ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) is intended to help provide an understanding of our business and results of operations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. This report, including the following MD&A, contains forward-looking statements regarding future events or trends that should be read in conjunction with the factors described under Forward-Looking Statements included in this report. In addition, our actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements as a result of the factors discussed under Forward-Looking Statements as well as the risk factors described in Item 1a, Risk Factors, of this report. Capitalized terms used without definitions have the meaning as provided elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Executive Overview Business Description We are primarily engaged in developing, acquiring, owning and operating apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets of the United States. We believe that apartment communities are an attractive long-term investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments, because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle. However, throughout the real estate cycle, apartment market fundamentals, and therefore operating cash flows, are affected by overall economic conditions. We seek to create long-term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms; deploying that capital to develop, redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets; operating apartment communities; and selling communities when pricing is attractive or when they no longer meet our long-term investment strategy. Barriers to entry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply. Our strategy is to be a leader in multifamily market research, consumer insight, and capital allocation, delivering a range of multifamily offerings tailored to serve the needs of the most attractive customer segments in the best-performing submarkets of the United States. Our communities are predominately upscale, which generally command among the highest rents in their markets. We also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points, consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services. We regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets, which are currently located in New England, the New York/New Jersey metro area, the Mid-Atlantic, the Midwest, the Pacific Northwest, and the Northern and Southern California regions of the United States. At the present time, we are no longer pursuing development or acquisition opportunities in the Midwest region, and we are currently marketing for sale, or have executed a sales contract, for two apartment communities, which includes one for Fund I, and a land parcel located in that region. Should these assets sell during 2012, we would no longer have an investment interest in the Midwest region. Financial Highlights and Outlook For the year ended December 31, 2011, net income attributable to common stockholders was $441,622,000 compared to $175,331,000 for 2010, an increase of 151.9%. The increase was due primarily to increased gains on sale of communities in 2011 as compared to 2010 as well as from an increase in net operating income ( NOI ) from both Established and newly stabilized communities. Apartment fundamentals improved throughout 2011 as compared to 2010, driven by a combination of a decline in the home ownership rate, modest employment growth and limited supply of new multifamily rental product. Full year 2011 Established Communities NOI increased 8.4% over the prior year across all of our markets as a result of an increase in rental revenue and a decrease in operating expenses. We expect that Earnings per share diluted ( EPS ) will increase to between $4.90 and $5.20 for 2012 from $4.87 in 2011, driven primarily by expected gains from the disposition of real estate and the continued improvement in revenue and NOI from our Established Communities in 2012. This positive outlook is as of the date that this Form 10-K is filed and reflects our expectations for (i) moderate, but accelerated job growth and population growth, particularly in the age groups that have historically demonstrated a higher propensity to rent, (ii) the expected weak 36 but moderating conditions in the for-sale housing market during 2012, and (iii) constrained levels of new supply. Our current financial outlook for 2012 provides for growth in rental revenue of between 5.0% and 6.5% in our Established Community portfolio resulting in a projected NOI growth for our Established Communities of 6.0% to 8.0%. Expense growth also impacts growth in NOI, and we continue to monitor and manage operating expenses to constrain expense growth. We expect operating expenses to increase between 2.5% and 3.5% in 2012 over 2011. These projections are based on our outlook for employment conditions and apartment market fundamentals in 2012, both nationally and in the markets where we operate, the individual demand/supply characteristics of each submarket in which we operate and assessment of each community potential performance for the upcoming year. We do not undertake a duty to update our outlook, and there can be no assurance that our outlook for economic conditions and/or their impact on our operating results will be accurate, and actual results could differ materially. Please see Risk Factors, Forward-Looking Statements and other discussions in this report on Form 10-K for a discussion of factors which could affect our results of operations. During 2011, we successfully raised approximately $1,265,000,000 of capital through sales of common equity in the public markets and asset sales. Proceeds were used to fund current investment activities, prefund planned investment activity, and combined with cash already on hand, to repay higher cost secured and unsecured debt, while retaining substantial cash balances for general corporate purposes. We believe that our current capital structure will provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms. The funds raised from dispositions consist of the proceeds from the sale of three communities and three land parcels for a gross sales price of $292,965,000. We expect to see continued strong investor demand for quality multifamily assets in 2012, due in part to the liquidity in the capital markets and constrained supply of quality multifamily assets resulting from the decline in development activity in 2008 and 2009 in all markets. We increased development activity during 2011 from the prior year in anticipation of the further improvement in the economy and apartment fundamentals, and believe that our development activity will continue to create long-term value. During 2011, we completed the development of six communities for an aggregate total capitalized cost of $297,100,000 which represents a savings from the original budgeted capitalized cost of $12,100,000. We started the development of 11 communities, which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of $892,500,000. In addition, during 2011 we completed the redevelopment of seven communities for a total investment of $67,500,000, excluding costs incurred prior to the redevelopment. During 2012, we expect to use our core competency in development to deliver new assets into the favorable market conditions expected in 2012 and 2013. We anticipate new development starts in 2012 with a total projected capitalized cost of $1,000,000,000 to $1,200,000,000. During 2012, we expect to invest between $750,000,000 and $850,000,000 related to the 19 communities under development at December 31, 2011, new development starts, and anticipated acquisitions of land for future development. Consistent with this view, we also expect to maintain our current level of redevelopment activity for our wholly-owned communities in 2012, during which we expect to start redevelopment of five wholly-owned communities, and invest between $100,000,000 and $150,000,000 in the redevelopment of communities. We believe that our current level of indebtedness, our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges and our current limited use of financial encumbrances (such as secured financing) provides us with flexibility in our capital raising activities. We expect to meet our liquidity needs from the issuance of unsecured debt and/or common and preferred equity and/or secured debt, as well as from disposition proceeds, joint venture investments or from retained cash and that these sources will provide adequate access to the capital necessary to fund our development and redevelopment activities during 2012. We also increase our direct and indirect interests in communities through acquisitions. In 2011, we completed an asset exchange with another apartment owner. Through this transaction, we exchanged three existing communities and a small land parcel for six operating communities and $26,000,000 in cash. The communities we provided to our exchange counterparty consisted of two properties and a small land parcel located in metropolitan Boston and one property located in San Francisco. In exchange we received six operating communities in Southern California (Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego). This transaction is consistent with our desire to increase our presence in Southern California, providing us with a larger portfolio of assets in the region at multiple price points that we believe will perform better than other US markets over the current operating cycle. Also in 2011, we acquired Fairfax Towers for our wholly-owned portfolio. Fairfax Towers is a high-rise community consisting of 415 apartment homes, located in Falls Church, VA, and was acquired for a purchase price of $89,200,000. 37 In February 2012, we acquired for our wholly-owned portfolio, The Mark Pasadena, located in Pasadena, CA. The Mark Pasadena contains 84 apartment homes and was acquired for $19,400,000. During 2012, we expect to be active in both acquisition and disposition activity for our wholly-owned portfolio. While this activity pertains primarily to portfolio shaping and repositioning, and is currently expected to have a nominal impact on our net capital position, we expect the dispositions to occur largely in the first half of the year and the acquisitions are expected to be weighted more towards the second half of the year. We established Fund I and Fund II to engage in acquisition programs through discretionary investment funds. We believe this investment format provides the following attributes: (i) third-party joint venture equity as an additional source of financing to expand and diversify our portfolio; (ii) additional sources of income in the form of property management and asset management fees and, potentially, incentive distributions if the performance of the Funds exceeds certain thresholds; and (iii) visibility into the transactions occurring in multifamily assets that helps us with other investment decisions related to our wholly-owned portfolio. Fund I has nine institutional investors, including us. One of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner of Fund I and we have made an equity investment of approximately $42,100,000 in Fund I (net of distributions and excluding the purchase by us of a mortgage note secured by a Fund I community), representing a 15.15% combined general partner and limited partner equity interest. Fund I was our principal vehicle for acquiring apartment communities through the close of its investment period in March 2008. Fund I has a term that expires in March 2015, plus two one-year extension options. During 2011, Fund I sold two communities: Avalon Columbia, located in Columbia, Maryland, for $34,650,000 and Avalon Redondo Beach, located in Redondo Beach, California, for $33,100,000. Fund I recognized an aggregate gain under GAAP of $22,246,000 from the sale of these communities, of which our share was $3,063,000. In addition, Fund I sold two communities in 2012. Avalon Lakeside, located in Chicago, Illinois, was sold for $20,500,000; and Avalon at Poplar Creek, also located in Chicago, Illinois, was sold for $27,200,000. Fund II has six institutional investors, including us. One of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner of Fund II and we have total equity commitments of $125,000,000, representing a 31.25% combined general partner and limited partner equity interest. Fund II has a term that expires in August 2018, plus two one-year extension options. Fund II served as the exclusive vehicle, with some exceptions, through which we acquired investment interests in apartment communities until August 2011. While the investment period for Fund II closed in August 2011, additional acquisitions may occur for active acquisition candidates identified prior to the end of the investment period. In 2012, we expect Fund II to acquire its final operating community, which was an active acquisition candidate at the end of the investment period for Fund II. We will receive, in addition to any returns on our invested equity, asset management fees, property management fees and redevelopment fees. We will also receive a promoted interest if certain return thresholds are met. During the year ended December 31, 2011, subsidiaries of Fund II acquired the following four operating communities: Waterstone Carlsbad, a garden-style community consisting of 448 apartment homes located in Carlsbad (San Diego County), CA was acquired for a purchase price of $78,100,000; Yale Village Townhomes, a garden-style community consisting of 210 townhomes located in Rockville, MD was acquired for a purchase price of $49,500,000; Captain Parker Arms, a garden-style community consisting of 94 apartment homes located in Lexington, MA was acquired for a purchase price of $20,850,000; and Highlands at Rancho San Diego, consisting of 676 apartment homes located in San Diego, CA was acquired for a purchase price of $124,000,000. In conjunction with the acquisition, Fund II extinguished an outstanding mortgage note secured by the community, incurring a prepayment penalty, of which the Company proportionate share was approximately $950,000. We are not presently pursuing the formation of a new, third fund, preferring at this time to maintain flexibility in shaping our portfolio of wholly-owned assets through acquisitions and dispositions. 38 Communities Overview As of December 31, 2011, we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 200 apartment communities containing 58,538 apartment homes in ten states and the District of Columbia, of which 19 communities were under construction and 13 communities were under reconstruction. Of these communities, 32 were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes, including 16 owned by subsidiaries of Fund I and 12 owned by subsidiaries of Fund II. In addition, we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in Development Rights to develop an additional 32 wholly-owned communities that, if developed in the manner expected, will contain an estimated 9,012 apartment homes. Our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities, Development Communities, and Development Rights. Our current operating communities are further distinguished as Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities, Lease-Up Communities and Redevelopment Communities. Established Communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, which allows the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared and monitored between years. Other Stabilized Communities are generally all other consolidated operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year, but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year. Lease-Up Communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved. Redevelopment Communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year. A more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in Note 9, Segment Reporting, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Although each of these categories is important to our business, we generally evaluate overall operating, industry and market trends based on the operating results of Established Communities, for which a detailed discussion can be found in Results of Operations as part of our discussion of overall operating results. We evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition, disposition, development, redevelopment and financing activities within Other Stabilized, Redevelopment and Development Communities. Discussions related to these segments of our business can be found in Liquidity and Capital Resources. NOI of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance. NOI is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets, our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs. Our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed and acquired apartment communities. Results of Operations Our year-over-year operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and reflected in changes in NOI of our Established Communities; NOI derived from acquisitions and development completions; the loss of NOI related to disposed communities; and capital market and financing activity.

Net income attributable to common stockholders increased $19,684,000, or 12.6% in 2010 over 2009 due primarily to an increase in gains on sale of real estate in 2010 and impairment losses recognized in 2009, with no comparable activity in 2010, as well as an increase in NOI in 2010 over 2009. NOI is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate-level or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. We define NOI as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses, including property taxes. 40 NOI does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance. NOI should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity, nor is NOI necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. Reconciliations of NOI for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 to net income for each year, are as follows (dollars in thousands): For the year ended 12-31-11 12-31-10 12-31-09 Net income $ 441,370 $ 174,079 $ 154,274 Indirect operating expenses, net of corporate income 30,550 30,246 30,315 Investments and investment management expense 5,126 3,824 3,844 Expensed development and other pursuit costs 2,967 2,741 5,842 Interest expense, net 168,179 170,349 145,462 Loss on extinguishment of debt, net 1,940 25,910 General and administrative expense 29,371 26,846 28,748 Equity in income of unconsolidated entities (5,120 ) (762 ) (1,441 ) Depreciation expense 246,666 227,878 204,481 Impairment loss - land holdings 14,052 21,152 Gain on sale of real estate assets (294,806 ) (74,074 ) (68,717 ) (Income) loss from discontinued operations 5,658 3,768 (7,689 ) Net operating income $ 645,953 $ 564,895 $ 542,181 The NOI increases for both 2011 and 2010, as compared to the prior year period, consist of changes in the following categories (dollars in thousands): Full Year 2011 Full Year 2010 Established Communities $ 36,187 $ (11,896 ) Other Stabilized Communities 21,580 24,154 Development and Redevelopment Communities 23,291 10,412 Total $ 81,058 $ 22,670 The NOI increase for Established Communities in 2011 is due to a combination of increased rental revenues and decreased operating expenses. During 2011, we experienced sequential quarterly increases in rental rates, while maintaining occupancy of at least 95% in all regions. In addition, we experienced favorable trends in operating expenses, primarily property taxes and utilities. Rental and other income increased in both 2011 and 2010 as compared to the prior years due to additional rental income generated from newly developed and acquired communities and increases in rental rates at our Established Communities. Overall Portfolio The weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased to 42,613 apartment homes for 2011 as compared to 40,489 homes for 2010 and 38,233 homes for 2009. The increase in 2011 over 2010 is due to homes available from newly developed and acquired communities, offset partially by communities sold during 2011. The weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to $1,911 for 2011 as compared to $1,823 in 2010 and $1,910 in 2009. Established Communities Rental revenue increased $33,335,000, or 5.1%, for 2011 and decreased $6,137,000 or 0.9%, for 2010 as compared to the prior year. For 2011, the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased 5.1% to $1,939 compared to $1,845 in 2010 driven by an increase in rental rates. Average economic occupancy for 2011 remained at 96.0% consistent with 2010. Economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community gross revenue. Economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss, as a percentage of gross potential revenue. Gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents. We experienced increases in rental revenue for all of our Established Communities regions in 2011 as compared to the prior year as discussed in more detail below. 41 The Metro New York/New Jersey region, which accounted for approximately 28.3% of Established Community rental revenue for 2011, experienced an increase in rental revenue of 4.3% for 2011 as compared to 2010. Average rental rates increased 4.3% to $2,427 over 2010 and economic occupancy was unchanged at 96.1% during 2011. An improving economy, favorable demographic trends and a minimal amount of competitive new supply supported positive results in 2011 over the prior year. Despite concerns about the near-term recovery in the region large financial services industry, the Metro New York/New Jersey region has experienced growth in other sectors (including technology) which has supported demand for rental housing. We anticipate the New York City market will continue to outperform suburban submarkets in 2012. New rental deliveries are expected to remain minimal in 2012 but we are anticipating completion and delivery of competitive new supply in certain New York City markets in 2013. The New England region accounted for approximately 24.6% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2011 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 5.5% over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 5.6% to $2,014, offset partially by a decrease in economic occupancy of 0.1% to 96.1% for 2011, as compared to 2010. Job growth from the region large technology sector and a low volume of new multifamily supply contributed to the improvement in apartment market conditions. Job growth in the Boston area was broad-based, but southwest Connecticut lagged given greater dependence on the financial services and manufacturing sectors. Similar conditions are expected in 2012. With large defense contractors headquartered in the region, the potential for job cutbacks in the defense sector may negatively impact market fundamentals in 2012. The Mid-Atlantic/Midwest region, which represented approximately 15.9% of Established Community rental revenue during 2011, experienced an increase in rental revenue of 4.7% as compared to 2010. Average rental rates increased by 5.3% to $1,814, while economic occupancy decreased 0.6% to 95.5% for 2011 as compared to 2010. The Mid-Atlantic region economy, which is highly dependent on government and government-contractors, is expected to underperform other regions as impacts from the current focus on controlling government spending take effect. At the same time, a significant amount of new rental supply is expected to be delivered in 2012 and 2013 in certain submarkets which will compete with existing product. Northern California accounted for approximately 14.9% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2011 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 7.2% from the prior year. Average rental rates increased 7.0% to $1,849, and economic occupancy increased 0.2% to 96.1% for 2011 as compared to 2010. Strong renter demand is being fueled by job growth in the region large high-tech sector, unaffordable home prices and a lack of competitive new rental supply. We expect the region solid apartment market fundamentals will continue during 2012. We anticipate competitive new supply will be delivered in 2013 but will be limited to certain submarkets. Southern California accounted for approximately 10.9% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2011 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 3.9% from the prior year. Average rental rates increased 3.1% to $1,626, and economic occupancy increased 0.8% to 96.1% for 2011 as compared to 2010. Apartment market conditions are improving in the region as job growth resumes in line with a strengthening U.S. economy. We anticipate that stronger job growth in the region during 2012, combined with minimal new supply, favorable demographics and a continued weak housing market will support stronger rental revenue growth. The Pacific Northwest region accounted for approximately 5.4% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2011 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 5.1% from the prior year. Average rental rates increased 5.4% to $1,304, offset partially by a decrease in economic occupancy of 0.3% to 94.9% for 2011 as compared to 2010. Job growth in the region is broad-based, driven by improvement in both aerospace and technology. Population growth and limited competition from both new rental supply and home purchases are expected to support continued strong rental revenue growth. New rental deliveries will be modest in 2012 but we expect an increase in 2013 in certain submarkets. Management, development and other fees increased $2,302,000, or 31.3%, in 2011 over 2010. The increase in 2011 was due primarily to increased asset management fees and property management fees from Fund II. Direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes increased $6,656,000, or 3.2% in 2011 and increased $11,918,000, or 6.0% for 2010 as compared to the prior years, primarily due to the addition of recently developed apartment homes. 42 For Established Communities, direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes, decreased $2,514,000, or 1.6% to $154,237,000 for 2011 and increased $2,282,000 or 1.4% for 2010 as compared to the prior year periods. The decrease in 2011 from 2010 is due primarily to decreased administrative expenses from a decrease in bad debt expense. Savings in utilities driven by milder temperatures and more favorable negotiated rates also contributed to the decrease. The decrease in 2010 from 2009 was due primarily to decreased administrative and marketing costs, offset partially by higher community maintenance expenses, including costs for repairs from storm damage. The decreases in administrative expenses were primarily due to decreased bad debt. Property taxes increased $4,370,000, or 4.8% and $9,652,000, or 11.8% in 2011 and 2010, respectively, due to the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes and overall higher assessments. Property tax increases are also impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals. For Established Communities, property taxes decreased by $631,000, or 0.9% and increased $3,455,000 or 5.2% for 2011 and 2010, respectively as compared to the prior year. The decrease in 2011 from 2010 is due to successful appeals and settlements offset partially by a combination of rate increases and higher assessments throughout all regions. The increase in 2010 over 2009 is due to higher assessments as well as the size and timing of successful appeals. We expect property taxes in 2012 to increase over 2011 due primarily to higher tax rates and higher assessments. For communities in California, property tax changes are determined by the change in the California Consumer Price Index, with increases limited by law (Proposition 13). We evaluate property tax increases internally, and also engage third-party consultants to assist in our evaluations. We appeal property tax increases when appropriate. Corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses increased by $2,926,000, or 7.8% in 2011 over the prior year. The increase in 2011 from 2010 is due primarily to increases in compensation costs, coupled with costs associated with the Company development and introduction of the AVA and Eaves by Avalon brands. Investments and investment management costs increased in 2011 by $1,302,000, or 34.0% from the prior year due primarily to increases in compensation costs. Expensed development and other pursuit costs primarily reflect the costs incurred for abandoned pursuit costs, which include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development, as well as the abandonment of Development Rights and disposition pursuits. Expensed development and other pursuit costs decreased in 2011 and 2010 from the prior years due to decreases in abandoned development pursuits attributable to continued economic improvement. These costs can be volatile, particularly in periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital, and the costs may vary significantly from period to period. Interest expense, net decreased $2,170,000, or 1.3% and increased $24,887,000, or 17.1% in 2011 and 2010, respectively as compared to the prior years. This category includes interest expense offset by interest capitalized and interest income. The decrease in 2011 from 2010 is due to a decrease in outstanding debt coupled with lower interest rates and an increase in interest costs capitalized over 2010. The increase in 2010 is due primarily to a decrease in the amount of interest capitalized as compared to the prior year, coupled with increased interest expense in 2010 compared to the prior year from additional secured and unsecured debt issued. The decrease in interest capitalized in 2010 as compared to 2009 was due to the reduction in development activity in 2010 as compared to the prior year. Loss on the extinguishment of debt, net reflects the impact from prepayment penalties and expensing of deferred financing costs from our debt repurchase and retirement activity, or payments above or below the carrying basis. In 2011 we recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $1,940,000 due to early retirement of a secured note. The net loss in 2009 is due to the $310,100,000 in unsecured notes that we purchased prior to their scheduled maturity at a premium, offset by the gain recognized from our January 2009 tender offer. Depreciation expense increased in 2011 and 2010 primarily due to the net increase in assets from the completion of development and redevelopment activities and acquisition activity, offset by a reduction in depreciation expense from assets sold during 2011 and 2010. General and administrative expense ( G&A ) increased $2,525,000, or 9.4% in 2011 and decreased $1,902,000, or 6.6% in 2010 as compared to the prior years. The changes in both periods are attributable to changes in compensation expense. 43 Impairment loss for 2011 was due to an additional write down of two land parcels for which we changed our intent and determined we now intend to pursue the disposal of these assets. In addition, the impairment charge in 2011 includes the impairment of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture. Impairment loss for 2009 was due to the write down of land parcels which we concluded that we did not plan to develop at the time of impairment. We did not recognize an impairment loss in 2010. Gain on sale of land increased in 2011 and decreased in 2010 as compared to the prior years due to the sale of land parcels in 2011 and 2009, without comparable activity in 2010. Equity in income of unconsolidated entities increased $4,358,000, or 571.9% in 2011 and decreased $679,000, or 47.1% in 2010 as compared to prior years. The increase in 2011 is due to the recognition of our proportionate share of the gain on sale of two communities by Fund I, offset partially by increased acquisition costs from Fund II over 2010. The decrease in 2010 is due to acquisition costs from Fund II which were not significant in 2009. Income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by communities sold or qualifying as discontinued operations during the period from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2011. This income increased for 2011 and decreased for 2010 due to changes in the number of communities sold in each year as compared to the prior year period. See Note 7, Real Estate Disposition Activities, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Gain on sale of communities increased in 2011 and 2010 as compared to the prior years as a result of changes in the sales volume and associated gains in each respective year. The amount of gain realized upon disposition of a community depends on many factors, including the number of communities sold, the size and carrying value of those communities and the market conditions in the local area. The gain on sale of communities in 2011 includes $122,416,000 for the recapture of cumulative straight line rent expense charged in excess of cash payments for a community subject to a long-term ground lease. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests resulted in income to us for the allocation of losses to the noncontrolling interests of $252,000 in 2011 and $1,252,000 in 2010. The decrease in income in 2011 relative to 2010 is due primarily to improved operating results of the Fund I community we consolidate. The conversion and redemption of limited partnership units in 2011 and 2010 also contributed to the decrease in 2011 from 2010, thereby reducing outside ownership interest and the allocation of net income to outside ownership interests. Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe our principal short-term liquidity needs are to fund: development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged; the minimum dividend payments on our common stock required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Code; debt service and principal payments either at maturity or opportunistically prior to maturity; and normal recurring operating expenses. Factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations, financing activities and investing activities (including dispositions) as well as general economic and market conditions. Operating cash flow has historically been determined by: (i) the number of apartment homes currently owned, (ii) rental rates, (iii) occupancy levels and (iv) operating expenses with respect to apartment homes. The timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage, as well as our plans for development, redevelopment, acquisition and disposition activity, are affected by changes in the capital markets environment, such as changes in interest rates or the availability of cost-effective capital. We regularly review our liquidity needs, the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs. We continued to have cost effective access to the capital markets during the year ended December 31, 2011, raising net proceeds of approximately $971,925,000 in the form of public equity including amounts issued in an underwritten public offering of common stock in August 2011 and amounts issued under the CEP II discussed below. In 2012, we expect to meet all of our liquidity needs from a variety of internal and external sources, including cash balances on hand, asset sales and other public or private sources of liquidity as discussed below, as well as our operating activities. Our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or short-term financial prospects. At December 31, 2011, we have unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $616,890,000 available for both current liquidity needs as well as development activities. 44 Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled $616,890,000 at December 31, 2011, an increase of $312,483,000 from $304,407,000 at December 31, 2010. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included elsewhere in this report. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $429,391,000 in 2011 from $332,106,000 in 2010. The increase was driven primarily by the timing of general corporate expenditures and increased cash flows from community operations in 2011 as compared to 2010. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of $443,141,000 in 2011 related to investments in assets through development, redevelopment, and acquisitions. In total, we invested $737,185,000 during 2011 in the following areas: We invested approximately $640,778,000 in the development and redevelopment of communities; We invested $46,275,000 in the acquisition of an apartment community; We had capital expenditures of $50,132,000 for real estate and non-real estate assets; and We made capital contributions to Fund II of $15,656,000. These expenditures were offset by net proceeds of $310,228,000 from an asset exchange and the disposition of three operating communities and three unimproved land parcels. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $326,233,000 in 2011. The net cash provided is due primarily to the issuance of common stock, primarily through the underwritten common equity offering we executed in August 2011 and under CEP II, for aggregate net proceeds of $1,049,835,000 partially offset by the payment of cash dividends in the amount of $318,231,000, repayment of $189,900,000 principal amount of unsecured notes, and repayment of $200,166,000 of secured notes including prepayment penalties. Variable Rate Unsecured Credit Facility In September 2011, we entered into the Credit Facility which has an available borrowing capacity of $750,000,000 and a four-year term, plus a one year extension option. We may elect to expand the facility to $1,300,000,000, provided that one or more banks (whether or not part of the current syndicate of banks) voluntarily agree to provide the additional commitment. No member of the syndicate of banks can prohibit the increase, which will only be effective to the extent banks from the syndicate or otherwise choose to commit to lend additional funds. The Credit Facility was entered into with a syndicate of commercial banks to whom we pay an annual facility fee of approximately $1,313,000 and bears interest at varying levels based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ), rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us. The current stated pricing is LIBOR plus 1.075% per annum (1.34% on January 31, 2012). The stated spread over LIBOR can vary from LIBOR plus 1.00% to LIBOR plus 1.85% based on our credit ratings. In addition, the Credit Facility includes a competitive bid option, which allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to make loans to us at a rate that is lower than the stated rate provided by the Credit Facility for up to $487,500,000. The competitive bid option may result in lower pricing than the stated rate if market conditions allow. We did not have any borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and had $49,883,000 outstanding in letters of credit that reduced our borrowing capacity as of January 31, 2012. The Credit Facility replaced our previous variable rate unsecured credit facility which had a borrowing capacity of $1,000,000,000 (the Cancelled Credit Facility ), which was scheduled to expire in November 2011. Financial Covenants We are subject to financial and other covenants contained in the Credit Facility and the indenture under which our unsecured notes were issued. The financial covenants include the following: limitations on the amount of total and secured debt in relation to our overall capital structure; limitations on the amount of our unsecured debt relative to the undepreciated basis of real estate assets that are not encumbered by property-specific financing; and minimum levels of debt service coverage. 45 We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2011. In addition, our secured borrowings may include yield maintenance, defeasance, or prepayment penalty provisions, which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity. These provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured. Continuous Equity Offering Program (CEP II) In November 2010, we commenced CEP II, under which we may sell up to $500,000,000 of our common stock from time to time during a 36-month period. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us, including market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding. In conjunction with CEP II, we engaged sales agents who receive compensation of approximately 1.5% of the gross sales price for shares sold. For the year ended December 31, 2011 we sold 2,057,933 shares under CEP II at an average sales price of $121.39 per share, for aggregate net proceeds of $246,065,000. From program inception in November 2010 through December 31, 2011, we sold 2,490,765 shares at an average price of $119.84 per share, for aggregate net proceeds of $294,000,000. Underwritten Public Offering of Common Stock In August 2011, we issued 5,865,000 shares of our common stock for a net price of $128.25 per share before offering costs. Net proceeds of approximately $725,860,000 are being used for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, which may include development, redevelopment and acquisitions of apartment communities and repayment and refinancing of debt. Future Financing and Capital Needs Debt and Derivative Maturities One of our principal long-term liquidity needs is the repayment of long-term debt at the time that such debt matures. For unsecured notes, a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity. Early retirement of our unsecured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment similar to those recognized in 2009. If we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due, it will be necessary for us to refinance the debt. This refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings, additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities, draws on our Credit Facility or by equity offerings. Although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or, if available, that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory. We are also party to $430,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements, which were executed to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of our expected debt issuance activity in 2012 and 2013. At maturity of the agreements, we will cash settle the contracts and either pay or receive cash for the then current fair value. Assuming that we issue the debt as expected, we will recognize in earnings the impact from settling these positions over the life of the issued debt as a yield adjustment. Our outlook for 2012 considered the expected impact for the settlement of the forward interest rate swap agreement that matures in 2012. At December 31, 2011 we had recorded a liability related to the value of these contracts of $85,467,000, approximately half of which relates to the contract expiring in 2012. The value of the contracts is subject to increase or decrease prior to their respective maturities, and the amount which we will pay or receive upon maturity will depend on market conditions at that time. In addition to the proceeds received from the common equity offering we executed in August 2011 and under CEP II and the forward interest rate swap agreements discussed above, the following financing activity occurred during 2011: In March 2011, we repaid a variable rate secured mortgage note in the amount of $28,785,000 in accordance with its scheduled maturity date. As part of an asset exchange in April 2011, we assumed a $55,400,000 fixed-rate mortgage loan with a 5.24% interest rate, and relinquished a $55,800,000 mortgage loan with a 5.86% fixed-rate. In conjunction with the acquisition of Fairfax Towers in April 2011, we assumed a 4.75% fixed-rate mortgage loan with an outstanding principal balance of $44,044,000 that matures in August 2015. 46 In April 2011, we repaid all amounts due under a $93,440,000 variable-rate, tax-exempt bond financing using the original issue proceeds which were held in escrow. In August 2011, we repaid a 7.25% fixed rate secured mortgage note in the amount of $7,191,000 at par in advance of its October 2011 scheduled maturity date. In September 2011, we repaid $189,900,000 principal amount of our unsecured notes in accordance with their scheduled maturity. The notes had an all-in interest rate of 6.67%. In October 2011, we repaid a 5.88% fixed rate secured mortgage note in the amount of $54,584,000 in advance of its January 2019 scheduled maturity. As part of this transaction, we incurred charges of $1,940,000 for a prepayment penalty and the write off of deferred financing fees which was recognized as loss on early retirement of debt. In November 2011, we repaid a 4.95% fixed rate secured mortgage note in the amount of $94,572,000 in advance of its April 2013 scheduled maturity date. As part of this transaction, we incurred a charge of $3,880,000 for a prepayment penalty and the write off of deferred financing fees which was recognized as loss on early retirement of debt. The following debt activity occurred subsequent to December 31, 2011 through the date this Form 10-K was filed: In January 2012, we repaid $179,400,000 principal amount of 5.5% coupon unsecured notes pursuant to their scheduled maturity. In February 2012, we repaid a variable rate secured mortgage note in the amount of $48,500,000 in advance of its November 2039 scheduled maturity date. Also in February 2012, in conjunction with the acquisition of a wholly-owned operating community, we assumed a 4.61% $11,958,000 note maturing in June 2018.

(2) Variable rates are given as of December 31, 2011. (3) Financed by variable rate debt, but interest rate is capped through an interest rate protection agreement. (4) Represents full amount of the debt as of December 31, 2011. Actual amounts drawn on the debt as of December 31, 2011 are $117,939 for Walnut Creek. (5) Balances outstanding represent total amounts due at maturity, and are net of $1,791 and $760 of debt discount and basis adjustments associated with the hedged unsecured notes as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, and $962 premium associated with secured notes as of December 31, 2011, as reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets included elsewhere in this report. 48 (6) In February 2012, we repaid a 4.20% variable rate secured mortgage note in the amount of $48,500,000 in advance of its November 2039 scheduled maturity date. (7) In October 2010, we elected to fix the borrowing rate until June 2012, at which point we will select the updated term and mode for the bonds. (8) In 2011, we elected to repay all amounts outstanding under this borrowing without penalty using the proceeds held in escrow. (9) Borrowing was repaid in advance of its scheduled maturity. (10) Borrowings were repaid in accordance with their scheduled maturity. (11) Borrowing was repaid at par in advance of its scheduled maturity. (12) Borrowings were repaid in January 2012, in accordance with their scheduled maturity. Future Financing and Capital Needs Portfolio and Other Activity As of December 31, 2011, we had 19 wholly-owned communities under construction, for which a total estimated cost of $804,231,000 remained to be invested. We also had 13 wholly-owned communities under reconstruction, for which a total estimated cost of $87,646,000 remained to be invested. Substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction and fund development costs related to pursuing Development Rights will be funded from: our $750,000,000 Credit Facility until it expires in 2016, assuming execution of a one-year extension option; cash currently on hand, including cash in construction escrows, invested in highly liquid overnight money market funds and repurchase agreements, and short-term investment vehicles; retained operating cash; the net proceeds from sales of existing communities; the issuance of debt or equity securities; and/or private equity funding, including joint venture activity. Before planned reconstruction activity, including reconstruction activity related to communities acquired by the Funds, or the construction of a Development Right begins, we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing. In the event that financing cannot be obtained, we may have to abandon Development Rights, write off associated pre-development costs that were capitalized and/or forego reconstruction activity. In such instances, we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such Development Rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred. From time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets. We generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity. We may also use joint ventures related to mixed-use land development opportunities where our partners bring specific development and operational expertise to the venture. Each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement. We cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures. In evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets, we sell assets that do not meet our long-term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities. Because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets, the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income, but reduce future total revenues, total expenses and NOI. However, we believe that the absence of future cash flows from communities sold will have a minimal impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs. Unconsolidated Real Estate Investments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Unconsolidated Investments As of December 31, 2011, we had investments in the following unconsolidated real estate entities with ownership interest percentages ranging from 15.2% to 31.3%. We account for these investments in unconsolidated real estate entities under the equity method of accounting. Refer to Note 6 Investments in Real Estate Entities , of the Consolidated Financial Statements located elsewhere in this report, which includes information on the aggregate assets, liabilities and equity, as well as operating results, and our proportionate share of their operating results. 49 Detail of the real estate and associated funding underlying our unconsolidated investments is presented in the following table: Company # of Total Debt Unconsolidated Real Estate Investments Ownership Percentage Apartment Homes Capitalized Cost (1) Amount (2) Type Interest Rate (3) Maturity Date Fund I 1.

(4) Beginning in the third quarter of 2010, the Company consolidated the net assets and results of operations of The Springs. (5) Borrowing on this community is comprised of three mortgage loans.

(9) The mortgage note secured by this community was repaid prior to its disposition in advance of its scheduled maturity. 50 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In addition to our investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities, we have certain off-balance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest. Additional discussion of these entities can be found in Note 6, Investments in Real Estate Entities, of our Consolidated Financial Statements located elsewhere in this report. CVP I, LLC has outstanding tax-exempt, variable rate bonds maturing in November 2036 in the amount of $117,000,000, which have permanent credit enhancement. We have agreed to guarantee, under limited circumstances, the repayment to the credit enhancer of any advances it may make in fulfillment of CVP I, LLC repayment obligations under the bonds . We have also guaranteed to the credit enhancer that CVP I, LLC will obtain a final certificate of occupancy for the project (Chrystie Place in New York City), which is expected in 2012. Our 80% partner in this venture has agreed that it will reimburse us its pro rata share of any amounts paid relative to these guaranteed obligations. The estimated fair value of, and our obligation under these guarantees, both at inception and as of December 31, 2011, were not significant. As a result we have not recorded any obligation associated with these guarantees at December 31, 2011. Subsidiaries of Fund I have 18 loans, including one owned by us, secured by individual assets with amounts outstanding in the aggregate of $378,177,000. Fund I subsidiary loans have varying maturity dates (or dates after which the loans can be prepaid), ranging from August 2013 to September 2016. These mortgage loans are secured by the underlying real estate. The mortgage loans are payable by the subsidiaries of Fund I with operating cash flow or disposition proceeds from the underlying real estate. We have not guaranteed the debt of Fund I, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should Fund I be unable to do so. In addition, as part of the formation of Fund I, we have provided to one of the limited partners a guarantee. The guarantee provides that if, upon final liquidation of Fund I, the total amount of all distributions to that partner during the life of Fund I (whether from operating cash flow or property sales) does not equal a minimum of the total capital contributions made by that partner, then we will pay the partner an amount equal to the shortfall, but in no event more than 10% of the total capital contributions made by the partner (maximum of approximately $7,500,000 as of December 31, 2011). As of December 31, 2011, the expected realizable value of the real estate assets owned by Fund I is considered adequate to cover such potential payment to that partner under the expected Fund I liquidation scenario. The estimated fair value of, and our obligation under this guarantee, both at inception and as of December 31, 2011was not significant and therefore we have not recorded any obligation for this guarantee as of December 31, 2011. Subsidiaries of Fund II have 12 loans secured by individual assets with amounts outstanding in the aggregate of $452,003,000 with maturity dates that vary from November 2014 to September 2019. The mortgage loans are payable by the subsidiaries of Fund II with operating cash flow or disposition proceeds from the underlying real estate. We have not guaranteed, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should Fund II be unable to do so. In addition, as part of the formation of Fund II, we have provided to one of the limited partners a guarantee. The guarantee provides that if, upon final liquidation of Fund II, the total amount of all distributions to that partner during the life of Fund II (whether from operating cash flow or property sales) does not equal a minimum of the total capital contributions made by that partner, then we will pay the partner an amount equal to the shortfall, but in no event more than 10% of the total capital contributions made by the partner (maximum of approximately $8,348,000 as of December 31, 2011). As of December 31, 2011, the expected realizable value of the real estate assets owned by Fund II is considered adequate to cover such potential payment to that partner under the expected Fund II liquidation scenario. The estimated fair value of, and our obligation under this guarantee, both at inception and as of December 31, 2011 was not significant and therefore we have not recorded any obligation for this guarantee as of December 31, 2011. Each individual mortgage loan of Fund I or Fund II was made to a special purpose, single asset subsidiary of the Funds. Each mortgage loan provides that it is the obligation of the respective subsidiary only, except under exceptional circumstances (such as fraud or misapplication of funds) in which case the respective Fund could also have obligations with respect to the mortgage loan. In no event do the mortgage loans provide for recourse against investors in the Funds, including against us or our wholly-owned subsidiaries that invest in the Funds. A default by a Fund or a Fund subsidiary on any loan to it would not constitute a default under any of our loans or any loans of our other non-Fund subsidiaries or affiliates. If a Fund subsidiary or a Fund were unable to meet its obligations under a loan, the value of our investment in that 51 Fund would likely decline and we might also be more likely to be obligated under the guarantee we provided to one of the Fund partners in each Fund as described above. If a Fund subsidiary or a Fund were unable to meet its obligations under a loan, we and/or the other investors might evaluate whether it was in our respective interests to voluntarily support the Fund through additional equity contributions and/or take other actions to avoid a default under a loan or the consequences of a default (such as foreclosure of a Fund asset). However, we cannot predict at this time whether we would provide such voluntary support, or take such other action, as any such action would depend on a variety of factors, including the amount of support required and the possibility that such support could enhance the Fund and/or our returns by providing time for performance to improve. MVP I, LLC, the entity that owns Avalon at Mission Bay North II, has a loan secured by the underlying real estate assets of the community for $105,000,000. The loan is a fixed rate, interest-only note bearing interest at 6.02%, maturing in December 2015. We have not guaranteed the debt of MVP I, LLC, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should MVP I, LLC be unable to do so. Avalon Del Rey Apartments, LLC has a variable rate loan secured by the underlying real estate assets of the community for $44,153,000 maturing in April 2016. We have not guaranteed the debt of Avalon Del Rey Apartments, LLC, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should Avalon Del Rey Apartments, LLC be unable to do so. Aria at Hathorne Hill, LLC is a joint venture in which we have a non-managing member interest. The LLC was formed to develop for-sale town homes in Danvers, Massachusetts on an out parcel adjacent to a current community. Through a taxable REIT subsidiary, we purchased the LLC outstanding $1,860,000 variable rate note for $1,700,000 in 2011. We acquired the note with a view of eventually controlling the site and thereafter holding, developing, or selling the site, as market conditions allow. In 2007 we entered into a non-cancelable commitment (the Commitment ) to acquire parcels of land in Brooklyn, New York for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $111,000,000 subject to escalations through April 2011 based on the timing of the acquisitions. Under the terms of the Commitment, we are closing on the various parcels over a period determined by the seller ability to execute unrelated purchase transactions and achieve deferral of gains for the land sold under this Commitment. Under the terms of the Commitment, we anticipate that we will purchase all parcels of land by December 2012. At December 31, 2011, we have an outstanding commitment to purchase the remaining land for approximately $27,707,000. There are no other lines of credit, side agreements, financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate entities and us. In evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage, management takes into consideration our proportionate share of this unconsolidated debt. Contractual Obligations There have not been any material changes outside of the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations during 2011. Scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of December 31, 2011 (dollars in thousands): Payments due by period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Debt Obligations $ 3,633,125 $ 409,482 $ 533,958 $ 680,599 $ 2,009,086 Interest on Debt Obligations 1,437,872 181,370 360,374 324,612 571,516 Capital Lease Obligations (1) 72,066 2,425 5,094 21,108 43,439 Operating Lease Obligations (1) 1,271,870 17,691 35,712 35,454 1,183,013 Land Purchase Commitments 27,707 27,707 Total $ 6,442,640 $ 638,675 $ 935,138 $ 1,061,773 $ 3,807,054 (1) Includes land leases expiring between October 2026 and March 2142. Amounts do not include any adjustment for purchase options available under the land leases. 52 Inflation and Deflation Substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less. In an inflationary environment, this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Similarly, in a deflationary rent environment, we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter-term leases. Forward-Looking Statements This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify forward-looking statements by our use of the words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, assume, project, plan, may, shall, will and other similar expressions in this Form 10-K, that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters. These statements include, among other things, statements regarding our intent, belief or expectations with respect to: our potential development, redevelopment, acquisition or disposition of communities; the timing and cost of completion of apartment communities under construction, reconstruction, development or redevelopment; the timing of lease-up, occupancy and stabilization of apartment communities; the pursuit of land on which we are considering future development; the anticipated operating performance of our communities; cost, yield, revenue, NOI and earnings estimates; our declaration or payment of distributions; our joint venture and discretionary fund activities; our policies regarding investments, indebtedness, acquisitions, dispositions, financings and other matters; our qualification as a REIT under the Code; the real estate markets in Northern and Southern California and markets in selected states in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New England, Metro New York/New Jersey and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States and in general; the availability of debt and equity financing; interest rates; general economic conditions including potential impacts from the current economic conditions; and trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations. We cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements; rather, these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed. In addition, these forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake a duty to update these forward-looking statements, and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report. You should not rely on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. These risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. In addition to the factors referred to below, you should carefully review the discussion under Item 1a., Risk Factors, in this document for a discussion of additional risks associated with our business and these forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: we may fail to secure development opportunities due to an inability to reach agreements with third parties to obtain land at attractive prices or to obtain desired zoning and other local approvals; we may abandon or defer development opportunities for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions which make development less desirable, increases in costs of development, increases in the cost of capital or lack of capital availability, resulting in losses; construction costs of a community may exceed our original estimates; we may not complete construction and lease-up of communities under development or redevelopment on schedule, resulting in increased interest costs and construction costs and a decrease in our expected rental revenues; occupancy rates and market rents may be adversely affected by competition and local economic and market conditions which are beyond our control; 53 financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all, and our cash flows from operations and access to cost effective capital may be insufficient for the development of our pipeline which could limit our pursuit of opportunities; our cash flows may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, and we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness; we may be unsuccessful in our management of Fund I, Fund II or the REIT vehicles that are used with each respective Fund; and we may be unsuccessful in managing changes in our portfolio composition. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 1, Organization and Basis of Presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Principles of Consolidation We may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets. We must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting. We determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements, applying the applicable accounting guidance. For investment interests that we do not consolidate, we evaluate the guidance to determine the accounting framework to apply. The application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment. Therefore, we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate. If we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method at December 31, 2011, our assets would have increased by $1,509,069,000 and our liabilities would have increased by $1,101,765,000. We would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed, including but not limited to the following reasons, none of which are currently expected to occur: For entities not considered to be variable interest entities, the nature of the entity changed such that it would be considered a variable interest entity and if we were considered the primary beneficiary. For entities in which we do not hold a controlling voting and/or variable interest, the contractual arrangement changed resulting in our investment interest being either a controlling voting and/or variable interest. We evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs. Cost Capitalization We capitalize costs during the development of assets beginning when we determine that development of a future asset is probable until the asset, or a portion of the asset, is delivered and is ready for its intended use. For redevelopment efforts, we capitalize costs either (i) in advance of taking homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun until the redevelopment is completed, or (ii) when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident. Rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial lease-up or post-redevelopment lease-up period are fully recognized as they accrue. During the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities. These costs include interest and related loan 54 fees, property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs. Interest is capitalized for any project specific financing, as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects. Indirect project costs, which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts, are also capitalized. Capitalized indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities total $23,984,000, $21,475,000 and $24,932,000 for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and, as such, we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate. There may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity. If changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, there may be an increase in our operating expenses. For example, if in 2011 our development activities decreased by 10%, and there were no corresponding decrease in our indirect project costs, our operating expenses would have increased by $2,398,000. We capitalize pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of Development Rights. These costs include legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs. Future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors, including zoning and regulatory approval, rental market conditions, construction costs and availability of capital. Pre-development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are written off with a charge to expense. Due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community, and therefore should be capitalized, the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate. If we had determined that 10% of our capitalized pursuit costs were associated with Development Rights that were no longer probable of occurring, net income for the year ended December 31, 2011 would have decreased by $2,477,000. Abandoned Pursuit Costs & Asset Impairment We evaluate our real estate and other long-lived assets for impairment when potential indicators of impairment exist. Such assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the property to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. Based on periodic tests of recoverability of long-lived assets, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we did not record any impairment losses for wholly-owned operating real estate assets. We expensed costs related to abandoned pursuits, which includes the abandonment of Development Rights and disposition pursuits, in the amounts of $1,957,000 in 2011, $2,741,000 in 2010 and $5,842,000 in 2009. These costs are included in operating expenses, excluding property taxes on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Income. Abandoned pursuit costs can vary greatly, and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years. We also assess land held for development for impairment if our intent changes with respect to the development of the land. During 2011, we concluded that we would pursue the sale of two land parcels and, as a result, that the carrying bases of the two land parcels were not fully recoverable. As a result, we recognized an aggregate charge of $12,097,000 for the impairment of these land parcels. We had previously recognized an impairment loss of $9,952,000 in 2008 when we determined that we no longer intended to pursue development of the assets. Our change in intent to pursue disposition of these assets rather than holding for investment triggered the determination that a further impairment of the basis for the land parcels existed. We did not recognize any impairment charges for land holds in 2010. During 2009, we concluded that the economic downturn and the related decline in employment levels did not support the development and construction of certain new apartment communities that were previously in planning. This resulted in the recognition of impairment charges of $21,152,000 in 2009 related to the impairment of land parcels which we concluded would not be developed at the dates of the impairment. We looked to a combination of internal models and third-party pricing estimates to determine the fair values for these impaired land parcels. Considering our knowledge of multifamily residential development, the fair values of parcels zoned for multifamily development were generated using an internal model. Land parcels zoned for other purposes were valued using third-party estimates of fair value. For the internally generated fair values, we used a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows for a multifamily rental community. The cash flow analysis incorporated assumptions that market participants would make, including applying discount factors to the estimated future cash 55 flows of the underlying asset, as well as potential disposition proceeds. The third-party values incorporated the use of estimated rates of return, investment time horizons and sales prices for land parcels considered to be market comparables, adjusted for known differences in critical areas including the existing entitlements (such as zoning and state of infrastructure readiness). Both valuation methods included significant other unobservable inputs and are therefore classified as Level 3 prices in the fair value hierarchy. We also evaluate our unconsolidated investments for impairment, considering both the carrying value of the investment, estimated to be the expected proceeds that it would receive if the entity were dissolved and the net assets were liquidated, as well as our proportionate share of any impairment of assets held by unconsolidated investments. During 2011, we concluded that because the market for for-sale housing development has not improved as expected, the investment in an unconsolidated joint venture was impaired and that impairment was other than temporary. As a result, we recognized a charge of $1,955,000 for the impairment of the investment in the unconsolidated joint venture. There were no impairment losses recognized by any of our investments in unconsolidated entities during the year ended December 31, 2010. In 2009, an unconsolidated joint venture in which we hold an interest determined that the economic downturn impacted the recoverability of the carrying value of a long lived asset held as an investment. Accordingly, the joint venture recognized an impairment loss. We recognized our proportionate share of the impairment loss of approximately $2,600,000 as a component of equity in income of unconsolidated entities on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Our focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate and/or capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development. We cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed, or the likelihood of any future impairment charges, if any. You should also review Item 1a., Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. REIT Status We are a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated, for federal income tax purposes, as a REIT. We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code for the year ended December 31, 1994 and have not revoked such election. A corporate REIT is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income if we distribute 100% of taxable income to our stockholders over time periods allowed under the Code. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at regular corporate rates (subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to elect to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. For example, if we failed to qualify as a REIT in 2011, our net income would have decreased by approximately $177,500,000. Our qualification as a REIT requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment. Therefore, we believe our REIT status is a critical accounting estimate.
