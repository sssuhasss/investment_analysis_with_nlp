ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is intended to help provide an understanding of our business and results of operations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. This report, including the following MD&A, contains forward-looking statements regarding future events or trends that should be read in conjunction with the factors described under "Forward-Looking Statements" included in this report. In addition, our actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements as a result of the factors discussed under "Forward-Looking Statements" as well as the risk factors described in Item 1a, "Risk Factors," of this report. Capitalized terms used without definitions have the meaning as provided elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Executive Overview As discussed under Item 1., "Business," we executed the Purchase Agreement under which we expect to acquire direct and indirect interests in certain operating and development communities from Archstone. We expect this transaction will close in the first quarter of 2013. The impact of the Archstone Acquisition is expected to significantly change the scope of our business and as a result our 2012 results of operations may not necessarily be representative of our future results of operations. Unless otherwise stated, all disclosures and discussion in this Form 10-K do not include the expected effects of the Archstone Acquisition. Business Description We are primarily engaged in developing, acquiring, owning and operating apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets of the United States. We believe that apartment communities are an attractive long-term investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments, because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle. However, throughout the real estate cycle, apartment market fundamentals, and therefore operating cash flows, are affected by overall economic conditions. We seek to create long-term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms; deploying that capital to develop, redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets; operating apartment communities; and selling communities when pricing is attractive or when they no longer meet our long-term investment strategy. Barriers to entry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply. Our strategy is to be a leader in multifamily market research, consumer insight, and capital allocation, delivering a range of multifamily offerings tailored to serve the needs of the most attractive customer segments in the best-performing submarkets of the United States. Our communities are predominately upscale, which generally command among the highest rents in their markets. We also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points, consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services. We regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our markets. Our current markets include New England, the New York/New Jersey metro area, the Mid-Atlantic, the Pacific Northwest, and the Northern and Southern California regions of the United States. 50 Table of Contents Financial Highlights For the year ended December 31, 2012, net income attributable to common stockholders was $423,869,000 compared to $441,622,000 for 2011, a decrease of 4.0%. The decrease was due primarily to decreased gains on sale of communities in 2012 as compared to 2011 and acquisition costs for the expected Archstone Acquisition offset partially by an increase in net operating income ("NOI") from both Established and newly stabilized communities. Apartment fundamentals improved throughout 2012 as compared to 2011, driven by a combination of a decline in the home ownership rate, modest employment growth and limited supply of new multifamily rental product. Full year 2012 Established Communities NOI increased 7.6% over the prior year across all of our markets as a result of an increase in rental revenue offset partially by an increase in operating expenses. During 2012, we raised approximately $3,370,000,000 of capital through the issuance of common equity and unsecured notes and asset sales. Proceeds were used to prefund our expected portion of the acquisition of Archstone, to fund current investment activities and to repay higher cost secured and unsecured debt both at or prior to their stated maturity. We believe that our current capital structure will continue to provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms. The funds raised from dispositions consist of the proceeds from the sale of four communities and one land parcel for a gross sales price of $280,550,000. We believe our development activity will continue to create long-term value. We increased development activity during 2012 from the prior year in anticipation of favorable economic conditions and apartment fundamentals. During 2012, we completed the development of eight communities for an aggregate total capitalized cost of $513,100,000. We also started the development of twelve communities, which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of $891,300,000. In addition, during 2012 we completed the redevelopment of eleven communities for a total investment of $105,900,000, excluding costs incurred prior to the redevelopment. We believe that our current level of indebtedness, our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges and our current limited use of financial encumbrances (such as secured financing) provides flexibility in our capital raising activities. We expect to meet our liquidity needs from the issuance of unsecured debt and/or common and preferred equity and/or secured debt, as well as from disposition proceeds, joint venture investments or from retained cash. These sources will provide adequate access to the capital necessary to fund our development and redevelopment activities during 2013. With the completion of the investment period for Fund II in 2011, we became active again in acquiring wholly-owned apartment communities, directly purchasing the following four apartment communities during 2012, one of which occurred through a purchase of our joint venture partner's interest. The Mark Pasadena, located in Pasadena, CA, which contains 84 apartment homes, was acquired for a purchase price of $19,400,000. In conjunction with this acquisition, we assumed the existing 4.61% fixed-rate mortgage loan with an outstanding principal amount of $11,958,000 which matures in June 2018 and is secured by the community. Eaves Cerritos, located in Artesia, CA, which contains 151 apartment homes, was acquired for a purchase price of $29,500,000. Eaves Burlington, located in Burlington MA, which contains 203 homes, was acquired for a purchase price of $40,250,000. The Company acquired Avalon Del Rey, a 309 apartment home community which was owned by a joint venture in which we held a 30% ownership interest. As part of this transaction, the 51 Table of Contents venture repaid the $43,606,000 variable rate note secured by the community. We paid approximately $67,200,000 for the joint venture partner's 70% interest as well as contributing our proportionate share of the note repayment to the venture. Upon the acquisition of Avalon Del Rey, we consolidated the community. We established Fund I and Fund II to engage in acquisition programs through discretionary investment funds. We believe this investment format provides the following attributes: (i) it enables us to access third-party joint venture equity as an additional source of financing to expand and diversify our portfolio; (ii) it provides us with additional sources of income in the form of property management and asset management fees and, potentially, incentive distributions if the performance of the Funds exceeds certain thresholds; and (iii) it gives us greater visibility into the transactions occurring in multifamily assets, which helps us with other investment decisions related to our wholly-owned portfolio. Fund I has nine institutional investors, including us. One of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner of Fund I and, excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of Fund I, we have made an equity investment of approximately $21,100,000 in Fund I (net of distributions and excluding the purchase by us of a mortgage note secured by a Fund I community), representing a 15.15% combined general partner and limited partner equity interest. Fund I was our principal vehicle for acquiring apartment communities from its formation in 2005 through the close of its investment period in March 2008. Fund I has a term that expires in March 2013, plus two one-year extension options. During 2012, Fund I sold six communities: Avalon Lakeside, a 204 apartment home community in Chicago, IL, for $20,500,000; Avalon at Poplar Creek, a 196 apartment home community in Chicago, IL, for $27,200,000; Avalon Lombard, a 256 apartment home community in Chicago, IL, for $35,450,000; Avalon Paseo Place, a 134 apartment home community in Fremont, CA, for $30,900,000; Avalon Skyway, a 348 apartment home community in San Jose, CA, for $90,900,000; and Avalon at Aberdeen Station, a 290 apartment home community in Aberdeen, NJ, for $66,250,000. Our proportionate share of the gain from the sale of these communities was $7,971,000. In conjunction with the disposition of these communities, Fund I repaid $89,142,000 of the related secured indebtedness in advance of the scheduled maturity dates, incurring charges for prepayment penalties and write off of deferred financing costs, of which our portion was approximately $530,000, reported as a reduction of Equity in income of unconsolidated entities. In addition, in 2013, Fund I sold Avalon at Yerba Buena, located in San Francisco, CA. Avalon at Yerba Buena contains 160 apartment homes and 32,000 square feet of retail space and was sold for $103,000,000. Fund II has six institutional investors, including us. One of our wholly owned subsidiaries is the general partner of Fund II and excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of Fund II, we have made an equity investment of $107,938,000 (net of distributions), representing a 31.3% combined general partner and limited partner equity interest. Fund II served as the exclusive vehicle through which we acquired investment interests in apartment communities from its formation in 2008 through the close of its investment period in August 2011. 52 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2012, a subsidiary of Fund II acquired Avalon Watchung, a 334 apartment home community located in Watchung, NJ, for $63,000,000. This was the final acquisition for Fund II. In 2013, Fund II sold Avalon Rothbury, a 205 apartment home community located in Gaithersburg, MD, for $39,600,000. We are not presently pursuing the formation of a new, third fund, preferring at this time to maintain flexibility in shaping our portfolio of wholly-owned assets through acquisitions and dispositions. However, we may acquire investments in existing fund structures in connection with the Archstone Acquisition, but these funds are not expected to limit our ability to acquire investments for our own account. Communities Overview As of December 31, 2012, we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 203 apartment communities containing 59,391 apartment homes in nine states and the District of Columbia, of which 23 communities were under construction and five communities were under reconstruction. Of these communities, 26 were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes, including 11 owned by subsidiaries of Fund I and 13 owned by subsidiaries of Fund II. In addition, we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in Development Rights to develop an additional 34 wholly-owned communities that, if developed in the manner expected, will contain an estimated 9,602 apartment homes. Our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities, Development Communities, and Development Rights. Our current operating communities are further distinguished as Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities, Lease-Up Communities and Redevelopment Communities. Established Communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, which allows the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared between years. Other Stabilized Communities are generally all other consolidated operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year, but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year. Lease-Up Communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved. Redevelopment Communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year. A more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in Note 8, "Segment Reporting," of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Although each of these categories is important to our business, we generally evaluate overall operating, industry and market trends based on the operating results of Established Communities, for which a detailed discussion can be found in "Results of Operations" as part of our discussion of overall operating results. We evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition, disposition, development, redevelopment and financing activities within Other Stabilized, Redevelopment and Development Communities. Discussions related to these segments of our business can be found in "Liquidity and Capital Resources." NOI of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance. NOI is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets, our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs. Our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed and acquired apartment communities. 53 Table of Contents Results of Operations Our year-over-year operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and reflected in changes in NOI of our Established Communities; NOI derived from acquisitions and development completions; the loss of NOI related to disposed communities; and capital market and financing activity. A comparison of our operating results for 2012, 2011 and 2010 follows (dollars in thousands): 2012 2011 $ Change % Change 2011 2010 $ Change % Change Revenue: Rental and other income $ 1,028,403 $ 926,431 $ 101,972 11.0 % $ 926,431 $ 835,466 $ 90,965 10.9 % Management, development and other fees 10,257 9,656 601 6.2 % 9,656 7,354 2,302 31.3 % Total revenue 1,038,660 936,087 102,573 11.0 % 936,087 842,820 93,267 11.1 % Expenses: Direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes 218,867 209,412 9,455 4.5 % 209,412 202,405 7,007 3.5 % Property taxes 101,136 92,568 8,568 9.3 % 92,568 87,864 4,704 5.4 % Total community operating expenses 320,003 301,980 18,023 6.0 % 301,980 290,269 11,711 4.0 % Corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses 42,193 40,213 1,980 4.9 % 40,213 37,287 2,926 7.8 % Investments and investment management expense 6,071 5,126 945 18.4 % 5,126 3,824 1,302 34.0 % Expensed acquisition, development and other pursuit costs 11,350 2,967 8,383 282.5 % 2,967 2,741 226 8.2 % Interest expense, net 136,920 167,814 (30,894 ) (18.4 )% 167,814 169,997 (2,183 ) (1.3 )% Loss on extinguishment of debt, net 1,179 1,940 (761 ) (39.2 )% 1,940 1,940 N/A Depreciation expense 256,026 239,060 16,966 7.1 % 239,060 220,563 18,497 8.4 % General and administrative expense 34,101 29,371 4,730 16.1 % 29,371 26,846 2,525 9.4 % Casualty and impairment loss 1,449 14,052 (12,603 ) (89.7 )% 14,052 14,052 N/A Gain on sale of land (280 ) (13,716 ) 13,436 (98.0 )% (13,716 ) (13,716 ) N/A Gain on acquisition of unconsolidated real estate entity (14,194 ) (14,194 ) 100.0 % 0.0 % Total other expenses 474,815 486,827 (12,012 ) (2.5 )% 486,827 461,258 25,569 5.5 % Equity in income of unconsolidated entities 20,914 5,120 15,794 308.5 % 5,120 762 4,358 571.9 % Income from continuing operations 264,756 152,400 112,356 73.7 % 152,400 92,055 60,345 65.6 % Discontinued operations: Income from discontinued operations 12,495 7,880 4,615 58.6 % 7,880 7,950 (70 ) (0.9 )% Gain on sale of communities 146,311 281,090 (134,779 ) (47.9 )% 281,090 74,074 207,016 279.5 % Total discontinued operations 158,806 288,970 (130,164 ) (45.0 )% 288,970 82,024 206,946 252.3 % Net income 423,562 441,370 (17,808 ) (4.0 )% 441,370 174,079 267,291 153.5 % Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 307 252 55 21.8 % 252 1,252 (1,000 ) (79.9 )% Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 423,869 $ 441,622 $ (17,753 ) (4.0 )% $ 441,622 $ 175,331 $ 266,291 151.9 % Net income attributable to common stockholders decreased $17,753,000, or 4.0%, to $423,869,000 in 2012 primarily due to a decrease in gain on sale of communities as compared to the prior year, offset partially by increased NOI in 2012 over 2011. Net income attributable to common stockholders increased $266,291,000, or 151.9% in 2011 over 2010 due primarily to an increase in gain on sale of communities and increased NOI in 2011 over 2010. NOI is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate-level or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy 54 Table of Contents comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impacts to overhead as a result of acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. We define NOI as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses, including property taxes. NOI does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance. NOI should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity, nor is NOI necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. Reconciliations of NOI for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 to net income for each year are as follows (dollars in thousands): For the year ended 12-31-12 12-31-11 12-31-10 Net income $ 423,562 $ 441,370 $ 174,079 Indirect operating expenses, net of corporate income 31,911 30,550 30,246 Investments and investment management expense 6,071 5,126 3,824 Expensed acquisition, development and other pursuit costs 11,350 2,967 2,741 Interest expense, net 136,920 167,814 169,997 Loss on extinguishment of debt, net 1,179 1,940 General and administrative expense 34,101 29,371 26,846 Equity in income of unconsolidated entities (20,914 ) (5,120 ) (762 ) Depreciation expense 256,026 239,060 220,563 Casualty and impairment loss 1,449 14,052 Gain on sale of real estate assets (146,591 ) (294,806 ) (74,074 ) (Income) loss from discontinued operations (12,495 ) (7,880 ) (7,950 ) Gain on acquisition of unconsolidated real estate entity (14,194 ) Net operating income $ 708,375 $ 624,444 $ 545,510 The NOI increases for both 2012 and 2011, as compared to the prior year period, consist of changes in the following categories (dollars in thousands): Full Year 2012 Full Year 2011 Established Communities $ 37,567 $ 34,652 Other Stabilized Communities 17,394 21,581 Development and Redevelopment Communities 28,970 22,701 Total $ 83,931 $ 78,934 The NOI increase for Established Communities in 2012 is due to a combination of increased rental revenues, offset partially by increased operating expenses. During 2012, we experienced sequential annual increases in rental rates over 2011, while maintaining occupancy of at least 95% in all markets, offset partially by an increase in operating expenses. Rental and other income increased in both 2012 and 2011 as compared to the prior years due to additional rental income generated from newly developed and acquired communities and increases in rental rates at our Established Communities. Overall Portfolio The weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased to 43,411 apartment homes for 2012 as compared to 42,613 homes for 2011 and 40,489 homes for 2010. The increase in 2012 over 2011 is due to homes available from newly developed and acquired communities, offset partially by communities sold during 2012 and 2011. The weighted 55 Table of Contents average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to $2,017 for 2012 as compared to $1,911 in 2011 and $1,823 in 2010. Established Communities Rental revenue increased $41,698,000, or 5.8%, for 2012 and increased $33,335,000 or 5.1%, for 2011 as compared to the respective prior years. For 2012, the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased 5.6% to $2,092 compared to $1,981 in 2011 coupled with an increase in economic occupancy of 0.2% to 96.1%. Economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community's gross revenue. Economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss, as a percentage of gross potential revenue. Gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents. We experienced increases in rental revenue for all of our Established Communities regions in 2012 as compared to the prior year as discussed in more detail below. The Metro New York/New Jersey region, which accounted for approximately 30.1% of Established Community rental revenue for 2012, experienced an increase in rental revenue of 5.5% for 2012 as compared to 2011. Average rental rates increased 5.2% to $2,548 over 2011 and economic occupancy increased 0.3% to 96.4% for 2012 as compared to 2011. While there has not been significant job growth in the financial services sector of the Metro New York/New Jersey region, job growth in the technology sector continues to support the improvement in apartment fundamentals in New York City and Northern New Jersey. The New England region accounted for approximately 22.0% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2012 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 4.2% over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 4.6% to $2,073, offset partially by a decrease in economic occupancy of 0.4% to 95.7% for 2012 as compared to 2011. The New England region's growth is driven by a renewed expansion in employment for the technology sector, primarily in the greater Boston area, offset somewhat by weakness in the financial services sector impacting the Fairfield-New Haven area. We expect continued but moderating revenue growth, with the increasing affordability of home ownership and future supply from new development impacting the longer term outlook. Northern California accounted for approximately 17.0% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2012 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 10.1% over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 10.0% to $2,151, and economic occupancy increased 0.1% to 96.1% for 2012 as compared to 2011. The growth in rental revenue is driven by the strength of Northern California's technology sector, which we expect will continue in 2013. An increase in development activity and future supply may slow revenue growth in future periods. The Mid-Atlantic region, which represented approximately 13.6% of Established Community rental revenue during 2012, experienced an increase in rental revenue of 3.6% as compared to 2011. Average rental rates increased by 3.2% to $1,900, and economic occupancy increased 0.4% to 95.9% for 2012 as compared to 2011. The Mid-Atlantic region is facing challenges resulting from additional supply due to new development and the uncertainty surrounding federal spending. We expect these factors will result in revenue growth at a slower pace relative to our other markets during 2013. Southern California accounted for approximately 13.0% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2012 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 4.9% over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 4.5% to $1,753, and economic occupancy increased 0.4% to 96.3% for 2012 as compared to 2011. The improvement in the Southern California market is driven by above average job growth and limited new supply, and we expect this trend will continue into 2013. The Pacific Northwest region accounted for approximately 4.3% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2012 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 9.6% over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 8.3% to $1,493, and economic occupancy increased by 1.3% to 96.3% for 2012 as compared to 2011. The Pacific Northwest's retail, technology and manufacturing sectors continue to support job creation and apartment fundamentals. Consistent with several of our other markets, new development and resulting additional supply may moderate revenue growth in future periods. 56 Table of Contents Management, development and other fees increased $601,000, or 6.2%, in 2012 over 2011 and $2,302,000, or 31.3% in 2011 over 2010. The increases in both years were due primarily to increased asset management fees and property management fees from Fund II over the prior years. Direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes increased $9,455,000, or 4.5% in 2012 and increased $7,007,000, or 3.5% for 2011 as compared to the prior years, primarily due to the addition of recently developed apartment homes. For Established Communities, direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes, decreased $475,000, or 0.3% for 2012 and decreased $2,514,000 or 1.6% for 2011 as compared to the prior years. The decreases in 2012 and 2011 from the respective prior years were due to a decrease in utilities from milder temperatures and more favorable negotiated rates as well as decreased bad debt expense. Property taxes increased $8,568,000, or 9.3% and $4,704,000, or 5.4% in 2012 and 2011, respectively, over the prior years due to the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes and overall higher assessments. Property tax increases are also impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals. For Established Communities, property taxes increased by $4,581,000, or 6.5% and decreased $631,000, or 0.9%, for 2012 and 2011, respectively, as compared to the prior year. The increase in 2012 over 2011 is due to appeals and settlements recognized in 2011 not present in 2012 coupled with increases in rates and assessments throughout our regions. The decrease in 2011 from 2010 is due to the appeals and settlements recognized in 2011 not present in 2010, offset partially by increased rates and assessments across all of our regions. Corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses increased by $1,980,000, or 4.9% and $2,926,000, or 7.8% in 2012 and 2011, respectively, over the prior years. The increases in 2012 and 2011 from the prior years are due primarily to increases in costs associated with our introduction and implementation of our AVA and Eaves by Avalon brands, and increases in compensation costs. Investments and investment management costs increased by $945,000, or 18.4% and $1,302,000, or 34.0% in 2012 and 2011, respectively, over the prior years due primarily to increases in compensation costs. Expensed acquisition, development and other pursuit costs primarily reflect the costs incurred for acquisitions of operating real estate and abandoned pursuit costs, which include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development, as well as the abandonment of Development Rights and disposition pursuits. These costs can be volatile, particularly in periods of increased acquisition activity, periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital, and the costs may vary significantly from period to period. These costs increased $8,383,000 or 282.5% in 2012 over 2011 due primarily to costs associated with the Archstone Acquisition. Interest expense, net decreased $30,894,000, or 18.4% and decreased $2,183,000, or 1.3% in 2012 and 2011, respectively as compared to the prior years. The decreases in 2012 and 2011 from the prior years are due primarily to decreases in the average outstanding indebtedness and lower average effective interest rates coupled with increases in the amount of capitalized interest. The increases in capitalized interest over the respective prior years were driven primarily by the increase in our development activity and development pursuits. The year-over-year decrease in interest expense, net, in 2012 from 2011 was offset somewhat by interest income associated with escrow accounts for certain tax exempt secured borrowings recognized in 2011 that were not present in 2012. Loss on the extinguishment of debt, net reflects the impact from prepayment penalties, expensing deferred financing costs from our debt repurchase and retirement activity, or payments above or below 57 Table of Contents the carrying basis, excluding assets sold or held for sale, which is included in discontinued operations, below. During 2012, we recognized a non-cash charge for the write off of deferred financing fees related to the early retirement of a secured note. In 2011 we incurred charges for a prepayment penalty and the write off of deferred financing fees related to the early retirement of a secured note, with no comparable activity in 2010. Depreciation expense increased in 2012 and 2011 primarily due to the net increase in assets from the completion of development and redevelopment activities and acquisition activity, offset by a reduction in depreciation expense from assets sold during 2012, 2011and 2010. General and administrative expense ("G&A") increased $4,730,000, or 16.1% in 2012 and $2,525,000, or 9.4% in 2011 as compared to the prior years. The increases in both periods are attributable to increased compensation expense and professional fees. Casualty and impairment loss for 2012 consists of the losses we incurred associated with Superstorm Sandy. Amounts for 2011 are composed of the write down of two land parcels and an other than temporary impairment of an investment in unconsolidated joint venture. Gain on sale of land decreased in 2012 and increased in 2011 as compared to the prior years due to the volume and associated gains on the sale of land parcels in each of the respective years. Gain on acquisition of unconsolidated entity represents the amount by which the fair value of our prior ownership interest in the joint venture that owned Avalon Del Rey exceeded our carrying value. Equity in income of unconsolidated entities increased $15,794,000, or 308.5% in 2012 and $4,358,000, or 571.9% in 2011 as compared to prior years. The increase in 2012 is due primarily to the recognition of income from our promoted interest for Avalon Del Rey and an increase in our proportionate share of gains from Fund I disposition activity over the prior year periods. The increase in 2011 is due to the recognition of our proportionate share of the gain on sale of communities by Fund I, offset partially by increased acquisition costs from Fund II over 2010. Income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by communities sold or qualifying as discontinued operations during the period from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2012. This income increased for 2012 and decreased for 2011 due to changes in the number of communities sold in each year as compared to the prior year period. See Note 6, "Real Estate Disposition Activities," to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Gain on sale of communities decreased in 2012 and increased in 2011 as compared to the prior years due to a change in the volume of community disposition activity and associated gains as compared to the prior year. The amount of gain realized upon disposition of a community depends on many factors, including the number of communities sold, the size and carrying value of those communities and the market conditions in the local area. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests resulted in income to us from the allocation of losses to the noncontrolling interests of $307,000 in 2012 and $252,000 in 2011. The decrease in loss allocated in 2011 relative to 2010 is due primarily to improved operating results of the Fund I community we consolidate. The conversion and redemption of limited partnership units in 2011 and 2010 also contributed to the decrease in 2011 from 2010, thereby reducing outside ownership interest and the allocation of net losses to outside ownership interests. 58 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe our principal short-term liquidity needs are to fund: the cash consideration due and any costs associated with the expected Archstone Acquisition as discussed in this Form 10-K, or any additional liquidity needs associated with the expected Archstone Acquisition; development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged; the minimum dividend payments on our common stock required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Code; debt service and principal payments either at maturity or opportunistically prior to maturity; and normal recurring operating expenses. Factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations, financing activities and investing activities (including dispositions) as well as general economic and market conditions. Operating cash flow has historically been determined by: (i) the number of apartment homes currently owned, (ii) rental rates, (iii) occupancy levels and (iv) operating expenses with respect to apartment homes. The timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage, as well as our plans for development, redevelopment, acquisition and disposition activity, are affected by changes in the capital markets environment, such as changes in interest rates or the availability of cost-effective capital. We regularly review our liquidity needs, the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs. We continued to have cost effective access to the capital markets during the year ended December 31, 2012. Net proceeds of approximately $3,100,458,000 were provided by capital markets activity in 2012. Capital raising activities included public equity and debt, including amounts issued in an underwritten public offering of common stock in December 2012, the issuance of unsecured notes in September and December 2012 and the issuance of common stock during 2012 under CEP II and CEP III, discussed below. In 2013, we expect to meet all of our liquidity needs from a variety of internal and external sources, including cash balances on hand, asset sales and other public or private sources of liquidity as discussed below, as well as our operating activities. Our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or short-term financial prospects. At December 31, 2012, we have unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $2,733,618,000 available to fund the Archstone Acquisition, to fund current liquidity needs as well as to fund development and acquisition related activities. Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled $2,733,618,000 at December 31, 2012, an increase of $2,116,765,000 from $616,853,000 at December 31, 2011. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included elsewhere in this report. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $540,819,000 in 2012 from $429,354,000 in 2011. The increase was driven primarily by increased cash flows from community operations in 2012 as compared to 2011 and the timing of general corporate expenditures. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of $623,386,000 in 2012 related to investments in assets through development, redevelopment, and acquisitions, partially offset by 59 Table of Contents proceeds of $274,018,000 from the sale of real estate. In total, we invested $937,946,000 during 2012 in the following areas: We invested approximately $755,363,000 in the development and redevelopment of communities; We invested $155,755,000 in the acquisition of four apartment communities, acquisition costs associated with these acquisitions, and costs related to the expected Archstone Acquisition; and We had capital expenditures of $26,528,000 for real estate and non-real estate assets. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $2,199,332,000 in 2012. The net cash provided is due to $2,430,190,000 received from the issuance of common stock, primarily through the underwritten common equity offering we executed in November 2012, through CEP II and CEP III, and stock option exercises, and the proceeds from our $450,000,000 and $250,000,000 unsecured notes offerings. These proceeds were offset partially by $365,572,000 of dividends paid, repayment of unsecured notes of $381,001,000, the repayment of mortgage notes payable of $110,013,000, and the settlement of an interest rate contract for $54,930,000. Variable Rate Unsecured Credit Facility In September 2011, we entered into a $750,000,000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of banks (the "Credit Facility"). In December 2012, pursuant to an option available under the terms of the Credit Facility, with the approval of the lending syndicate we expanded the aggregate facility size to $1,300,000,000, extended the maturity of the credit facility from September 2015 to April 2017, and amended other sections of the Credit Facility (the "Facility Increase"). We may further extend the term for up to two additional six month periods (for a total extension of one year), provided we are not in default and upon payment of a $975,000 extension fee for each extension option. In connection with the Facility Increase, the applicable margin over reference rates used to determine the applicable interest rates on our borrowings from time to time decreased. The Credit Facility now bears interest at varying levels based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us. The current stated pricing is LIBOR plus 1.05% per annum (1.25% on January 31, 2013). The stated spread over LIBOR can vary from LIBOR plus 0.95% to LIBOR plus 1.725% based on our credit ratings. In addition, a competitive bid option is available for borrowings up to 65% of the Credit Facility amount, which allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to make loans at a rate that is lower than the stated rate if market conditions allow. In connection with the Facility Increase, the annual facility fee was also amended to lower the fee from 0.175% to 0.15% (approximately $1,950,000 based on the $1,300,000,000 facility size and based on our current credit rating). We did not have any borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and had $42,575,000 outstanding in letters of credit that reduced our borrowing capacity as of January 31, 2013. Financial Covenants We are subject to financial and other covenants contained in the Credit Facility and the indenture under which our unsecured notes were issued. The financial covenants include the following: limitations on the amount of total and secured debt in relation to our overall capital structure; limitations on the amount of our unsecured debt relative to the undepreciated basis of real estate assets that are not encumbered by property-specific financing; and 60 Table of Contents minimum levels of debt service coverage. We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2012. In addition, our secured borrowings may include yield maintenance, defeasance, or prepayment penalty provisions, which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity. These provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured. Continuous Equity Offering Program In November 2010, we commenced our second continuous equity program ("CEP II"), under which we were authorized to sell up to $500,000,000 of our common stock from time to time during a 36-month period. In conjunction with CEP II, we engaged sales agents who received compensation of approximately 1.5% of the gross sales price for shares sold. For the year ended December 31, 2012 we sold 1,435,215 shares under CEP II at an average sales price of $140.41 per share, for aggregate net proceeds of $198,489,000. From program inception in November 2010 through completion in July 2012, we sold 3,925,980 shares at an average price of $127.36 per share, for aggregate net proceeds of $492,490,000. In August 2012, we commenced our third continuous equity program ("CEP III"), under which we may sell up to $750,000,000 of shares of our common stock during a 36-month period. In conjunction with CEP III we have engaged sales agents who receive compensation of approximately 1.5% of the gross sales price for shares sold. From program inception through December 31, 2012, we sold 729,991 shares at an average sales price of $142.09, for net proceeds of $102,168,000. Underwritten Public Offering of Common Stock In December 2012, we issued 16,675,000 shares of our common stock at $130.00 per share. Net proceeds of approximately $2,102,718,000 are expected to be used to repay a portion of the debt we expect to assume in connection with the Archstone Acquisition, to fund the cash consideration due in connection with the Archstone Acquisition, to fund the fees, costs and expenses related thereto or, if the acquisition does not occur, for general corporate purposes. Future Financing and Capital Needs Debt and Derivative Maturities One of our principal long-term liquidity needs is the repayment of long-term debt at the time that such debt matures. For unsecured notes, a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity. Early retirement of our unsecured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment. If we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due, it will be necessary for us to refinance the debt. This refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings, additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities, borrowings under our Credit Facility or by equity offerings. Although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or, if available, that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory. We are also party to a $215,000,000 forward interest rate swap agreement, which was executed to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of our expected debt issuance activity in 2013. In 2013, based on changes in our capital markets outlook for the year, coupled with our current liquidity position, it is now uncertain as to whether we will issue the anticipated debt for which this interest rate protection agreement was transacted. We expect to settle this position at or prior to its maturity in May 2013 for the fair value at the time of settlement. At the point that we deem the 61 Table of Contents anticipated debt issuance probable of not occurring, we will record a charge for the reversal of the amount recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income for the forward interest swap agreement. If we do issue the debt as previously anticipated, then the amounts recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income will be recognized as interest expense over the term of the debt. As of January 31, 2013 we had recorded a liability related to the value of this contract of $49,675,000 In conjunction with our issuance of unsecured notes in September 2012, discussed below, we cash settled a liability associated with a second $215,000,000 forward interest rate swap contract to which we were a party in September 2012 for $54,930,000. In addition to the proceeds received from the common equity offering we completed in December 2012 and from the CEP II and CEP III offerings during 2012 and the forward interest rate swap agreement discussed above, the following financing activity occurred during 2012: In January 2012, we repaid $179,400,000 principal amount of 5.5% unsecured notes pursuant to their scheduled maturity. In February 2012, in conjunction with the acquisition of a community, we assumed the existing 4.61% mortgage note in the amount of $11,958,000 that matures in June 2018, and is secured by the community. Also in February 2012, we repaid a variable rate secured mortgage note in the amount of $48,500,000 in advance of its November 2039 scheduled maturity date. In conjunction with the early retirement we incurred a non-cash charge of $1,179,000 for the write off of deferred financing fees which was recognized as a loss on extinguishment of debt on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. In May 2012, we repaid a variable rate secured mortgage note in the amount of $14,566,000 in accordance with its scheduled maturity date. Also in May 2012, in conjunction with the disposition of an operating community, we repaid a variable rate secured mortgage note in the amount of $33,100,000 in advance of its scheduled maturity date. We incurred a charge of $602,000 for a prepayment penalty and the write off of deferred financing fees associated with the early repayment of this note included in income from discontinued operations on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. In September 2012, we issued $450,000,000 principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement. The notes mature in September 2022 and were issued at a 2.95% interest rate. The notes have an effective interest rate of approximately 4.30%, including the effect of the interest rate hedge discussed above and offering costs. In November 2012, we repaid $201,601,000 principal amount of 6.125% unsecured notes pursuant to their scheduled maturity. In December 2012, we issued $250,000,000 principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement. The notes mature in March 2023 and were issued at a 2.85% interest rate. The notes have an effective interest rate of 3.00%, including the effect of offering costs. The following table details debt maturities for the next five years, excluding our Credit Facility and amounts outstanding related to communities classified as held for sale, for debt outstanding at December 31, 2012 (dollars in thousands). We are not directly or indirectly (as borrower or guarantor) obligated in any material respect to pay principal or interest of the indebtedness of any unconsolidated entities in which we have any equity or other interest. The information presented in this table may materially change as a result of the expected Archstone Acquisition which we anticipate will occur in the first quarter of 2013. 62 Table of Contents Balance Outstanding Scheduled maturities All-In interest rate(1) Principal maturity date Community 12-31-11 12-31-12 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter Tax-exempt bonds Fixed rate Eaves Washingtonian Center I 7.81 % May-2027 $ 9,103 $ 8,764 $ 364 $ 390 $ 419 $ 449 $ 482 $ 6,660 Avalon Oaks 7.49 % Feb-2041 16,468 16,288 195 209 223 240 257 15,164 Avalon Oaks West 7.54 % Apr-2043 16,367 16,205 173 185 198 211 225 15,213 Avalon at Chestnut Hill 6.15 % Oct-2047 40,781 40,390 411 434 457 482 509 38,097 Avalon Morningside Park 4.62 % May-2046 100,000 (6) 182,719 81,647 1,143 1,218 1,297 1,382 1,473 75,134 Variable rate (2) Avalon at Mountain View 1.03 % Feb-2017 18,300 18,300 (3) 18,300 Avalon at Mission Viejo 1.29 % Jun-2025 7,635 7,635 (3) 7,635 AVA Nob Hill 1.21 % Jun-2025 20,800 20,800 (3) 20,800 Avalon Campbell 1.55 % Jun-2025 38,800 38,800 (3) 38,800 Avalon Pacifica 1.56 % Jun-2025 17,600 17,600 (3) 17,600 Avalon Bowery Place I 3.08 % Nov-2037 93,800 93,800 93,800 Avalon Bowery Place II Nov-2039 48,500 (5) Avalon Acton 1.65 % Jul-2040 45,000 45,000 (3) 45,000 Avalon Walnut Creek 2.50 % Mar-2046 116,000 116,000 116,000 Avalon Walnut Creek 2.46 % Mar-2046 10,000 10,000 10,000 Avalon Morningside Park 4.62 % May-2046 100,000 (6) 100,000 416,435 467,935 18,300 449,635 Conventional loans(4) Fixed rate $250 Million unsecured notes Jan-2012 104,400 (7) $250 Million unsecured notes Nov-2012 201,601 (7) $100 Million unsecured notes 5.11 % Mar-2013 100,000 100,000 100,000 $150 Million unsecured notes 5.52 % Apr-2014 150,000 150,000 150,000 $250 Million unsecured notes 5.89 % Sep-2016 250,000 250,000 250,000 $250 Million unsecured notes 5.82 % Mar-2017 250,000 250,000 250,000 $250 Million unsecured notes 6.19 % Mar-2020 250,000 250,000 250,000 $250 Million unsecured notes 4.04 % Jan-2021 250,000 250,000 250,000 $450 Million unsecured notes 4.30 % Sep-2022 450,000 450,000 $250 Million unsecured notes 3.00 % Mar-2023 250,000 250,000 Avalon at Tysons West 5.55 % Jul-2028 5,668 5,465 216 229 242 255 271 4,252 Avalon Orchards 7.78 % Jul-2033 18,321 17,939 412 441 472 506 542 15,566 Avalon at Arlington Square 4.81 % Apr-2013 170,125 170,125 170,125 Avalon Crescent 5.59 % May-2015 110,600 110,600 110,600 Avalon at Silicon Valley 5.74 % Jul-2015 150,000 150,000 150,000 Avalon Darien 6.22 % Nov-2015 49,907 49,221 742 789 47,690 Avalon Greyrock Place 6.12 % Nov-2015 60,133 59,292 907 962 57,423 Avalon Walnut Creek 4.00 % Jul-2066 2,500 2,500 2,500 Avalon Shrewsbury 5.92 % May-2019 20,991 20,737 273 289 307 323 346 19,199 Eaves Trumbull 5.93 % May-2019 41,048 40,552 533 566 601 631 676 37,545 Avalon at Stamford Harbor 5.92 % May-2019 65,261 64,472 847 900 955 1,003 1,075 59,692 Avalon Freehold 5.94 % May-2019 36,388 35,948 473 502 532 559 599 33,283 Avalon Run East 5.94 % May-2019 38,991 38,519 506 538 571 599 642 35,663 Eaves Nanuet 6.06 % May-2019 65,800 65,004 855 907 963 1,011 1,083 60,185 Avalon at Edgewater 5.94 % May-2019 78,046 77,103 1,016 1,076 1,142 1,199 1,285 71,385 Avalon at Foxhall 6.05 % May-2019 58,620 57,912 763 808 858 901 965 53,617 Avalon at Gallery Place 6.05 % May-2019 45,547 44,997 592 628 667 700 750 41,660 Avalon at Traville 5.91 % May-2019 77,187 76,254 1,003 1,065 1,130 1,186 1,271 70,599 Avalon Bellevue 5.91 % May-2019 26,522 26,201 344 366 388 408 437 24,258 Avalon on the Alameda 5.90 % May-2019 53,624 52,975 696 740 785 824 883 49,047 Avalon at Mission Bay North 5.90 % May-2019 72,785 71,905 946 1,004 1,065 1,118 1,198 66,574 Fairfax Towers 5.01 % Aug-2015 43,426 42,459 1,019 1,070 40,370 Eaves Phillips Ranch 5.75 % Jun-2013 54,574 53,348 53,348 The Mark Pasadena 4.77 % Jun-2018 11,958 89 186 195 202 213 11,073 2,902,065 3,295,486 335,705 163,066 416,956 261,425 262,236 1,856,098 Variable rate (2)(4) Avalon at Bedford Center May-2012 14,806 (7) Avalon Walnut Creek 2.54 % Mar-2046 9,000 9,000 9,000 $250 Million unsecured notes Jan-2012 75,000 (7) 98,806 9,000 9,000 Total indebtedness excluding unsecured credit facility $ 3,600,025 $ 3,854,068 $ 336,848 $ 164,284 $ 418,253 $ 262,807 $ 282,009 $ 2,389,867 (1) Includes credit enhancement fees, facility fees, trustees' fees, the impact of interest rate hedges, offering costs and other fees.

See discussion under "Contractual Obligations." As of December 31, 2012, we had 23 wholly-owned communities under construction, for which a total estimated cost of $983,079,000 remained to be invested. We also had five wholly-owned communities under reconstruction, for which a total estimated cost of $43,090,000 remained to be invested. Substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction and fund development costs related to pursuing Development Rights will be funded from: our $1,300,000,000 Credit Facility until it expires in 2017; cash currently on hand, invested in highly liquid overnight money market funds and repurchase agreements, and short-term investment vehicles; retained operating cash; the net proceeds from sales of existing communities; the issuance of debt or equity securities; and/or private equity funding, including joint venture activity. Before planned reconstruction activity, including reconstruction activity related to communities owned by the Funds, or the construction of a Development Right begins, we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing. In the event that financing cannot be obtained, we may have to abandon Development Rights, write off associated pre-development costs that were capitalized and/or forego reconstruction activity. In such instances, we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such Development Rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred. From time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets. We generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity. We may also use joint ventures related to mixed-use land development opportunities where our partners bring specific development and operational expertise to the venture. Each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement. We cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures. In evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets, we sell assets that do not meet our long-term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities. Because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets, the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income, but reduce future total revenues, total expenses and NOI. However, we believe that the absence of future cash flows from communities sold will have a minimal impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs. 64 Table of Contents Unconsolidated Real Estate Investments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Unconsolidated Investments As of December 31, 2012, we had investments in the following unconsolidated real estate entities with ownership interest percentages ranging from 15.2% to 31.3%. We account for these investments in unconsolidated real estate entities under the equity method of accounting. Refer to Note 5 "Investments in Real Estate Entities" of the Consolidated Financial Statements located elsewhere in this report, which includes information on the aggregate assets, liabilities and equity, as well as operating results, and our proportionate share of their operating results. Detail of the real estate and associated funding underlying our unconsolidated investments is presented in the following table. The information presented in this table may materially change as a result of the expected Archstone Acquisition which we anticipate will occur in the first quarter of 2013.

(7) Borrowing on this community is comprised of two mortgage loans. (8) After the venture makes certain threshold distributions to the third-party partner, the Company generally receives 50% of all further distributions. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In addition to our investment interests in unconsolidated real estate entities, we have certain off-balance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest. Additional discussion of these entities can be found in Note 5, "Investments in Real Estate Entities," of our Consolidated Financial Statements located elsewhere in this report. CVP I, LLC has outstanding tax-exempt, variable rate bonds maturing in November 2036 in the amount of $117,000,000, which have permanent credit enhancement. We agreed to guarantee, under limited circumstances, the repayment to the credit enhancer of any advances it may make in fulfillment of CVP I, LLC's repayment obligations under the bonds. We also guaranteed to the credit enhancer that CVP I, LLC would obtain a final certificate of occupancy for the project (Chrystie Place in New York City), which was obtained in December 2012, satisfying the conditions of the guarantee. Subsidiaries of Fund I have 13 loans secured by individual assets with amounts outstanding in the aggregate of $254,354,000, including $23,172,000 for the mortgage note of a Fund I subsidiary that we purchased during 2010. Fund I subsidiary loans have varying maturity dates (or dates after which the loans can be prepaid without penalty), ranging from August 2013 to September 2016. These mortgage loans are secured by the underlying real estate. The mortgage loans are payable by the subsidiaries of Fund I with operating cash flow or disposition proceeds from the underlying real estate. We have not guaranteed the debt of Fund I, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should Fund I be unable to do so. In addition, as part of the formation of Fund I, we provided to one of the limited partners a guarantee. The guarantee provides that if, upon final liquidation of Fund I, the total amount of all distributions to that partner during the life of Fund I (whether from operating cash flow or property sales) does not equal a minimum of the total capital contributions made by that partner, then we will pay the partner an amount equal to the shortfall, but in no event more than 10% of the total capital contributions made by the partner (maximum of approximately $7,500,000 as of December 31, 2012). As of December 31, 2012, the expected realizable value of the real estate assets owned by Fund I is considered adequate to cover such potential payment to that partner under the expected Fund I liquidation scenario. The estimated fair value of, and our obligation under this guarantee, both at inception and as of December 31, 2012 was not significant and therefore we have not recorded any obligation for this guarantee as of December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2012, subsidiaries of Fund II have 14 loans secured by individual assets with amounts outstanding in the aggregate of $490,078,000 with varying maturity dates (or dates after which the loans can be prepaid without penalty), ranging from November 2014 to September 2019. The mortgage loans are payable by the subsidiaries of Fund II with operating cash flow or disposition proceeds from the underlying real estate. We have not guaranteed the debt of Fund II, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should Fund II be unable to do so. In addition, as part of the formation of Fund II, we provided to one of the limited partners a guarantee. The guarantee provides that if, upon final liquidation of Fund II, the total amount of all distributions to that partner during the life of Fund II (whether from operating cash flow or property sales) does not equal a minimum of the total capital contributions made by that partner, then we will pay the partner an amount equal to the shortfall, but in no event more 66 Table of Contents than 10% of the total capital contributions made by the partner (maximum of approximately $8,910,000 as of December 31, 2012). As of December 31, 2012, the expected realizable value of the real estate assets owned by Fund II is considered adequate to cover such potential payment to that partner under the expected Fund II liquidation scenario. The estimated fair value of, and our obligation under this guarantee, both at inception and as of December 31, 2012 was not significant and therefore we have not recorded any obligation for this guarantee as of December 31, 2012. Each individual mortgage loan of Fund I or Fund II was made to a special purpose, single asset subsidiary of the Funds. Each mortgage loan provides that it is the obligation of the respective subsidiary only, except under exceptional circumstances (such as fraud or misapplication of funds) in which case the respective Fund could also have obligations with respect to the mortgage loan. In no event do the mortgage loans provide for recourse against investors in the Funds, including against us or our wholly-owned subsidiaries that invest in the Funds. A default by a Fund or a Fund subsidiary on any loan to it would not constitute a default under any of our loans or any loans of our other "non-Fund" subsidiaries or affiliates. If a Fund subsidiary or a Fund were unable to meet its obligations under a loan, the value of our investment in that Fund would likely decline and we might also be more likely to be obligated under the guarantee we provided to one of the Fund partners in each Fund as described above. If a Fund subsidiary or a Fund were unable to meet its obligations under a loan, we and/or the other investors might evaluate whether it was in our respective interests to voluntarily support the Fund through additional equity contributions and/or take other actions to avoid a default under a loan or the consequences of a default (such as foreclosure of a Fund asset). In the future, in the event either of the Funds were unable to meet their obligations under a loan, we cannot predict at this time whether we would provide any voluntary support, or take any other action, as any such action would depend on a variety of factors, including the amount of support required and the possibility that such support could enhance the return of either of the Funds and/or our returns by providing time for performance to improve. MVP I, LLC, the entity that owns Avalon at Mission Bay North II, has a loan secured by the underlying real estate assets of the community for $105,000,000. The loan is a fixed rate, interest-only note bearing interest at 6.02%, maturing in December 2015. We have not guaranteed the debt of MVP I, LLC, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should MVP I, LLC be unable to do so. In July 2012, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries acquired Avalon Del Rey, a 309 apartment home community which was owned by a joint venture in which we held a 30% ownership interest. As part of this transaction, the venture repaid the $43,606,000 variable rate note secured by the community. We paid approximately $67,200,000 to purchase our joint venture partner's 70% interest as well as paying the venture our proportionate share of the note repayment. In 2007 we entered into a non-cancelable commitment (the "Commitment") to acquire parcels of land in Brooklyn, New York for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $111,000,000. During 2012 we purchased the remaining outstanding parcels for $27,709,000 satisfying our purchase obligation. There are no other lines of credit, side agreements, financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate entities and us. In evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage, management takes into consideration our proportionate share of the indebtedness of unconsolidated entities in which we have an interest. 67 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations In November 2012, we entered into agreements with (i) Equity Residential and its operating partnership, ERP Operating Partnership LP ("Equity Residential"), (ii) Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc., ("Lehman"), and (iii) Archstone Enterprise LP ("Archstone"), pursuant to which AvalonBay and Equity Residential will acquire, directly or indirectly, all of the assets and entities owned by and all of the liabilities of Archstone. Under the terms of the agreements, we will acquire approximately 40% of Archstone's assets and liabilities and Equity Residential will acquire approximately 60% of Archstone's assets and liabilities ("Archstone Acquisition"). The transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2013. As disclosed in November 2012, we expect to purchase the following as part of the Archstone Acquisition, which is subject to adjustment up until the transaction closes: 66 apartment communities that are expected to be consolidated for financial reporting purposes, containing 22,222 apartment homes, of which six communities are under construction and are expected to contain 1,666 apartment homes upon completion; Three parcels of land, which are expected to be wholly owned, and if developed as anticipated, are expected to contain a total of 968 apartment homes; Interests in joint ventures the assets of which consist primarily of real estate, for which our ownership percentage is expected to be up to 40%, and that are not expected to be consolidated for financial reporting purposes. The Company expects to provide the following consideration for the Archstone Acquisition: the issuance of 14,889,706 shares of its common stock to Lehman or its designees; cash payment of $669,000,000 to Lehman or its designees; the assumption of approximately $3,700,000,000 principal amount of consolidated indebtedness; the acquisition with Equity Residential of interests in entities that have preferred units outstanding that may be presented for redemption from time to time. The Company's 40% share of the liquidation value of and accrued dividends on these outstanding Archstone preferred units is approximately $132,200,000 at January 31, 2013; and the assumption with Equity Residential of all other liabilities, known or unknown, of Archstone, other than certain excluded liabilities. The Company will share in 40% of the cost of these liabilities. Equity Residential and we are jointly and severally liable for most obligations to Lehman related to the Archstone Acquisition. If we and Equity Residential fail to close the Archstone Acquisition by March 26, 2013, then Equity Residential and we could be liable for payment of a termination fee of $800,000,000. The closing of the transaction is also subject to customary closing conditions, which do not include our and Equity Residential's ability to obtain the necessary financing or lender consents for the transaction. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts and disclosures included in this Form 10-K do not include any impact from the anticipated closing of the Archstone Acquisition. 68 Table of Contents There have not been any other material changes outside of the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations during 2012. Scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of December 31, 2012 (dollars in thousands): Payments due by period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Debt Obligations $ 3,854,068 $ 336,848 $ 582,537 $ 544,816 $ 2,389,867 Interest on Debt Obligations 1,072,220 159,273 290,355 221,136 401,456 Capital Lease Obligations(1) 70,489 2,427 4,621 20,075 43,366 Operating Lease Obligations(1) 1,269,071 17,996 36,833 35,850 1,178,392 Asset Purchase Commitment(2) 669,000 669,000 Total $ 6,934,848 $ 1,185,544 $ 914,346 $ 821,877 $ 4,013,081 (1) Includes land leases expiring between October 2026 and March 2142. Amounts do not include any adjustment for purchase options available under the land leases. (2) Represents our obligation for cash payment pursuant to the expected Archstone Acquisition. We expect to pay additional non-cash considerations as described in this report. Inflation and Deflation Substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less. In an inflationary environment, this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Similarly, in a deflationary rent environment, we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter-term leases. Forward-Looking Statements This Form 10-K contains "forward-looking statements" as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify forward-looking statements by our use of the words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate," "assume," "project," "plan," "may," "shall," "will" and other similar expressions in this Form 10-K, that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters. These statements include, among other things, statements regarding our intent, belief or expectations with respect to: our potential development, redevelopment, acquisition or disposition of communities including completion of the expected Archstone Acquisition; the timing and cost of completion of apartment communities under construction, reconstruction, development or redevelopment; the timing of lease-up, occupancy and stabilization of apartment communities; the pursuit of land on which we are considering future development; the anticipated operating performance of our communities; cost, yield, revenue, NOI and earnings estimates; our declaration or payment of distributions; our joint venture and discretionary fund activities; 69 Table of Contents our policies regarding investments, indebtedness, acquisitions, dispositions, financings and other matters; our qualification as a REIT under the Code; the real estate markets in Northern and Southern California and markets in selected states in the Mid-Atlantic, New England, Metro New York/New Jersey and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States and in general; the availability of debt and equity financing; interest rates; general economic conditions including potential impacts from the current economic conditions; and trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations. We cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements; rather, these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed. In addition, these forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake a duty to update these forward-looking statements, and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report. You should not rely on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. These risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. In addition to the factors referred to below, you should carefully review the discussion under Item 1a., "Risk Factors," and the other disclosures elsewhere in this document for further discussion of additional risks and uncertainties associated with our business and these forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: we may fail to secure development opportunities due to an inability to reach agreements with third parties to obtain land at attractive prices or to obtain desired zoning and other local approvals; we may abandon or defer development opportunities for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions which make development less desirable, increases in costs of development, increases in the cost of capital or lack of capital availability, resulting in losses; construction costs of a community may exceed our original estimates; we may not complete construction and lease-up of communities under development or redevelopment on schedule, resulting in increased interest costs and construction costs and a decrease in our expected rental revenues; occupancy rates and market rents may be adversely affected by competition and local economic and market conditions which are beyond our control; financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all, and our cash flows from operations and access to cost effective capital may be insufficient for the development of our pipeline which could limit our pursuit of opportunities; 70 Table of Contents our cash flows may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, and we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness; we may be unsuccessful in our management of Fund I, Fund II or the REIT vehicles that are used with each respective Fund; and we may be unsuccessful in managing changes in our portfolio composition. In addition, any forward-looking statements or forecasts relating to the business, prospects, operating statistics or financial results that relate to or may be expected to result from the Archstone Acquisition are based on expectations, forecasts and assumptions that are inherently speculative and are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, many of which we cannot predict with accuracy and some of which we may not have anticipated. As a result, the actual operating statistics and financial results that relate to or may be expected to result from the Archstone Acquisition may differ materially from the Company's forecasts. Risks, uncertainties and other factors related to the Archstone Acquisition that might cause such differences include, among other things, the following: the Archstone Acquisition may not close at the time or on the terms that we currently expect; assumptions concerning the availability and/or terms of financing, including among other things obtaining lender consents to the assumption of indebtedness related to the Archstone Acquisition may not be realized; obtaining joint venture partner consents to the assumption of partnership interest related to the Archstone Acquisitions may not be realized; we may not be able to integrate the assets and operations acquired in the Archstone Acquisition in a manner consistent with our assumptions and/or we may fail to achieve expected efficiencies and synergies; we may encounter liabilities related to the Archstone Acquisition for which we may be responsible that were unknown to us at the time we agreed to the Archstone Acquisition or at the time of this report; and our assumptions concerning risks relating to our lack of control of joint ventures and our ability to successfully dispose of certain assets may not be realized. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 1, "Organization and Basis of Presentation" of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 71 Table of Contents Principles of Consolidation We may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets. We must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting. We determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements, applying the applicable accounting guidance. For investment interests that we do not consolidate, we evaluate the guidance to determine the accounting framework to apply. The application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment. Therefore, we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate. If we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method at December 31, 2012, our assets would have increased by $1,280,984,000 and our liabilities would have increased by $963,664,000. We would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed, including but not limited to the following reasons, none of which are currently expected to occur: For entities not considered to be variable interest entities, the nature of the entity changed such that it would be considered a variable interest entity and if we were considered the primary beneficiary. For entities in which we do not hold a controlling voting and/or variable interest, the contractual arrangement changed resulting in our investment interest being either a controlling voting and/or variable interest. We evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs. Cost Capitalization We capitalize costs during the development of assets beginning when we determine that development of a future asset is probable until the asset, or a portion of the asset, is delivered and is ready for its intended use. For redevelopment efforts, we capitalize costs either (i) in advance of taking homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun until the redevelopment is completed, or (ii) when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident. Rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial lease-up or post-redevelopment lease-up period are fully recognized as they accrue. During the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities. These costs include interest and related loan fees, property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs. Interest is capitalized for any project specific financing, as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects. Indirect project costs, which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts, are also capitalized. Capitalized indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities are comprised primarily of compensation related costs for associates dedicated to our development and redevelopment efforts and total $26,513,000, $23,984,000, and $21,475,000 for 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. The estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and, as such, we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate. 72 Table of Contents There may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity. If changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, there may be an increase in our operating expenses. For example, if in 2012 our development activities decreased by 10%, and there were no corresponding decrease in our indirect project costs, our operating expenses would have increased by $2,651,000. We capitalize pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of Development Rights. These costs include legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs. Future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors, including zoning and regulatory approval, rental market conditions, construction costs and availability of capital. Pre-development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are written off with a charge to expense. Due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community, and therefore should be capitalized, the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate. If we had determined that 10% of our capitalized pursuit costs were associated with Development Rights that were no longer probable of occurring, net income for the year ended December 31, 2012 would have decreased by $2,467,000. Abandoned Pursuit Costs & Asset Impairment We evaluate our real estate and other long-lived assets for impairment when potential indicators of impairment exist. Such assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the property to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. Based on periodic tests of recoverability of long-lived assets, for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, we did not record any impairment losses for wholly-owned operating real estate assets. We expensed costs related to abandoned pursuits, which includes the abandonment of Development Rights and disposition pursuits, in the amounts of $1,757,000 in 2012, $1,957,000 in 2011 and $2,741,000 in 2010. These costs are included in operating expenses, excluding property taxes on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Income. Abandoned pursuit costs can vary greatly, and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years. We also assess land held for development for impairment if our intent changes with respect to the development of the land. We did not recognize any impairment charges for land holdings in 2012 or 2010. During 2011, we concluded that we would pursue the sale of two land parcels and, as a result, that the carrying bases of the two land parcels were not fully recoverable. As a result, we recognized an aggregate charge of $12,097,000 for the impairment of these land parcels. We had previously recognized an impairment loss of $9,952,000 in 2008 when we determined that we no longer intended to pursue development of the assets. Our change in intent to pursue disposition of these assets rather than holding for investment triggered the determination that a further impairment of the basis for the land parcels existed. We looked to a combination of internal models and third-party pricing estimates to determine the fair values for these impaired land parcels. Considering our knowledge of multifamily residential development, the fair values of parcels zoned for multifamily development were generated using an internal model. Land parcels zoned for other purposes were valued using third-party estimates 73 Table of Contents of fair value. For the internally generated fair values, we used a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows for a multifamily rental community. The cash flow analysis incorporated assumptions that market participants would make, including applying discount factors to the estimated future cash flows of the underlying asset, as well as potential disposition proceeds. The third-party values incorporated the use of estimated rates of return, investment time horizons and sales prices for land parcels considered to be market comparables, adjusted for known differences in critical areas including the existing entitlements (such as zoning and state of infrastructure readiness). Both valuation methods included significant other unobservable inputs and are therefore classified as Level 3 prices in the fair value hierarchy. We also evaluate our unconsolidated investments for impairment, considering both the carrying value of the investment, estimated to be the expected proceeds that it would receive if the entity were dissolved and the net assets were liquidated, as well as our proportionate share of any impairment of assets held by unconsolidated investments. During 2011, we concluded that because the market for for-sale housing development had not improved as expected, the investment in an unconsolidated joint venture was impaired and that impairment was other than temporary. As a result, we recognized a charge of $1,955,000 for the impairment of the investment in the unconsolidated joint venture. There were no impairment losses recognized by any of our investments in unconsolidated entities during 2012 or 2010. Our focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate and/or capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development. We cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed, or the likelihood of any future impairment charges, if any.

We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code for the year ended December 31, 1994 and have not revoked such election. A corporate REIT is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income if we distribute 100% of our taxable income to our stockholders over time periods allowed under the Code. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at regular corporate rates (subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to elect to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. For example, if we failed to qualify as a REIT in 2012, our net income would have decreased by approximately $170,400,000. Our qualification as a REIT requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment. Therefore, we believe our REIT status is a critical accounting estimate. Acquisition of Investments in Real Estate We account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with the authoritative guidance for the initial measurement, which requires the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to be recognized at fair value. Typical assets and liabilities acquired include land, building, furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-below market leases and in-place leases. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize various sources, including our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. 74 Table of Contents
