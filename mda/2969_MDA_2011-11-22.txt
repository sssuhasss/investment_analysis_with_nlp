All comparisons in the discussion are to the corresponding prior year unless otherwise stated. All amounts presented are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), except as noted. All amounts are presented in millions of dollars, except for share data, unless otherwise indicated. Captions such as income from continuing operations attributable to Air Products, net income attributable to Air Products, and diluted earnings per share attributable to Air Products are simply referred to as income from continuing operations, net income, and diluted earnings per share throughout this Management Discussion and Analysis, unless otherwise stated. The discussion of results that follows includes comparisons to non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures exclude the net loss on Airgas transaction in 2011 and 2010. For 2009, the non-GAAP measures exclude the global cost reduction plan charge, costs related to customer bankruptcy and asset actions, and third quarter 2009 pension settlement costs. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures that our management uses internally to evaluate our baseline performance on a comparable basis. The reconciliation of reported GAAP results to non-GAAP measures is presented on pages 27-28. BUSINESS OVERVIEW Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and its subsidiaries serves energy, electronics, chemicals, steel, and manufacturing customers globally with a unique portfolio of products, services, and solutions that include atmospheric gases, process and specialty gases, performance materials, equipment, and services. Geographically diverse, with operations in over 40 countries, we have sales of $10.1 billion, assets of $14.3 billion, and a worldwide workforce of approximately 18,900 employees. We organize our operations into four reportable business segments: Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases, Electronics and Performance Materials, and Equipment and Energy. 2011 IN SUMMARY In 2011, we had strong increases in sales and earnings in the first half of the year with a slowing in the second half due to product supply and cost issues and declining economic growth. In the first two quarters of 2011, underlying sales increased 11% and 12%, respectively due to strong volume growth. In the third and fourth quarters of 2011, our underlying sales increased 7% and 6%, respectively. Overall for 2011, sales increased 12%, principally due to volume increases of 9%. Volumes increased in the Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage Gases segments. Also, we achieved significant growth in Asia in the Merchant Gases segment. Operating income increased due primarily to improved performance in the Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage Gases segments. Operating margin increased modestly from last year, as operating leverage was partially offset by a number of product supply and cost issues in the last nine months of the year. 18 Table of Contents We withdrew our tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Airgas, terminated the associated credit facility, and sold previously purchased Airgas stock. Highlights for 2011 Sales of $10,082.0 increased 12%, or $1,056.0, driven by strong volume increases across the Electronics and Performance Materials, Tonnage Gases and Merchant Gases segments. Operating income of $1,622.2 increased 17%, or $233.2. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,670.7 increased 13%, or $185.7, primarily due to improved performance in the Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage Gases segments. Income from continuing operations of $1,215.3 increased 18%, or $186.2, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $5.59 increased 18%, or $.85. On a non-GAAP basis, income from continuing operations of $1,246.9 increased 14%, or $157.7, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $5.73 increased 14%, or $.71. A summary table of changes in diluted earnings per share is presented below. Capital spending of $1,408.3 increased 24%. On a non-GAAP basis, capital spending of $1,581.8 increased 22%, primarily for the construction of new plants under contract with customers. Operating cash flow increased 15%, a significant improvement from last year. We purchased 7.4 million of our outstanding shares at a cost of $649.2, which completed our prior $1,000 share repurchase program. On 15 September 2011, the Board of Directors authorized a new $1,000 share repurchase program. We increased our quarterly dividend from $.49 to $.58 per share. This represents the 29th consecutive year that we have increased our dividend payment. For a discussion of the challenges, risks, and opportunities on which management is focused, refer to our 2012 Outlook discussions provided on page 20 in the Management Discussion and Analysis that follows.

Management believes global economic growth in the regions we operate in could range from 2% 5% in 2012. We expect that the U.S. will have positive growth between 1% 5%. Europe should range between a negative 2% to a positive 1%. We believe Asia will continue as the strongest region, growing at 4% 9%. Regardless of global economic conditions, we expect new plant onstreams to increase earnings in 2012. Loading existing assets would also benefit earnings, however, this factor will be most influenced by the economy. We also expect earnings improvement from our productivity efforts and cost controls in discretionary spending, new programs, and staffing. These gains will be partially offset by higher pension expense next year, as a result of a decline in the discount rates and lower asset returns, lower Equipment and Energy results, and a higher tax rate in 2012. The 2012 tax rate is expected to be approximately 26% excluding the impact of the completion of the tax examination and any changes in uncertain tax positions related to the two Spanish tax matters, as described in Note 21, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements. Outlook by Segment In Merchant Gases, we expect volume growth in the U.S. from new applications and the expansion of Microbulk (small bulk) offerings. As we continue to expand our capacity in Asia, manufacturing growth along with new applications should lead to stronger volumes. In Europe, we will continue to seek higher pricing to offset higher energy costs and will also take actions to reduce operating costs. Tonnage Gases is expected to benefit from the full-year loading of our 2011 new plant start-ups, along with several investments due to come onstream in 2012. In Electronics, we expect the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half, primarily due to new plant start-ups and increased demand. The electronics equipment business is expected to slow in 2012 due to a forecasted decline in electronics industry capital spending. For Performance Materials, we anticipate typical seasonality in the first quarter and that volumes will remain soft in the first half of the year. However, if economic conditions improve as expected in the second half of the year, volume growth should return, as we benefit from our low cost production facilities and new product, market and application successes. Equipment and Energy results are expected to decline due to lower LNG activity. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Discussion of Consolidated Results 2011 2010 2009 Sales $10,082.0 $9,026.0 $8,256.2 Operating income GAAP Basis 1,622.2 1,389.0 846.3 Operating income Non-GAAP Basis 1,670.7 1,485.0 1,184.6 Operating margin GAAP Basis 16.1 % 15.4 % 10.3 % Operating margin Non-GAAP Basis 16.6 % 16.5 % 14.3 % Equity affiliates income 154.3 126.9 112.2 Sales % Change from Prior Year 2011 2010 Underlying business Volume 9 % 9 % Price 1 % (1 )% Currency 2 % 1 % Total Consolidated Sales Change 12 % 9 % 2011 vs. 2010 Sales of $10,082.0 increased 12%, or $1,056.0. Underlying business increased 10%, with volumes up 9% and price up 1%. Volumes grew primarily from strong performance in the Electronics and Performance Materials segment, new investments and contracts in the Tonnage Gases segment, and growth in Asia in the Merchant Gases segment. Currency favorably impacted sales 2%. 20 Table of Contents 2010 vs. 2009 Sales of $9,026.0 increased 9%, or $769.8. Underlying business increased 8%, driven by volume increases in the Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage Gases segments, as the economic environment improved. These results were driven by a significant recovery in the Electronics and Performance Materials segment and new investments and contracts in the Tonnage Gases segment. Operating Income 2011 vs. 2010 Operating income of $1,622.2 increased 17%, or $233.2. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,670.7 increased 13%, or $185.7. Underlying business increased $161, primarily from higher volumes in all segments, partially offset by lower recovery of raw material costs in pricing and higher operating costs. Favorable currency translation and foreign exchange impacts increased operating income by $25. On a GAAP basis, operating income in the current year includes a $48.5 net loss related to the Airgas transaction. The prior year included a $96.0 net loss related to the Airgas transaction. 2010 vs. 2009 Operating income of $1,389.0 increased 64%, or $542.7. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,485.0 increased 25%, or $300.4. Underlying business increased $275, primarily from higher volumes in the Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage Gases segments and lower costs, partially offset by reduced pricing. Favorable currency translation and foreign exchange impacts increased operating income by $25. Equity Affiliates Income 2011 vs. 2010 Income from equity affiliates of $154.3 increased $27.4, or 22%. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes and price, and favorable currency and foreign exchange. 2010 vs. 2009 Income from equity affiliates of $126.9 increased $14.7, or 13%, primarily due to higher volumes. Selling and Administrative Expense (S&A) 2011 vs. 2010 S&A expense of $1,014.4 increased $57.5, or 6%, primarily due to unfavorable currency, inflation, and higher pension expense. S&A as a percent of sales decreased to 10.1% from 10.6%. 2010 vs. 2009 S&A expense of $956.9 increased $13.5, or 1%, primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs, partially offset by improved productivity and the impact of the global cost reduction plan. S&A as a percent of sales decreased to 10.6% from 11.4%. Research and Development (R&D) 2011 vs. 2010 R&D expense of $118.8 increased 4%, or $4.1, primarily due to increased spending in the Energy business. R&D as a percent of sales decreased to 1.2% from 1.3%. 2010 vs. 2009 R&D expense of $114.7 decreased 1%, or $1.6, primarily due to the impact of cost reduction actions. R&D as a percent of sales decreased to 1.3% from 1.4%. Global Cost Reduction Plan The 2009 results from continuing operations included a total charge of $298.2 ($200.3 after-tax, or $.94 per share) for the global cost reduction plan. In the first quarter of 2009, we announced the global cost reduction plan, designed to lower our cost structure and better align our businesses to reflect rapidly declining economic conditions around the world. The 2009 first-quarter results included a charge of $174.2 ($116.1 after-tax, or $.55 per share). In the third quarter of 2009, due to the continuing slow economic recovery, we committed to additional actions associated with our global cost reduction plan that resulted in a charge of $124.0 ($84.2 after-tax, or $.39 per share). The total 2009 charge included $210.0 for severance and other benefits, including pension-related costs, associated with the elimination of approximately 2,550 positions from our global workforce. The remainder of this charge, $88.2, was for business exits and asset management actions. 21 Table of Contents During 2010, we revised our estimate of the costs associated with the 2009 global cost reduction plan. The unfavorable impact of additional severance and other benefits was primarily offset by favorable variances related to completed business exits and asset management actions. These adjustments to the charge were excluded from segment operating profit and did not have a material impact on any individual segment. As of 30 September 2011, the planned actions associated with the global cost reduction plan were completed. Refer to Note 5, Global Cost Reduction Plan, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on this charge. Net Loss on Airgas Transaction As discussed in Note 3, Airgas Transaction, to the consolidated financial statements, we withdrew our tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding stock of Airgas on 15 February 2011. In connection with the tender offer, we had secured committed financing in the form of a $6.7 billion term loan credit facility. This credit facility was also terminated. Prior to the tender offer, we purchased approximately 1.5 million shares of Airgas stock for a total cost of $69.6. This amount was recorded as an available-for-sale investment within other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheet. On 16 February 2011, we sold the 1.5 million shares of Airgas stock for total proceeds of $94.7 and recognized a gain of $25.1 ($15.9 after-tax, or $.07 per share). For the year ended 30 September 2011, $48.5 ($31.6 after-tax, or $.14 per share) in net loss was recognized related to this transaction. This amount is reflected separately on the consolidated income statement as Net loss on Airgas transaction and includes amortization of the fees related to the term loan credit facility, the gain on the sale of Airgas stock, and other acquisition-related costs. For the year ended 30 September 2010, $96.0 ($60.1 after-tax, or $.28 per share) in expense was recognized in relation to this transaction. Refer to Note 3, Airgas Transaction, to the consolidated financial statements. Customer Bankruptcy and Asset Actions On 6 January 2009, one of our customers, who principally receives product from the Tonnage Gases segment, began operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. As a result, we recognized a $22.2 ($13.9 after- tax, or $.07 per share) charge, primarily for the write-off of certain receivables during the third quarter of 2009. Sales and operating income associated with this customer are not material to the Tonnage Gases segment results. In April 2010, the customer emerged from bankruptcy proceedings. We received a final settlement in the amount of $22.4, of which $16.0 was applied against the remaining outstanding receivables. Income of $6.4 ($4.0 after-tax, or $.02 per share) was recognized for the recovery of certain receivables that had been previously written off. This amount was recorded as a gain and is reflected within customer bankruptcy on the consolidated income statement. In the third quarter of 2009, we recorded a charge of $9.9 ($7.1 after-tax, or $.03 per share) for other asset actions which consisted of the closure of certain manufacturing facilities. This charge was reflected in cost of sales on the consolidated income statement. The 2009 customer bankruptcy charge combined with this asset write-down resulted in a total charge of $32.1 ($21.0 after-tax, or $.10 per share). Pension Settlement Our U.S. supplemental pension plan provides for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of retirement, or for corporate officers, six months after the participant retirement date. We recognize pension settlements when payments exceed the sum of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost of the plan for the fiscal year. A settlement loss is recognized when the pension obligation is settled. We recognized $11.5 and $10.7 of settlement charges in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Refer to Note 15, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Other Income, Net Items recorded to other income arise from transactions and events not directly related to our principal income earning activities. The detail of other income is presented in Note 22, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements. 2011 vs. 2010 Other income of $37.2 decreased $1.5, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange, offset mainly by reimbursements from government grants for expenses. Otherwise, no individual items were significant in comparison to the prior year. 22 Table of Contents 2010 vs. 2009 Other income of $38.7 increased $15.7, primarily due to a net gain on the sale of assets and favorable foreign exchange. Otherwise, no individual items were significant in comparison to the prior year. Interest Expense 2011 2010 2009 Interest incurred $138.2 $136.2 $143.8 Less: Capitalized interest 22.7 14.3 21.9 Interest Expense $115.5 $121.9 $121.9 2011 vs. 2010 Interest incurred increased $2.0. The increase was driven by the impact of a weaker dollar on the translation of foreign currency interest, partially offset by a lower average debt balance. The change in capitalized interest is driven by an increase in project spending which qualified for capitalization. 2010 vs. 2009 Interest incurred decreased $7.6. The decrease was driven by lower average interest rates on variable rate debt, partially offset by a higher average debt balance and the impact of a weaker dollar on the translation of foreign currency interest. The change in capitalized interest is driven by a decrease in project spending which qualified for capitalization. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes. Refer to Note 21, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for details on factors affecting the effective tax rate. 2011 vs. 2010 On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 24.6% and 24.4% in 2011 and 2010, respectively. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 24.9% and 25.2% in 2011 and 2010, respectively. 2010 vs. 2009 On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 24.4% and 22.1% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 25.2% and 25.3% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Discontinued Operations In July 2008, the Board of Directors authorized management to pursue the sale of the U.S. Healthcare business. The U.S. Healthcare business was accounted for as a discontinued operation with its results of operations removed from the results of continuing operations. In the first half of 2009, based on additional facts, we recorded an impairment charge of $48.7 ($30.9 after-tax, or $.15 per share), reflecting a revision in the estimated net realizable value of the business. Also, tax benefits of $25.5, or $.12 per share, were recorded to revise the estimated tax benefit associated with the total impairment charges recorded. During the third quarter of 2009, we sold more than half of our remaining U.S. Healthcare business for cash proceeds of $38.1. We recognized an after-tax gain of $.3 resulting from the sales combined with adjustments to net realizable value of the remaining businesses. During the fourth quarter of 2009, through a series of transactions, we sold our remaining U.S. Healthcare business for cash proceeds of $12.1. A net after-tax loss of $.7 was recognized. These transactions completed the disposal of the U.S. Healthcare business. The U.S. Healthcare business generated sales of $125.2 and a loss from operations, net of tax, of $3.4 in 2009. Refer to Note 6, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. During the third quarter of 2011, a tax benefit of $8.9, or $.04 per share, was recognized related to the U.S. Healthcare business resulting from the completion of an audit of tax years 2007 and 2008 by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Refer to Note 21, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the audit settlement. 23 Table of Contents Net Income 2011 vs. 2010 Net income was $1,224.2 compared to $1,029.1, and diluted earnings per share was $5.63 compared to $4.74. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $1,255.8 compared to $1,089.2, and diluted earnings per share was $5.77 compared to $5.02. 2010 vs. 2009 Net income was $1,029.1 compared to $631.3, and diluted earnings per share was $4.74 compared to $2.96. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $1,089.2 compared to $857.6, and diluted earnings per share was $5.02 compared to $4.02.

Sales increased 2% from favorable currency effects, due to a weaker U.S. dollar against key European and Asian currencies in the first half of the year. Underlying business increased 1% as volume increases, primarily in Asia, were partially offset by a decrease in pricing due to liquid hydrogen natural gas cost pass-through and unfavorable customer mix. 24 Table of Contents In the U.S./Canada, sales were flat, as volume increases were offset by lower pricing and unfavorable customer mix. In Europe, sales were flat as favorable currency impacts were offset by lower pricing and unfavorable customer mix. In Asia, sales increased 20%, with volumes up 16% and a favorable currency impact of 4%. Volume increases were driven by steel, electronics and bulk hydrogen customers. Merchant Gases Operating Income Operating income of $729.4 increased 10%, or $68.2. The increase was primarily due to lower costs of $50, higher volumes of $32 and favorable currency of $8, partially offset by lower pricing and unfavorable customer mix of $22. The improved costs resulted from improved plant operating costs, distribution efficiency, and organizational restructuring benefits. Merchant Gases Equity Affiliates Income Merchant Gases equity affiliates income of $104.3 increased 6%, or $6.0. The increase was a result of higher volumes.

The reduced costs were a result of restructuring and productivity initiatives. Equipment and Energy 2011 2010 2009 Sales $400.6 $472.2 $489.8 Operating income 62.8 67.3 42.2 2011 vs. 2010 Sales of $400.6 decreased 15%, or $71.6, reflecting lower air separation unit (ASU) activity. Operating income of $62.8 decreased 7%, or $4.5, primarily due to a gain on the sale of an asset in the prior year and higher energy development spending, partially offset by higher LNG sales. The sales backlog for the Equipment business at 30 September 2011 was $334, compared to $274 at 30 September 2010. It is expected that approximately $200 of the backlog will be completed during 2012. 2010 vs. 2009 Sales of $472.2 decreased 4%, or $17.6, due to lower air separation unit (ASU) sales. Operating income of $67.3 increased 59%, due to higher LNG heat exchanger activity, a gain on the sale of an asset, and lower project costs. The sales backlog for the Equipment business at 30 September 2010 was $274, compared to $239 at 30 September 2009. Other Other operating income (loss) primarily includes other expense and income that cannot be directly associated with the business segments, including foreign exchange gains and losses. Also included are LIFO inventory adjustments, as the business segments use FIFO and the LIFO pool adjustments are not allocated to the business segments. Corporate general and administrative costs and research and development costs are fully allocated to the business segments. 26 Table of Contents 2011 vs. 2010 Operating loss was $16.1 compared to $2.6, primarily due to an increase in the LIFO pool adjustment as a result of significant increases in inventory values and unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by gains on asset sales. 2010 vs. 2009 Operating loss was $2.6 compared to $17.3, primarily due to favorable foreign exchange in 2010. No other individual items were significant in comparison to the prior year. RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The presentation of non-GAAP measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures which our management uses internally to evaluate our baseline performance on a comparable basis. Presented below are reconciliations of the reported GAAP results to the non-GAAP measures.

We retained consistent access to commercial paper markets throughout the year. Our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table: 2011 2010 2009 Cash provided by (used for) Operating activities $1,753.2 $1,522.4 $1,329.4 Investing activities (1,212.2 ) (1,056.5 ) (1,040.4 ) Financing activities (484.5 ) (579.7 ) 95.0 Operating Activities 2011 vs. 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $230.8, or 15%. The increase resulted from higher net income of $195.1 combined with the favorable impact of changes in working capital of $238.1, partially offset by unfavorable adjustments to income to reconcile to cash provided by operating activities of $202.4. Changes in working capital increased cash provided by $238.1 and primarily included: A $261.2 positive cash flow variance from payables and accrued liabilities, primarily due to lower pension contributions in the current year of $165.6 and payments related to the global cost reduction program of $103.0 in the prior year. A $39.0 positive cash flow variance from trade receivables as the current year reflected a negative cash flow of $103.5 while the prior year reflected a negative cash flow of $142.5. Faster collections of receivables in the current year partially offset the increase in sales. A $62.1 net negative cash flow variance in several other working capital accounts, primarily from changes in other receivables and accrued income taxes. 28 Table of Contents Adjustments to income to reconcile to cash provided by operating activities include depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, deferred taxes, certain acquisition-related costs and share-based compensation cost. These adjustments also include changes in operating assets, such as noncurrent capital lease receivables and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt or disbursement of cash and their recognition in earnings. Unfavorable adjustments to income to reconcile to cash provided by operating activities in 2011 primarily included the following: An increase in noncurrent capital lease receivables of $186.9, primarily related to a new large contract in China that is accounted for as a capital lease. Higher payments of Airgas acquisition-related costs of $144.2 as payments in the current year were $156.2 compared to $12.0 in the prior year. These unfavorable adjustments were partially offset by an increase in deferred income taxes of $89.5 due to tax benefits related to a U.S. audit settlement, the Airgas transaction, and bonus depreciation. 2010 vs. 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $193.0, or 15%. The increase resulted from higher net income of $397.8 combined with the favorable impact of adjustments to income to reconcile to cash provided by operating activities of $191.2, partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital of $396.0. Favorable adjustments to income to reconcile to cash provided by operating activities in 2010 primarily included the following: An increase in deferred income taxes of $148.5 due to pension funding and the utilization of foreign tax credits. Expense of $84.0 for the amortization of financing costs associated with the Airgas tender offer. A decrease in noncurrent capital lease receivables of $101.1. These favorable adjustments were partially offset by the impact of 2009 impairment charges of $118.7 related to the global cost reduction plan and the discontinued U.S. Healthcare business. Changes in working capital increased cash used by $396.0 and included: A $301.5 negative cash flow variance due to higher trade receivables. The current year reflected a negative cash flow of $142.5 caused by rising sales, while the prior year reflected a positive cash flow of $159.0 resulting from a significant drop in sales. A $94.6 negative cash flow variance from inventories and contracts in progress primarily due to increased spending for inventory and projects to support higher business activity. Investing Activities 2011 vs. 2010 Cash used for investing increased $155.7, primarily due to: Capital expenditures for plant and equipment increased by $320.8. Investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates increased by $41.0, primarily due to an additional investment in an Asian equity affiliate. A positive cash flow variance of $164.3 resulted from the current year proceeds of $94.7 received from the sale of approximately 1.5 million Airgas shares and the prior year purchase of these shares for $69.6. A positive cash flow variance of $29.2 resulted from higher proceeds from the sale of assets and investments. 2010 vs. 2009 Cash used for investing increased $16.1, primarily due to: Capital expenditures for plant and equipment decreased by $148.2, consistent with our capital spending plan. We purchased approximately 1.5 million shares of Airgas stock for $69.6. Changes in restricted cash, due to lower project spending, resulted in a reduced source of cash of $53.4. The proceeds from the issuance of certain Industrial Revenue Bonds must be held in escrow until related project spending occurs and are classified as noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The prior year included proceeds of $51.0 from the sale of the U.S. Healthcare business. 29 Table of Contents Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures are detailed in the following table: 2011 2010 2009 Additions to plant and equipment $1,351.7 $1,030.9 $1,179.1 Acquisitions, less cash acquired 10.8 37.2 32.7 Short-term borrowings associated with SAGA acquisition (A) 60.9 Investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates 45.8 4.8 24.5 Capital Expenditures on a GAAP Basis $1,408.3 $1,133.8 $1,236.3 Capital lease expenditures (B) 173.5 122.6 238.6 Noncurrent liability related to purchase of shares from noncontrolling interests (B) 42.0 Capital Expenditures on a Non-GAAP Basis $1,581.8 $1,298.4 $1,474.9 (A) Noncash transaction. (B) We utilize a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases and purchases of noncontrolling interests. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, the purchase of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction and will be reflected as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows. The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure which our management uses internally to evaluate and manage our expenditures. Capital expenditures on a GAAP basis in 2011 totaled $1,408.3, compared to $1,133.8 in 2010, resulting in an increase of $274.5. Additions to plant and equipment were largely in support of the Merchant Gases and Tonnage Gases businesses during both 2011 and 2010. Additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine, ongoing nature, including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements. Capital expenditures on a non-GAAP basis in 2011 totaled $1,581.8, compared to $1,298.4 in 2010. Capital lease expenditures of $173.5 increased by $50.9, reflecting higher project spending. 2012 Outlook Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures for new plant and equipment in 2012 on a GAAP basis are expected to be between $1,600 and $1,800, and on a non-GAAP basis are expected to be between $1,900 and $2,200. The non-GAAP capital expenditures include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases which are expected to be between $300 and $400. The majority of spending is expected in the Tonnage Gases segment, with approximately $1,000 associated with new plants and pipelines. It is anticipated that capital expenditures will be funded principally with cash from continuing operations. In addition, we intend to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and investments in equity affiliates. In September 2011, we entered into an agreement to acquire 25% of the outstanding shares of Abdullah Hashim Industrial Gases & Equipment Co. Ltd. (AHG). The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and customary local closing conditions. The closing date is expected to occur in early 2012. AHG is a company of the privately-owned Abdullah Hashim Group, based in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. AHG is the largest private industrial gases company in Saudi Arabia. It is comprised of three businesses, including industrial gases, equipment and consumables and refrigerants. The transaction will be recorded as an investment in net assets of and advances to equity affiliates in the Merchant Gases segment with the purchase price included in capital expenditures in the period it closes. Financing Activities 2011 vs. 2010 Cash used by financing activities decreased $95.2, primarily due to: An increase in the net cash provided by commercial paper and short-term borrowings of $308.9, driven primarily by $338.4 of proceeds from commercial paper. A decrease in payments on long-term debt of $249.3. Payments in the prior year primarily included a 250 million Eurobond ($306.8) and a $50.0 Medium-term note. Payments in 2011 primarily included $156.0 Medium-term notes. 30 Table of Contents An increase in long-term debt proceeds of $183.6, due primarily to the issuance of a $350.0 senior fixed-rate 2.0% note in the current year. The prior year primarily included proceeds of $85.0 from the issuance of an Industrial Revenue Bond. The above three items, all of which decreased cash used by financing activities, were largely offset by an increase in cash used of $649.2 due to the purchase of treasury stock in 2011. 2010 vs. 2009 Cash used by financing activities increased $674.7, primarily due to: A decrease in long-term proceeds of $384.3. The prior year included proceeds of $400.0 from the issuance of a fixed-rate 4.375% 10-year senior note. An increase in payments on long-term debt of $353.5, resulting primarily from the repayment of a 250 million Eurobond ($306.8). Financing and Capital Structure Capital needs in 2011 were satisfied primarily with cash from operations. At the end of 2011, total debt outstanding was $4,562.2 compared to $4,128.3 and Cash and cash items were $422.5 compared to $374.3. Total debt at 30 September 2011 and 2010, expressed as a percentage of the sum of total debt and total equity, was 43.4% and 42.0%, respectively. Long-term debt proceeds of $409.8 included $350.0 from the issuance of a senior fixed-rate 2.0% note. Additionally, on 3 November 2011, we issued a $400.0 senior fixed-rate 3.0% note that matures 3 November 2021, the proceeds of which will be used for general corporate purposes. Refer to Note 14, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. We have obtained the commitment of a number of commercial banks to lend money at market rates whenever needed. Effective 31 March 2011, we increased our total multicurrency revolving facility, maturing in July 2013, by $170.0, to a total of $2,170.0. Effective 30 June 2011, this $2,170.0 facility was amended to extend the maturity date from 8 July 2013 to 30 June 2015, reduce facility fees to reflect current market rates and modify the financial covenant. Our only financial covenant changed from a maximum ratio of total debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of no greater than 3.0 to a ratio of long-term debt to equity of no greater than 60%. There were no other material changes to the terms and conditions of the arrangement. This credit facility provides a source of liquidity and is used to support the issuance of commercial paper. No borrowings were outstanding under this commitment at 30 September 2011. Additional commitments totaling $474.2 are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $419.1 was borrowed and outstanding at 30 September 2011. We are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements. In 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of our outstanding common stock. We repurchase shares pursuant to Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, through repurchase agreements established with several brokers. During fiscal year 2011, we purchased 7.4 million of our outstanding shares at a cost of $649.2, which completed our 2007 $1,000 share repurchase program. On 15 September 2011, the Board of Directors authorized a new $1,000 share repurchase program. At 30 September 2011, $1,000 in share repurchase authorization remains. 2012 Outlook Cash flow from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. We project a modest need to access the long-term debt markets in 2012, primarily driven by debt maturities. We expect that we will continue to be in compliance with all of our financial covenants. Also, we anticipate that we will continue to be able to access the commercial paper and other short-term debt markets. Dividends On 17 March 2011, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend from $.49 per share to $.58 per share. Dividends are declared by the Board of Directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter. 31 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We are obligated to make future payments under various contracts, such as debt agreements, lease agreements, unconditional purchase obligations, and other long-term obligations. The following table summarizes our obligations as of 30 September 2011: Payments Due By Period Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Long-term debt obligations Debt maturities $4,000 $474 $334 $476 $479 $402 $1,835 Contractual interest 516 114 98 77 62 52 113 Capital leases 9 3 2 1 1 1 1 Operating leases 220 53 44 35 29 24 35 Pension obligations 942 40 75 197 199 86 345 Unconditional purchase obligations 1,675 649 121 119 117 122 547 Other liabilities 51 51 Total Contractual Obligations $7,413 $1,384 $674 $905 $887 $687 $2,876 Long-Term Debt Obligations The long-term debt obligations include the maturity payments of long-term debt, including current portion, and the related contractual interest obligations. Refer to Note 14, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on long-term debt. Contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on the long-term debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt, which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest. We had $1,229 of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 September 2011, excluding fixed-rate debt that has been swapped to variable-rate debt. The rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 September 2011. Variable interest rates are primarily determined by interbank offer rates and by U.S. short-term tax-exempt interest rates. Leases Refer to Note 11, Leases, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases. Pension Obligations The amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by us that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities. The 2012 amount represents the low end of an estimated range of $40 to $60. Refer to Note 15, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements. These payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment. The total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates, plan demographics, actual return on plan assets, continuation or modification of benefits, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions. Unconditional Purchase Obligations Most of our long-term unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous HyCO (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas) facilities. The price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas. However, long-term take-or-pay sales contracts to HyCO customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply. Due to the matching of most long-term feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts, we do not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. The unconditional purchase obligations also include other product supply and purchase commitments and electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations, which are primarily pass-through contracts with our customers. We also have one supply agreement that is not matched to a customer sales contract that has terms extending to ten years and the related commitment is at prices that are not in excess of current market prices. In addition, purchase commitments to spend approximately $510 for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2012. 32 Table of Contents We also purchase materials, energy, capital equipment, supplies, and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations. The majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy, which are obtained under requirements-type contracts at market prices. In total, we purchase approximately $7.4 billion annually, including the unconditional purchase obligations in the table above. Other Liabilities In June 2010, we entered into agreements obligating us to purchase 25% of the remaining shares of CryoService Limited (CSL). The agreements require the consideration, which is based on a multiple of earnings formula, to be remitted in December 2011. At 30 September 2011, the liability amounted to $51.0 and has been reported in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 19, Noncontrolling Interests, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Income Tax Liabilities Noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities as of 30 September 2011 were $570.1. Refer to Note 21, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2011 were $126.4. These tax liabilities were not included in the Contractual Obligations table, as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year. PENSION BENEFITS We and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover a substantial portion of our worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan were closed to new participants in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution plans. Over the long run, the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions. For 2011, the fair market value of pension plan assets for our defined benefit plans as of the measurement date increased to $2,823.7 from $2,711.6 in 2010. The projected benefit obligation for these plans as of the measurement date was $3,765.8 and $3,753.6 in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Refer to Note 15, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on our postretirement benefits. Pension Expense 2011 2010 2009 Pension expense $114.1 $109.0 $110.0 Special terminations, settlements, and curtailments (included above) 1.3 14.8 43.8 Weighted average discount rate 5.0 % 5.6 % 7.1 % Weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets 8.0 % 8.2 % 8.3 % Weighted average expected rate of compensation increase 4.0 % 4.1 % 4.3 % 2011 vs. 2010 The increase in pension expense, net of special items, was primarily attributable to the 60 bp decrease in the weighted average discount rate, resulting in higher amortization of actuarial losses. The increase was partially offset by a higher expected return on plan assets resulting from large contributions in 2011. Expense in 2011 included $1.3 of special termination and settlement charges. 2010 vs. 2009 The increase in pension expense, net of special items, was primarily attributable to the 150 bp decrease in the weighted average discount rate, resulting in higher amortization of actuarial losses. The increase was partially offset by a higher expected return on plan assets resulting from large contributions. Expense in 2010 included $14.8 of special termination and settlement charges, of which $2.8 was related to the global cost reduction plan. 2012 Outlook Pension expense is estimated to be approximately $120 to $125 in 2012, an increase of $7 to $12 from 2011, net of special terminations and settlements. In 2012, pension expense will include approximately $91 for amortization of actuarial losses compared to $94.8 in 2011. Net actuarial losses of $127.7 were incurred in 2011, resulting primarily from actual asset returns below expected returns, partially offset by actuarial gains experienced by the international plans, as a result of an increase in discount rates. Actuarial gains/losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses. Future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets, different from expected returns, would impact the actuarial gains/losses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2012. 33 Table of Contents Pension Funding Pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans. With respect to funded plans, our funding policy is that contributions, combined with appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses. In addition, we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. We analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. During 2011 and 2010, our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $241.0 and $406.6, respectively. The majority of the cash contributions were voluntary. Cash contributions to defined benefit plans, including benefit payments for unfunded plans, are estimated to be approximately $40 to $60 in 2012. Actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors. Refer to the Contractual Obligations discussion on page 32 for a projection of future contributions. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs. From time to time, we are involved in proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the federal Superfund law), similar state laws, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation and possible cleanup. Our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. The amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled $34.0, $31.6, and $52.5 in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. These amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws, remedial activities, and activities undertaken to meet internal Company standards. Future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts. The 2009 amount included a charge of $16.0 for the Paulsboro site. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on this charge. Although precise amounts are difficult to determine, we estimate that in both 2011 and 2010, we spent approximately $6 and $6, respectively, on capital projects to control pollution. Capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately $6 and $6 in 2012 and 2013, respectively. We accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from $82 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of $96. The consolidated balance sheets at 30 September 2011 and 2010 included an accrual of $82.3 and $87.0, respectively. The accrual for the environmental obligations relating to the Pace, Florida; Piedmont, South Carolina; and the Paulsboro, New Jersey locations is included in these amounts. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities. Actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, we do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a materially adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year. Some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have, or are developing, regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). These include existing and expanding coverage under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme; mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in Alberta, Canada; and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on GHG emissions in Ontario, Canada and South Korea. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is regulating GHG emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities. At the U.S. state level, California cap and trade program rules have been officially adopted and our compliance obligation as a hydrogen producer is set to begin 1 January 2013. We believe we will be able to mitigate some of the costs through our contractual terms. 34 Table of Contents Increased public awareness and concern may result in more international, U.S. federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power, hydrogen production, and fluorinated gases production. We believe we will be able to mitigate some of the potential costs through our contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements in some of the jurisdictions where we operate prevents accurate prediction of the long-term impact on us. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions from our facilities could impact our growth by increasing our operating costs or reducing demand for certain of our products. Regulation of GHG may also produce new opportunities for us. We continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption, improve efficiency, and lower emissions. We are also developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from power and chemical plants before it reaches the atmosphere, enable cleaner transportation fuels, and facilitate alternate fuel source development. In addition, the potential demand for clean coal and our carbon capture solutions could increase demand for oxygen, one of our main products, and our proprietary technology for delivering low-cost oxygen. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. We are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity. We do not have any derivative instruments indexed to our own stock. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Our principal related parties are equity affiliates operating primarily in the industrial gas business. We did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated at arm length with clearly independent parties. INFLATION The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and do not fully reflect the impact of prior years inflation. While some inflationary pressures developed during the second half of fiscal year 2011, inflation in the U.S. has been modest for several years. In addition, we operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates, with inflationary pressures that differ from those in the U.S. The ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations. It is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost. Accordingly, depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies. Judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas. However, application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management significant judgments, often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. Our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee. Depreciable Lives of Plant and Equipment Net plant and equipment at 30 September 2011 totaled $7,412.0, and depreciation expense totaled $851.0 during 2011. Plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life. Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us, which may be less than its physical life. Assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material availability, and geographic location. The estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially in light of changed business circumstances. For example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products, or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. In these cases, we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. 35 Table of Contents We have numerous long-term customer supply contracts, particularly in the gases on-site business within the Tonnage Gases segment. These contracts principally have initial contract terms of 15 to 20 years. There are also long-term customer supply contracts associated with the tonnage gases business within the Electronics and Performance Materials segment. These contracts principally have initial terms of 10 to 15 years. Additionally, we have several customer supply contracts within the Energy and Equipment segment with contract terms that are primarily 5 to 10 years. The depreciable lives of assets within this segment can be extended to 20 years for certain re-deployable assets. Depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term contracts are matched to the contract lives. Extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. As contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term, as long as it does not exceed the economic life of the asset. The depreciable lives of production facilities within the Merchant Gases segment are principally 15 years. Customer contracts associated with products produced at these types of facilities typically have a much shorter term. The depreciable lives of production facilities within the Electronics and Performance Materials segment, where there is not an associated long-term supply agreement, range from 10 to 15 years. These depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances, potential obsolescence, competitors actions, etc. Management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change. A change in the depreciable life by one year for production facilities within the Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments for which there is not an associated long-term customer supply agreement would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below: Decrease Life By 1 Year Increase Life By 1 Year Merchant Gases $27 $(18 ) Electronics and Performance Materials $20 $(14 ) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Plant and Equipment Plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition, a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping, or changes in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets. There were no such events or changes in circumstances that occurred during the reporting periods. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset group is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset group fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows. Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management best estimates at the time of the impairment review. Factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, inflation, etc. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. We use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges. Goodwill The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations currently requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of an acquired entity. Goodwill, including goodwill associated with equity affiliates of $62.6, was $955.0 as of 30 September 2011. The majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Disclosures related to goodwill are included in Note 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements. 36 Table of Contents We perform an impairment test annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. In addition, goodwill would be tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicated that potential impairment exists. The impairment test requires that we compare the fair value of business reporting units to carrying value, including assigned goodwill. We have designated our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing as one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly. Currently, we have four business segments and fifteen reporting units. Reporting units are primarily based on products and geographic locations within each business segment. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we conducted the required annual test of goodwill for impairment. We determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value, and therefore there were no indications of impairment. We primarily use an income approach valuation model, representing the present value of future cash flows, to determine fair value of a reporting unit. Our valuation model uses a five-year growth period for the business and an estimated exit trading multiple. Management has determined the income approach valuation model represents the most appropriate valuation methodology due to the capital intensive nature of the business, long-term contractual nature of the business, relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units, and limited comparables within the industry. The principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rate, operating profit margins, discount rate, and exit multiple. Revenue growth rate and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and long-term financial planning process. The discount rate assumption is calculated based upon an estimated weighted-average cost of capital which includes factors such as the risk-free rate of return, cost of debt, and expected equity premiums. The exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions. Also, the expected cash flows consider the customer attrition rate assumption, which is based on historical experience and current and future expected market conditions. Management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates. Intangible Assets Intangible assets at 30 September 2011 totaled $260.7 and consisted primarily of customer relationships as well as purchased patents and technology. We have no intangible assets with indefinite lives. Intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long-lived asset grouping impairment tests. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. See impairment discussion above under Plant and Equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined. Equity Investments Investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled $1,011.6 at 30 September 2011. The majority of our investments are non-publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business. Summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in Note 8, Summarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. In the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs, and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, an impairment loss would be recognized. Management estimate of fair value of an investment is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee. Changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using the enacted tax rate. At 30 September 2011, accrued income taxes and net deferred tax liabilities amounted to $65.5 and $347.7, respectively. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2011 were $126.4, excluding interest and penalties. Income tax expense was $408.4 for the year ended 30 September 2011. Disclosures related to income taxes are included in Note 21, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements. Management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts. Judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets. 37 Table of Contents Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. We believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for the probable outcome of these assessments. Deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. However, when there are not sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards, these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. The effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the current period tax expense. A 1% point increase/decrease in our effective tax rate would have decreased/increased net income by approximately $17. Pension Benefits The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension benefits under the defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. The discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans. Actuarial models are used in calculating the pension expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans. These models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern. Several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans. We determine assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase. Note 15, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted-average basis for both the domestic and international plans. The actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. We believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable. However, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover. One of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate. This rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the benefit obligations on the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. The rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date. The timing and amount of expected benefit cash flows are matched against the returns of high-quality corporate bonds over the expected benefit payment period to determine an overall effective discount rate. This rate will change from year-to-year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the discount rate decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $27 per year. The expected rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. The expected return on plan assets assumption is based on a weighted average of estimated long-term returns of major asset classes and the historical performance of plan assets. In determining asset class returns, we take into account historical long-term returns, and the value of active management, as well as the interest rate environment. Asset allocation is determined based on long-term return, volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes, the profiles of the plans liabilities and acceptable levels of risk. Lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $15 per year. We use a market-related valuation method for recognizing investment gains or losses. Investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets. This method recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur, which reduces year-to-year volatility. Expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets over the five-year period. 38 Table of Contents The expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption. We determine this rate based on review of the underlying long-term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience, as well as comparison to peer companies. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the expected rate of compensation increases/decreases pension expense by approximately $13 per year. Loss Contingencies In the normal course of business we encounter contingencies, i.e., situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on us. We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. Contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters for which our accounting policy is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and particulars are provided in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required in both determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated. These determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies. Revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted. For example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, or our proportionate share is increased. Similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded.
