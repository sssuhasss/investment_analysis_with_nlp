Business Overview We provide high performance network security solutions, which enable broad, integrated and high performance protection against dynamic security threats while simplifying the IT security infrastructure for enterprises, service providers and governmental entities worldwide. Since inception through December 31, 2013 , we had shipped over 1,400,000 appliances via more than 20,000 channel partners to more than 184,000 end-customers worldwide, including a majority of the 2013 Fortune Global 100. Our core DCFW/UTM/NGFW product line of FortiGate physical and virtual appliances ships with a set of security and networking capabilities, including firewall, VPN, application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, Web filtering, 32 Table of Contents vulnerability management, anti-spam, wireless controller, and WAN acceleration functionality. We derive a substantial majority of product sales from our FortiGate appliances, which range from the FortiGate-20, designed for small businesses, to the FortiGate-5000 series for large enterprises, telecommunications carriers, and service providers. Our DCFW/UTM/NGFW solution also includes our FortiGuard security subscription services, which end-customers can subscribe to in order to obtain access to dynamic updates to intrusion prevention, application control, antivirus, Web filtering, vulnerability management and anti-spam functionality included in our appliances. End-customers can also choose to purchase FortiCare technical support services for our products. End-customers also often use FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer products in conjunction with a FortiGate deployment to provide centralized management, analysis and reporting capabilities. We complement our core FortiGate product line with other appliances and software that offer additional protection from security threats to other critical areas of the enterprise, such as messaging, Web application firewalls, databases, protection against denial of service attacks (DDoS) and endpoint security for employee computers and mobile devices. Sales of these complementary products have grown in recent quarters, although these products still represent less than 10% of our total revenue. During fiscal 2013 , we expanded and enhanced our FortiGate DCFW/UTM/NGFW and FortiAP secure wireless access product lines. We also introduced software-based virtual appliances for many of our FortiGate and FortiManager product lines, which help secure the end-customer cloud-based network infrastructures with the same functionality as the traditional physical appliance in their respective product lines. In fiscal 2013, we completed certain acquisitions as part of our strategy to expand our product offerings, around load balancing solutions and add patents to our patent portfolio. Financial Highlights We recorded total revenue of $615.3 million in fiscal 2013 . This represents an increase of 15% in fiscal 2013 , compared to fiscal 2012 . Revenue in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 included $2.8 million and $3.7 million, respectively, from the sales of previously-acquired patents. Product revenue was $278.0 million , an increase of 12% in fiscal 2013 , compared to fiscal 2012 . Services revenue was $329.7 million in fiscal 2013 , an increase of 20% in fiscal 2013 , compared to fiscal 2012 . Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $843.0 million as of December 31, 2013 , an increase of $103.5 million from December 31, 2012 . Deferred revenue was $432.6 million as of December 31, 2013 , an increase of $69.4 million from December 31, 2012 . We generated cash flows from operating activities of $147.4 million in fiscal 2013 , a decrease of 20% compared to fiscal 2012 . In December 2013, our board of directors authorized a Share Repurchase Program ( the Program ), which authorizes us to repurchase up to $200.0 million of our outstanding common stock. In fiscal 2013, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of common stock under the Program in open market transactions for an aggregate purchase price of $38.9 million. We continue to invest in research and development to strengthen our technology leadership position. We believe that continued product innovation has strengthened our technology advantage and resulted in market share gains, as evidenced by the recent introduction of several noteworthy new FortiGate appliance models, including new FortiGate entry-level appliances, such as the FG-60D and FG-90D with its WIFI counterparts and FG-100D; the FG-200D and FG-800C mid-range appliance; and the FG-3600C and FG-5001C for large enterprises and service providers. During fiscal 2013 , we also made a significant investment in sales and marketing to increase brand awareness and grow our global sales force and distribution channels to expand our global presence both geographically and by industry segment. As a result, we experienced increased deal volumes driven by traction in enterprise data center deployments and large enterprise deals, with particular strength in the retail, financial and telecommunication sectors. We remain focused on investing in our sales and research and development resources in order to expand our reach into new high-growth verticals and emerging markets, and meet increasing customer expectations about the quality and functionality of our products, as we continue to sell to large customers, such as enterprise and service providers. While we have experienced some success selling into certain vertical customer segments, such as service providers and enterprise, we have experienced less traction selling into other verticals such as the U.S. federal government and there can be no assurance we will be successful selling into certain vertical customer segments. 33 Table of Contents Sales of FortiGate products have generally been balanced across entry-level (FortiGate-20 to -100 series), mid-range (FortiGate-200 to -800 series) and high-end (FortiGate-1000 to -5000 series) models with each product category representing approximately one-third of FortiGate sales, with some degree of variability from year to year and between quarters over the three-year period ended December 31, 2013. The percentage of our FortiGate related billings from the entry-level category increased from 32% in fiscal 2012 to 38% in fiscal 2013, while the mid-range category decreased from 33% in fiscal 2012 to 29% in fiscal 2013 and the high-end category decreased from 35% to 34% . In fiscal 2013, operating expenses increased by 27% compared to fiscal 2012. The increase was primarily driven by our accelerated pace of hiring to support our growth as we continued to invest in expanding our sales coverage, developing new products and scaling our customer support organization to meet the needs of our growing customer base. This resulted in revenue per employee, defined as annual revenue divided by average headcount, of $286,000, down from $303,000 for fiscal 2012. Business Model Our sales strategy is based on a distribution model whereby we primarily sell our products and services directly to distributors who sell to resellers and service providers, who, in turn, sell to our end-customers. In certain cases, we sell directly to government-focused resellers, large service providers and major systems integrators, who have significant purchasing power and unique customer deployment requirements. Typically, FortiGuard security subscription services and FortiCare technical support services are purchased along with our physical and virtual appliances. We invoice at the time of our sale for the total price of the products and subscription and support services, and the invoice generally becomes payable within 30 to 90 days. We generally recognize product revenue up-front based on the allocated revenue value and defer revenue for the sale of new and renewal subscription and support services contracts. We recognize the related services revenue over the service period, which is typically one year from the date the end-customer registers for these services (the date on which the services can first be used by the customer), although it can be as long as five years. Sales of new and renewal services increase our deferred revenue balance, which contributes significantly to our positive cash flow from operations. Key Metrics We monitor the key financial metrics set forth below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. Our total deferred revenue increased by $69.4 million from $363.2 million as of December 31, 2012 to $432.6 million as of December 31, 2013 . Revenue recognized plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period less any deferred revenue balances acquired from business combinations is a useful metric that management identifies as billings. Billings for services drive deferred revenue, which is an important indicator of the health and visibility of our business, and has historically represented a majority of the revenue that we recognize in a typical quarter. We ended fiscal 2013 with $843.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments and have had positive cash flow from operations every fiscal year since 2005. We discuss revenue, gross margin, and the components of operating income and margin below under Components of Operating Results, and we discuss our cash, cash equivalents, and investments under Liquidity and Capital Resources. Deferred revenue and cash flow from operations are discussed immediately below the following table. 34 Table of Contents Fiscal Year or as of Fiscal Year End 2013 2012 2011 ($ amounts in 000 s) Revenue 615,297 533,639 433,576 Gross margin 71 % 72 % 74 % Operating income (1) 72,090 100,475 88,904 Operating margin 12 % 19 % 21 % Total deferred revenue 432,628 363,185 294,833 Increase in total deferred revenue 69,443 68,352 42,202 Cash, cash equivalents and investments 843,045 739,586 538,687 Cash provided by operating activities 147,384 183,866 132,842 Free cash flow (2) 133,507 161,783 135,218 ___________________ (1) Includes: Stock-based compensation expense 44,471 30,690 19,015 Amortization expense of certain intangible assets 1,551 826 394 Impairment charges related to certain intangible assets 469 Patent settlement income 1,912 1,912 1,911 (2) Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Deferred revenue. Our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of the unamortized portion of services revenue from subscription and support service contracts. We monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods. We define billings as revenue recognized during a period plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period less any deferred revenue balances acquired from business combinations. The following table reflects the calculation of billings as discussed in the paragraph above. For a discussion of the limitations of non-GAAP financial measures, see Other Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. Fiscal Year 2013 2012 2011 ($ amounts in 000 s) Billings: Revenue 615,297 533,639 433,576 Increase in deferred revenue 69,443 68,352 42,202 Less deferred revenue balance acquired in business combination (550 ) Total billings (Non-GAAP) 684,190 601,991 475,778 Cash flow from operations and free cash flow. We monitor cash flow from operations as a measure of our overall business performance. Our cash flow from operations is driven in large part by payments for both new and renewal contracts for subscription and support services. Monitoring cash flow from operations and free cash flow enables us to analyze our financial performance excluding the non-cash effects of certain items such as depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expenses, thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business. Free cash flow, an alternative non-GAAP financial measure of liquidity, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. For a discussion of the limitations of non-GAAP financial measures, see Other Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. 35 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2013 2012 2011 ($ amounts in 000 s) Free Cash Flow: Net cash provided by operating activities 147,384 183,866 132,842 Less purchases of property and equipment (13,877 ) (22,083 ) (3,624 ) Free cash flow (Non-GAAP) 133,507 161,783 129,218 Other Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), we consider certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including billings and free cash flow discussed above as well as non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, and non-GAAP net income. These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating our ongoing operational performance and enhancing an overall understanding of our past financial performance, as they help illustrate underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude in these non-GAAP financial measures. Furthermore, we use many of these measures to establish budgets and operational goals for managing our business and evaluating our performance. We also believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our recurring core business operating results over multiple periods with other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures versus the nearest GAAP equivalent of these financial measures. First, these non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain recurring, non-cash charges such as stock-based compensation expense, amortization expense and impairment charges related to certain intangible assets, offset by patent settlement income. Prior period amounts have been adjusted to conform to current period presentation. Stock-based compensation expense has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in our business and is an important part of our employees overall compensation. Second, the expenses that we exclude in our calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the expenses, if any, that our peer companies may exclude when they report their results of operations. We compensate for these limitations by providing the nearest GAAP equivalents of these non-GAAP financial measures and describing these GAAP equivalents in the section entitled Results of Operations below. Non-GAAP gross margin is gross margin as reported on our consolidated statements of operations, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization expense and impairment charges related to certain intangible assets, all of which are non-cash charges. Non-GAAP operating income is operating income, as reported on our consolidated statements of operations, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization expense and impairment charges related to certain intangible assets, and the income we received from a patent settlement. Non-GAAP operating margin is non-GAAP operating income divided by revenue.

(3) Provision for income taxes is our GAAP tax provision that is added back to GAAP net income to reconcile to non-GAAP income before provision for income taxes. (4) We used non-GAAP effective tax rates of 33%, 34%, and 33%, which could differ from the GAAP tax rates, to calculate non-GAAP net income for fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. Components of Operating Results Revenue We derive our revenue from sales of our products and subscription and support services. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Our total revenue is comprised of the following: Product revenue . Product revenue is generated from sales of our appliances. The substantial majority of our product revenue has been generated by our FortiGate line of appliances, and we do not expect this to change in the foreseeable future. Product revenue also includes revenue derived from sales of FortiManager, FortiAnalyzer, FortiSwitch, FortiMail, FortiDB, FortiWeb, FortiAP, FortiScan, FortiCarrier, FortiBalancer, FortiCache, FortiVoice, FortiBridge, FortiDDoS, FortiDNS, FortiSandbox, FortiADC, and FortiAuthenticator appliances, and our FortiClient and virtual domain, or VDOM, software. For arrangements which include end-customer acceptance criteria, revenue is recognized upon acceptance. We recognize product revenue on sales to distributors that have no general right of return and direct sales to end-customers upon shipment, once all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Certain distributors that stock our products are granted stock rotation rights, limited rights of return, as well as rebates for sales of our products. The arrangement fee for this group of distributors is not fixed and determinable when products are shipped and revenue is therefore deferred and recognized upon sell-through. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our product revenue may vary from quarter-to-quarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors discussed below under Quarterly Results of Operations but generally may remain at relatively comparable levels or decline modestly over time, as services revenue becomes a larger portion of our business as our customers renew existing services contracts and we expand our customer base. 39 Table of Contents Services revenue . Services revenue is generated primarily from FortiCare technical support services for software updates, maintenance releases and patches, Internet access to technical content, telephone and Internet access to technical support personnel and hardware support, and FortiGuard security subscription services related to application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, Web filtering, anti-spam and vulnerability management updates. We recognize revenue from subscription and support services over the service performance period. Our typical contractual support and subscription term is one year from the date of registration, although we do offer multi-year support and subscription contracts. We also generate a small portion of our revenue from professional services and training services, and we recognize this revenue as the services are provided. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our services revenue to remain at comparable levels or increase as our customers renew existing service contracts and we expand our customer base. Our services revenue growth rate depends significantly on the growth of our customer base and the renewal of service contracts by our current customers. Ratable and other revenue . Ratable and other revenue is generated from sales of our products and services in cases where the fair value of the services being provided cannot be separated from the value of the entire sale. In these cases, the value of the entire sale is deferred and recognized ratably over the service performance period. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Revenue Recognition. In fiscal 2013 and 2012 , this category included a $2.8 million and $3.7 million sale of previously-acquired patents, respectively. In fiscal 2013 and 2012 , ratable and other revenue represented 1% and 2% of total revenue, respectively. Over time, excluding the impact of any patent sales, we expect this category to continue to decline due to the current revenue recognition rules, which allow us to use best estimate of selling price ( BESP ) in our allocation of arrangement consideration when vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) is not available. Our total cost of revenue is comprised of the following: Cost of product revenue . A substantial majority of the cost of product revenue consists of third-party manufacturing costs. Our cost of product revenue also includes product testing costs, write-offs for excess and obsolete inventory, royalty payments, amortization and any impairment of applicable acquired intangible assets, warranty costs, shipping and allocated facilities costs, stock-based compensation expense, and personnel costs associated with logistics and quality control. Personnel costs include stock-based compensation and cash-based personnel costs such as salaries, benefits and bonuses. Cost of services revenue . Cost of services revenue is primarily comprised of cash-based personnel costs associated with our FortiGuard Labs team and our technical support, professional services and training teams, as well as depreciation, supplies, data center, data communications, facility-related costs and stock-based compensation expense. We expect our cost of services revenue will increase slightly as a percentage of revenue as we continue to invest in subscription and support services to meet the needs of our growing customer base and service levels expected by our enterprise customers. Cost of ratable and other revenue . Cost of ratable and other revenue is comprised primarily of deferred product costs and services-related costs. Gross profit . Gross profit as a percentage of revenue, or gross margin, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the average sales price of our products, any excess inventory write-offs, product costs, the mix of products sold and the mix of revenue between products and services. We believe our overall gross margin for the near term will remain at levels comparable or slightly lower to that achieved in fiscal 2013 . Services revenue has historically increased as a percentage of total revenue since inception, and this trend has had a positive effect on our total gross margin given the higher services gross margins compared to product gross margins. During fiscal 2013 service margins decreased slightly from fiscal 2012 as we made the decision to invest in support services infrastructure that will allow us to both expand our base of enterprise customers and to support future growth and higher service levels to our existing enterprise customers. Operating expenses . Our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of cash-based personnel costs such as salaries, benefits, bonuses, and sales commissions. They also include non-cash charges, specifically, stock-based compensation expense. We expect personnel costs to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we hire new employees. 40 Table of Contents Research and development . Research and development expense consists primarily of cash-based personnel costs. Additional research and development expenses include ASIC and system prototypes and certification-related expenses, depreciation of capital equipment, facility-related expenses and stock-based compensation expenses. The majority of our research and development is focused on both software development and the ongoing development of our hardware platform. We record all research and development expenses as incurred, except for capital equipment which is depreciated over time. Our development teams are primarily located in Canada, China, and the United States. Sales and marketing . Sales and marketing expense is the largest component of our operating expenses and primarily consists of cash-based personnel costs including salary, benefits and commissions. Additional sales and marketing expenses include stock-based compensation expense, promotional and other marketing expenses, travel, depreciation of capital equipment and facility-related expenses. We intend to hire additional personnel focused on sales and marketing and expand our sales and marketing efforts worldwide in order to increase our presence in new geographic markets and enterprise verticals, add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base. General and administrative . General and administrative expense consists of cash-based personnel costs as well as professional fees, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation of capital equipment and software, and facility-related expenses. General and administrative personnel include our executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations. Our professional fees principally consist of outside legal, auditing, accounting, information technology and other consulting costs. Interest income. Interest income consists of income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investments. We have historically invested our cash in money market funds, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, municipal bonds, certificates of deposit and term deposits, and U.S. government and agency debt securities. Other expense, net . Other expense, net consists primarily of foreign exchange and related hedging gains and losses. Foreign exchange gains and losses relate to foreign currency exchange re-measurement. The hedging gains and losses are related to our settled balance sheet hedges. Provision for income taxes. We are subject to tax in the United States as well as other tax jurisdictions or countries in which we conduct business. Earnings from our non-U.S. activities are subject to income taxes in the local country which are generally lower than U.S. tax rates, and may be subject to U.S. income taxes. Our effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to foreign income subject to different tax rates than the U.S., research and development tax credits, withholding taxes, nondeductible stock-based compensation expense and adjustments related to our intercompany transfer pricing. The income tax provision for fiscal 2013 was comprised primarily of domestic income taxes, foreign income taxes and withholding taxes. Our effective tax rate approximates the U.S. federal statutory tax rates plus the impact of state taxes, research and development tax credits (when applicable), withholding tax, nondeductible stock-based compensation expense, foreign income subject to lower tax than the U.S., and adjustments related to intercompany transfer pricing. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue and expenses, cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates include those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation expense, valuation of inventory, warranty liabilities, goodwill and other long-lived assets and accounting for income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations. 41 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition We derive revenue from sales of products, including appliances and software, and services, including subscription, support and other services. The majority of our products are hardware appliances containing software components that function together to provide the essential functionality of the product. We record revenue from our hardware appliances in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. Our product revenue also includes software products that may operate on the hardware appliances, but are not considered essential to the functionality of the hardware and are subject to the industry-specific software revenue recognition guidance. Certain of our software, when sold with our appliances, is considered essential to the functionality of the appliances and, as a result, is accounted for as non-software deliverables. However, this same software, if sold separately, is accounted for under industry-specific software revenue recognition guidance. When a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, such as hardware appliances, software, customer support services, and/or professional services, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy. In multiple element arrangements where software is more-than-incidental, revenue is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy. When applying the relative selling price method, we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of selling price, if it exists, or third-party evidence ( TPE ) of selling price. If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exist for a deliverable, we use our best estimate of selling price ("BESP") for that deliverable. Revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met for each element. VSOE of fair value for elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those services when sold separately. In establishing VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range, generally evidenced by a substantial majority of such historical stand-alone transactions falling within a reasonably narrow range of the median rates. We are typically not able to determine TPE for our products or services. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately, which is generally unavailable. For our hardware appliances, we use BESP as our selling price. For our support and other services, we generally use VSOE as our selling price estimate. When we are unable to establish a selling price using VSOE for our support and other services, we use BESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. We determine BESP for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, cost of products, gross margin objectives, pricing practices, geographies, customer classes and distribution channels. We recognize revenue for our software sales based on industry-specific software revenue recognition guidance. Under industry-specific software revenue recognition guidance, we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a product agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered and VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements exists. If evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist, all revenue is generally deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established. When the undelivered element for which we do not have VSOE of fair value is support, revenue for the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the support period. Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met: Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. Binding contracts or purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement. Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered. Delivery occurs when we fulfill an order and title and risk of loss has been transferred. Services revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed, which is typically from one to three years. Professional service revenue is recognized upon delivery or completion of performance. Sales price is fixed or determinable. We assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. In the event payment terms differ from our standard business practices, the sales price is deemed to be not fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized when the payments become due, provided the remaining 42 Table of Contents criteria for revenue recognition have been met. In the event the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment, the sales price is deemed to be not fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized when the refund or adjustment privileges expire provided the remaining criteria for revenue recognition have been met. Collectibility is reasonably assured . We assess collectibility based primarily on creditworthiness as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as payment history. For arrangements which include end-customer acceptance criteria, revenue is recognized upon acceptance. We recognize product revenue on sales to distributors that have no general right of return and direct sales to end-customers upon shipment, once all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Certain distributors that stock our products are granted stock rotation rights, limited rights of return as well as rebates for sales of our products. The arrangement fee for this group of distributors is not fixed and determinable when products are shipped and revenue is therefore deferred and recognized upon sell-through. Substantially all of our products have been sold in combination with services, which consist of subscriptions and/or support. Subscription services provide access to our antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, and anti-spam functionality. Support services include rights to unspecified software upgrades, maintenance releases and patches, telephone and Internet access to technical support personnel, and hardware support. The subscription and support services start on the date the customer registers the appliance. The customer is then entitled to service for the stated contractual period beginning on the registration date. We offer certain sales incentives to channel partners. We reduce revenue for estimates of sales returns and allowances. Additionally, in limited circumstances we may permit end-customers, distributors and resellers to return our products, subject to varying limitations, for a refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase. We estimate and record reserves for sales incentives and sales returns based on historical experience. Stock-Based Compensation Expense Employees Stock Options. We estimate the fair value of employee stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton ( Black-Scholes ) pricing model. For all employee stock options, we recognize expense over the requisite service period using the straight-line method. Our option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, expected term, and forfeiture rate. Any changes in these highly subjective assumptions could significantly impact stock-based compensation expense. Employee Stock Purchase Plan. We estimate the fair value of the rights to acquire stock under our employee stock purchase plan ( ESPP ) using the Black-Scholes pricing model and is amortized over the requisite service period using the straight-line method. Our ESPP provides for consecutive six-month offering periods and we use our own historical volatility data in the valuation of ESPP shares. Restricted Stock Units. We account for the fair value of restricted stock units ( RSUs ) awarded to employees and members of our board of directors using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. RSUs are payable in shares of our common stock as the periodic vesting requirements are satisfied. RSUs generally vest over a four-year period if the employees, non-employees, or directors, as applicable, remain with us for the duration of the vesting period. For all RSUs, we recognize expense over the requisite service period using the straight-line method. Performance Stock Units. Performance Stock Units ( PSUs ) are RSUs that contain both service-based and market-based vesting conditions. PSUs vest over a specified service period upon the satisfaction of certain market-based vesting conditions, and settle into shares of our common stock upon vesting over a two- or three-year period. The fair value of a PSU is calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant and is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant modified to reflect the impact of the market-based vesting condition, including the estimated payout level based on that condition. We do not adjust compensation cost for subsequent changes in the expected outcome of the market-based vesting conditions. Valuation of Inventory Inventory is recorded at the lower of average cost or market, after we give appropriate consideration to obsolescence and inventory in excess of anticipated future demand. In assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventory, we are required to make estimates regarding future customer demand, the timing of new product introductions, economic trends and market conditions. If the actual product demand is significantly lower than forecasted, we could be required to record additional 43 Table of Contents inventory write-downs which would be charged to cost of product revenue. Any write-downs could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. Warranty Liabilities We generally provide a one-year warranty on hardware products and a 90-day warranty on software. A provision for estimated future costs related to warranty activities is charged to cost of product revenue based upon historical product failure rates and historical costs incurred in correcting product failures. If we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected, our gross margin could be adversely affected. Accounting for Income Taxes We record income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. We operate in various tax jurisdictions and are subject to audit by various tax authorities. We provide for tax contingencies whenever it is deemed more likely than not that a tax asset has been impaired or a tax liability has been incurred for events such as tax claims or changes in tax laws. Tax contingencies are based upon their technical merits, relevant tax law and the specific facts and circumstances as of each reporting period. Changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes to the amounts recorded for such tax contingencies. We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with GAAP, which defines the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements. The tax effects of a position are recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. In general, deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws, or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist. Any adjustment to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the income statement for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required. We make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our tax expense and liabilities could be materially impacted. 44 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods. The period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of financial results to be achieved in future periods.

The Americas region contributed the largest portion of our revenue growth on an absolute dollar basis and all three regions showed growth on a percentage basis. The growth in EMEA was slightly lower due to a slowdown in the macroeconomic environment in that area. Product revenue increased by $29.1 million , or 12% , compared to fiscal 2012 . The increase in product revenue was primarily driven by greater sales volume in our FortiGate product family due to increased demand across all product categories from our entry-level and mid-range products for smaller enterprises and branch deployments to our high-end products for large enterprise and service provider customers. Services revenue increased by $55.7 million , or 20% , in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to the recognition of revenue from our growing deferred revenue balance consisting of subscription and support contracts sold to a larger customer base. The decrease in ratable and other revenue of $3.1 million was primarily due to the 46 Table of Contents continuing decline in amortization of ratable revenue. Ratable and other revenue for fiscal 2013 included a $2.8 million sale of previously-acquired patents, as compared to a $3.7 million sale of previously-acquired patents in fiscal 2012.

Product gross margin decreased by 3.5 percentage points in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to a slightly higher mix of sales of entry-level products, particularly several high-volume distributed enterprise, retail and education deals sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. We also experienced the impact from higher costs related to warranty-related costs which increased by $2.5 million, freight costs which increased by $1.5 million, occupancy-related costs which increased by $1.1 million and higher excess inventory write-offs of $0.7 million. Services gross margin decreased by 0.9 percentage points during fiscal 2013 primarily due to our continued investments in our technical support organization to accommodate our expanding customer base and higher service level expectations from our enterprise customers. In addition, we experienced growth in our professional consulting services which have lower gross margins than our support and subscription businesses. Cost of services revenue increased by $13.4 million primarily due to a $9.9 million increase in cash-based personnel costs related to headcount increases, a $1.1 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, and a $2.4 million increase in depreciation and other expenses.

In addition, we incurred higher stock-based compensation expense of $4.0 million, product development expenses, such as third-party testing and prototypes, of $2.0 million, acquisition-related costs of $1.9 million, and depreciation and other expenses of $2.1 million. We intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization but expect research and development expense as a percentage of revenue to remain at comparable levels in fiscal 2014. 47 Table of Contents Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expense increased by $45.8 million , or 26% , in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 , primarily due to an increase of $25.6 million in cash-based personnel costs as we continued to increase our sales headcount in order to expand our global footprint. In addition, we incurred increases in stock-based compensation expense of $6.7 million, marketing-related expenses of $5.4 million, travel expenses of $3.9 million, depreciation expenses of $2.1 million, and other expenses of $2.1 million. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expenses increased as we accelerated the investment in our sales force during fiscal 2013 to support future growth. We intend to continue to make investments in our sales resources and infrastructure, which are critical to support sustainable growth and expect sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue to increase in fiscal 2014. General and administrative General and administrative expense increased by $9.4 million , or 37% , in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 . Cash-based personnel costs increased by $3.4 million and stock-based compensation expense increased by $1.8 million as we continued to increase our headcount in order to support our expanding business. In addition, we incurred an additional $3.9 million of legal and accounting fees and $0.3 million in higher depreciation. We expect general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue to remain at comparable levels in fiscal 2014.

The change in other expense, net, for fiscal 2013 when compared to fiscal 2012, was the result of higher foreign exchange losses. Provision for income taxes Fiscal Year Change % Change 2013 2012 ($ amounts in 000 s) Provision for income taxes 31,668 38,160 (6,492 ) (17 ) Effective tax rate (%) 42 36 6 Our effective tax rate was 42% for fiscal 2013 , compared with an effective tax rate of 36% for fiscal 2012 . The provision for income taxes for fiscal 2013 was comprised primarily of federal, state and foreign income taxes as well as the inclusion of stock option benefits and cost allocations, which affected the transfer pricing calculations among the U.S. and some of our foreign subsidiaries. The increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to an increase in profits subject to U.S. tax, a decrease in stock option benefits, and their corresponding impact on the transfer pricing calculations among the U.S. and some of our foreign subsidiaries During January 2013, the U.S. Federal Research and Development Tax Credit was reinstated retroactively to fiscal 2012. The U.S. Federal Research and Development Tax Credit benefit was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, which was the period of enactment. Beginning with fiscal 2013, we operate under a tax incentive agreement in Singapore, which is effective through December 31, 2023, and may be extended if certain additional requirements are satisfied. The tax incentive agreement is conditional upon our meeting certain employment and investment thresholds. We did not realize any tax savings from the Singapore tax incentives in fiscal 2013 because of net tax losses in that jurisdiction. 48 Table of Contents It is our policy to classify accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. As of December 31, 2013, we had accrued approximately $1.0 million for estimated interest related to uncertain tax provisions compared to an accrual of $1.5 million as of December 31, 2012. The State of California has been conducting an audit of our state income tax returns for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011. We do not expect this audit to have a significant detrimental effect on our income tax liability nor have a material impact on our results of operations. Within the next twelve months, we do not believe there will be a decrease in uncertain tax benefits that could impact our future effective tax rate.

The Americas region contributed the largest portion of our revenue growth on a percentage basis, while the EMEA and APAC regions both demonstrated growth of over 20%. Product revenue increased by $51.5 million, or 26%, compared to fiscal 2011. The increase in product revenue was primarily driven by greater sales volume in our FortiGate product family due to increased demand across all product categories from our entry-level and mid-range products for smaller enterprises and branch deployments to our high-end products for large enterprise and service provider customers. Services revenue increased by $53.8 million, or 24%, in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 due to the recognition of revenue from our growing deferred revenue balance consisting of subscription and support contracts sold to a larger customer base. The decrease in ratable and other revenue of $5.3 million was primarily due to the continuing decline in amortization of ratable revenue. Ratable and other revenue for fiscal 2012 included a $3.7 million sale of previously-acquired patents, which was an increase from a $2.6 million sale of previously-acquired patents in fiscal 2011. Excluding the decline in ratable and other revenue, product and services revenue combined together increased by 25% compared to fiscal 2011. 49 Table of Contents Cost of revenue and gross margin Fiscal Year Change % Change 2012 2011 ($ amounts in 000 s) Cost of revenue: Product 93,971 73,201 20,770 28 Services 50,682 35,486 15,196 43 Ratable and other revenue 2,767 4,911 (2,144 ) (44 ) Total cost of revenue 147,420 113,598 33,822 30 Gross margin (%): Product 62.3 62.9 (0.6 ) Services 81.5 83.9 (2.4 ) Ratable and other revenue 74.0 69.1 4.9 Total gross margin 72.4 73.8 (1.4 ) Total gross margin decreased by 1.4 percentage points in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011, as both product and services gross margins declined. Product gross margin decreased by 0.6 percentage points in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily related to a higher quantity of mid-range products purchased by a large retail customer with lower than average gross margins. We also experienced the impact from cost increases related to higher material costs incurred to support higher density storage requirements for our recent release of FortioOS 5.0, our next generation operating system. From time to time, we have experienced sales of previously reserved inventory. During fiscal 2012, we experienced a positive impact to gross margin of 0.2 percentage points due to the sale of fully reserved inventory compared to a positive impact to gross margin of 0.4 percentage points in the prior year. Services gross margin decreased by 2.4 percentage points during fiscal 2012 primarily due to our continued investments in our technical support organization to accommodate our expanding customer base and higher service level expectations from our enterprise customers. In addition, we experienced growth in our professional consulting services which have lower gross margins than our support and subscription businesses. Cost of services revenue increased by $15.2 million primarily due to an $8.6 million increase in cash-based personnel costs related to headcount increases, a $1.9 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, a $1.8 million increase in costs associated with extended support contracts, a $0.7 million increase in occupancy-related costs, a $0.5 million increase in professional services expenses, a $0.5 million increase in travel expenses, and a $1.1 million increase in depreciation and other expenses.

In addition, we incurred higher stock-based compensation expense of $4.5 million, product development expenses of $1.2 million, depreciation expense of $0.9 million, supplies expense of $0.6 million, occupancy-related costs of $0.4 million, and other expenses of $0.5 million. The increase in research and development expense was partially offset by a 2% year-over-year increase in the U.S. dollar exchange rate against the CAD, as a majority of our research and development personnel are located in Canada. 50 Table of Contents Sales and marketing expense Sales and marketing expense increased by $33.6 million, or 23%, in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to an increase of $21.6 million in cash-based personnel costs as we continued to increase our sales headcount in order to expand our global footprint. In addition, we incurred increases in stock-based compensation expense of $3.5 million, marketing-related expenses of $3.2 million, depreciation expenses of $1.6 million, occupancy-related costs of $0.7 million, travel expenses of $1.0 million, supplies expense of $0.4 million, and other expenses of $1.2 million. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expenses remained flat as we accelerated the investment in our sales force during the past year to support future growth. The increase in sales and marketing expense was partially offset by a 9% year-over-year increase in the U.S. dollar exchange rate against the Euro. General and administrative expense General and administrative expense increased by $3.5 million, or 16%, in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. Stock-based compensation expense increased by $1.6 million and cash-based personnel costs increased by $0.7 million. In addition, we incurred $1.0 million of litigation settlement expense. Interest income and other expense, net Fiscal Year Change % Change 2012 2011 ($ amounts in 000 s) Interest income 5,006 3,523 1,483 42 Other expense, net (485 ) (354 ) (131 ) 37 The $1.5 million increase in interest income in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to interest earned on higher invested balances of cash, cash equivalents and investments. The change in other expense, net, for fiscal 2012 when compared to fiscal 2011, was the result of higher foreign exchange losses. Provision for income taxes Fiscal Year Change % Change 2012 2011 ($ amounts in 000 s) Provision for income taxes 38,160 29,581 8,579 29 Effective tax rate (%) 36 32 4 Our effective tax rate was 36% for fiscal 2012, compared with an effective tax rate of 32% for fiscal 2011. The provision for income taxes for fiscal 2012 was comprised primarily of federal, state and foreign income taxes as well as the inclusion of stock option benefits, which affected the transfer pricing calculations between some of our foreign subsidiaries. The 2011 effective tax rate was impacted by the inclusion of stock option benefits, which affected the transfer pricing calculations between some of our foreign subsidiaries, as well as research and development tax credit. The increase in the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to an increase in profits subject to U.S. tax, a decrease in stock option benefits, and their corresponding impact on the transfer pricing calculations between some of our foreign subsidiaries, and the reduction in U.S. Federal Research and Development Tax Credit that was reinstated in fiscal 2013, but not recognized in fiscal 2012. 51 Table of Contents Quarterly Results of Operations The following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for the last eight fiscal quarters.

(5) During the three months ended December 31, 2012, we recorded a $1.5 million non-recurring cumulative out-of-period adjustment to reflect a true-up related to forfeitures of stock awards granted to employees. Of this amount, $0.9 million and $0.6 million were related to fiscal 2011 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2012, respectively. The adjustment resulted in lower stock-based compensation expense and higher operating income and net income during the three months ended December 31, 2012. Seasonality, Cyclicality and Quarterly Revenue Trends Our quarterly results reflect seasonality in the sale of our products, subscriptions and services. In general, a pattern of increased customer buying at year-end has positively impacted sales activity in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter we generally experience lower sequential billings and product revenues, which results in lower revenue. In the third quarter, we generally experience lower revenue in Europe compared to the second quarter due to reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer months, but this may not always be the case. Similarly, our operating income has been affected by these historical trends because operating expenses are relatively fixed in the near-term. Although these seasonal factors are common in the technology sector, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance. On a quarterly basis, we have usually generated the majority of our product revenue in the final month of each quarter and a significant amount in the last two weeks of a quarter. We believe this is due to customer buying patterns typical in this industry. Our total quarterly revenue over the past eight quarters has increased sequentially in each quarter except the first quarter of fiscal 2013 which was down due to the seasonality referenced above and macro-economic challenges experienced in Europe. Product revenue in all of the quarters of fiscal 2013 was higher as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2012 , which we believe was due in part to the investments made in our sales organization and continued product innovation. Total gross margin has fluctuated on a quarterly basis primarily due to shifts in the mix of sales between products and services. Product gross margins were lower in each quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to the same quarter of fiscal 2012 due to a higher mix of sales of entry-level products. Product gross margin varies based on the types of products sold and the average selling prices of our products. Services gross margins were lower in the first three quarters of fiscal 2013 compared to the same 53 Table of Contents periods of fiscal 2012 as we made investments in our support organizations at a rate slightly greater than the increase in services revenue. Liquidity and Capital Resources December 31 2013 2012 2011 ($ amounts in 000 s) Cash and cash equivalents 115,873 122,975 71,990 Investments 727,172 616,611 466,697 Total cash, cash equivalents and investments 843,045 739,586 538,687 Working capital 322,485 249,970 256,706 Fiscal Year 2013 2012 2011 ($ amounts in 000 s) Cash provided by operating activities 147,384 183,866 132,842 Cash used in investing activities (146,734 ) (182,711 ) (166,826 ) Cash (used in) provided by financing activities (6,423 ) 50,156 39,797 Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (1,329 ) (326 ) (682 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents (7,102 ) 50,985 5,131 Liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities, as well as acquisitions, capital expenditures and investments in strategic relationships that we have made or may make in the future. We expect to spend approximately $15.0 million related to the improvement of our new corporate headquarters in fiscal 2014. Additionally, our liquidity may be impacted, if we were to repurchase additional shares of our common stock under our Share Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2013, $161.1 million remains available for future share repurchases under this program, which will be financed through our available working capital. As of December 31, 2013 , our cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $843.0 million were held for working-capital purposes and were invested primarily in corporate debt securities, commercial paper, municipal bonds, certificates of deposit and term deposits, money market funds, and U.S. government and agency debt securities. It is our investment policy to invest excess cash in a manner that preserves capital, provides liquidity and maximizes return. As of December 31, 2013 , $88.9 million of our cash and investments was held by our international subsidiaries and is therefore not immediately available to fund domestic operations unless the cash is repatriated. While we do not intend to do so, should this amount be repatriated, it would be subject to U.S. federal income tax which would be partially offset by foreign tax credits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings, the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity and the continuing market acceptance of our products. Historically, we have required capital principally to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, share repurchases, and acquisition activities. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. 54 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2013 2012 2011 ($ amounts in 000 s) Net income 44,273 66,836 62,492 Adjustments for non-cash charges (1) 69,153 44,028 18,712 Net income before non-cash charges 113,426 110,864 81,204 Increase in deferred revenue 68,871 68,292 42,177 Increase in income taxes payable 22,522 28,265 35,964 Increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, net 12,139 1,262 8,566 Increase in accrued payroll and compensation 6,013 4,599 4,773 Decrease in other assets 1,243 2,470 227 Increase in inventory (35,093 ) (11,303 ) (6,034 ) Increase in accounts receivable net (22,080 ) (12,120 ) (23,246 ) Increase in deferred tax assets (18,750 ) (9,254 ) (7,874 ) (Increase) decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets (907 ) 791 (2,915 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 147,384 183,866 132,842 ____________________ (1) Non-cash charges consist of stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of investment premiums, an excess tax benefit from our employee stock option plans, and other non-cash items, net.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013 : Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 year 1 - 3 years 3 - 5 years More than 5 years ($ amounts in 000 s) Operating leases (1) 31,905 8,759 15,291 6,230 1,625 Purchase commitments (2) 37,794 37,794 Other contracts (3) 9,946 9,632 264 50 Total 79,645 56,185 15,555 6,280 1,625 56 Table of Contents ________________________ (1) Consists of contractual obligations from non-cancelable office space under operating leases. (2) Consists of minimum purchase commitments with independent contract manufacturers. (3) Consists of an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. Purchase obligations do not include contracts that may be cancelled without penalty. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. No tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions have been included in the table. As of December 31, 2013 , we had $30.2 million of long-term tax liabilities, including interest, related to uncertain tax positions. Because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the settlement of these liabilities, we are unable to estimate the years in which future cash outflows may occur. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
