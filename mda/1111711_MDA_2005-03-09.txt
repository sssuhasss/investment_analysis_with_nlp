ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40-year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write-down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEI wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17-G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSource decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02-03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02-03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSource interest in Mid-Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts.
