Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in combination with our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 herein. OVERVIEW Background We are a public utility holding company whose indirect wholly owned subsidiaries include: CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC (CenterPoint Houston), which engages in the electric transmission and distribution business in a 5,000-square mile area of the Texas Gulf Coast that includes Houston; and CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. (CERC Corp., and, together with its subsidiaries, CERC), which owns and operates natural gas distribution systems in six states. Subsidiaries of CERC Corp. own interstate natural gas pipelines and gas gathering systems and provide various ancillary services. A wholly owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. offers variable and fixed-price physical natural gas supplies primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities. Business Segments In this section, we discuss our results from continuing operations on a consolidated basis and individually for each of our business segments. We also discuss our liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies. We are first and foremost an energy delivery company and it is our intention to remain focused on this segment of the energy business. The results of our business operations are significantly impacted by weather, customer growth, cost management, rate proceedings before regulatory agencies and other actions of the various regulatory agencies to which we are subject. Our electric transmission and distribution services are subject to rate regulation and are reported in the Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment, as are impacts of generation-related stranded costs and other true-up balances recoverable by the regulated electric utility. Our natural gas distribution 35 Table of Contents services are also subject to rate regulation and are reported in the Natural Gas Distribution business segment. A summary of our reportable business segments as of December 31, 2007 is set forth below: Electric Transmission & Distribution Our electric transmission and distribution operations provide electric transmission and distribution services to retail electric providers (REPs) serving approximately 2.0 million metered customers in a 5,000-square-mile area of the Texas Gulf Coast that has a population of approximately 5.5 million people and includes Houston. On behalf of REPs, CenterPoint Houston delivers electricity from power plants to substations, from one substation to another and to retail electric customers in locations throughout the control area managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which serves as the regional reliability coordinating council for member electric power systems in Texas. ERCOT membership is open to consumer groups, investor and municipally owned electric utilities, rural electric cooperatives, independent generators, power marketers and REPs. The ERCOT market represents approximately 85% of the demand for power in Texas and is one of the nation largest power markets. Transmission and distribution services are provided under tariffs approved by the Texas Utility Commission. Natural Gas Distribution CERC owns and operates our regulated natural gas distribution business, which engages in intrastate natural gas sales to, and natural gas transportation for, approximately 3.2 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas. Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services CERC operations also include non-rate regulated retail and wholesale natural gas sales to, and transportation services for, commercial and industrial customers in the six states listed above as well as several other Midwestern and Eastern states. Interstate Pipelines CERC interstate pipelines business owns and operates approximately 8,100 miles of gas transmission lines primarily located in Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. This business also owns and operates six natural gas storage fields with a combined daily deliverability of approximately 1.2 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day and a combined working gas capacity of approximately 59.0 Bcf. Most storage operations are in north Louisiana and Oklahoma. This business has recently completed the first two phases of its Carthage to Perryville pipeline in 2007 adding over 1.2 Bcf per day, and is in the process of completing its third phase. In addition, construction has begun on the Southeast Supply Header (SESH) pipeline joint venture project. Field Services CERC field services business owns and operates approximately 3,500 miles of gathering pipelines and processing plants that collect, treat and process natural gas from approximately 151 separate systems located in major producing fields in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. Other Operations Our other operations business segment includes office buildings and other real estate used in our business operations and other corporate operations which support all of our business operations. 36 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Significant Events in 2007 and 2008 Debt Financing Transactions In December 2006, we called our 2.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (2.875% Convertible Notes) for redemption on January 22, 2007 at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The 2.875% Convertible Notes became immediately convertible at the option of the holders upon our call for redemption and were convertible through the close of business on the redemption date. Substantially all the $255 million aggregate principal amount of the 2.875% Convertible Notes were converted and the remaining amount was redeemed. The $255 million principal amount of the 2.875% Convertible Notes was settled in cash and the excess value due converting holders of $97 million was settled by delivering approximately 5.6 million shares of our common stock. In February 2007, we redeemed $103 million aggregate principal amount of 8.257% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures at 104.1285% of their aggregate principal amount and the related 8.257% capital securities issued by HL&P Capital Trust II were redeemed at 104.1285% of their $100 million aggregate liquidation value. In February 2007, we issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in February 2017 with an interest rate of 5.95%. The proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were used to repay debt incurred in satisfying our $255 million cash payment obligation in connection with the conversion and redemption of our 2.875% Convertible Notes as discussed above. In February 2007, CERC Corp. issued $150 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in February 2037 with an interest rate of 6.25%. The proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were used to repay advances for the purchase of receivables under CERC Corp. $375 million receivables facility. Such repayment provides increased liquidity and capital resources for CERC general corporate purposes. In June 2007, we, CenterPoint Houston and CERC Corp. entered into amended and restated bank credit facilities. Our amended credit facility is a $1.2 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The facility has a first drawn cost of London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 55 basis points based on our current credit ratings, versus the previous rate of LIBOR plus 60 basis points. The amended facility at CenterPoint Houston is a $300 million five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The facility first drawn cost remains at LIBOR plus 45 basis points based on CenterPoint Houston current credit ratings. The amended facility at CERC Corp. is a $950 million five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility versus a $550 million facility prior to the amendment. The facility first drawn cost remains at LIBOR plus 45 basis points based on CERC Corp. current credit ratings. In October 2007, CERC Corp. issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% senior notes due in November 2017 and $250 million aggregate principal amount of 6.625% senior notes due in November 2037. The proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment or refinancing of debt, including $300 million of CERC Corp. 6.5% senior notes due February 1, 2008, capital expenditures, working capital and loans to or investments in affiliates. Pending application of the proceeds for these purposes, CERC Corp. repaid borrowings under its revolving credit and receivables facilities. In October 2007, CERC amended its receivables facility and extended the termination date to October 28, 2008. The facility size will range from $150 million to $375 million during the period from October 2007 to the October 28, 2008 termination date. The variable size of the facility was designed to track the seasonal pattern of receivables in CERC natural gas businesses. In 2007, we issued 1.3 million shares of our common stock and paid cash of approximately $40 million upon conversion of approximately $40 million principal amount of our 3.75% convertible senior notes. Subsequent to December 31, 2007, we have issued 4.1 million shares of our common stock and paid cash of approximately $121 million upon conversion of approximately $123 million principal amount of our 3.75% convertible senior notes. A February 2008 conversion notice by a holder of $10 million principal amount of our 3.75% convertible 37 Table of Contents senior notes is expected to result in a March 2008 conversion and settlement with a cash payment for the principal amount and delivery of shares of our common stock for the excess value due the converting holder. Transition Bonds Pursuant to a financing order issued by the Texas Utility Commission in September 2007, in February 2008 a subsidiary of CenterPoint Houston issued approximately $488 million in transition bonds in two tranches with interest rates of 4.192% and 5.234% and final maturity dates in February 2020 and February 2023, respectively. Scheduled final payment dates are February 2017 and February 2020. Through issuance of the transition bonds, CenterPoint Houston securitized transition property of approximately $483 million representing the remaining balance of the competition transition charge (CTC) less an environmental refund as reduced by the fuel reconciliation settlement amount. Recovery of True-Up Balance In December 2007, the Texas Third Court of Appeals issued its decision in the appeal of the 2004 final order (True-Up Order) issued by the Texas Utility Commission to CenterPoint Houston. In its decision, the court of appeals: reversed the district court judgment to the extent it restored the capacity auction true-up amounts; reversed the district court judgment to the extent it upheld the Texas Utility Commission decision to allow CenterPoint Houston to recover excess mitigation credits (EMCs) paid to Reliant Energy, Inc. (RRI); ordered that the tax normalization issue be remanded to the Texas Utility Commission; and affirmed the district court judgment in all other respects. CenterPoint Houston and two other parties filed motions for rehearing with the court of appeals. In the event that the motions for rehearing are not resolved in a manner favorable to it, CenterPoint Houston intends to seek further review by the Texas Supreme Court. Although we and CenterPoint Houston believe that CenterPoint Houston true-up request is consistent with applicable statutes and regulations and accordingly that it is reasonably possible that it will be successful in its further appeals, we can provide no assurance as to the ultimate rulings by the courts on the issues to be considered in the various appeals or with respect to the ultimate decision by the Texas Utility Commission on the tax normalization issue. To reflect the impact of the True-Up Order, in 2004 and 2005 we recorded a net after-tax extraordinary loss of $947 million. No amounts related to the district court judgment or the decision of the court of appeals have been recorded in our consolidated financial statements. However, if the court of appeals decision is not reversed or modified as a result of the pending motions for rehearing or on further review by the Texas Supreme Court, we anticipate that we would be required to record an additional loss to reflect the court of appeals decision. The amount of that loss would depend on several factors, including ultimate resolution of the tax normalization issue and the calculation of interest on any amounts CenterPoint Houston ultimately is authorized to recover or is required to refund beyond the amounts recorded based on the True-up Order, but could range from $130 million to $350 million, plus interest subsequent to December 31, 2007. Interstate Pipeline Expansion Carthage to Perryville. In April 2007, CenterPoint Energy Gas Transmission (CEGT), a wholly owned subsidiary of CERC Corp., completed phase one construction of a 172-mile, 42-inch diameter pipeline and related compression facilities for the transportation of gas from Carthage, Texas to CEGT Perryville hub in northeast Louisiana. On May 1, 2007, CEGT began service under its firm transportation agreements with shippers of approximately 960 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day. CEGT second phase of the project, which involved adding compression that increased the total capacity of the pipeline to approximately 1.25 Bcf per day, was placed into service in August 2007. CEGT has signed firm contracts for the full capacity of phases one and two. In May 2007, CEGT received Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approval for the third phase of the project to expand capacity of the pipeline to 1.5 Bcf per day by adding additional compression and operating at 38 Table of Contents higher pressures, and in July 2007, CEGT received approval from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Administration (PHMSA) to increase the maximum allowable operating pressure. The PHMSA approval contained certain conditions and requirements, which CEGT expects to satisfy in the first quarter of 2008. CEGT has executed contracts for approximately 150 MMcf per day of the 250 MMcf per day phase three expansion. The third phase is projected to be in-service in the second quarter of 2008. SESH. In June 2006, CenterPoint Energy Southeast Pipelines Holding, L.L.C., a wholly owned subsidiary of CERC Corp., and a subsidiary of Spectra Energy Corp. (Spectra) formed a joint venture, SESH, to construct, own and operate a 270-mile pipeline with a capacity of approximately 1 Bcf per day that will extend from CEGT Perryville hub in northeast Louisiana to an interconnection in southern Alabama with Gulfstream Natural Gas System, which is 50% owned by an affiliate of Spectra. We account for our 50% interest in SESH as an equity investment. In 2006, SESH signed agreements with shippers for firm transportation services, which subscribed capacity of 945 million cubic feet per day. Additionally, SESH and Southern Natural Gas (SNG) have executed a definitive agreement that provides for SNG to jointly own the first 115 miles of the pipeline. Under the agreement, SNG will own an undivided interest in the portion of the pipeline from Perryville, Louisiana to an interconnect with SNG in Mississippi. The pipe diameter was increased from 36 inches to 42 inches, thereby increasing the initial capacity of 1 Bcf per day by 140 MMcf per day to accommodate SNG. SESH will own assets providing approximately 1 Bcf per day of capacity as initially planned and will maintain economic expansion opportunities in the future. SNG will own assets providing 140 MMcf per day of capacity, and the agreement provides for a future compression expansion that will increase the jointly owned capacity up to 500 MMcf per day, subject to FERC approval. An application to construct, own and operate the pipeline was filed with the FERC in December 2006. In September 2007, the FERC issued the certificate authorizing the construction of the pipeline. This FERC approval does not include the expansion capacity that would take SNG to 500 MMcf per day. SESH began construction in November 2007. SESH expects to complete construction of the pipeline as approved by the FERC in the second half of 2008. SESH net costs after SNG contribution are estimated to have increased to approximately $1 billion. CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE EARNINGS Our past earnings and results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future earnings and results of operations. The magnitude of our future earnings and results of our operations will depend on or be affected by numerous factors including: the resolution of the true-up components, including, in particular, the results of appeals to the courts regarding rulings obtained to date; state and federal legislative and regulatory actions or developments, including deregulation, re-regulation, environmental regulations, including regulations related to global climate change, and changes in or application of laws or regulations applicable to the various aspects of our business; timely and appropriate rate actions and increases, allowing recovery of costs and a reasonable return on investment; cost overruns on major capital projects that cannot be recouped in prices; industrial, commercial and residential growth in our service territory and changes in market demand and demographic patterns; the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices, particularly natural gas; the timing and extent of changes in the supply of natural gas; the timing and extent of changes in natural gas basis differentials; weather variations and other natural phenomena; changes in interest rates or rates of inflation; 39 Table of Contents commercial bank and financial market conditions, our access to capital, the cost of such capital, and the results of our financing and refinancing efforts, including availability of funds in the debt capital markets; actions by rating agencies; effectiveness of our risk management activities; inability of various counterparties to meet their obligations to us; non-payment for our services due to financial distress of our customers, including Reliant Energy, Inc. (RRI); the ability of RRI and its subsidiaries to satisfy their other obligations to us, including indemnity obligations, or in connection with the contractual arrangements pursuant to which we are their guarantor; the outcome of litigation brought by or against us; our ability to control costs; the investment performance of our employee benefit plans; our potential business strategies, including acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses, which we cannot assure will be completed or will have the anticipated benefits to us; acquisition and merger activities involving us or our competitors; and other factors we discuss under Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report and in other reports we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 40 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS All dollar amounts in the tables that follow are in millions, except for per share amounts. Year Ended December 31, 2005 2006 2007 Revenues $ 9,722 $ 9,319 $ 9,623 Expenses 8,783 8,274 8,438 Operating Income 939 1,045 1,185 Gain (Loss) on Time Warner Investment (44 ) 94 (114 ) Gain (Loss) on Indexed Debt Securities 49 (80 ) 111 Interest and Other Finance Charges (670 ) (470 ) (503 ) Interest on Transition Bonds (40 ) (130 ) (123 ) Distribution from AOL Time Warner Litigation Settlement 32 Additional Distribution to ZENS Holders (27 ) Return on True-Up Balance 121 Other Income, net 23 35 33 Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Extraordinary Item 378 494 594 Income Tax Expense (153 ) (62 ) (195 ) Income From Continuing Operations Before Extraordinary Item 225 432 399 Discontinued Operations, net of tax (3 ) Income Before Extraordinary Item 222 432 399 Extraordinary Item, net of tax 30 Net Income $ 252 $ 432 $ 399 Basic Earnings (Loss) Per Share: Income From Continuing Operations Before Extraordinary Item $ 0.72 $ 1.39 $ 1.25 Discontinued Operations, net of tax (0.01 ) Extraordinary Item, net of tax 0.10 Net Income $ 0.81 $ 1.39 $ 1.25 Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share: Income From Continuing Operations Before Extraordinary Item $ 0.67 $ 1.33 $ 1.17 Discontinued Operations, net of tax (0.01 ) Extraordinary Item, net of tax 0.09 Net Income $ 0.75 $ 1.33 $ 1.17 2007 Compared to 2006 Income from Continuing Operations. We reported income from continuing operations before extraordinary item of $399 million ($1.17 per diluted share) for 2007 as compared to $432 million ($1.33 per diluted share) for the same period in 2006. As discussed below, the decrease in income from continuing operations of $33 million was primarily due to a $33 million increase in interest expense, excluding transition bond-related interest expense, due to higher borrowing levels; a $133 million increase in income tax expense primarily as a result of the favorable tax settlement reached with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in 2006 related to our Zero Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes (ZENS) and Automatic Common Exchange Securities (ACES) and an $8 million decrease in operating income from our Electric Transmission & Distribution utility. 41 Table of Contents These decreases in income from continuing operations were partially offset by a $94 million increase in operating income from our Natural Gas Distribution business segment, a $56 million increase in operating income from our Interstate Pipelines business segment and a $10 million increase in operating income from our Field Services business segment. Segment changes are discussed in detail below. Income Tax Expense. In 2007, our effective tax rate of 32.8% was lower than the expected statutory tax rate as a result of the revised Texas Franchise Tax Law (Texas Margin Tax) and a Texas state tax examination for tax years 2002 through 2004. Our 2007 effective tax rate differed from the 2006 effective tax rate of 12.6% primarily due to the favorable tax settlement reached with the IRS in 2006 as discussed above. 2006 Compared to 2005 Income from Continuing Operations. We reported income from continuing operations before extraordinary item of $432 million ($1.33 per diluted share) for 2006 as compared to $225 million ($0.67 per diluted share) for the same period in 2005. As discussed below, the increase in income from continuing operations of $207 million was primarily due to a $200 million decrease in interest expense, excluding transition bond-related interest expense, due to lower borrowing costs and borrowing levels; a $91 million decrease in income tax expense primarily related to the tax settlement associated with ZENS and ACES; a $19 million increase in operating income from our Field Services business segment; a $17 million increase in operating income from our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment; and a $16 million increase in operating income from our Interstate Pipelines business segment. These increases in income from continuing operations were partially offset by a $121 million decrease in other income related to a reduction in the return on the true-up balance of our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment recorded in 2005 and a $51 million decrease in operating income from our Natural Gas Distribution business segment. Segment changes are discussed in detail below. Net income for 2005 included an after-tax extraordinary gain of $30 million ($0.09 per diluted share) reflecting an adjustment to the extraordinary loss recorded in 2004 to write down generation-related regulatory assets as a result of the final orders issued by the Texas Utility Commission. Income Tax Expense. The effective tax rate in 2006 was reduced to 12.6% primarily as a result of an agreement with the IRS related to the ZENS and ACES which reduced accrued tax and related interest reserves by approximately $107 million. The net reduction in the reserves related to ZENS and ACES in 2006 was $92 million. In addition, we reached tentative settlements with the IRS on a number of other tax matters which allowed us to reduce our total tax and related interest reserve for other tax items from $60 million at December 31, 2005 to $34 million at December 31, 2006. Interest Expense and Other Finance Charges Total interest expense incurred was $711 million, $600 million and $626 million in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2005, CenterPoint Houston retired at maturity its $1.341 billion term loan, which bore interest at LIBOR plus 975 basis points, subject to a minimum LIBOR rate of 3%. Borrowings under a CenterPoint Houston credit facility, which bore interest at LIBOR plus 75 basis points, were used for the payment of the term loan and then repaid with a portion of the proceeds of the December 2005 issuance of transition bonds. 42 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT The following table presents operating income (in millions) for each of our business segments for 2005, 2006 and 2007. Included in revenues are intersegment sales. We account for intersegment sales as if the sales were to third parties, that is, at current market prices.

Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment reported operating income of $561 million for 2007, consisting of $400 million from our regulated electric transmission and distribution utility operations (TDU), $42 million from the CTC, and $119 million related to transition bond companies. For 2006, operating income totaled $576 million, consisting of $395 million from the TDU, $55 million from the CTC, and $126 million related to transition bond companies. Revenues increased due to growth ($22 million), with over 53,000 metered customers added since December 2006, higher transmission-related revenues ($22 million), increased miscellaneous service charges ($15 million), increased demand ($7 million), interest on settlement of the final fuel reconciliation ($4 million) and a one-time charge in the second quarter of 2006 related to the resolution of the unbundled cost of service order ($32 million). These increases were partially offset by the rate reduction resulting from the 2006 rate case settlement that was implemented in October 2006 ($41 million) and lower CTC return resulting from the reduction in the allowed interest rate on the unrecovered CTC balance from 11.07% to 8.06% in 2006 ($13 million). Operation and maintenance expense increased primarily due to higher transmission costs ($25 million), the absence of a gain on the sale of property in 2006 ($13 million), and increased expenses primarily related to low income and energy efficiency programs as required by the 2006 rate case settlement ($8 million), partially offset by settlement of the final fuel reconciliation ($13 million). 2006 Compared to 2005. Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment reported operating income of $576 million for 2006, consisting of $395 million from the TDU, $55 million from the CTC and $126 million related to the transition bond companies. For 2005, operating income totaled $487 million, consisting of $429 million for the TDU, $19 million from the CTC, and $39 million related to the transition bond companies. Increases in operating income from growth ($34 million), a higher CTC amount collected in 2006 ($36 million), revenues from ancillary services ($11 million) and proceeds from land sales ($13 million) were partially offset by milder weather and reduced demand ($49 million), and the implementation of reduced base rates ($13 million) and spending on low income assistance and energy efficiency programs ($5 million) resulting from the Settlement Agreement described in Business Our Business Regulation State and Local Regulation Electric Transmission & Distribution CenterPoint Houston Rate Agreement. In addition, the TDU operating income for 2006 included the $32 million adverse impact of the resolution of the remand of the 2001 UCOS order. In September 2005, CenterPoint Houston service area in Texas was adversely affected by Hurricane Rita. Although damage to CenterPoint Houston electric facilities was limited, over 700,000 customers lost power at the height of the storm. Power was restored to over a half million customers within 36 hours and all power was restored in less than five days. The Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment revenues lost as a result of the storm were more than offset by warmer than normal weather during the third quarter of 2005. CenterPoint Houston deferred $28 million of restoration costs which are being amortized over a seven-year period that began in October 2006. 44 Table of Contents Natural Gas Distribution The following table provides summary data of our Natural Gas Distribution business segment for 2005, 2006 and 2007 (in millions, except throughput and customer data): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2006 2007 Revenues $ 3,846 $ 3,593 $ 3,759 Expenses: Natural gas 2,841 2,598 2,683 Operation and maintenance 551 594 579 Depreciation and amortization 152 152 155 Taxes other than income taxes 127 125 124 Total expenses 3,671 3,469 3,541 Operating Income $ 175 $ 124 $ 218 Throughput (in billion cubic feet (Bcf)): Residential 160 152 172 Commercial and industrial 215 224 232 Total Throughput 375 376 404 Average number of customers: Residential 2,839,947 2,883,927 2,931,523 Commercial and industrial 244,782 243,265 246,993 Total 3,084,729 3,127,192 3,178,516 2007 Compared to 2006. Our Natural Gas Distribution business segment reported operating income of $218 million for 2007 as compared to $124 million for 2006. Operating income improved as a result of increased usage primarily due to a return to more normal weather in 2007 compared to the unusually mild weather in 2006 ($33 million), growth from the addition of over 38,000 customers in 2007 ($9 million), the effect of the 2006 purchased gas cost write-off described below ($21 million), the effect of rate changes ($7 million) and reduced operation and maintenance expenses ($15 million). Operation and maintenance expenses declined primarily as a result of costs associated with staff reductions incurred in 2006 ($17 million) and settlement of certain rate case-related items ($9 million), partially offset by increases in bad debts and collection costs ($8 million) and other services ($5 million). 2006 Compared to 2005. Our Natural Gas Distribution business segment reported operating income of $124 million for 2006 as compared to $175 million for 2005. Decreases in operating margins (revenues less natural gas costs) include a $21 million write-off in 2006 of purchased gas costs for periods prior to July 2004, the recovery of which was denied by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, and the impact of milder weather and decreased usage ($30 million). These decreases were partially offset by higher margins from rate and service charge increases and rate design changes ($35 million), along with the addition of over 42,000 customers in 2006 ($9 million). Operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily as a result of costs associated with staff reductions ($17 million), benefit costs increases ($6 million), higher costs of goods and services ($8 million) and higher bad debt expenses ($10 million), partially offset by higher litigation reserves recorded in 2005 ($11 million). During the third quarter of 2005, our east Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas service areas were affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Damage to our facilities was limited, but approximately 10,000 homes and businesses were damaged to such an extent that they were not able to, and in some cases continue to be unable to, take service. The impact on the Natural Gas Distribution business segment operating income was not material. 45 Table of Contents Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services The following table provides summary data of our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment for 2005, 2006 and 2007 (in millions, except throughput and customer data): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2006 2007 Revenues $ 4,129 $ 3,651 $ 3,579 Expenses: Natural gas 4,033 3,540 3,467 Operation and maintenance 30 30 31 Depreciation and amortization 2 1 5 Taxes other than income taxes 4 3 1 Total expenses 4,069 3,574 3,504 Operating Income $ 60 $ 77 $ 75 Throughput (in Bcf): Wholesale third parties 304 335 314 Wholesale affiliates 27 36 9 Retail 156 149 192 Pipeline 51 35 7 Total Throughput 538 555 522 Average number of customers: Wholesale 138 140 235 Retail 6,328 6,452 6,789 Pipeline 142 138 12 Total 6,608 6,730 7,036 2007 Compared to 2006. Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment reported operating income of $75 million for 2007 compared to $77 million for 2006. The decrease in operating income of $2 million was primarily due to reduced opportunities for optimization of pipeline and storage assets resulting from lower locational and seasonal natural gas price differentials in the wholesale business ($10 million) offset by an increase in sales to commercial and industrial customers in the retail business ($3 million). In addition, 2007 included a charge to income from mark-to-market accounting for non-trading derivatives ($10 million) and a write-down of natural gas inventory to the lower of average cost or market ($11 million), compared to a gain from mark-to-market accounting ($37 million) and an inventory write-down ($66 million) for 2006. 2006 Compared to 2005. Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment reported operating income of $77 million for 2006 as compared to $60 million for 2005. The increase in operating income of $17 million was primarily driven by improved operating margins (revenues less natural gas costs) resulting from seasonal price differentials and favorable basis differentials over the pipeline capacity that we control ($44 million) and a favorable change in unrealized gains resulting from mark-to-market accounting ($37 million), partially offset by write-downs of natural gas inventory to the lower of average cost or market ($66 million). 46 Table of Contents Interstate Pipelines The following table provides summary data of our Interstate Pipelines business segment for 2005, 2006 and 2007 (in millions, except throughput data): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2006 2007 Revenues $ 386 $ 388 $ 500 Expenses: Natural gas 47 31 83 Operation and maintenance 121 120 125 Depreciation and amortization 36 37 44 Taxes other than income taxes 17 19 11 Total expenses 221 207 263 Operating Income $ 165 $ 181 $ 237 Throughput (in Bcf): Transportation 914 939 1,216 Other 2 1 5 Total Throughput 916 940 1,221 2007 Compared to 2006. Our Interstate Pipeline business segment reported operating income of $237 million for 2007 compared to $181 million for 2006. The increase in operating income of $56 million was driven primarily by the new Carthage to Perryville pipeline ($42 million), other transportation and ancillary services ($20 million), lower spending in 2007 on project development costs ($6 million) and a decrease in other taxes ($8 million) related to the settlement of certain state tax issues. These favorable variances to operating income were partially offset by lower sales in 2007 of excess gas associated with storage enhancement projects ($15 million) and increased operating expenses ($6 million). 2006 Compared to 2005. Our Interstate Pipelines business segment reported operating income of $181 million for 2006 as compared to $165 million for 2005. Operating margins (natural gas sales less gas cost) increased by $18 million. This increase was driven primarily by increased demand for transportation services and ancillary services ($15 million). Operation and maintenance expenses decreased by $1 million primarily due to the gain on sale of excess gas during 2006 ($18 million) combined with lower litigation reserves ($6 million) in 2006 compared to 2005. These favorable variances were partially offset by a write-off of project development expenses associated with the Mid-Continent Crossing pipeline project which was discontinued in 2006 ($11 million) as well as increased operating expenses ($11 million) largely associated with staffing increases and costs associated with continued compliance with pipeline integrity regulations. 47 Table of Contents Field Services The following table provides summary data of our Field Services business segment for 2005, 2006 and 2007 (in millions, except throughput data): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2006 2007 Revenues $ 120 $ 150 $ 175 Expenses: Natural gas (10 ) (10 ) (4 ) Operation and maintenance 49 59 66 Depreciation and amortization 9 10 11 Taxes other than income taxes 2 2 3 Total expenses 50 61 76 Operating Income $ 70 $ 89 $ 99 Throughput (in Bcf): Gathering 353 375 398 2007 Compared to 2006. Our Field Services business segment reported operating income of $99 million for 2007 compared to $89 million for 2006. Continued increased demand for gas gathering and ancillary services ($27 million) was partially offset by lower commodity prices ($10 million) and increased operation and maintenance expenses related to cost increases and expanded operations ($7 million). 2006 Compared to 2005. Our Field Services business segment reported operating income of $89 million for 2006 as compared to $70 million for 2005. The increase of $19 million was driven by increased gas gathering and ancillary services, which reflects contributions from new facilities placed in service ($27 million) and higher commodity prices ($3 million), partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses ($10 million). In addition, this business segment recorded equity income of $6 million, $6 million and $10 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively, from its 50% interest in the Waskom Joint Venture. These amounts are included in Other net under the Other Income (Expense) caption. Other Operations The following table provides summary data for our Other Operations business segment for 2005, 2006 and 2007 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2006 2007 Revenues $ 19 $ 15 $ 10 Expenses 37 17 15 Operating Loss $ (18 ) $ (2 ) $ (5 ) 2007 Compared to 2006. Our Other Operations business segment operating loss in 2007 compared to 2006 increased by $3 million. 2006 Compared to 2005. Our Other Operations business segment operating loss in 2006 compared to 2005 decreased $16 million primarily due to increased rental revenues ($2 million), decreased insurance costs ($4 million), and decreased state franchise taxes ($8 million). Discontinued Operations In December 2004, Texas Genco completed the sale of its fossil generation assets (coal, lignite and gas-fired plants) to Texas Genco LLC for $2.813 billion in cash. Following the sale, Texas Genco, whose principal remaining 48 Table of Contents asset was its ownership interest in a nuclear generating facility, distributed $2.231 billion in cash to us. The final step of the transaction, the merger of Texas Genco with a subsidiary of Texas Genco LLC in exchange for an additional cash payment to us of $700 million, was completed in April 2005. We recorded an after-tax loss of $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 related to the operations of Texas Genco. The consolidated financial statements report the businesses described above as discontinued operations for all periods presented in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (SFAS No. 144). For further information regarding discontinued operations, please read Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Historical Cash Flow The net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for 2005, 2006 and 2007 is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2006 2007 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 63 $ 991 $ 774 Investing activities 17 (1,056 ) (1,300 ) Financing activities (171 ) 118 528 Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities in 2007 decreased $217 million compared to 2006 primarily due to the timing of fuel recovery ($204 million), increased tax payments ($10 million), increased interest payments ($40 million), increased gas storage inventory ($36 million) and decreased net accounts receivable/payable ($178 million). These decreases were partially offset by decreased reductions in customer margin deposit requirements ($76 million) and decreases in our margin deposit requirements ($145 million). Net cash provided by operating activities in 2006 increased $928 million compared to 2005 primarily due to decreased tax payments of $156 million, the majority of which related to the tax payment in the first quarter of 2005 associated with the sale of our former electric generation business (Texas Genco); increased fuel over-recovery ($240 million) primarily related to declining gas prices during 2006; decreases in net regulatory assets ($271 million), primarily due to the termination of excess mitigation credits effective April 2005 and recovery of regulatory assets through rates; increased net accounts receivable/payable ($128 million) primarily due to decreased gas prices as compared to 2005 partially offset by funding under CERC receivables facility being accounted for as short-term borrowings instead of sales of receivables beginning in October 2006 and decreased cash used in the operations of Texas Genco ($38 million). Additionally, customer margin deposit requirements decreased ($155 million) primarily due to the decline in natural gas prices from December 2005 and our margin deposits increased ($52 million). Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities increased $244 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 due to increased capital expenditures of $107 million primarily related to pipeline projects for our Interstate Pipelines business segment, increased notes receivable from unconsolidated affiliates of $148 million and increased investment in unconsolidated affiliates of $26 million, primarily related to the SESH pipeline project. Net cash used in investing activities increased $1.1 billion in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to increased capital expenditures of $314 million primarily related to our Electric Transmission & Distribution, Interstate Pipelines, and Field Services business segments, increased restricted cash of transition bond companies of $36 million primarily related to the $1.85 billion of transition bonds issued in December 2005 and the absence of 49 Table of Contents $700 million in proceeds received in the second quarter of 2005 from the sale of our remaining interest in Texas Genco and cash of Texas Genco of $24 million. Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities in 2007 increased $410 million compared to 2006 primarily due to increased borrowings under revolving credit facilities ($334 million) and increased proceeds from long-term debt ($576 million), which were partially offset by increased repayments of long-term debt ($319 million), increased dividend payments ($31 million) and decreased short-term borrowings ($142 million). Net cash provided by financing activities in 2006 increased $289 million compared to 2005 primarily due to net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $324 million, decreased repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility ($236 million) and funding under CERC receivables facility being accounted for as short-term borrowings ($187 million) in 2006, partially offset by the absence of borrowings under Texas Genco revolving credit facility ($75 million) due to the sale of Texas Genco, payments of long-term debt ($229 million) and increased dividend payments of $63 million. Future Sources and Uses of Cash Our liquidity and capital requirements are affected primarily by our results of operations, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, tax payments, working capital needs, various regulatory actions and appeals relating to such regulatory actions. Our principal cash requirements for 2008 include the following: approximately $995 million of capital expenditures; cash settlement obligations in connection with possible conversions by holders of our 3.75% convertible senior notes, having an aggregate principal amount of $535 million at December 31, 2007; maturing long-term debt aggregating approximately $666 million, including $159 million of transition bonds; investment in and advances to SESH of approximately $294 million; dividend payments on CenterPoint Energy common stock and interest payments on debt. We expect that borrowings under our credit facilities, the proceeds from the issuance of $488 million of transition bonds in February 2008 (discussed below) and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs in 2008. Cash needs or discretionary financing or refinancing may also result in the issuance of equity or debt securities in the capital markets. The following table sets forth our capital expenditures for 2007 and estimates of our capital requirements for 2008 through 2012 (in millions): 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Electric Transmission & Distribution $ 401 $ 371 $ 358 $ 444 $ 415 $ 392 Natural Gas Distribution 191 209 192 193 196 203 Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services 7 18 2 2 2 2 Interstate Pipelines 308 209 133 77 72 76 Field Services 74 154 83 93 94 85 Other Operations 30 34 29 38 22 20 Total $ 1,011 $ 995 $ 797 $ 847 $ 801 $ 778 50 Table of Contents The following table sets forth estimates of our contractual obligations, including payments due by period (in millions): 2013 and Contractual Obligations Total 2008 2009-2010 2011-2012 thereafter Transition bond debt $ 2,260 $ 159 $ 366 $ 432 $ 1,303 Other long-term debt(1) 7,419 1,156 212 986 5,065 Interest payments transition bond debt(2) 745 117 207 166 255 Interest payments other long-term debt(2) 4,215 420 793 688 2,314 Short-term borrowings 232 232 Capital leases 1 1 Operating leases(3) 68 19 22 13 14 Benefit obligations(4) Purchase obligations(5) 27 27 Non-trading derivative liabilities 75 61 14 Other commodity commitments(6) 3,027 743 563 550 1,171 Joint venture obligations(7) 294 294 Income taxes(8) 118 118 Total contractual cash obligations $ 18,481 $ 3,346 $ 2,177 $ 2,835 $ 10,123 (1) 2008 maturities include $114 million of ZENS obligations as they are exchangeable for cash at any time at the option of the holders and $535 million principal amount of our 3.75% convertible senior notes as they meet the criteria that make them eligible for conversion at the option of the holders of these notes. (2) We calculated estimated interest payments for long-term debt as follows: for fixed-rate debt and term debt, we calculated interest based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for variable-rate debt and/or non-term debt, we used interest rates in place as of December 31, 2007. We typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operations and short-term borrowings. (3) For a discussion of operating leases, please read Note 10(b) to our consolidated financial statements. (4) Contributions to our qualified pension plan are not required in 2008. However, we expect to contribute approximately $8 million and $21 million, respectively, to our non-qualified pension and postretirement benefits plans in 2008. (5) Represents capital commitments for material in connection with the construction of a new pipeline by our Interstate Pipelines business segment. This project has been included in the table of capital expenditures presented above. (6) For a discussion of other commodity commitments, please read Note 10(a) to our consolidated financial statements. (7) We anticipate SESH to be in-service mid-year 2008 and ultimately will be funded with approximately 50% debt. (8) Represents estimated income tax liability for settled positions for tax years under examination. In addition, as of December 31, 2007, the liability for uncertain income tax positions was $82 million. However, due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid. Transition Bonds. During the 2007 legislative session, the Texas legislature amended certain statutes authorizing amounts that can be securitized by utilities. In June 2007, CenterPoint Houston filed a request with the Texas Utility Commission for a financing order that would allow the securitization of the remaining balance of the CTC, as well as the fuel reconciliation settlement amount, provisions for deduction of the environmental refund and certain other matters. CenterPoint Houston reached substantial agreement with other parties to this proceeding, 51 Table of Contents and a financing order was approved by the Texas Utility Commission in September 2007. The financing order allowed for the netting of the fuel reconciliation settlement amount against the environmental refund. In February 2008, approximately $488 million of transition bonds were issued by a new special purpose subsidiary of CenterPoint Houston pursuant to the financing order. Proceeds were used by the special purpose entity to purchase $483 million of transition property from CenterPoint Houston and to pay costs of issuance. Following a subsequent distribution to us, we used the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt and the making of loans to or investments in affiliates. Convertible Debt. As of December 31, 2007, the 3.75% convertible senior notes discussed in Note 8(b) to our consolidated financial statements have been included as current portion of long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets because the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the third quarter of 2007 was greater than or equal to 120% of the conversion price of the 3.75% convertible senior notes and therefore, during the fourth quarter of 2007, the 3.75% convertible senior notes meet the criteria that make them eligible for conversion at the option of the holders of these notes. In 2007, we issued 1.3 million shares of our common stock and paid cash of approximately $40 million upon conversion of approximately $40 million principal amount of our 3.75% convertible senior notes. Subsequent to December 31, 2007, we have issued 4.1 million shares of our common stock and paid cash of approximately $121 million upon conversion of approximately $123 million principal amount of our 3.75% convertible senior notes. A February 2008 conversion notice by a holder of $10 million principal amount of our 3.75% convertible senior notes is expected to result in a March 2008 conversion and settlement with a cash payment for the principal amount and delivery of shares of our common stock for the excess value due the converting holder. Arkansas Public Service Commission (APSC), Affiliate Transaction Rulemaking Proceeding. In December 2006, the APSC adopted new rules governing affiliate transactions involving public utilities operating in Arkansas. In February 2007, in response to requests by CERC and other gas and electric utilities operating in Arkansas, the APSC granted reconsideration of the rules and stayed their operation in order to permit additional consideration. In May 2007, the APSC adopted revised rules, which incorporated many revisions proposed by the utilities, the Arkansas Attorney General and the APSC staff. The revised rules prohibit affiliated financing transactions for purposes not related to utility operations, but permit the continuation of existing money pool and multi-jurisdictional financing arrangements such as those currently in place at CERC. Non-financial affiliate transactions generally have to be priced under an asymmetrical pricing formula under which utilities would receive the better of cost or market pricing for goods and services provided to or from the utility operations. However, corporate services provided at fully-allocated cost such as those provided by service companies are exempt. The rules also restrict utilities from engaging in businesses other than utility and utility-related businesses if the total book value of non-utility businesses exceeds 10% of the book value of the utility and its affiliates. However, existing businesses are grandfathered under the revised rules. The revised rules also permit utilities to petition for waivers of financing and non-financial rules that would otherwise be applicable to their transactions. The APSC revised rules impose record keeping, record access, employee training and reporting requirements related to affiliate transactions, including notification to the APSC of the formation of new affiliates that will engage in transactions with the utility and annual certification by the utility president or chief executive officer and its chief financial officer of compliance with the rules. In addition, the revised rules require a report to the APSC in the event the utility bond rating is downgraded in certain circumstances. Although the revised rules impose new requirements on CERC operations in Arkansas, at this time neither we nor CERC anticipate that the revised rules will have an adverse effect on existing operations in Arkansas. In September 2007, Gas Operations made a filing with the APSC in accordance with the revised rules to document existing practices that would be covered by grandfathering provisions of those rules. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. Other than operating leases and the guaranties described below, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements. Prior to the distribution of our ownership in Reliant Energy, Inc. (RRI) to our shareholders, CERC had guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became RRI trading subsidiary. Under the terms of the 52 Table of Contents separation agreement between the companies, RRI agreed to extinguish all such guaranty obligations prior to separation, but at the time of separation in September 2002, RRI had been unable to extinguish all obligations. To secure CERC against obligations under the remaining guaranties, RRI agreed to provide cash or letters of credit for the benefit of CERC, and undertook to use commercially reasonable efforts to extinguish the remaining guaranties. In February 2007, we and CERC made a formal demand on RRI in connection with one of the two remaining guaranties under procedures provided by the Master Separation Agreement, dated December 31, 2000, between Reliant Energy and RRI. That demand sought to resolve a disagreement with RRI over the amount of security RRI is obligated to provide with respect to this guaranty. In December 2007, we, CERC and RRI amended the agreement relating to the security to be provided by RRI for these guaranties, pursuant to which CERC released the $29.3 million in letters of credit RRI had provided as security, and RRI agreed to provide cash or new letters of credit to secure CERC against exposure under the remaining guaranties as calculated under the new agreement if and to the extent changes in market conditions exposed CERC to a risk of loss on those guaranties. The remaining exposure to CERC under the guaranties relates to payment of demand charges related to transportation contracts. The present value of the demand charges under those transportation contracts, which will be effective until 2018, was approximately $135 million as of December 31, 2007. RRI continues to meet its obligations under the contracts, and we believe current market conditions make those contracts valuable in the near term and that additional security is not needed at this time. However, changes in market conditions could affect the value of those contracts. If RRI should fail to perform its obligations under the contracts or if RRI should fail to provide security in the event market conditions change adversely, our exposure to the counterparty under the guaranty could exceed the security provided by RRI. Senior Notes. In February 2007, we issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in February 2017 with an interest rate of 5.95%. The proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were used to repay debt incurred in satisfying our $255 million cash payment obligation in connection with the conversion and redemption of our 2.875% Convertible Notes. In February 2007, CERC Corp. issued $150 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in February 2037 with an interest rate of 6.25%. The proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were used to repay advances for the purchase of receivables under CERC Corp. receivables facility. Such repayment provided increased liquidity and capital resources for CERC general corporate purposes. In October 2007, CERC Corp. issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% senior notes due in November 2017 and $250 million aggregate principal amount of 6.625% senior notes due in November 2037. The proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment or refinancing of debt, including $300 million of CERC Corp. 6.5% senior notes due February 1, 2008, capital expenditures, working capital and loans to or investments in affiliates. Pending application of the proceeds for these purposes, CERC Corp. repaid borrowings under its revolving credit and receivables facilities. Credit and Receivables Facilities. In June 2007, we, CenterPoint Houston and CERC Corp. entered into amended and restated bank credit facilities. Our amended credit facility is a $1.2 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The facility has a first drawn cost of London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 55 basis points based on our current credit ratings, versus the previous rate of LIBOR plus 60 basis points. The facility contains covenants, including a debt (excluding transition bonds) to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) covenant. The amended facility at CenterPoint Houston is a $300 million five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The facility first drawn cost remains at LIBOR plus 45 basis points based on CenterPoint Houston current credit ratings. The facility contains covenants, including a debt (excluding transition bonds) to total capitalization covenant. The amended facility at CERC Corp. is a $950 million five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility versus a $550 million facility prior to the amendment. The facility first drawn cost remains at LIBOR plus 45 basis points based on CERC Corp. current credit ratings. The facility contains covenants, including a debt to total capitalization covenant. 53 Table of Contents Under each of the credit facilities, an additional utilization fee of 5 basis points applies to borrowings any time more than 50% of the facility is utilized. The spread to LIBOR and the utilization fee fluctuate based on the borrower credit rating. Borrowings under each of the facilities are subject to customary terms and conditions. However, there is no requirement that we, CenterPoint Houston or CERC Corp. make representations prior to borrowings as to the absence of material adverse changes or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect. Borrowings under each of the credit facilities are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of events of default that we, CenterPoint Houston or CERC Corp. consider customary. CERC receivables facility terminates in October 2008. The facility size will range from $150 million to $375 million during the period from December 31, 2007 to the October 28, 2008 termination date of the facility. At December 31, 2007, $232 million was utilized under the facility. We, CenterPoint Houston and CERC Corp. are currently in compliance with the various business and financial covenants contained in the respective receivables and credit facilities. As of February 15, 2008, we had the following facilities (in millions): Amount Utilized at February 15, Date Executed Company Type of Facility Size of Facility 2008 Termination Date June 29, 2007 CenterPoint Energy Revolver $ 1,200 $ 28 (1) June 29, 2012 June 29, 2007 CenterPoint Houston Revolver 300 4 (1) June 29, 2012 June 29, 2007 CERC Corp. Revolver 950 87 (2) June 29, 2012 October 30, 2007 CERC Receivables 375 85 October 28, 2008 (1) Represents outstanding letters of credit. (2) Includes $74 million of borrowings under the credit facility and $13 million of outstanding letters of credit. The $1.2 billion CenterPoint Energy credit facility backstops a $1.0 billion commercial paper program under which we began issuing commercial paper in June 2005. The $950 million CERC Corp. credit facility backstops a $950 million commercial paper program under which CERC Corp. began issuing commercial paper in February 2008. As of December 31, 2007, there was no commercial paper outstanding. The CenterPoint Energy commercial paper is rated Not Prime by Moody Investors Service, Inc. (Moody s), A-2 by Standard & Poor Rating Services (S&P), a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, and F3 by Fitch, Inc. (Fitch). The CERC Corp. commercial paper is rated P-3 by Moody s, A-2 by S&P, and F2 by Fitch. As a result of the credit ratings on the two commercial paper programs, we do not expect to be able to rely on the sale of commercial paper to fund all of our short-term borrowing requirements. We cannot assure you that these ratings, or the credit ratings set forth below in Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings, will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing, the cost of such financings and the execution of our commercial strategies. Securities Registered with the SEC. As of December 31, 2007, CenterPoint Energy had a shelf registration statement covering senior debt securities, preferred stock and common stock aggregating $750 million and CERC Corp. had a shelf registration statement covering $400 million principal amount of senior debt securities. Hedging of Future Debt Issuances. As of February 15, 2008, we had outstanding Treasury rate lock agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million, expiration dates of June 2008 and a weighted-average locked Treasury rate on ten-year debt of 4.05%. These agreements were executed to hedge the ten-year Treasury rate expected to be used in pricing a 2008 issuance of ten-year notes. Temporary Investments. As of December 31, 2007, we had no external temporary investments. Money Pool. We have a money pool through which the holding company and participating subsidiaries can borrow or invest on a short-term basis. Funding needs are aggregated and external borrowing or investing is based 54 Table of Contents on the net cash position. The net funding requirements of the money pool are expected to be met with borrowings under our revolving credit facility or the sale of our commercial paper. Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings. As of February 15, 2008, Moody s, S&P, and Fitch had assigned the following credit ratings to senior debt of CenterPoint Energy and certain subsidiaries: Moody S&P Fitch Company/Instrument Rating Outlook(1) Rating Outlook(2) Rating Outlook(3) CenterPoint Energy Senior Unsecured Debt Ba1 Stable BBB- Positive BBB- Stable CenterPoint Houston Senior Secured Debt (First Mortgage Bonds) Baa2 Stable BBB+ Positive A- Stable CERC Corp. Senior Unsecured Debt Baa3 Stable BBB Positive BBB Stable (1) A stable outlook from Moody indicates that Moody does not expect to put the rating on review for an upgrade or downgrade within 18 months from when the outlook was assigned or last affirmed. (2) An S&P rating outlook assesses the potential direction of a long-term credit rating over the intermediate to longer term. (3) A stable outlook from Fitch encompasses a one- to two-year horizon as to the likely ratings direction. A decline in credit ratings could increase borrowing costs under our $1.2 billion credit facility, CenterPoint Houston $300 million credit facility and CERC Corp. $950 million credit facility. A decline in credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on long-term debt to be issued in the capital markets and could negatively impact our ability to complete capital market transactions. Additionally, a decline in credit ratings could increase cash collateral requirements and reduce earnings of our Natural Gas Distribution and Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segments. In September 1999, we issued 2.0% ZENS having an original principal amount of $1.0 billion of which $840 million remain outstanding. Each ZENS note is exchangeable at the holder option at any time for an amount of cash equal to 95% of the market value of the reference shares of Time Warner Inc. common stock (TW Common) attributable to each ZENS note. If our creditworthiness were to drop such that ZENS note holders thought our liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the ZENS notes were to become illiquid, some ZENS note holders might decide to exchange their ZENS notes for cash. Funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of TW Common that we own or from other sources. We own shares of TW Common equal to approximately 100% of the reference shares used to calculate our obligation to the holders of the ZENS notes. ZENS note exchanges result in a cash outflow because deferred tax liabilities related to the ZENS notes and TW Common shares become current tax obligations when ZENS notes are exchanged or otherwise retired and TW Common shares are sold. A tax obligation of approximately $153 million relating to our original issue discount deductions on the ZENS would have been payable if all of the ZENS had been exchanged for cash on December 31, 2007. The ultimate tax obligation related to the ZENS notes continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year and there could be a significant cash outflow when the taxes are paid as a result of the retirement of the ZENS notes. CenterPoint Energy Services, Inc. (CES), a wholly owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. operating in our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment, provides comprehensive natural gas sales and services primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities throughout the central and eastern United States. In order to economically hedge its exposure to natural gas prices, CES uses derivatives with provisions standard for the industry, including those pertaining to credit thresholds. Typically, the credit threshold negotiated with each counterparty defines the amount of unsecured credit that such counterparty will extend to CES. To the extent that the credit exposure that a counterparty has to CES at a particular time does not exceed that credit threshold, CES is not obligated to provide collateral. Mark-to-market exposure in excess of the credit threshold is routinely collateralized by CES. As of December 31, 2007, the amount posted as collateral amounted to approximately $47 million. Should the credit ratings of CERC Corp. (as the credit support provider for CES) fall below certain levels, CES would be required to provide additional collateral on two business days notice up to the amount of its previously unsecured credit limit. We estimate that as of December 31, 2007, unsecured credit limits extended to CES by counterparties aggregate $154 million; however, utilized credit capacity is significantly 55 Table of Contents lower. In addition, CERC Corp. and its subsidiaries purchase natural gas under supply agreements that contain an aggregate credit threshold of $100 million based on CERC Corp. S&P Senior Unsecured Long-Term Debt rating of BBB. Upgrades and downgrades from this BBB rating will increase and decrease the aggregate credit threshold accordingly. In connection with the development of SESH 270-mile pipeline project, CERC Corp. has committed that it will advance funds to the joint venture or cause funds to be advanced for its 50% share of the cost to construct the pipeline. CERC Corp. also agreed to provide a letter of credit in an amount up to $400 million for its share of funds that have not been advanced in the event S&P reduces CERC Corp. bond rating below investment grade before CERC Corp. has advanced the required construction funds. However, CERC Corp. is relieved of these commitments (i) to the extent of 50% of any borrowing agreements that the joint venture has obtained and maintains for funding the construction of the pipeline and (ii) to the extent CERC Corp. or its subsidiary participating in the joint venture obtains committed borrowing agreements pursuant to which funds may be borrowed and used for the construction of the pipeline. A similar commitment has been provided by the other party to the joint venture. As of December 31, 2007, subsidiaries of CERC Corp. have advanced approximately $198 million to SESH, of which $52 million was in the form of an equity contribution and $146 million was in the form of a loan. Cross Defaults. Under our revolving credit facility, a payment default on, or a non-payment default that permits acceleration of, any indebtedness exceeding $50 million by us or any of our significant subsidiaries will cause a default. In addition, six outstanding series of our senior notes, aggregating $1.4 billion in principal amount as of December 31, 2007, provide that a payment default by us, CERC Corp. or CenterPoint Houston in respect of, or an acceleration of, borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations, in the aggregate principal amount of $50 million, will cause a default. A default by CenterPoint Energy would not trigger a default under our subsidiaries debt instruments or bank credit facilities. Other Factors that Could Affect Cash Requirements. In addition to the above factors, our liquidity and capital resources could be affected by: cash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain contracts, including gas purchases, gas price and weather hedging and gas storage activities of our Natural Gas Distribution and Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segments, particularly given gas price levels and volatility; acceleration of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts under certain circumstances, as a result of increased gas prices and concentration of natural gas suppliers; increased costs related to the acquisition of natural gas; increases in interest expense in connection with debt refinancings and borrowings under credit facilities; various regulatory actions; the ability of RRI and its subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations as the principal customers of CenterPoint Houston and in respect of RRI indemnity obligations to us and our subsidiaries or in connection with the contractual obligations to a third party pursuant to which CERC is a guarantor; slower customer payments and increased write-offs of receivables due to higher gas prices or changing economic conditions; cash payments in connection with the exercise of contingent conversion rights of holders of convertible debt; the outcome of litigation brought by and against us; contributions to benefit plans; restoration costs and revenue losses resulting from natural disasters such as hurricanes; and various other risks identified in Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report. Certain Contractual Limits on Our Ability to Issue Securities and Borrow Money. CenterPoint Houston credit facility limits CenterPoint Houston debt (excluding transition bonds) as a percentage of its total capitalization to 65%. CERC Corp. bank facility and its receivables facility limit CERC debt as a percentage of its total 56 Table of Contents capitalization to 65%. Our $1.2 billion credit facility contains a debt, excluding transition bonds, to EBITDA covenant. Additionally, CenterPoint Houston has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certain exceptions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates. An accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element, item or account in the financial statements. Accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events, or the present status of an asset or liability. The accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made. Additionally, different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations. The circumstances that make these judgments difficult, subjective and/or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments. These estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates. Accordingly, these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors. Accounting for Rate Regulation SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate-regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business applies SFAS No. 71, which results in our accounting for the regulatory effects of recovery of stranded costs and other regulatory assets resulting from the unbundling of the transmission and distribution business from our former electric generation operations in our consolidated financial statements. Certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. Significant accounting estimates embedded within the application of SFAS No. 71 with respect to our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment relate to $281 million of recoverable electric generation-related regulatory assets as of December 31, 2007. These costs are recoverable under the provisions of the 1999 Texas Electric Choice Plan. Based on our analysis of the final order issued by the Texas Utility Commission, we recorded an after-tax charge to earnings in 2004 of approximately $977 million to write down our electric generation-related regulatory assets to their realizable value, which was reflected as an extraordinary loss. Based on subsequent orders received from the Texas Utility Commission, we recorded an extraordinary gain of $30 million after-tax in 2005 related to the regulatory asset. Additionally, a district court in Travis County, Texas issued a judgment which would have had the effect of restoring approximately $650 million, plus interest, of disallowed costs. CenterPoint Houston and other parties appealed the district court judgment to the Texas Third Court of Appeals, which issued its decision in December 2007. In its decision, the court of appeals: reversed the district court judgment to the extent it restored the capacity auction true-up amounts; reversed the district court judgment to the extent it upheld the Texas Utility Commission decision to allow CenterPoint Houston to recover EMCs paid to RRI; ordered that the tax normalization issue be remanded to the Texas Utility Commission; and affirmed the district court judgment in all other respects. 57 Table of Contents CenterPoint Houston and two other parties filed motions for rehearing with the court of appeals. In the event that the motions for rehearing are not resolved in a manner favorable to it, CenterPoint Houston intends to seek further review by the Texas Supreme Court. Although we and CenterPoint Houston believe that CenterPoint Houston true-up request is consistent with applicable statutes and regulations and accordingly that it is reasonably possible that it will be successful in its further appeals, we can provide no assurance as to the ultimate rulings by the courts on the issues to be considered in the various appeals or with respect to the ultimate decision by the Texas Utility Commission on the tax normalization issue. To reflect the impact of the True-Up Order, in 2004 and 2005 we recorded a net after-tax extraordinary loss of $947 million. No amounts related to the district court judgment or the decision of the court of appeals have been recorded in our consolidated financial statements. However, if the court of appeals decision is not reversed or modified as a result of the pending motions for rehearing or on further review by the Texas Supreme Court, we anticipate that we would be required to record an additional loss to reflect the court of appeals decision. The amount of that loss would depend on several factors, including ultimate resolution of the tax normalization issue and the calculation of interest on any amounts CenterPoint Houston ultimately is authorized to recover or is required to refund beyond the amounts recorded based on the True-up Order, but could range from $130 million to $350 million, plus interest subsequent to December 31, 2007. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including goodwill and identifiable intangibles, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable, and at least annually for goodwill as required by SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. No impairment of goodwill was indicated based on our annual analysis as of July 1, 2007. Unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in the value of long-lived assets and intangibles due to changes in estimates of future cash flows, interest rates, regulatory matters and operating costs could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge. Fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques, including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties, present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures. The fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques. Asset Retirement Obligations We account for our long-lived assets under SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No. 143), and Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations An Interpretation of SFAS No. 143 (FIN 47). SFAS No. 143 and FIN 47 require that an asset retirement obligation be recorded at fair value in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. In the same period, the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Rate-regulated entities may recognize regulatory assets or liabilities as a result of timing differences between the recognition of costs as recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 143 and FIN 47, and costs recovered through the ratemaking process. We estimate the fair value of asset retirement obligations by calculating the discounted cash flows that are dependent upon the following components: Inflation adjustment The estimated cash flows are adjusted for inflation estimates for labor, equipment, materials, and other disposal costs; Discount rate The estimated cash flows include contingency factors that were used as a proxy for the market risk premium; and Third-party markup adjustments Internal labor costs included in the cash flow calculation were adjusted for costs that a third party would incur in performing the tasks necessary to retire the asset. 58 Table of Contents Changes in these factors could materially affect the obligation recorded to reflect the ultimate cost associated with retiring the assets under SFAS No. 143 and FIN 47. For example, if the inflation adjustment increased 25 basis points, this would increase the balance for asset retirement obligations by approximately 3.0%. Similarly, an increase in the discount rate by 25 basis points would decrease asset retirement obligations by approximately the same percentage. At December 31, 2007, our estimated cost of retiring these assets is approximately $81 million. Unbilled Energy Revenues Revenues related to electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services are generally recognized upon delivery to customers. However, the determination of deliveries to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, deliveries to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated. Unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on daily supply volumes, applicable rates and analyses reflecting significant historical trends and experience. Unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes, estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect. As additional information becomes available, or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised. Consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates. Pension and Other Retirement Plans We sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements. We use several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management, within certain guidelines. In addition, our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded. Please read Other Significant Matters Pension Plans for further discussion. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2(o) to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us. OTHER SIGNIFICANT MATTERS Pension Plans. As discussed in Note 2(p) to our consolidated financial statements, we maintain a non-contributory qualified pension plan covering substantially all employees. Employer contributions for the qualified plan are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes. Under the terms of our pension plan, we reserve the right to change, modify or terminate the plan. Our funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. We made no contribution to the qualified pension plans in 2006 and 2007. The minimum funding requirements for these plans did not require contribution for the respective years. Additionally, we maintain an unfunded non-qualified benefit restoration plan that allows participants to retain the benefits to which they would have been entitled under our non-contributory pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated. Employer contributions for the non-qualified benefit restoration plan represent benefit payments made to participants and totaled $7 million and $9 million in 2006 and 2007, respectively. 59 Table of Contents In accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension expense in the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension expense recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS No. 158). SFAS No. 158 requires us, as the sponsor of a plan, to (a) recognize on our balance sheets as an asset a plan over-funded status or as a liability such plan under-funded status, (b) measure a plan assets and obligations as of the end of our fiscal year and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of our plans in the year that changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006, we recorded a regulatory asset of $466 million and a charge to accumulated comprehensive income of $79 million, net of tax. At December 31, 2007, the market value of plan assets exceeded the projected benefit obligation of our pension plans by $147 million. Changes in interest rates and the market values of the securities held by the plan during 2008 could materially, positively or negatively, change our funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions. Pension expense was $36 million, $46 million and $15 million for 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. In addition, included in the costs for 2005 is less than $1 million of expense related to Texas Genco participants. Pension expense for Texas Genco participants is reflected in our Statement of Consolidated Income as discontinued operations. The calculation of pension expense and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. Two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate. As of December 31, 2007, our qualified pension plan had an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.5%, which was unchanged from the rate assumed as of December 31, 2006. We believe that our actual asset allocation, on average, will approximate the targeted allocation and the estimated return on net assets. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance plan assets as appropriate. As of December 31, 2007, the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of 6.40%, which is a 0.55% increase from the 5.85% discount rate assumed in 2006. The discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on high-quality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of our plan. Pension expense for 2008, including the benefit restoration plan, is estimated to be $1 million based on an expected return on plan assets of 8.5% and a discount rate of 6.40% as of December 31, 2007. If the expected return assumption were lowered by 0.5% (from 8.5% to 8.0%), 2008 pension expense would increase by approximately $9 million. As of December 31, 2007, pension plan assets exceed the projected benefit obligation (including the unfunded benefit restoration plan) by $147 million. However, if the discount rate was lowered by 0.5% (from 6.40% to 5.90%), the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation and 2008 pension expense by approximately $103 million and $10 million, respectively. In addition, the assumption change would impact our Consolidated Balance Sheet by increasing the regulatory asset recorded as of December 31, 2007 by $79 million and would result in a charge to comprehensive income in 2007 of $15 million, net of tax. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plan will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be. 60 Table of Contents
