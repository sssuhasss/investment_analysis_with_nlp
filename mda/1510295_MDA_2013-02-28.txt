Item 7: Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the information included under Item 1. Business, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 6. Selected Financial Data and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes various forward-looking statements concerning trends or events potentially affecting our business. You can identify our forward-looking statements by words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, forecast, goal, intend, plan, predict, project, seek, target, could, may, should or would or other similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. In accordance with safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, which could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in forward-looking statements. The Spinoff and Basis of Presentation On May 25, 2011, the Marathon Oil board of directors approved the spinoff of its RM&T Business into an independent, publicly traded company, MPC, through the distribution of MPC common stock to the stockholders of Marathon Oil common stock. In accordance with a separation and distribution agreement between Marathon Oil and MPC, the distribution of MPC common stock was made on June 30, 2011, with Marathon Oil stockholders receiving one share of MPC common stock for every two shares of Marathon Oil common stock held. Following the Spinoff, Marathon Oil retained no ownership interest in MPC, and each company had separate public ownership, boards of directors and management. On July 1, 2011, our common stock began trading regular-way on the NYSE under the ticker symbol MPC . Prior to the Spinoff on June 30, 2011, our results of operations and cash flows consisted of the RM&T Business, which represented a combined reporting entity. Subsequent to the Spinoff, our results of operations and cash flows consist of consolidated MPC activities. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. The consolidated statements of income for periods prior to the Spinoff include expense allocations for certain corporate functions historically performed by the Marathon Oil Companies, including allocations of general corporate expenses related to executive oversight, accounting, treasury, tax, legal, procurement and information technology. Those allocations were based primarily on specific identification, headcount or computer utilization. Our management believes the assumptions underlying the consolidated financial statements, including the assumptions regarding allocating general corporate expenses from the Marathon Oil Companies, are reasonable. However, the consolidated financial statements do not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred had we been a stand-alone company during those periods presented prior to the Spinoff and may not reflect our consolidated results of operations and cash flows had we been a stand-alone company during the periods presented. Actual costs that would have been incurred if we had been a stand-alone company would depend on multiple factors, including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas, including information technology and infrastructure. Subsequent to the Spinoff, we are performing these functions using internal resources or services provided by third parties, certain of which were provided by the Marathon Oil Companies during a transition period pursuant to a transition services agreement, which terminated June 30, 2012. Corporate Overview We are an independent petroleum refining, marketing and transportation company. As of December 31, 2012, we owned and operated six refineries, all located in the United States, with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 1.25 mmbpcd. The acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery on February 1, 2013 increased our crude oil refining capacity to approximately 1.7 mmbpcd. Our refineries supply refined products to resellers and 42 Table of Contents consumers within our market areas, including the Midwest, Gulf Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. We distribute refined products to our customers through one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges, one of the largest terminal operations in the United States, and a combination of MPC-owned and third-party-owned trucking and rail assets. As of December 31, 2012, we owned, leased or had ownership interests in approximately 8,200 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines to deliver crude oil to our refineries and other locations and refined products to wholesale and retail market areas. The acquisition of approximately 100 miles of natural gas liquid pipelines on February 1, 2013 increased our pipeline mileage to approximately 8,300 miles. We are one of the largest petroleum pipeline companies in the United States on the basis of total volumes delivered. Our operations consist of three reportable operating segments: Refining & Marketing; Speedway; and Pipeline Transportation. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services they offer. See Item 1. Business for additional information on our segments. Refining & Marketing refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our seven refineries in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States (including the recently acquired Galveston Bay refinery), purchases ethanol and refined products for resale and distributes refined products through various means, including barges, terminals and trucks that we own or operate. We sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, to buyers on the spot market, to our Speedway business segment and to dealers and jobbers who operate Marathon retail outlets; Speedway sells transportation fuels and convenience products in the retail market in the Midwest, primarily through Speedway convenience stores; and Pipeline Transportation transports crude oil and other feedstocks to our refineries and other locations, delivers refined products to wholesale and retail market areas and includes the aggregated operations of MPLX and MPC retained pipeline assets and investments. Net income attributable to MPC was $3.39 billion, or $9.89 per diluted share, in 2012 compared to $2.39 billion, or $6.67 per diluted share, in 2011. The increase was primarily due to our Refining & Marketing segment operations, which generated income from operations of $5.10 billion in 2012 compared to $3.59 billion in 2011. The increase in Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was due to an improved refining and marketing gross margin, which was primarily a result of larger Light Louisiana Sweet crude oil ( LLS ) 6-3-2-1 crack spreads and wider sweet/sour differentials. In 2012, we completed a $2.2 billion (excluding capitalized interest) heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our Detroit refinery. This project increased the refinery heavy crude oil refining capacity from 20 mbpcd to 100 mbpcd, allowing it to process more heavy, sour crude oils, including Canadian bitumen blends, which have traded at a significant discount to light sweet crude oil. In addition, the project increased the refinery total crude oil refining capacity by approximately 14 mbpcd to 120 mbpcd. We also continued to optimize our other refineries in 2012, which includes increasing our Garyville refinery crude oil refining capacity from 490 mbpcd to 522 mbpcd as of December 31, 2012. Our Speedway segment generated income from operations of $310 million for 2012 compared to $271 million for 2011. The increase in 2012 was primarily due to increases in our merchandise gross margin and our gasoline and distillates gross margin, partially offset by higher expenses associated with an increase in the number of convenience stores. In 2012, Speedway LLC acquired 10 convenience stores located in the northern Kentucky and southwestern Ohio regions from Road Ranger LLC in exchange for cash and a truck stop location in the Chicago metropolitan area and 87 convenience stores situated throughout Indiana and Ohio from GasAmerica Services, Inc. These acquisitions support our strategic initiative to increase Speedway segment sales and complement our existing network of assets. 43 Table of Contents Our Pipeline Transportation segment generated income from operations of $216 million for 2012 compared to $199 million for 2011. The increase primarily reflects higher transportation tariffs, partially offset by higher mechanical integrity expenses and a reduction in income from a pipeline affiliate. On February 1, 2013, we acquired from BP the 451,000 barrel per calendar day Texas City, Texas refinery, three intrastate natural gas liquid pipelines originating at the refinery, an allocation of BP Colonial Pipeline Company shipper history, four light product terminals, branded-jobber marketing contract assignments for the supply of approximately 1,200 branded sites and a 1,040 megawatt electric cogeneration facility. We refer to these assets as the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets . The financial results and operating statistics included in this section do not include these assets. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 26 for additional information on the acquisition of these assets. In 2012, we formed MPLX, a master limited partnership, to own, operate, develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets related to the transportation and storage of crude oil, refined products and other hydrocarbon-based products. On October 31, 2012, MPLX completed its initial public offering of 19,895,000 common units, which represented the sale by us of a 26.4 percent interest in MPLX. We own a 73.6 percent interest in MPLX, including the general partner interest, and we consolidate this entity for financial reporting purposes since we have a controlling financial interest. Headquartered in Findlay, Ohio, MPLX initial assets consist of a 51 percent general partner interest in Pipe Line Holdings, which owns a network of common carrier crude oil and product pipeline systems and associated storage assets in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions of the United States, and a 100 percent interest in a butane storage cavern in West Virginia. We own the remaining 49 percent limited partner interest in Pipe Line Holdings. The financial results and operating statistics in this section include 100 percent of these assets for all time periods presented. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 4 for additional information on MPLX initial public offering. In 2012, we signed a letter of intent with Harvest Pipeline Company, agreeing to jointly develop infrastructure that will facilitate transportation of hydrocarbon liquids production from the Utica Shale in eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania. The proposed project is expected to result in up to 24,000 barrels per day of truck unloading capacity and a terminal capable of loading up to 50,000 barrels per day onto barges on the Ohio River at our Wellsville, Ohio asphalt terminal. In 2012, to increase access to Bakken and Canadian crude oil, we agreed to be the anchor shipper on Enbridge Inc. proposed Southern Access Extension pipeline with an option to acquire a 25 percent equity interest in the pipeline. This line will originate in Flanagan, Illinois near Chicago and terminate in Patoka, Illinois, a critical crude storage and blending hub and the origination point for crude supply to our four Midwest refineries. On February 1, 2012, we announced that our board of directors authorized a share repurchase plan, enabling us to purchase up to $2.0 billion of MPC common stock over a two-year period. We entered into two ASR programs in 2012 to repurchase shares of MPC common stock totaling $1.35 billion. We received 27,760,674 shares under these programs in 2012 and 870,947 shares in February 2013. On January 30, 2013, we announced that our board of directors approved an additional $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization. The board also extended the remaining $650 million share repurchase authorization announced on February 1, 2012, for a total outstanding authorization of $2.65 billion through December 2014. In 2012, we entered into a five-year revolving credit agreement with an initial borrowing capacity of $2.0 billion and terminated our previous four-year revolving credit agreement. We subsequently amended this agreement to increase the borrowing capacity to $2.5 billion, which became effective in February 2013 in conjunction with the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets. Also in 2012, MPLX Operations LLC, an affiliate of MPC and wholly-owned subsidiary of MPLX, entered into a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit agreement with an initial borrowing loan capacity of $500 million that became effective at the time of MPLX initial public offering. The agreement provides MPLX with an independent source of liquidity. 44 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2012, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.86 billion and no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under MPC revolving credit agreement or trade receivables securitization facility or MPLX revolving credit agreement. On December 1, 2010, we completed the sale of the Minnesota Assets. These assets included the 74,000 barrel per calendar day St. Paul Park refinery and associated terminals, 166 convenience stores primarily branded SuperAmerica (including six stores in Wisconsin) along with the SuperMom bakery and commissary (a baked goods and sandwich supply operation) and certain associated trademarks, SuperAmerica Franchising LLC, interests in pipeline assets in Minnesota and associated inventories. Our financial results and operating statistics for all periods prior to the disposition include amounts for the Minnesota Assets. The above discussion includes forward-looking statements that relate to our expectations with respect to the proposed project with Harvest Pipeline Company and the share repurchase plan. Factors that could affect the proposed project with Harvest Pipeline Company include, but are not limited to, our ability to reach a definitive agreement with Harvest Pipeline Company and the timing and extent of hydrocarbon liquids production and demand from the Utica Shale. Factors that could affect the share repurchase plan and its timing include, but are not limited to, business conditions, availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Overview of Segments Refining & Marketing Refining & Marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our refining and marketing gross margin and refinery throughputs. Our refining and marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries, the costs of purchased products and manufacturing expenses, including depreciation and amortization. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate Midwest (Chicago) and U.S. Gulf Coast ( USGC ) crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. LLS prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products (6 barrels of LLS crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline, 2 barrels of ultra-low sulfur diesel and 1 barrel of 3 percent sulfur residual fuel) are used for these crack-spread calculations. Our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. The amount of this discount, the sweet/sour differential, can vary significantly, causing our refining and marketing gross margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude. In general, a larger sweet/sour differential will enhance our refining and marketing gross margin. Historically, WTI has traded at prices similar to LLS. During 2012 and 2011, WTI traded at prices significantly less than LLS, which favorably impacted our refining and marketing gross margin. The logistical constraints in the U.S. mid-continent markets have prevented the price of WTI from rising with the prices of crude oil produced in other regions. Future differentials will be dependent on changes made to the logistical infrastructure. 45 Table of Contents The following table provides sensitivities showing the estimated change in annual net income, including the impact of the Galveston Bay refinery, due to potential changes in market conditions. (In millions, after-tax) LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread sensitivity (a) (per $1.00/barrel change) $ 425 Sweet/sour differential sensitivity (b) (per $1.00/barrel change) 225 LLS-WTI spread sensitivity (c) (per $1.00/barrel change) 75 Natural gas price sensitivity (per $1.00/million British thermal unit change) 140 (a) Weighted 38% Chicago and 62% USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads and assumes all other differentials and pricing relationships remain unchanged. (b) LLS (prompt) - [delivered cost of sour crude oil: Arab Light, Kuwait, Maya, Western Canadian Select and Mars]. (c) Assumes 20% of crude oil throughput volumes are WTI-based domestic crude oil. In addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads, the sweet/sour differential and the discount of WTI to LLS, our refining and marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as: the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed; the selling prices realized for refined products; the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to hedge price risk; the cost of products purchased for resale; and changes in manufacturing costs, which include depreciation and amortization. Changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries, including purchased natural gas, and the level of maintenance costs. Planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. The following table lists the refineries that had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities for each of the last three years. Year Refinery 2012 Catlettsburg, Detroit, Garyville and Robinson 2011 Canton and Catlettsburg 2010 Catlettsburg, Detroit, Garyville, Robinson and Texas City The table below sets forth the location and daily crude oil refining capacity of each of our refineries at December 31 of each year. The acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery (not shown below) on February 1, 2013 increased our crude oil refining capacity to approximately 1.7 mmbpcd. Crude Oil Refining Capacity (mbpcd) Refinery 2012 2011 2010 Garyville, Louisiana 522 490 464 Catlettsburg, Kentucky 240 233 212 Robinson, Illinois 206 206 206 Detroit, Michigan 120 106 106 Canton, Ohio 80 78 78 Texas City, Texas 80 80 76 Total 1,248 1,193 1,142 46 Table of Contents Speedway Our retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillates, which is the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, impacts the Speedway segment profitability. Numerous factors impact gasoline and distillates demand throughout the year, including local competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions. The demand for gasoline in the Midwest region is estimated to have declined by less than half a percent in 2012 after decreasing by more than two percent in 2011. Stronger economic growth supported demand, but was offset by slightly higher prices and increasing vehicle efficiency. Unseasonably warm winter weather early in 2012 contributed to an estimated one percent decline in Midwest distillate demand in 2012, which followed a slight decrease in demand in 2011. Market demand increases for gasoline and distillates generally increase the product margin we can realize. The gross margin on merchandise sold at convenience stores historically has been less volatile. Approximately two-thirds of Speedway gross margin was derived from merchandise sales in 2012. Pipeline Transportation The profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. A majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our common carrier pipelines serve our Refining & Marketing segment. In 2012, new transportation services agreements were entered into between MPC and MPLX, which resulted in higher tariff rates. The volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines. Key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. The volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines. In most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillates peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from May through September of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. As with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements. 47 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 Consolidated Results of Operations (In millions) 2012 2011 Variance Revenues and other income: Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) $ 82,235 $ 78,583 $ 3,652 Sales to related parties 8 55 (47) Income from equity method investments 26 50 (24) Net gain on disposal of assets 177 12 165 Other income 46 59 (13) Total revenues and other income 82,492 78,759 3,733 Costs and expenses: Cost of revenues (excludes items below) 68,668 65,795 2,873 Purchases from related parties 280 1,916 (1,636) Consumer excise taxes 5,709 5,114 595 Depreciation and amortization 995 891 104 Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,223 1,059 164 Other taxes 270 239 31 Total costs and expenses 77,145 75,014 2,131 Income from operations 5,347 3,745 1,602 Related party net interest and other financial income 1 35 (34) Net interest and other financial income (costs) (110) (61) (49) Income before income taxes 5,238 3,719 1,519 Provision for income taxes 1,845 1,330 515 Net income 3,393 2,389 1,004 Less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 4 - 4 Net income attributable to MPC $ 3,389 $ 2,389 $ 1,000 Net income attributable to MPC was $1.00 billion higher in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to a higher refining and marketing gross margin, which increased to $10.45 per barrel in 2012 from $7.75 per barrel in 2011. Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) increased $3.65 billion in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to increases in refined product selling prices and sales volumes, crude oil and refinery feedstock sales volumes and consumer excise taxes. Sales to related parties decreased $47 million in 2012 compared to 2011. The decrease resulted from lower refined product volumes sold to Centennial Pipeline LLC ( Centennial ) and sales to Marathon Oil after the Spinoff no longer being classified as related party. Income from equity method investments decreased $24 million in 2012 compared to 2011. The decrease resulted from an $18 million decrease in income from our ethanol investments and an $8 million decrease in income from our investment in LOOP LLC ( LOOP ). Our ethanol investments experienced lower product margins in 2012, primarily due to lower demand for corn ethanol and higher corn prices, and LOOP experienced higher expenses in 2012 compared to 2011. Additionally, Centennial experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 that continued in 2012. At December 31, 2012, Centennial was not shipping product. As a result, we continued to evaluate the carrying value of our equity investment in Centennial and concluded that no impairment was required given our assessment of its fair value based on various uses for Centennial assets. 48 Table of Contents Other income decreased $13 million in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to a decrease in income from transition services provided to the buyer of our Minnesota Assets and to Marathon Oil and a decrease in sales of Renewable Identification Numbers. These decreases were partially offset by $12 million of dividend income recognized in 2012 from our preferred equity interest in the buyer of our Minnesota Assets, which was paid in connection with our settlement agreement with the buyer. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 7 for additional information on the Minnesota Assets sale and subsequent settlement with the buyer. Cost of revenues increased $2.87 billion in 2012 compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher acquisition costs of crude oil and refined products in the Refining & Marketing segment, which resulted from increased volumes, partially offset by decreased prices. The increase in crude oil volumes was partially due to purchases from Marathon Oil not being classified as related party purchases in periods subsequent to the Spinoff. These impacts were partially offset by decreased acquisition costs of other charge and blendstocks, due to decreased volumes and prices. Crude oil volumes were up 6 percent and refined product volumes were up 8 percent, while other charge and blendstocks volumes were down 7 percent. Crude oil acquisition prices were down 1 percent, charge and blendstock prices were down 6 percent and purchased refined product prices were down 4 percent. Purchases from related parties decreased $1.64 billion in 2012 compared to 2011. The decrease was primarily due to purchases of crude oil from Marathon Oil after the Spinoff not being classified as related party transactions. Consumer excise taxes increased $595 million in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to the expiration of a federal excise tax credit for blending ethanol and increased excise tax in select states. Depreciation and amortization increased $104 million in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to the completion of the heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our Detroit refinery and Speedway acquisition of 97 convenience stores in 2012. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $164 million in 2012 compared to 2011. Employee compensation and benefit expenses comprised $141 million of the increase, which was primarily due to $117 million of higher pension settlement expenses in 2012 and an increase in the number of administrative employees associated with being a stand-alone company for a full year in 2012 compared to half of the year in 2011, partially offset by a decrease in pension expenses associated with a pension plan amendment. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 22 for additional information on the pension settlements and the pension plan amendment. Contract service expenses increased $52 million primarily due to higher information technology costs, higher refinery-related contract services and contract services associated with the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets. These impacts were partially offset by having no allocations from Marathon Oil subsequent to the Spinoff. Other taxes increased $31 million in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to increases in operating taxes of $11 million, personal property taxes of $8 million, real estate taxes of $7 million and franchise taxes of $6 million. These increases were attributable to a number of factors including the completion of the heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our Detroit refinery, Speedway acquisition of 97 convenience stores and higher feedstock inventory values. Related party net interest and other financial income decreased $34 million in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to our short-term investments in preferred stock of MOC Portfolio Delaware, Inc. ( PFD ), a subsidiary of Marathon Oil, being redeemed prior to the Spinoff. The agreement with PFD was terminated on June 30, 2011. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 for further discussion of the PFD preferred stock. 49 Table of Contents Net interest and other financial costs increased $49 million in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily reflecting an increase in interest expense associated with the $3.0 billion senior notes issued in February 2011, a decrease in foreign currency gains and an increase in bank service and other fees. We capitalized third-party interest of $101 million in 2012 compared to $104 million in 2011. The capitalized interest was primarily associated with the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project. Provision for income taxes increased $515 million 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to the $1.52 billion increase in income before income taxes. The effective income tax rate decreased from 36 percent in 2011 to 35 percent in 2012. The 2012 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by a decrease in adverse tax impacts from state legislation and other permanent benefit differences. For years 2012 and 2011, adverse tax impacts of state legislation were $9 million and $19 million, respectively. The provision for income taxes for periods prior to the Spinoff has been computed as if we were a stand-alone company. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 13 for further details. Segment Results Revenues are summarized by segment in the following table. (In millions) 2012 2011 Refining & Marketing $ 76,710 $ 73,381 Speedway 14,243 13,490 Pipeline Transportation 459 403 Segment revenues 91,412 87,274 Elimination of intersegment revenues (9,167) (8,636) Total revenues $ 82,245 $ 78,638 Items included in both revenues and costs: Consumer excise taxes $ 5,709 $ 5,114 Refining & Marketing segment revenues increased $3.33 billion in 2012 from 2011, primarily due to increased refined product selling prices and sales volumes. Our average refined product selling prices were $3.00 per gallon in 2012 compared to $2.93 per gallon in 2011. The table below shows the average refined product benchmark prices for our marketing areas. (Dollars per gallon) 2012 2011 Chicago spot unleaded regular gasoline $ 2.84 $ 2.79 Chicago spot ultra-low sulfur diesel 3.01 2.98 USGC spot unleaded regular gasoline 2.81 2.75 USGC spot ultra-low sulfur diesel 3.05 2.97 Refining & Marketing intersegment sales to our Speedway segment were $8.78 billion in 2012 compared to $8.30 billion in 2011. Intersegment refined product sales volumes were 2.73 billion gallons in 2012 compared to 2.66 billion gallons in 2011, with the increased volumes primarily due to Speedway acquisition of 97 convenience stores in 2012. Speedway segment revenues increased $753 million in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to higher gasoline and distillates sales volumes and selling prices, which averaged $3.54 per gallon in 2012 compared to $3.44 per gallon in 2011. The Speedway segment also had higher merchandise sales excluding cigarettes. The increases in gasoline and distillates sales volumes and merchandise sales were primarily due to the acquisition of 97 convenience stores in 2012. 50 Table of Contents Pipeline Transportation segment revenue increased $56 million in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to higher transportation tariffs resulting from increased tariff rates in 2012 and the startup of a new crude oil pipeline in 2012. Income before income taxes and income from operations by segment are summarized in the following table.

Refining & Marketing segment income from operations increased $1.51 billion in 2012 from 2011, primarily due to a higher refining and marketing gross margin per barrel, which averaged $10.45 per barrel in 2012 compared to $7.75 per barrel in 2011. Our realized Refining & Marketing gross margin for 2012 benefited from increases in the Chicago and USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread of $3.36 per barrel and the sweet/sour differential of $3.36 per barrel in 2012, and we estimate these had positive impacts on our Refining & Marketing gross margin of $1.68 billion and $870 million, respectively. These favorable impacts on our Refining & Marketing gross margin for 2012 compared to 2011 were partially offset by higher cost realizations of the actual mix of crude oils we processed compared to market indicators and higher direct operating costs associated with higher planned turnaround and major maintenance expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses. 51 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our refinery throughputs for 2012 and 2011. (mbpd) 2012 2011 Refinery Throughputs: Crude oil refined 1,195 1,177 Other charge and blendstocks 168 181 Total 1,363 1,358 The increase in crude oil throughput in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the increased crude oil refining capacities of the Garyville and Catlettsburg refineries and the impacts of the planned turnarounds in 2012 and 2011. The decrease in other charge and blendstocks throughput in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the planned turnarounds in 2012 and a combination of increased crude oil throughput and feedstock economics at our Garyville refinery in 2012. Within our refining system, sour crude accounted for 53 percent and 52 percent of our crude oil processed in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The following table includes certain key operating statistics for the Refining & Marketing segment for 2012 and 2011. 2012 2011 Refining & Marketing gross margin (Dollars per barrel) (a) $ 10.45 $ 7.75 Direct operating costs in Refining & Marketing gross margin (Dollars per barrel) : (b) Planned turnaround and major maintenance $ 1.00 $ 0.78 Depreciation and amortization 1.44 1.29 Other manufacturing (c) 3.15 3.16 Total $ 5.59 $ 5.23 Refined products sales volumes (mbpd) (d) 1,599 1,581 (a) Sales revenue less cost of refinery inputs, purchased products and manufacturing expenses, including depreciation and amortization, divided by Refining & Marketing segment refined product sales volumes. (b) Per barrel of total refinery throughputs. (c) Includes utilities, labor, routine maintenance and other operating costs. (d) Includes intersegment sales. Speedway segment income from operations increased $39 million in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to increases in our merchandise gross margin and our gasoline and distillates gross margin, partially offset by higher expenses attributable to an increase in the number of convenience stores. The increase in the merchandise gross margin was primarily due to margin expansion resulting from higher merchandise and food sales along with an increase in the number of convenience stores. 52 Table of Contents The following table includes certain key operating statistics for the Speedway segment for 2012 and 2011. 2012 2011 Convenience stores at period-end 1,464 1,371 Gasoline & distillates sales (millions of gallons) 3,027 2,938 Gasoline & distillates gross margin (dollars per gallon) (a) $ 0.1318 $ 0.1308 Merchandise sales (in millions) $ 3,058 $ 2,924 Merchandise gross margin (in millions) $ 795 $ 719 (a) The price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, divided by gasoline and distillates sales volume. Same-store gasoline sales volume decreased 0.8 percent in 2012 compared to 2011, while same-store merchandise sales excluding cigarettes increased 7.0 percent for the same period. The primary factor affecting lower same store gasoline sales volume was lower gasoline demand in our market area. Pipeline Transportation segment income from operations increased $17 million in 2012 from 2011. The increase primarily reflects higher transportation tariffs, partially offset by higher mechanical integrity expenses and a reduction in income from LOOP. Corporate and other unallocated expenses increased $20 million in 2012 compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to our administrative units realizing the impact of being a stand-alone company in 2012 compared to expenses incurred prior to the June 30, 2011 Spinoff, partially offset by lower pension expenses associated with a pension plan amendment in the second quarter of 2012. We recognized a gain of $183 million in 2012 associated with the settlement agreement with the buyer of our Minnesota Assets, which included $86 million of the deferred gain that was recorded when the sale transaction was originally closed. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7 for additional information on the Minnesota Assets sale and subsequent settlement with the buyer. We recorded pretax pension settlement expenses of $124 million in 2012 resulting from the level of employee lump sum retirement distributions that occurred in 2012. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 22 for additional information on the pension plan amendments. 53 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 Consolidated Results of Operations (In millions) 2011 2010 Variance Revenues and other income: Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) $ 78,583 $ 62,387 $ 16,196 Sales to related parties 55 100 (45) Income from equity method investments 50 70 (20) Net gain on disposal of assets 12 11 1 Other income 59 37 22 Total revenues and other income 78,759 62,605 16,154 Costs and expenses: Cost of revenues (excludes items below) 65,795 51,731 14,064 Purchases from related parties 1,916 2,593 (677) Consumer excise taxes 5,114 5,208 (94) Depreciation and amortization 891 941 (50) Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,059 874 185 Other taxes 239 247 (8) Total costs and expenses 75,014 61,594 13,420 Income from operations 3,745 1,011 2,734 Related party net interest and other financial income 35 24 11 Net interest and other financial income (costs) (61) (12) (49) Income before income taxes 3,719 1,023 2,696 Provision for income taxes 1,330 400 930 Net income $ 2,389 $ 623 $ 1,766 Consolidated net income was $1.77 billion higher in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to a higher refining and marketing gross margin, which increased to $7.75 per barrel in 2011 from $2.81 per barrel in 2010. Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) increased $16.20 billion in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to higher refined product selling prices. Sales to related parties decreased $45 million in 2011 compared to 2010. The decrease resulted from sales to Marathon Oil after the Spinoff no longer being classified as related party and lower refined product volumes sold to Centennial, partially offset by higher refined product selling prices. Income from equity method investments decreased $20 million from 2010 to 2011, primarily due to $12 million of increased losses from our investment in Centennial. Centennial experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 compared to the corresponding period of 2010. Also, 2010 included $4 million of income from an investment in a pipeline company that was included in the Minnesota Assets disposition. Other income increased $22 million in 2011 compared with 2010, due primarily to income from transition services provided to the purchaser of the Minnesota Assets and to Marathon Oil. 54 Table of Contents Cost of revenues increased $14.06 billion in 2011 from 2010. The increase was primarily the result of higher acquisition costs of crude oil, refinery charge and blendstocks and refined products in the Refining & Marketing segment, largely due to higher market prices. Crude oil acquisition prices were up 31 percent, charge and blendstock prices were up 28 percent and purchased refined product prices were up 40 percent. Purchases from related parties decreased $677 million in 2011 compared to 2010. The decrease was primarily due to purchases of crude oil from Marathon Oil after the Spinoff not being classified as related party transactions. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $185 million in 2011 compared with 2010. Employee compensation and benefits expenses comprised $81 million of the increase, which is partially due to an increase in the number of administrative employees associated with being a stand-alone public company, higher incentive compensation accruals related to 2011 performance and increased pension and postretirement benefit costs. Contract services expenses increased $62 million, primarily due to higher information technology costs associated with being a separate stand-alone company. In addition, bankcard processing fees related to Marathon brand sales increased $41 million, primarily due to higher transportation fuel selling prices. Following the Spinoff, we no longer receive allocated corporate overhead costs from Marathon Oil. Related party net interest and other financial income increased $11 million in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily reflecting higher average balances of our short-term investments in PFD preferred stock. The agreement with PFD was terminated on June 30, 2011. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 for further discussion of the PFD preferred stock. Net interest and other financial costs increased $49 million in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily reflecting increased interest expense associated with the $3.0 billion of long-term debt we issued in February 2011. We capitalized third-party interest of $104 million in 2011 compared to $17 million in 2010. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 20 for further details relating to our debt. Provision for income taxes increased $930 million from 2010 to 2011, primarily due to the $2.70 billion increase in income before income taxes. The effective income tax rate decreased from 39 percent in 2010 to 36 percent in 2011. The 2011 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by an increase in income qualifying for the domestic manufacturing deduction and a decrease in the effective tax rate for state taxes. The year 2011 included a $19 million adverse tax impact of state legislative changes, primarily in Michigan, and 2010 included a $26 million adverse tax impact of federal legislative changes. The provision for income taxes for periods prior to the Spinoff has been computed as if we were a stand-alone company. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 13 for further details. Segment Results Revenues are summarized by segment in the following table. (In millions) 2011 2010 Refining & Marketing $ 73,381 $ 57,333 Speedway 13,490 12,494 Pipeline Transportation 403 401 Segment revenues 87,274 70,228 Elimination of intersegment revenues (8,636) (7,741) Total revenues $ 78,638 $ 62,487 Items included in both revenues and costs: Consumer excise taxes $ 5,114 $ 5,208 55 Table of Contents Refining & Marketing segment revenues increased $16.05 billion in 2011 from 2010, primarily due to increased refined product selling prices. Our average refined product selling prices were $2.93 per gallon in 2011 compared to $2.24 per gallon in 2010. The table below shows the average refined product benchmark prices for our marketing areas. (Dollars per gallon) 2011 2010 Chicago spot unleaded regular gasoline $ 2.79 $ 2.09 Chicago spot ultra-low sulfur diesel 2.98 2.17 USGC spot unleaded regular gasoline 2.75 2.05 USGC spot ultra-low sulfur diesel 2.97 2.16 Refining & Marketing intersegment sales to our Speedway segment were $8.30 billion in 2011 compared to $7.39 billion in 2010. Intersegment refined product sales volumes were 2.66 billion gallons in 2011 compared to 3.11 billion gallons in 2010, with the decreased volumes primarily due to the Minnesota Assets disposition. Speedway segment revenues increased $996 million from 2010 to 2011, mainly due to higher gasoline and distillates selling prices, which averaged $3.44 per gallon in 2011 compared to $2.70 per gallon in 2010. These impacts were partially offset by decreased gasoline and distillates sales volumes and lower merchandise sales primarily due to the Minnesota Assets disposition in December 2010. Income before income taxes and income from operations by segment are summarized in the following table. (In millions) 2011 2010 Income from operations by segment: Refining & Marketing $ 3,591 $ 800 Speedway 271 293 Pipeline Transportation 199 183 Items not allocated to segments: Corporate and other unallocated items (a) (316) (236) Impairments (b) - (29) Income from operations 3,745 1,011 Net interest and other financial income (costs) (c) (26) 12 Income before income taxes $ 3,719 $ 1,023 (a) Corporate and other unallocated items consists primarily of MPC corporate administrative expenses, including allocations from Marathon Oil for periods prior to the Spinoff, and costs related to certain non-operating assets. (b) The impairment in 2010 was related to a maleic anhydride plant. (c) Includes related party net interest and other financial income. The following table presents certain market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our Refining & Marketing segment business. (Dollars per barrel) 2011 2010 Chicago LLS 6-3-2-1 (a)(b) $ 3.81 $ 3.02 USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 (a) 2.84 2.13 Blended 6-3-2-1 (a)(c) 3.35 2.64 LLS 112.37 82.83 WTI 95.11 79.61 LLS - WTI differential (a) 17.26 3.22 Sweet/Sour differential (a)(d) 9.11 7.57 (a) All spreads and differentials are measured against prompt LLS. (b) Calculation utilizes USGC 3% Bunker value as a proxy for Chicago residual fuel price. (c) Blended Chicago/USGC crack spread is 53%/47% in 2011 and 57%/43% in 2010 based on MPC refining capacity by region in each period. (d) LLS (prompt) - [delivered cost of sour crude oil: Arab Light, Kuwait, Maya, Western Canadian Select and Mars]. 56 Table of Contents Refining & Marketing segment income from operations increased $2.79 billion in 2011 from 2010, primarily due to a higher refining and marketing gross margin per barrel, which averaged $7.75 per barrel in 2011 compared to $2.81 per barrel in 2010. Our realized refining and marketing gross margin for 2011 improved from 2010 primarily due to wider differentials between WTI and other light sweet crudes such as LLS, larger LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads, and wider sweet/sour differentials. The discount of WTI to LLS increased $14.04 per barrel as a result of logistical constraints in the U.S. mid-continent markets, which prevented the price of WTI from rising with the prices of crudes produced in other regions. We estimate this had a $1.69 billion positive impact on our refining and marketing gross margin. The Chicago and USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads increased $0.79 per barrel and $0.71 per barrel, respectively, and we estimate this had a $349 million positive impact on our refining and marketing gross margin. The sweet/sour differential widened $1.54 per barrel and we estimate this had a $277 million positive impact on our refining and marketing gross margin. Within our refining system, sour crude accounted for 52 percent and 54 percent of our crude oil processed in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Direct operating costs declined $248 million from 2010 to 2011, primarily due to a $188 million reduction in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs, which also contributed to the increase in gross margin. The following table summarizes our refinery throughputs for 2011 and 2010. (mbpd) 2011 2010 Refinery Throughputs: Crude oil refined 1,177 1,173 Other charge and blendstocks 181 162 Total 1,358 1,335 Our total refinery throughputs were two percent higher in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to improved refinery utilization and decreased turnaround activity in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily at our Garyville refinery, partially offset by the sale of the St. Paul Park refinery in December 2010. Crude oil refined was essentially flat in 2011 compared to 2010, while other charge and blendstock throughputs increased 12 percent over the same period. The following table includes certain key operating statistics for the Refining & Marketing segment for 2011 and 2010. 2011 2010 Refining & Marketing gross margin (Dollars per barrel) (a) $ 7.75 $ 2.81 Direct operating costs in Refining & Marketing gross margin (Dollars per barrel) : (b) Planned turnaround and major maintenance $ 0.78 $ 1.19 Depreciation and amortization 1.29 1.32 Other manufacturing (c) 3.16 3.32 Total $ 5.23 $ 5.83 Refined products sales volumes (mbpd) (d) 1,581 1,573 (a) Sales revenue less cost of refinery inputs, purchased products and manufacturing expenses, including depreciation and amortization, divided by Refining & Marketing segment refined product sales volumes. (b) Per barrel of total refinery throughputs. (c) Includes utilities, labor, routine maintenance and other operating costs. (d) Includes intersegment sales. 57 Table of Contents Speedway segment income from operations decreased $22 million from 2010 to 2011, with $45 million attributable to the sale of 166 convenience stores that were part of the Minnesota Assets disposition in December 2010 and $33 million attributable to increased operating expenses partially due to higher employee costs. These decreases were partially offset by a $30 million increase associated with a higher gasoline and distillates gross margin and a $26 million increase associated with a higher merchandise gross margin. Speedway gasoline and distillates gross margin per gallon averaged 13.08 cents in 2011, compared with 12.07 cents in 2010. Gasoline and distillates sales volumes declined in 2011 primarily reflecting the sale of the Minnesota Assets. Merchandise gross margin was $719 million in 2011 compared to $789 million in 2010, also reflecting the Minnesota Assets disposition. Same-store gasoline sales volume decreased 1.7 percent in 2011 compared to 2010, while same-store merchandise sales excluding cigarettes increased 6.7 percent for the same period. The primary factor affecting same store gasoline sales volume was the higher average retail price of gasoline. Pipeline Transportation segment income from operations increased $16 million in 2011 from 2010. The increase primarily reflects the absence of non-routine maintenance and impairment expenses incurred in 2010, partially offset by a reduction in income from pipeline equity method investments. Refined product throughput volumes increased seven percent in 2011 compared to 2010, while crude oil throughput volumes decreased two percent in the same period. Corporate and other unallocated items increased $80 million in 2011 compared to 2010 due to higher information technology, employee benefits and other administrative expenses, partially resulting from costs associated with being a stand-alone company. Following the Spinoff, we no longer receive allocated corporate overhead costs from Marathon Oil. Impairment expense in 2010 was a $29 million property impairment related to a maleic anhydride plant, which was operated by our Refining & Marketing segment. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $4.86 billion at December 31, 2012 compared to $3.08 billion at December 31, 2011. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the past three years is presented in the following table. (In millions) 2012 2011 2010 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 4,492 $ 3,309 $ 2,217 Investing activities (1,452) 1,295 (2,145) Financing activities (1,259) (1,643) (82) Total $ 1,781 $ 2,961 $ (10) Net cash provided from operating activities increased $1.18 billion in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to higher net income and noncash income adjustments in 2012, partially offset by changes in working capital. Net cash provided from operating activities increased $1.09 billion in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to higher net income in 2011, partially offset by changes in working capital and lower deferred income taxes. 58 Table of Contents Changes in working capital were a net $428 million use of cash in 2012, primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulting primarily from reductions in crude oil prices and payable volumes, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable resulting primarily from reductions in crude oil prices and receivable volumes. Changes in working capital were a net $13 million source of cash in 2011, primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulting primarily from increases in crude oil prices and payable volumes, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable resulting primarily from increases in crude oil prices and receivable volumes and refined product prices. Changes in working capital were a net $318 million source of cash in 2010, primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulting primarily from increases in crude oil prices and payable volumes, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable resulting primarily from increases in crude oil and refined product prices and crude oil receivable volumes. Cash flows from investing activities decreased $2.75 billion in 2012 compared to 2011 and increased $3.44 billion in 2011 compared to 2010. The investing activity is further discussed below. The consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash. A reconciliation of additions to property, plant and equipment to reported total capital expenditures and investments follows for each of the last three years. (In millions) 2012 2011 2010 Additions to property, plant and equipment $ 1,369 $ 1,185 $ 1,217 Acquisitions (a) 180 74 - Increase (decrease) in capital accruals (117 ) 53 (51 ) Total capital expenditures 1,432 1,312 1,166 Investments in equity method investees 28 11 7 Total capital expenditures and investments $ 1,460 $ 1,323 $ 1,173 (a) Excludes inventory acquired and liability assumed in 2012. Capital expenditures and investments for each of the last three years are summarized by segment below. (In millions) 2012 2011 2010 Refining & Marketing $ 705 $ 900 $ 961 Speedway (a) 340 164 84 Pipeline Transportation 211 121 24 Corporate and Other (b) 204 138 104 Total $ 1,460 $ 1,323 $ 1,173 (a) Includes acquisitions of 97 convenience stores in 2012 and 23 convenience stores in 2011. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6. (b) Includes capitalized interest of $101 million, $114 million and $103 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project, which we completed in 2012, comprised 46 percent, 59 percent and 50 percent (excluding capitalized interest associated with this project) of our Refining & Marketing segment capital spending in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Cash used in acquisitions, as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows, totaled $190 million in 2012 and $74 million in 2011, which relates to the 97 convenience stores Speedway acquired in 2012 and the 23 convenience stores Speedway acquired in 2011. Cash provided by disposal of assets totaled $53 million, $144 million and $763 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The $53 million of cash from asset disposals in 2012 primarily included proceeds from a settlement 59 Table of Contents agreement with the buyer of our Minnesota Assets. The $144 million of cash from asset disposals in 2011 primarily included the collection of a receivable associated with the sale of the Minnesota Assets. In 2010, disposal of assets primarily included proceeds from the original sale of the Minnesota Assets. Net investments in related party debt securities was a source of cash of $2.40 billion in 2011 and a use of cash of $1.69 billion in 2010. All such activity reflected the net cash flow from redemptions and purchases of PFD preferred stock. Prior to the Spinoff, all investments in PFD preferred stock were redeemed, and the agreement with PFD was terminated. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 for further discussion of our investments in PFD preferred stock. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1.26 billion in 2012, $1.64 billion in 2011 and $82 million in 2010. The net use of cash in 2012 was primarily due to the common stock repurchases under our ASR programs and dividend payments, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of MPLX common units. The use of cash in 2011 was primarily due to the net repayment of debt payable to Marathon Oil and its subsidiaries and net distributions to Marathon Oil, partially offset by cash provided from the issuance of long-term debt. These 2011 activities were undertaken to effect the Spinoff. The year 2011 also included a use of cash of $60 million for debt issuance costs associated with the $3.0 billion of senior notes, our $2.0 billion revolving credit agreement and our $1.0 billion trade receivables securitization facility. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 20 for additional information on our long-term debt. The net use of cash in 2010 was primarily due to distributions to Marathon Oil, partially offset by net borrowings of debt payable to Marathon Oil. Cash used in common stock repurchases totaled $1.35 billion in 2012 associated with the share repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors. We entered into an $850 million ASR program on February 3, 2012, under which we repurchased 20,357,380 shares at an average cost of $41.75 per share, and a $500 million ASR program on November 5, 2012, under which we received 7,403,294 shares as of December 31, 2012 and 870,947 shares in February 2013. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 for further discussion of the share repurchase plan. Cash used in dividend payments increased $247 million in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to having a full year of dividend payments in 2012 and a 75 percent increase in our base dividend since July 2011, partially offset by a decrease in the number of outstanding shares of our common stock attributable to the ASR programs. Our quarterly dividend began at 20 cents per common share in July 2011 and has increased to 35 cents per common share as of December 31, 2012. Cash proceeds from the issuance of MPLX common units was $407 million in 2012, of which $203 million was distributed by MPLX to MPC, in partial consideration of assets we contributed to MPLX and to reimburse us for certain capital expenditures incurred with respect to those assets. The initial public offering represented the sale of a 26.4 percent interest in MPLX. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 for further discussion of MPLX and its initial public offering. Net borrowings and repayments under our long-term debt payable to Marathon Oil and its subsidiaries was a use of cash of $3.62 billion in 2011 compared with a source of cash of $1.26 billion in 2010. The agreements with Marathon Oil and its subsidiaries were terminated in 2011. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 for further discussion of these financing agreements. Net distributions to Marathon Oil totaled $783 million in 2011 and $1.33 billion in 2010. The net distribution in 2011 was primarily related to $1.47 billion in net cash distributions paid to Marathon Oil, partially offset by income taxes it incurred on our behalf. The net distribution in 2010 was primarily related to $1.48 billion in cash distributions paid to Marathon Oil. Derivative Instruments See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk. 60 Table of Contents Capital Resources Our intention is to maintain an investment grade credit profile. As of December 31, 2012, our liquidity totaled $7.86 billion consisting of: (In millions) December 31, 2012 Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,860 Revolving credit agreement (a) 2,000 Trade receivables securitization facility 1,000 Total $ 7,860 (a) Excludes MPLX revolving credit agreement and does not give effect to subsequent increase in capacity to $2.5 billion. As of December 31, 2012, we had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit agreement or our trade receivables securitization facility. Because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements, including capital spending programs, the repurchase of shares of our common stock, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. On September 14, 2012, we entered into a five-year revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement ) with a syndicate of lenders and terminated our previous four-year revolving credit agreement. The Credit Agreement was amended on December 20, 2012 to increase the borrowing capacity by $500 million to a total of $2.5 billion. The commitment increase became effective on February 1, 2013 in conjunction with the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets. The Credit Agreement includes letter of credit issuing capacity of up to $2.0 billion and swingline loan capacity of up to $100 million. We may increase the borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement by up to an additional $500 million, subject to certain conditions including the consent of the lenders whose commitments would be increased. In addition, we may request that the term of the Credit Agreement, which expires on September 14, 2017, be extended for up to two additional one-year periods. Each such extension would be subject to the approval of lenders holding greater than 50 percent of the commitments then outstanding, and the commitment of any lender that does not consent to an extension of the maturity date will be terminated on the then-effective maturity date. The Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for an agreement of this type. The financial covenant included in the Credit Agreement requires us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to Total Capitalization (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2012, we were in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization of -0.1 to 1.00, as well as the other covenants contained in the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Credit Agreement includes limitations on the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, other than subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under the Credit Agreement and our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to incur liens on property or assets or enter into certain transactions with affiliates. Borrowings of revolving loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either (i) the sum of the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and a margin ranging between 1.00 percent to 2.00 percent, depending on our credit ratings, or (ii) the sum of the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and a margin ranging between zero percent to 1.00 percent, depending on our credit ratings. The Credit Agreement also provides for customary fees, including administrative agent fees, annual commitment fees ranging from 0.10 percent to 0.35 percent, depending on our credit ratings, on the unused portion, fees in respect to letters of credit and other fees. 61 Table of Contents On September 14, 2012, MPLX Operations LLC, an affiliate of MPC and wholly-owned subsidiary of MPLX, as the borrower, and MPLX, as the parent guarantor, entered into a five-year revolving credit agreement ( MPLX Credit Agreement ) with a syndicate of lenders. The MPLX Credit Agreement became effective following MPLX initial public offering and has an initial borrowing capacity of $500 million. MPLX may increase the borrowing capacity under the MPLX Credit Agreement by up to an additional $300 million, subject to certain conditions, including the consent of the lenders whose commitments would be increased. The MPLX Credit Agreement includes letter of credit issuing capacity of up to $250 million and swingline loan capacity of up to $50 million. MPLX may, subject to certain conditions, request that the term of the MPLX Credit Agreement, which expires on October 31, 2017, be extended for up to two additional one-year periods. Each such extension would be subject to the approval of lenders holding greater than 50 percent of the commitments then outstanding, and the commitment of any lender that does not consent to an extension of the maturity date will be terminated on the then-effective maturity date. At December 31, 2012, MPLX had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under this agreement. The MPLX Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for an agreement of that type. The financial covenant included in the MPLX Credit Agreement requires MPLX to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 during the six-month period following certain acquisitions). As of December 31, 2012, MPLX was in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of 0.1 to 1.0, as well as the other covenants contained in the MPLX Credit Agreement. Borrowings of revolving loans under the MPLX Credit Agreement bear interest at either (i) the sum of the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) and a margin ranging from 1.00 percent to 2.00 percent or (ii) the sum of the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) and a margin ranging from zero percent to 1.00 percent. Prior to MPLX receiving a rating from Standard & Poor Rating Group or Moody Investor Service, Inc. for its Index Debt (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement), the margin that is added to the applicable interest rate is based on MPLX ratio of Consolidated Total Debt as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA for the prior four fiscal quarters. Once MPLX receives a rating, the margin added to the applicable interest rate will be based on MPLX credit ratings. The MPLX Credit Agreement also provides for customary fees, including administrative agent fees, commitment fees ranging from 0.10 percent to 0.35 percent of the unused portion, depending on MPLX ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA for the prior four fiscal quarters prior to the rating date, or MPLX credit ratings subsequent to the rating date, fronting and issuance fees in respect to letters of credit and other fees. As of December 31, 2012, the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows. Rating Agency Rating Moody Baa2 (stable outlook) Standard & Poor BBB (stable outlook) The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant. Neither our Credit Agreement, the MPLX Credit Agreement nor our trade receivables securitization facility contain credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. However, any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings would increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under our 62 Table of Contents Credit Agreement, the MPLX Credit Agreement and trade receivables securitization facility. In addition, a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment grade levels could, under certain circumstances, decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables securitization facility and could potentially impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis. Debt-to-Total-Capital Ratio Our debt-to-total capital ratio (total debt to total debt-plus-equity) was 22 percent and 26 percent at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. December 31, (In millions) 2012 2011 Long-term debt due within one year $ 19 $ 15 Long-term debt 3,342 3,292 Total debt $ 3,361 $ 3,307 Calculation of debt-to-total capital ratio: Total debt $ 3,361 $ 3,307 Plus equity 12,105 9,505 Total debt plus equity $ 15,466 $ 12,812 Debt-to-total capital ratio 22% 26% Capital Requirements We have a capital and investment budget for 2013 of $1.62 billion, excluding capitalized interest and the purchase price for the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets. Additional details related to the 2013 capital and investment budget are discussed in the Outlook section below. On February 1, 2013, we acquired the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets for approximately $598 million plus approximately $900 million for inventory. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement, we may also be required to pay BP a contingent earnout of up to an additional $700 million over six years, subject to certain conditions. This acquisition was paid for with cash on hand. We plan to make contributions of approximately $160 million to our funded pension plans in 2013. On January 30, 2013, our board of directors approved a 35 cents per share dividend, payable March 11, 2013 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2013. On February 1, 2012, we announced that our board of directors authorized a share repurchase plan, enabling us to purchase up to $2.0 billion of our common stock. On January 30, 2013, our board of directors approved an additional $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization and extended the unused amounts remaining on the February 1, 2012 authorization, with both authorizations ending December 2014. After the effects of the ASR programs described below, $2.65 billion of the $4.0 billion total share repurchase authorization is available. We may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market purchases, negotiated block transactions, ASRs or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing of future repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time. On February 3, 2012, we entered into an $850 million ASR program with a major financial institution as part of this authorization. Under this ASR program, we received 20,357,380 shares of our common stock in 2012, resulting in an average per share cost for these shares of $41.75. 63 Table of Contents On November 5, 2012, we entered into a second ASR program for $500 million. Under this ASR program, we received 7,403,294 shares of our common stock in 2012 and 870,947 shares in February 2013, for a total of 8,274,241 repurchased shares, which concluded this ASR program. Upon final settlement, the average per share cost for all shares purchased under this ASR program was $60.43. These ASR programs are accounted for as treasury stock purchase transactions, reducing the weighted average number of basic and diluted common shares outstanding by the repurchased shares, and as forward contracts indexed to our common stock. The above discussion of the share repurchase authorization includes forward-looking statements. Factors that could affect the share repurchase plan and its timing include, but are not limited to business conditions, availability of liquidity, and the market price of our common stock. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Contractual Cash Obligations The table below provides aggregated information on our consolidated obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of December 31, 2012. The contractual obligations detailed below do not include our contractual obligations to MPLX under various fee-based commercial agreements as these transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The contractual obligations detailed below include amounts paid at closing for the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets, but do not include obligations assumed upon closing. (In millions) Total 2013 2014-2015 2016-2017 Later Years Long-term debt (a) $ 5,878 $ 169 $ 332 $ 1,039 $ 4,338 Capital lease obligations 546 44 89 87 326 Operating lease obligations 612 151 254 129 78 Purchase obligations: (b) Crude oil, feedstock, refined product and renewable fuel contracts (c)(d) 11,545 10,302 765 395 83 Transportation and related contracts 1,700 144 267 315 974 Contracts to acquire property, plant and equipment (e)(f) 1,391 834 410 147 - Service and materials contracts (g) 1,315 355 339 216 405 Total purchase obligations 15,951 11,635 1,781 1,073 1,462 Other long-term liabilities reported in the consolidated balance sheet (h) 1,101 247 274 144 436 Total contractual cash obligations $ 24,088 $ 12,246 $ 2,730 $ 2,472 $ 6,640 (a) Includes interest payments for our senior notes and commitment and administrative fees for our Credit Agreement, the MPLX Credit Agreement and our trade receivables securitization facility. (b) Includes both short- and long-term purchases obligations. 64 Table of Contents (c) These contracts include variable price arrangements with estimated prices to be paid primarily based on current market conditions. We are in the process of implementing systems that will allow us to estimate prices based on futures curves, which as of December 31, 2012, has been implemented for contracts with purchase obligations of $1.78 billion. (d) Includes the approximate value of inventories included in the purchase of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets, which was completed on February 1, 2013. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 26. (e) Includes approximately $598 million in 2013 for the purchase of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets and $700 million for the contingent earnout provision. The acquisition was completed on February 1, 2013. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 26. (f) Includes obligations to advance funds to equity method investees. (g) Includes contracts to purchase services such as utilities, supplies and various other maintenance and operating services. (h) Primarily includes obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits including medical and life insurance, which we have estimated through 2022. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 22. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Although off-balance sheet arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on these arrangements to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources. We have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees. In conjunction with the Spinoff, we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to Marathon Oil. These arrangements are described in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 25. Outlook We have a capital and investment budget for 2013 of $1.62 billion, excluding capitalized interest and the purchase price for the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets. This represents a 19 percent increase from our 2012 spending, which is primarily due to increases in the Refining & Marketing segment. The budget includes spending on refining, retail marketing, transportation, logistics and brand marketing projects as well as amounts designated for corporate activities. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant. Refining & Marketing The 2013 capital budget includes $1.02 billion for our Refining & Marketing segment. The Refining & Marketing capital budget includes approximately $400 million for our Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets for synergy capital and the continuation of infrastructure investments and other programs begun by the prior owner. At our Garyville refinery, we have projects underway to optimize diesel and gasoline yields through modifications to the older crude unit, hydrocracker and the distillate hydrotreaters. Total capital spending is estimated at $225 million with projected capital spending of $117 million in 2013. The hydrocracker revamp is expected to be completed in 2014 and the completion of the final phase of the program is expected in 2015. At our Robinson refinery, we have a $75 million project to revamp our distillate hydrocracker to improve margins by processing more feedstock at a lower conversion and shifting approximately 10 mbpd of other products to diesel production. The amount of capital spending budgeted for this project in 2013 is $15 million. The project is expected to be completed in 2015. 65 Table of Contents At our Catlettsburg refinery, we have a $25 million project underway to recover additional volumes of gas oil from the refinery residual oil production to be processed in the fluidized catalytic cracker, thus increasing the production of higher valued gasoline and diesel. The amount of capital spending budgeted for this project in 2013 is $9 million. This project is expected to be completed in 2014. Our Refining & Marketing and Pipeline Transportation segments have approximately $300 million of capital projects that will allow us to process and handle crude oil and condensate from the Utica Shale region, of which approximately $110 million have been budgeted for in 2013. We have projects to invest in condensate splitters at our Canton and Catlettsburg refineries to allow the refineries to process up to 60 mbpd of condensate from the Utica Shale region. In addition, we have a truck-to-barge crude system project at our Wellsville asphalt terminal and expect to purchase new barges to allow Utica production to be transported from our Wellsville terminal to our Catlettsburg refinery. The remaining budget is primarily allocated to maintaining facilities and meeting regulatory requirements at our refineries. Speedway The 2013 capital budget includes $255 million for our Speedway segment, relating to new construction and acquisitions to expand our markets and remodeling and rebuilding projects for existing convenience stores to upgrade and enhance our existing facilities. Also included in the capital budget are expenditures for dispenser, equipment and technology upgrades. Pipeline Transportation The 2013 capital budget includes $184 million for our Pipeline Transportation segment, primarily for upgrades to replace or enhance our existing facilities, including our Patoka to Catlettsburg crude oil pipeline upgrade, and new infrastructure. Corporate and Other The remaining 2013 capital budget includes $160 million, primarily related to upgrades to information technology systems. In addition, we expect to record $43 million in capitalized interest, which is 57 percent less than 2012 primarily due to the completion of the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project. Our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors, including cash provided by operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. The discussion of liquidity and capital resources above also contains forward-looking statements regarding expected capital and investment spending, costs for projects under construction, project completion dates and expectations or projections about strategies and goals for growth, upgrades and expansion. The forward-looking statements about our capital and investment budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for crude oil and refinery feedstocks and refined products, actions of competitors, delays in obtaining necessary third-party approvals, changes in labor, materials, and equipment costs and availability, planned and unplanned outages, the delay of, cancellation of or failure to implement planned capital projects, project cost 66 Table of Contents overruns, disruptions or interruptions of our refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations. Transactions with Related Parties Following completion of the Spinoff on June 30, 2011, Marathon Oil retained no ownership interest in us and is no longer a related party. Purchases of crude oil and natural gas from Marathon Oil accounted for five percent or less of our total cost of revenues and purchases from related parties for the periods prior to the Spinoff. Related party purchases of crude oil and natural gas from Marathon Oil were at market-based contract prices. The crude oil prices were based on indices that represented market value for time and place of delivery and that were also used in third-party contracts. The natural gas prices equaled the price at which Marathon Oil purchased the natural gas from third parties plus the cost of transportation. We believe that transactions with related parties, other than certain transactions with Marathon Oil to effect the Spinoff and related to the provision of administrative services, were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties. On May 25, 2011, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and several other agreements with Marathon Oil to effect the Spinoff and to provide a framework for our relationship with Marathon Oil. Because the terms of our separation from Marathon Oil and these agreements were entered into in the context of a related-party transaction, the terms may not be comparable to terms that would be obtained in a transaction between unaffiliated parties. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 for further discussion of activity with related parties. Environmental Matters and Compliance Costs We have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products. Legislation and regulations pertaining to fuel specifications, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including costs of compliance and permitting delays. The extent and magnitude of these adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific regulatory and legislative requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists with respect to the measures being considered, the costs and the time frames for compliance, and our ability to pass compliance costs on to our customers. For additional information see Item 1A. Risk Factors. 67 Table of Contents Our environmental expenditures, based on the American Petroleum Institute definition of environmental expenditures, for each of the last three years were: (In millions) 2012 2011 2010 Capital $ 115 $ 167 $ 223 Compliance: Operating and maintenance 318 354 403 Remediation (a) 24 27 20 Total $ 457 $ 548 $ 646 (a) These amounts include spending charged against remediation reserves, where permissible, but exclude non-cash provisions recorded for environmental remediation. We accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. As environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required. New or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future. We believe we comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation or regulations, it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed. Our environmental capital expenditures accounted for 8 percent, 13 percent and 19 percent of capital expenditures in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our environmental capital expenditures are expected to approximate $41 million, or three percent, of total capital expenditures in 2013. Predictions beyond 2013 can only be broad-based estimates, which have varied, and will continue to vary, due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory requirements, the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies, among other matters. Based on currently identified projects, we anticipate that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately $86 million in 2014; however, actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed. We spent $620 million from 2008 through 2011 to comply with MSAT II regulations relating to benzene content in refined products. All MSAT II compliance units were in operation in 2011. For more information on environmental regulations that impact us, or could impact us, see Item 1. Business Environmental Matters, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( US GAAP ) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. 68 Table of Contents Fair Value Estimates Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach, each of which includes multiple valuation techniques. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset. This is often referred to as current replacement cost. The cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence. The fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and does not prioritize among the techniques. These standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques. Inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions, including assumptions about risk. Level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while Level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: Level 1 Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2 Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. These are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management best estimate of fair value. Valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy. We use a market or income approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to use the best information available. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 18 for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements. Significant uses of fair value measurements include: assessment of impairment of long-lived assets; assessment of impairment of goodwill; assessment of impairment of equity method investments; recorded value of derivative instruments; and recorded value of investments in debt and equity securities. 69 Table of Contents Impairment Assessments of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Equity Method Investments Fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our long-lived assets, goodwill and equity method investments for impairment is estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate. Significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted assumptions. Significant assumptions include: Future margins on products produced and sold . Our estimates of future product margins are based on our analysis of various supply and demand factors, which include, among other things, industry-wide capacity, our planned utilization rate, end-user demand, capital expenditures and economic conditions. Such estimates are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews. Future volumes. Our estimates of future pipeline throughput volumes are based on internal forecasts prepared by our Pipeline Transportation segment operations personnel. Discount rate commensurate with the risks involved . We apply a discount rate to our cash flows based on a variety of factors, including market and economic conditions, operational risk, regulatory risk and political risk. This discount rate is also compared to recent observable market transactions, if possible. A higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows. Future capital requirements . These are based on authorized spending and internal forecasts. We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable. However, actual results may differ from these projections. The need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators, including a significant reduction in prices of or demand for products produced, a poor outlook for profitability, a significant reduction in pipeline throughput volumes, significant reduction in refining margins, other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment in which the asset or equity method investment is located. Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. For purposes of impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which generally is the refinery and associated distribution system level for Refining & Marketing segment assets, site level for Speedway segment convenience stores or the pipeline system level for Pipeline Transportation segment assets. If the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group, fair value is calculated, and the carrying value is written down if greater than the calculated fair value. Unlike long-lived assets, goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually, or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. At December 31, 2012, we had a total of $930 million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of our reporting units exceeded book value appreciably for each of our reporting units in 2012. Equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary loss in value. Factors providing evidence of such a loss include the fair value of an investment that is less than its carrying value, absence of an ability to recover the carrying value or the investee inability to generate income sufficient to justify our carrying value. At December 31, 2012, we had $321 million of investments in equity method investments recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. An estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions (e.g., pricing, volumes and discount rates) that can materially affect our estimates. That is, unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions. 70 Table of Contents Derivatives We record all derivative instruments at fair value. A large volume of our commodity derivatives are exchange-traded and require few assumptions in arriving at fair value. Fair value estimation for all our derivative instruments is discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 18. Additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following: the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; the expected long-term return on plan assets; the rate of future increases in compensation levels; and health care cost projections. We develop our demographics and utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. We have selected different discount rates for our funded pension plans and our unfunded retiree health care plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns. The selected rates are compared to various similar bond indexes for reasonableness. In determining the assumed discount rates, we use our third-party actuary discount rate model. This model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a yield curve derived from Aa bond yields. The yield curve represents a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 0.5 to 99 years. The bonds used are rated Aa or higher by a recognized rating agency and only non-callable bonds are included. Outlier bonds that have a yield to maturity that deviate significantly from the average yield within each maturity grouping are not included. Each issue is required to have at least $250 million par value outstanding. Of the assumptions used to measure the year-end obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. Decreasing the discount rates of 3.45 percent for our pension plans and 4.05 percent for our other postretirement benefit plans by 0.25 percent would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by $85 million and $21 million, respectively, and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by $6 million and $2 million, respectively. The long-term asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans (currently targeted at approximately 75 percent equity securities and 25 percent fixed income securities for the funded pension plans), past performance and other factors. Certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation and returns. In addition, our long-term asset rate of return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to historical returns for reasonableness. After evaluating activity in the capital markets, we reduced the asset rate of return from 8.50 percent to 7.50 percent effective for 2012. We have also used the 7.50 percent long-term rate of return to determine our 2013 defined benefit pension expense. Decreasing the 7.50 percent asset rate of return assumption by 0.25 percent would increase our defined benefit pension expense by $4 million. Compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans. Health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 22 includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our annual defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense, as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive loss reported on the year-end balance sheets. 71 Table of Contents Contingent Liabilities We accrue contingent liabilities for legal actions, claims, litigation, environmental remediation, tax deficiencies related to operating taxes and third-party indemnities for specified tax matters when such contingencies are both probable and estimable. We regularly assess these estimates in consultation with legal counsel to consider resolved and new matters, material developments in court proceedings or settlement discussions, new information obtained as a result of ongoing discovery and past experience in defending and settling similar matters. Actual costs can differ from estimates for many reasons. For instance, settlement costs for claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on degree of responsibility and assessments of the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation may vary from estimates because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology. We generally record losses related to these types of contingencies as cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income, except for tax deficiencies unrelated to income taxes, which are recorded as other taxes. For additional information on contingent liabilities, see Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters and Compliance Costs. An estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, in terms of both the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an accounting standards update that requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. If the amount reclassified is required under US GAAP to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income. For other amounts not required to be reclassed in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures that provide additional detail about those amounts. The accounting standards update is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2012, and interim periods within those annual periods. Adoption of this accounting standards update in the first quarter of 2013 is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In July 2012, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that gives an entity the option to first assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, through the qualitative assessment, an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the intangible asset is impaired, the quantitative impairment test must then be performed. The accounting standards update is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this accounting standards update in the first quarter of 2013 is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In December 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which was amended in January 2013 that requires disclosure of additional information related to recognized derivative instruments, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are offset or are not offset but are subject to an enforceable netting agreement. The purpose of the requirement is to help users evaluate the effect or potential effect of offsetting and related netting arrangements on an entity financial position. The update is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for annual periods that begin on or after January 1, 2013 and interim periods within those annual periods. Adoption of this update is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 72 Table of Contents
