ITEM 7 Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW We are a global consumer foods company. We develop distinctive food products and market these value-added products under unique brand names. We work continuously to improve our established brands and to create new products that meet consumers evolving needs and preferences. In addition, we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer-directed marketing and innovative merchandising. We believe our brand-building strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe. Our fundamental business goal is to generate superior returns for our stockholders over the long term. We believe that increases in net sales, segment operating profits, earnings per share (EPS), and return on average total capital are the key measures of financial performance for our businesses. See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our discussion of segment operating profit and return on average total capital, which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Our objectives are to consistently deliver: low single-digit annual growth in net sales; mid single-digit annual growth in total segment operating profit; high single-digit annual growth in EPS; and on average, at least a 50 basis point annual increase in return on average total capital. We believe that this financial performance, coupled with an attractive dividend yield, should result in long-term value creation for stockholders. We also return a substantial amount of cash annually to stockholders through share repurchases. For the fiscal year ended May 25, 2008, our net sales grew 9.7 percent, total segment operating profit grew 6.4 percent, diluted EPS grew 16.7 percent, and our return on average total capital improved by 100 basis points. These results met or exceeded our long-term targets. Diluted EPS for fiscal 2008 includes a $0.10 net gain from mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and a $0.09 benefit associated with a favorable court decision on a discrete tax matter. Net cash provided by operations totaled $1.7 billion in fiscal 2008, enabling us to increase our annual dividend payments per share by 9.0 percent from fiscal 2007 and continue returning cash to stockholders through share repurchases, which totaled $1,384.6 million in fiscal 2008. We also made significant capital investments totaling $522.0 million in fiscal 2008, an increase of 13.4 percent from fiscal 2007, to support future growth and productivity. We achieved each of our four key operating objectives for fiscal 2008: We generated broad-based growth in net sales across our businesses. All of our U.S. Retail divisions, International geographic regions, and Bakeries and Foodservice customer segments posted net sales gains in fiscal 2008. We generated 2.9 points of growth from volume, generated 5.3 points of growth from net price realization and product mix, and realized 1.5 points of foreign currency exchange benefit. Our cost savings initiatives helped to partially offset input cost inflation in fiscal 2008. We took steps to manage raw material costs, especially with significant commodity price increases in fiscal 2008, and we initiated several restructuring actions to rationalize and simplify our product portfolio, allowing us to focus on higher margin products. We invested a significant amount in media and other brand-building marketing programs, which contributed to sales growth across our businesses. We also recorded increases in EPS well above our target, even excluding the effects of non-cash, mark-to-market gains and a discrete tax item. Details of our financial results are provided in the Fiscal 2008 Consolidated Results of Operations section below. In fiscal 2009, input cost inflation will remain a challenge for us. We plan to offset a significant portion of this cost inflation with our holistic margin management (HMM) efforts, which include cost-savings initiatives, marketing spending efficiencies, and profitable sales mix strategies. We have also raised prices on a number of our product lines. We believe our HMM efforts help us keep our price increases moderate and expand our margins over the long term. In addition, our HMM savings generate resources for increased advertising and other brand-building consumer marketing initiatives. Our plans call for a high single digit increase in consumer marketing support in fiscal 2009. We believe this support is a key factor in generating net sales growth, as we believe it builds consumer loyalty, increases our market share, and defends against private-label offerings. In addition to protecting and expanding our margins over time, and investing in brand-building marketing initiatives, our key operating objectives for fiscal 2009 include plans for introducing new products and extending existing brands to new markets. We 14 Table of Contents are exploring innovative ways to partner with customers including traditional food retailers, new retail formats, and various away-from-home channels. We will continue to grow our business in international markets, focusing on our core platforms of super-premium ice cream, world cuisine, and healthy snacking. Our plans also call for $550 million of expenditures for capital projects and a significant amount of cash returned to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our long-term objective is to reduce outstanding shares by a net 2 percent per year. We intend to continue repurchasing shares in fiscal 2009, with a goal of reducing average diluted shares outstanding a net 1 percent. On June 23, 2008, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase to an annual rate of $1.72 per share. This represents a 9 percent compound annual growth rate in dividends from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2009. Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report. FISCAL 2008 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For fiscal 2008, we reported diluted EPS of $3.71, up 16.7 percent from $3.18 per share earned in fiscal 2007. Earnings after tax were $1,294.7 million in fiscal 2008, up 13.2 percent from $1,143.9 million in fiscal 2007. The components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Components of Net Sales Growth Fiscal 2008 vs. 2007 Contributions from volume growth (a) 2.9 pts Net price realization and product mix 5.3 pts Foreign currency exchange 1.5 pts Net sales growth 9.7 pts (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. Net sales for fiscal 2008 grew 9.7 percent to $13.7 billion, driven by 2.9 percentage points from volume growth, mainly in our U.S. Retail and International segments, and 5.3 percentage points of growth from net price realization and product mix across many of our businesses. In addition, foreign currency exchange effects added 1.5 percentage points of growth. During the second quarter of fiscal 2008, we voluntarily recalled all pepperoni varieties of Totino and Jeno frozen pizza manufactured on or before October 30, 2007 due to potential contamination. We also voluntarily recalled one flavor of Progresso soup during the third quarter of fiscal 2008. The frozen pizza and soup recalls did not significantly impact our net sales for fiscal 2008. Cost of sales was up $823.2 million in fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007. Cost of sales as a percent of net sales increased from 63.9 percent in fiscal 2007 to 64.3 percent in fiscal 2008. Higher volume drove $206.9 million of this increase. Higher input costs and changes in mix increased cost of sales by $632.1 million. We recorded net mark-to-market gains of $59.6 million related to hedges on open commodity positions that will mitigate future input cost inflation, and a $2.6 million loss from the revaluation of certain grain inventories to market. We also recorded $18.5 million of charges to cost of sales, primarily accelerated depreciation on long-lived assets associated with previously announced restructuring actions. Our La Salte a pasta manufacturing plant in Argentina was destroyed by a fire resulting in a loss of $1.3 million, net of insurance proceeds, from the write off of inventory and property, plant, and equipment, and severance expense related to this event. Cost of sales for fiscal 2008 also includes $21.4 million of costs, including product write offs, logistics, and other costs related to the voluntary recalls. Gross margin grew 8.6 percent in fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007, driven by higher volume, cost savings initiatives and net price realization. Gross margin as a percent of net sales declined 40 basis points from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008. This primarily reflects declines in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment, where we took price increases designed to offset cost increases on a dollar basis, but gross margin as a percent of net sales declined. Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased by $235.7 million in fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007. The increase in SG&A expenses from fiscal 2007 was largely the result of a 13.2 percent increase in media and other consumer marketing spending consistent with our brand-building strategy, $30.1 million more foreign exchange losses than a year ago, higher levels of compensation and benefits, a 7.1 percent increase in research and development expense supporting our innovation initiatives, and $9.2 million of costs associated with the remarketing of the Class A and Series B-1 Interests in our subsidiary General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC). SG&A expense as a percent of net sales was essentially flat compared to fiscal 2007. Net interest for fiscal 2008 totaled $421.7 million, $4.8 million lower than fiscal 2007. Average interest-bearing instruments 15 Table of Contents increased $467.3 million leading to a $29.3 million increase in net interest, while average interest rates decreased 50 basis points generating a $34.1 million decrease in net interest. Net interest includes preferred distributions paid on minority interests. The average rate on our total outstanding debt and minority interests was 5.8 percent in fiscal 2008 compared to 6.3 percent in fiscal 2007. Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs totaled $21.0 million in fiscal 2008 as follows: Expense (Income), In Millions Closure of Poplar, Wisconsin plant $ 2.7 Closure and sale of Allentown, Pennsylvania frozen waffle plant 9.4 Closure of leased Trenton, Ontario frozen dough plant 10.9 Restructuring of production scheduling and discontinuation of cake product line at Chanhassen, Minnesota plant 1.6 Gain on sale of previously closed Vallejo, California plant (7.1 ) Charges associated with restructuring actions previously announced 3.5 Total $ 21.0 We approved a plan to transfer Old El Paso production from our Poplar, Wisconsin facility to other plants and to close the Poplar facility to improve capacity utilization and reduce costs. This action affects 113 employees at the Poplar facility and resulted in a charge of $2.7 million consisting entirely of employee severance. Due to declining financial results, we decided to exit our frozen waffle product line (retail and foodservice) and to close our frozen waffle plant in Allentown, Pennsylvania, affecting 111 employees. We recorded a charge consisting of $3.5 million of employee severance and a $5.9 million non-cash impairment charge against long-lived assets at the plant. We also completed an analysis of the viability of our Bakeries and Foodservice frozen dough facility in Trenton, Ontario, and decided to close the facility, affecting 470 employees. We recorded a charge consisting of $8.4 million for employee expenses and $2.5 million in charges for shutdown and decommissioning costs. We lease the Trenton plant under an agreement expiring in fiscal 2013. We expect to make limited use of the plant during fiscal 2009 while we evaluate sublease or lease termination options. These actions, including the anticipated timing of the disposition of the plants we will close, are expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2009. We also restructured our production scheduling and discontinued our cake production line at our Chanhassen, Minnesota Bakeries and Foodservice plant. These actions affected 125 employees, and we recorded a $3.0 million charge for employee severance, partially offset by a $1.4 million gain from the sale of long-lived assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. This action is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Finally, we recorded additional charges of $3.5 million primarily related to previously announced Bakeries and Foodservice segment restructuring actions including employee severance for 38 employees. Collectively, the charges we expect to incur with respect to these fiscal 2008 restructuring actions total $65 million, of which $43.3 million has been recognized in fiscal 2008. This includes a $17.7 million non-cash charge related to accelerated depreciation on long-lived assets at our plant in Trenton, Ontario and $0.8 million of inventory write offs at our plants in Chanhassen, Minnesota and Allentown, Pennsylvania. The accelerated depreciation charge is recorded in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and in unallocated corporate items in our segment results. Our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was 34.4 percent compared to 34.3 percent for the same period of fiscal 2007. The 0.1 percentage point increase is the result of an increase in the state income tax rate due to more income in higher rate jurisdictions and lower foreign tax credits. These items were offset by a favorable U.S. Federal District Court decision on an uncertain tax matter that reduced our liability for uncertain tax positions and related accrued interest by $30.7 million. The IRS has appealed the District Court decision, and accordingly, its ultimate resolution is subject to change. After-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $110.8 million in fiscal 2008, compared to $72.7 million in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, net sales for Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW) grew 23.3 percent driven by higher volume, key new product introductions including Oats & More in the United Kingdom and Nesquik Duo across a number of regions, favorable foreign currency effects, and the benefit of a full year of sales from the Uncle Tobys acquisition, which closed in July 2006. Our fiscal 2008 after-tax earnings from joint ventures was benefited by $15.9 million for our share of a gain on the sale of a CPW property in the United Kingdom. Net sales for our H agen-Dazs joint ventures in Asia increased 15.7 percent in fiscal 2008 as a result of favorable 16 Table of Contents foreign exchange and introductory product shipments. During the third quarter of fiscal 2008, the 8th Continent soymilk business was sold. Our 50 percent share of the after-tax gain on the sale was $2.2 million. During fiscal 2008, we recognized $1.7 million of this gain in after-tax earnings from joint ventures. We will record an additional after-tax gain of up to $0.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 if certain conditions are satisfied. Average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 13.3 million from fiscal 2007 due to our repurchase of 23.9 million shares of stock during fiscal 2008, partially offset by the issuance of 14.3 million shares to settle a forward purchase contract with an affiliate of Lehman Brothers, Inc. (Lehman Brothers), the issuance of shares upon stock option exercises, the issuance of annual stock awards, and the vesting of restricted stock units. FISCAL 2008 CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS Cash and cash equivalents increased $243.9 million from fiscal 2007, as discussed in the Liquidity section below. Receivables increased $128.7 million from fiscal 2007, mainly driven by higher international sales levels and foreign exchange translation. The allowance for doubtful accounts was unchanged from fiscal 2007. Inventories increased $193.4 million from fiscal 2007 due to an increase in the prices and levels of grain inventories, as well as a higher level of finished goods. These increases were partially offset by an increase in the reserve for the excess of first in, first out (FIFO) inventory costs over last in, first out (LIFO) inventory costs of $47.7 million. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased $67.5 million, as derivative and other receivables increased $91.3 million, partially offset by a $13.2 million decrease in interest rate swap receivables. Land, buildings, and equipment increased $94.2 million, as capital expenditures of $522.0 million were partially offset by depreciation expense of $455.1 million, including accelerated depreciation charges against long-lived assets related to restructured facilities in Trenton, Ontario and Poplar, Wisconsin. In addition, our Lanus, Argentina plant was destroyed by fire and we sold facilities in Allentown, Pennsylvania and Vallejo, California in fiscal 2008. Goodwill and other intangible assets increased $33.9 million from fiscal 2007 as increases from foreign currency translation of $170.5 million and the finalization of purchase accounting for the Saxby Bros. Limited and Uncle Tobys acquisitions of $15.3 million were partially offset by a $151.9 million decrease due to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). Other assets increased $163.5 million from fiscal 2007, driven by a $91.6 million increase in our prepaid pension asset following our annual update of assumptions and fiscal 2008 asset performance, and a $92.1 million increase in interest rate derivative receivables resulting from a decrease in interest rates. Accounts payable increased $159.4 million to $937.3 million in fiscal 2008 from higher vendor payables associated with increases in inventories and payables for construction in progress, as well as foreign exchange translation. Long-term debt , including current portion, and notes payable together increased $793.4 million from fiscal 2007 due to borrowings utilized for the repurchase of $843.0 million of Series B-1 limited membership interests in GMC. The current and noncurrent portions of deferred income taxes increased $117.1 million to $1,483.0 million due to increases in our pension asset and the beneficial tax treatment for certain inventories and investments, partially offset by increases in our deferred compensation deferred tax asset. We also incurred $98.1 million of deferred income tax expense in fiscal 2008. Other current liabilities decreased $839.0 million to $1,239.8 million, reflecting the adoption of FIN 48, which required us to reclassify $810.6 million of accrued taxes and related interest from current to noncurrent based on the expected timing of any required future payments. Other liabilities increased $694.0 million, driven by increases to accrued taxes of $628.6 million from the adoption of FIN 48 and increases in interest rate swap liabilities of $66.6 million. Our minority interests decreased by $896.5 million mainly as a result of our repurchase of the Series B-1 limited membership interests in GMC and the preferred stock of General Mills Capital, Inc., net of proceeds from the sale of additional Class A interests in GMC. Retained earnings increased $765.4 million, reflecting fiscal 2008 net earnings of $1,294.7 million less dividends of $529.7 million. Treasury stock decreased $4,539.6 million due to the retirement of $5,080.8 million of treasury stock and a $581.8 million decrease related to the settlement of a forward purchase contract 17 Table of Contents with Lehman Brothers, offset by share repurchases of $1,384.6 million. Additional paid in capital decreased $4,692.2 million due to a $5,068.3 million decrease from the treasury stock retirement, offset by increases of $168.2 million related to the Lehman Brothers contract and $133.2 million related to stock compensation expense recognized in fiscal 2008 earnings. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) increased by $296.4 million after-tax, driven by favorable foreign exchange translation of $246.3 million. FISCAL 2007 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For fiscal 2007, we reported diluted EPS of $3.18, up 9.7 percent from $2.90 per share earned in fiscal 2006. Earnings after tax were $1,143.9 million in fiscal 2007, up 4.9 percent from $1,090.3 million in fiscal 2006. The components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Components of Net Sales Growth Fiscal 2007 vs. 2006 Contributions from volume growth (a) 3.4 pts Net price realization and product mix 2.2 pts Foreign currency exchange 0.6 pts Net sales growth 6.2 pts (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. Net sales for fiscal 2007 grew 6.2 percent to $12.4 billion, driven by 3.4 percentage points from volume growth, mainly in our U.S. Retail and International segments, and 2.2 percentage points of growth from net price realization and product mix across many of our businesses. In addition, foreign currency exchange effects added 0.6 percentage points of growth. Cost of sales was up $410.3 million in fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006. Higher volume drove $264.4 million of this increase along with an increase of $145.9 million in input costs and changes in mix. Cost of sales as a percent of net sales decreased from 64.4 percent in fiscal 2006 to 63.9 percent in fiscal 2007 as $115.0 million of higher ingredient (mostly grains and dairy) and energy costs were more than offset by efficiency gains at our manufacturing facilities. SG&A expenses increased by $211.6 million in fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006. SG&A expense as a percent of net sales increased from 18.6 percent in fiscal 2006 to 19.2 percent in fiscal 2007. The increase in SG&A expense from fiscal 2006 was largely the result of an 8.2 percent increase in media and brand-building consumer marketing spending and $68.8 million of incremental stock compensation expense resulting from our adoption of SFAS No. 123 (Revised), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R). Net interest for fiscal 2007 totaled $426.5 million, $26.9 million higher than net interest for fiscal 2006. Higher interest rates caused nearly all of the increase. Net interest includes preferred distributions paid on minority interests. The average rate on our total outstanding debt and minority interests was 6.3 percent in fiscal 2007, compared to 5.8 percent in fiscal 2006. Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs totaled $39.3 million in fiscal 2007 as follows: Expense (Income), In Millions Non-cash impairment charge for certain Bakeries and Foodservice product lines $ 36.7 Gain from our previously closed plant in San Adrian, Spain (7.3 ) Loss from divestitures of our par-baked bread and frozen pie product lines 9.6 Charges associated with restructuring actions previously announced 0.3 Total $ 39.3 In fiscal 2007, we concluded that the future cash flows generated by certain product lines in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment would not be sufficient to recover the net book value of the related long-lived assets, and we recorded a noncash impairment charge against these assets. The effective income tax rate was 34.3 percent for fiscal 2007, including an increase of $29.4 million in benefits from our international tax structure and benefits from the settlement of tax audits. In fiscal 2006, our effective income tax rate was 34.5 percent, including the benefit of $11.0 million of adjustments to deferred tax liabilities associated with our International segment brand intangibles. After-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $72.7 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $69.2 million in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2007, net sales for CPW grew 17.9 percent, including 5.5 points of incremental sales from the Uncle Tobys cereal business it acquired in Australia. In February 2006, CPW announced a restructuring of its manufacturing plants in the United Kingdom. Our after-tax earnings from joint ventures were reduced by 18 Table of Contents $8.2 million in both fiscal 2007 and 2006 for our share of the restructuring costs, mainly accelerated depreciation and severance. Net sales for our H agen-Dazs joint ventures in Asia declined 6.8 percent in fiscal 2007, reflecting a change in our reporting period for these joint ventures. We changed this reporting period to include results through March 31. In previous years, we included results for the twelve months ended April 30. Accordingly, fiscal 2007 included only 11 months of results from these joint ventures, compared to 12 months in fiscal 2006. The impact of this change was not material to our consolidated results of operations, so we did not restate prior periods for comparability. Average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 18.6 million from fiscal 2006 due to our repurchase of 25.3 million shares of stock during fiscal 2007, partially offset by increases in diluted shares outstanding from the issuance of annual stock awards. RESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Our businesses are organized into three operating segments: U.S. Retail; International; and Bakeries and Foodservice. The following tables provide the dollar amount and percentage of net sales and operating profit from each reportable segment for fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006: Net Sales Percent of Percent of Percent of Net Sales Net Sales Net Sales Net Sales Net Sales Net Sales Fiscal Year In Millions 2008 2007 2006 U.S. Retail $ 9,072.0 66.5 % $ 8,491.3 68.2 % $ 8,136.3 69.5 % International 2,558.8 18.7 % 2,123.4 17.1 % 1,837.0 15.7 % Bakeries and Foodservice 2,021.3 14.8 % 1,826.8 14.7 % 1,738.0 14.8 % Total $ 13,652.1 100.0 % $ 12,441.5 100.0 % $ 11,711.3 100.0 % Segment Operating Profit Percent of Percent of Percent of Segment Segment Segment Segment Segment Segment Operating Operating Operating Operating Operating Operating Profit Profit Profit Profit Profit Profit Fiscal Year In Millions 2008 2007 2006 U.S. Retail $ 1,971.2 81.9 % $ 1,896.6 84.0 % $ 1,801.4 85.3 % International 268.9 11.2 % 215.7 9.5 % 193.9 9.2 % Bakeries and Foodservice 165.4 6.9 % 147.8 6.5 % 116.3 5.5 % Total $ 2,405.5 100.0 % $ 2,260.1 100.0 % $ 2,111.6 100.0 % Segment operating profit excludes unallocated corporate items of $156.7 million for fiscal 2008, $163.0 million for fiscal 2007, and $122.8 million for fiscal 2006; and also excludes restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs because these items affecting operating profit are centrally managed at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by our executive management. U.S. Retail Segment Our U.S. Retail segment reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains, and drug, dollar and discount chains operating throughout the United States. Our major product categories in this business segment are ready-to-eat cereals, refrigerated yogurt, ready-to-serve soup, dry dinners, shelf stable and frozen vegetables, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza and pizza snacks, grain, fruit and savory snacks, microwave popcorn, and a wide variety of organic products including soup, granola bars, and cereal. 19 Table of Contents The components of the changes in net sales are shown in the following table: Components of U.S. Retail Net Sales Growth Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 vs. 2007 vs. 2006 Contributions from volume growth (a) 3.3 pts 2.3 pts Net price realization and product mix 3.5 pts 2.1 pts Change in Net Sales 6.8 pts 4.4 pts (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. In fiscal 2008, net sales for our U.S. Retail segment were $9.1 billion, up 6.8 percent from fiscal 2007. This growth in net sales was the result of a 3.5 percentage point benefit from net price realization and product mix as well as a 3.3 percentage point increase in volume, led by strong growth in our grain snacks and yogurt businesses. Net sales for this segment totaled $8.5 billion in fiscal 2007 and $8.1 billion in fiscal 2006. Volume increased 2.3 percentage points in fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006, led by strong growth in our grain snacks business as well as volume increases in our Yoplait, Meals, and Pillsbury divisions. The volume increase was largely driven by higher levels of consumer marketing spending and new product innovation, resulting in higher sales to key customers. All of our U.S. Retail divisions experienced net sales growth in fiscal 2008 as shown in the tables below: U.S. Retail Net Sales by Division Fiscal Year In Millions 2008 2007 2006 Big G $ 2,028.0 $ 1,932.9 $ 1,902.3 Meals 2,006.1 1,909.2 1,815.4 Pillsbury 1,673.4 1,591.4 1,549.8 Yoplait 1,293.1 1,170.7 1,099.4 Snacks 1,197.6 1,066.5 967.3 Baking Products 723.3 666.7 650.2 Small Planet Foods and Other 150.5 153.9 151.9 Total $ 9,072.0 $ 8,491.3 $ 8,136.3 U.S. Retail Change in Net Sales by Division Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 vs. 2007 vs. 2006 Big G 4.9 % 1.6 % Meals 5.1 5.2 Pillsbury 5.2 2.7 Yoplait 10.5 6.5 Snacks 12.3 10.3 Baking Products 8.5 2.5 Small Planet Foods 6.3 21.3 Total 6.8 % 4.4 % In fiscal 2008, Big G cereals net sales grew 4.9 percent, driven by strong performance in core brands including Cheerios varieties and Fiber One cereals. Net sales for Meals grew by 5.1 percent led by Progresso ready-to-serve soups . Pillsbury net sales increased 5.2 percent led by Totino frozen pizza and hot snacks and Pillsbury refrigerated baked goods. Yoplait net sales grew 10.5 percent due to strong performance by Yoplait Light yogurt and new products including Yo-Plus and Fiber One yogurt. Net sales for Snacks grew 12.3 percent led by continued strong sales for Nature Valley grain snacks and Fiber One bars. Baking Products net sales grew 8.5 percent due to increases in Betty Crocker cookie mixes, Gold Medal flour, and the launch of Warm Delights Minis. For fiscal 2007, Big G cereals net sales grew 1.6 percent as a result of new product launches such as Fruity Cheerios and Nature Valley cereals, and continued strong performance of the Cheerios franchise. Net sales for Meals grew 5.2 percent led by the introduction of Progresso reduced sodium soups and Hamburger Helper Microwave Singles and the continued strong performance of our other Hamburger Helper and Progresso offerings. Net sales for Pillsbury increased 2.7 percent as core refrigerated dough products, Totino Pizza Rolls pizza snacks, and Toaster Strudel pastries all generated solid growth. Yoplait net sales grew 6.5 percent due to strong performance by Yoplait Light, Go-GURT , and Yoplait Kids yogurt. Net sales for Snacks grew 10.3 percent led by continuing growth for Nature Valley granola bars and the introduction of Fiber One bars. Baking Products net sales grew 2.5 percent reflecting greater focus on product lines such as Bisquick baking mix and Warm Delights microwaveable desserts. Segment operating profit of $2.0 billion in fiscal 2008 improved $74.6 million, or 3.9 percent, over fiscal 2007. Net price realization increased segment operating profit by $317.0 million and volume growth increased segment operating profit by $95.4 million. 20 Table of Contents These were offset by increased supply chain input costs of $181.0 million, higher administrative costs, and an 11.7 percent increase in consumer marketing expense consistent with our brand-building strategy. Voluntary product recalls reduced segment operating profit by $24.0 million. Segment operating profit of $1.9 billion in fiscal 2007 improved $95.2 million, or 5.3 percent, over fiscal 2006. Unit volume increased segment operating profit by $90.3 million, and inflation in ingredients (mostly grains and dairy), energy, and labor costs was more than offset by efficiency gains at our manufacturing facilities resulting from cost-saving capital projects, changes to product formulations, and continued actions to reduce low-turning products. These increases in segment operating profit were partially offset by a 5.7 percent increase in brand-building consumer marketing spending. International Segment In Canada, our major product categories are ready-to-eat cereals, shelf stable and frozen vegetables, dry dinners, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza snacks, and grain, fruit and savory snacks. In markets outside North America, our product categories include super-premium ice cream, grain snacks, shelf stable and frozen vegetables, dough products, and dry dinners. Our International segment also includes products manufactured in the United States for export, mainly to Caribbean and Latin American markets, as well as products we manufacture for sale to our international joint ventures. Revenues from export activities are reported in the region or country where the end customer is located. These international businesses are managed through 34 sales and marketing offices.

For fiscal 2008, net sales for our International segment were $2.6 billion, up 20.5 percent from fiscal 2007. Net sales totaled $2.1 billion in fiscal 2007, up 15.6 percent from $1.8 billion in fiscal 2006. Net sales growth for our International segment by geographic region is shown in the following tables: International Net Sales by Geographic Region Fiscal Year In Millions 2008 2007 2006 Europe $ 898.5 $ 756.3 $ 628.3 Canada 697.0 610.4 565.9 Asia/Pacific 577.4 462.0 404.5 Latin America and South Africa 385.9 294.7 238.3 Total $ 2,558.8 $ 2,123.4 $ 1,837.0 International Change in Net Sales by Geographic Region Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 vs. 2007 vs. 2006 Europe 18.8 % 20.4 % Canada 14.2 7.9 Asia/Pacific 25.0 14.2 Latin America and South Africa 30.9 23.7 Total 20.5 % 15.6 % In fiscal 2008, net sales in Europe increased 18.8 percent reflecting strong performance from Old El Paso and H agen-Dazs in the United Kingdom. Continued success from the launch of Nature Valley granola bars in several European markets and favorable foreign exchange also contributed to the region growth. Net sales in Canada increased 14.2 percent including favorable foreign exchange. In the Asia/Pacific region, net sales increased 25.0 percent led by double-digit growth for H agen-Dazs ice cream and Wanchai Ferry dumplings and meal kits in China. In Latin America and South Africa, net sales increased 30.9 percent led by Diablitos canned meat spread in Venezuela and pricing actions taken in other countries. In fiscal 2007, net sales in Europe grew 20.4 percent reflecting 14.6 percent growth in net sales of H agen-Dazs ice cream and continued strong performance from Old El Paso and Green Giant across the region, and especially in the United Kingdom. The acquisition of Saxby Bros. Limited, a chilled pastry company in the 21 Table of Contents United Kingdom, contributed less than 1 point of net sales growth. Net sales in Canada increased 7.9 percent, led by 34.8 percent net sales growth on Nature Valley snack bars, 6.0 percent net sales growth in cereals, and 10.6 percent net sales growth on Old El Paso products. Asia/Pacific net sales increased 14.2 percent led by 16.5 percent net sales growth for H agen-Dazs in China. Latin America and South Africa net sales increased 23.7 percent led by 19.6 percent growth in our Diablitos product line and the re-launch of H agen-Dazs in Latin America. Segment operating profit for fiscal 2008 grew to $268.9 million, up 24.7 percent from fiscal 2007, with foreign currency exchange contributing 9.1 points of that growth. Segment operating profit increased by $37.5 million mainly from higher volumes. Net price realization more than offset higher supply chain input costs, a 21.7 percent increase in consumer marketing expense, and administrative cost increases. Segment operating profit for fiscal 2007 grew to $215.7 million, up 11.2 percent from fiscal 2006, with foreign currency exchange contributing 4.5 points of that growth. The growth was led by a $45.6 million increase from higher volumes driven by increases in consumer marketing spending. Net price realization offset supply chain and administrative cost increases. Bakeries and Foodservice Segment In our Bakeries and Foodservice segment we sell branded ready-to-eat cereals, snacks, dinner and side dish products, refrigerated and soft-serve frozen yogurt, frozen dough products, branded baking mixes, and custom food items. Our customers include foodservice distributors and operators, convenience stores, vending machine operators, quick service and other restaurant operators, and business and school cafeterias in the United States and Canada. In addition, we market mixes and unbaked and fully baked frozen dough products throughout the United States and Canada to retail, supermarket, and wholesale bakeries. The components of the change in net sales are shown in the following table: Components of Bakeries and Foodservice Net Sales Growth Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 vs. 2007 vs. 2006 Contributions from volume growth on continuing businesses (a) (1 .3) pts 3 .9 pts Net price realization and product mix 15 .8 pts 3 .1 pts Divested product lines (3 .9) pts (1 .9) pts Net sales growth 10 .6 pts 5 .1 pts (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. For fiscal 2008, net sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice segment increased 10.6 percent to $2.0 billion. The growth in fiscal 2008 net sales was driven mainly by 15.8 percentage points of benefit from net price realization and product mix, as we took price increases to offset higher supply chain input costs. This was partially offset by a 1.3 percentage point decline in volume on continuing businesses, mainly in the distributors and restaurants customer channel, and a 3.9 percentage point decline due to the effects of divested product lines. Net sales increased 5.1 percent from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2007 volume grew 3.9 percentage points compared to fiscal 2006, driven by: increased sales of higher margin, branded products and the introduction of new products to customers such as schools, hotels, restaurants, and convenience stores; improved innovation in foodservice products; and favorable net price realization. Net sales growth for our Bakeries and Foodservice segment by customer segment is shown in the following tables: Bakeries and Foodservice Net Sales by Customer Segment Fiscal Year In Millions 2008 2007 2006 Distributors and restaurants $ 902.0 $ 864.8 $ 887.0 Bakery channels 927.8 780.5 688.1 Convenience stores and vending 191.5 181.5 162.9 Total $ 2,021.3 $ 1,826.8 $ 1,738.0 22 Table of Contents Bakeries and Foodservice Change in Net Sales by Customer Segment Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 vs. 2007 vs. 2006 Distributors and restaurants 4.3 % (2.5 )% Bakery channels 18.9 13.4 Convenience stores and vending 5.5 11.4 Total 10.6 % 5.1 % In fiscal 2008, segment operating profits were $165.4 million, up 11.9 percent from $147.8 million in fiscal 2007. The increase for the year was driven by grain merchandising activities and benefits from prior restructuring activities. Net price realization offset higher supply chain input costs and a decrease in volume. Segment operating profits were $147.8 million in fiscal 2007, up 27.1 percent from $116.3 million in fiscal 2006. The business was able to offset high levels of input cost inflation with a combination of pricing actions, sourcing productivity, and manufacturing improvements. Unallocated Corporate Items Unallocated corporate items include variances to planned corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, all stock compensation costs, annual contributions to the General Mills Foundation, and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. This includes restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs, as well as gains and losses from mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments in accordance with our internal hedge documentation as discussed in Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. For fiscal 2008, unallocated corporate items totaled $156.7 million of expense compared to $163.0 million for the same period last year. During fiscal 2008, we recognized a net gain of $59.6 million related to the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and a previously deferred gain of $10.8 million on the sale of a corporate investment. These gains were offset by $25.6 million of unfavorable foreign exchange, $18.5 million of charges to cost of sales, primarily accelerated depreciation on long-lived assets associated with previously announced restructuring actions, and $9.2 million of expense related to the remarketing of minority interests in our GMC subsidiary. Unallocated corporate items were $163.0 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $122.8 million in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2007 included $68.8 million of incremental expense relating to the impact of the adoption of SFAS 123R, and fiscal 2006 included $32.7 million of charges related to increases in environmental reserves and a write-down of the asset value of a low-income housing investment. Excluding these items, unallocated corporate items were essentially unchanged from fiscal 2006. Joint Ventures In addition to our consolidated operations, we participate in several joint ventures. International Joint Ventures We have a 50 percent equity interest in CPW, which manufactures and markets ready-to-eat cereal products in more than 130 countries and republics outside the United States and Canada. CPW also markets cereal bars in several European countries and manufactures private label cereals for customers in the United Kingdom. Results from our CPW joint venture are reported for the 12 months ended March 31. On July 14, 2006, CPW acquired the Uncle Tobys cereal business in Australia for $385.6 million. We funded our 50 percent share of the purchase price by making additional advances to and equity contributions in CPW totaling $135.1 million (classified as investments in affiliates, net on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows) and by acquiring a 50 percent undivided interest in certain intellectual property for $57.7 million (classified as acquisitions on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows). We funded the advances to and our equity contribution in CPW from cash generated by our international operations, including our international joint ventures. We have 50 percent equity interests in H agen-Dazs Japan, Inc. and H agen-Dazs Korea Company. These joint ventures manufacture, distribute, and market H agen-Dazs ice cream products and frozen novelties. In fiscal 2007, we changed the reporting period for the H agen-Dazs joint ventures. Accordingly, fiscal 2007 includes only 11 months of results from these joint ventures compared to 12 months in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2006. Domestic Joint Venture During fiscal 2008, the 8th Continent soy milk business was sold, and our 50 percent share of the after-tax gain on the sale was $2.2 million, of which $1.7 million was recorded in fiscal 2008. We will record an additional gain in 23 Table of Contents the first quarter of fiscal 2010 if certain conditions related to the sale are satisfied. Our share of after-tax joint venture earnings increased from $72.7 million in fiscal 2007 to $110.8 million in fiscal 2008. This growth was largely driven by strong sales growth, favorable foreign exchange, and our share of the gain from the sale of a property. Our after-tax share of CPW restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs pursuant to approved plans during fiscal 2008 and prior years was as follows: Fiscal Year Expense (Income), In Millions 2008 2007 2006 Gain on sale of property $ (15.9 ) $ $ Accelerated depreciation charges and severance associated with previously announced restructuring actions 4.5 8.2 8.0 Other charges resulting from fiscal 2008 restructuring actions 3.2 Total $ (8.2 ) $ 8.2 $ 8.0 Our share of after-tax joint venture earnings increased from $69.2 million in fiscal 2006 to $72.7 million in fiscal 2007. This growth was largely driven by strong core brand volume and organic net sales growth, new product innovation, and increases in brand-building consumer marketing spending, partially offset by a $2.0 million impact of the change in reporting period for the H agen-Dazs joint ventures and a $8.2 million restructuring charge in 2007. The change in net sales for each joint venture is set forth in the following table: Joint Ventures Change in Net Sales Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 vs. 2007 vs. 2006 CPW 23.3 % 17.9 % H agen-Dazs (11 months in fiscal 2007 and 12 months in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2006) 15.7 (6.8 ) 8th Continent NM 2.5 Joint Ventures 20.6 % 12.6 % For fiscal 2008, CPW net sales grew by 23.3 percent reflecting higher volume, key new product introductions including Oats & More in the United Kingdom and Nesquik Duo across a number of regions, favorable foreign currency effects, and the benefit of a full year of sales from the fiscal 2007 Uncle Tobys acquisition. Net sales for our H agen-Dazs joint ventures increased 15.7 percent from fiscal 2007, as a result of favorable foreign exchange and introductory product shipments. For fiscal 2007, CPW net sales grew by 17.9 percent reflecting the introduction of new products and favorable currency translation. The acquisition of Uncle Tobys in Australia also contributed 5.5 points of CPW net sales growth. Net sales for our H agen-Dazs joint ventures declined 6.8 percent from fiscal 2006, reflecting the change in our reporting period for these joint ventures. Selected cash flows from our joint ventures are set forth in the following table: Selected Cash Flows from Joint Ventures Fiscal Year Inflow (Outflow), In Millions 2008 2007 2006 Advances to joint ventures $ (20.6 ) $ (141.4 ) $ (7.0 ) Repayments of advances 95.8 38.0 Dividends received 108.7 45.2 77.4 IMPACT OF INFLATION We have experienced strong levels of input cost inflation since fiscal 2006. Our gross margin performance in fiscal 2008 reflects the impact of significant input cost inflation, primarily from commodities and energy inputs. For fiscal 2009, we expect inflationary trends to accelerate, with input costs (fuel, energy, commodities, and employee benefits) forecasted to be 9 percent higher than fiscal 2008 levels. We expect to mitigate this inflationary pressure through cost saving initiatives and pricing. We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through appropriate planning and operating practices. Our risk management practices are discussed in Item 7A of this report. LIQUIDITY The primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations. Over the most recent three-year period, our operations have generated $5.3 billion in cash. A substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to stockholders annually through share repurchases and dividends. We also use this source of liquidity to fund our annual capital expenditures. We typically 24 Table of Contents use a combination of available cash, notes payable, and long-term debt to finance acquisitions and major capital expansions. Cash Flows from Operations Fiscal Year In Millions 2008 2007 2006 Net earnings $ 1,294.7 $ 1,143.9 $ 1,090.3 Depreciation and amortization 459.2 417.8 423.9 After-tax earnings from joint ventures (110.8 ) (72.7 ) (69.2 ) Stock-based compensation 133.2 127.1 44.6 Deferred income taxes 98.1 26.0 25.9 Distributions of earnings from joint ventures 108.7 45.2 77.4 Tax benefit on exercised options (55.7 ) (73.1 ) 40.9 Pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit costs (24.8 ) (53.6 ) (74.2 ) Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs (income) (1.7 ) 39.1 29.8 Changes in current assets and liabilities (126.7 ) 149.1 183.9 Other, net (44.3 ) 2.4 70.2 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,729.9 $ 1,751.2 $ 1,843.5 Our cash flow from operations decreased $21.3 million from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 as a $150.8 million increase in net earnings and the $72.1 million effect of changes in deferred income taxes were more than offset by an increase of $275.8 million in working capital compared to the prior year. Accounts receivable was a $69.9 million increased use of cash, partially offset by a $37.3 million increase in cash from accounts payable, and inventory was a $49.1 million increased use of cash in fiscal 2008. Working capital also includes $59.6 million of mark-to-market gains on our commodity derivatives. In addition, other current liabilities had a $173.1 million reduction to the source of cash driven by cash taxes paid in fiscal 2008. We strive to grow a key measure, core working capital, at or below our growth in net sales. For fiscal 2008, core working capital grew 12.1 percent, more than our net sales growth of 9.7 percent, largely driven by the effect of increases in commodity prices on inventories and an increase in accounts receivable. In fiscal 2007, core working capital grew 4.2 percent, less than net sales growth of 6.2 percent, and in fiscal 2006, core working capital grew 5.0 percent and net sales grew 3.6 percent. The $92.3 million decrease in cash flows from operations from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was the result of a reduction in our cash flows from working capital and a decrease in distributions of earnings from joint ventures, offset by an increase in net earnings.

Limited, and acquired our master franchisee of H agen-Dazs shops in Greece. During fiscal 2008, we sold our former production facilities in Vallejo, California and Allentown, Pennsylvania, while in fiscal 2007 we sold our frozen pie product line, including a plant in Rochester, New York, and our par-baked bread product line, including plants in Chelsea, Massachusetts and Tempe, Arizona. Capital investment for land, buildings, and equipment increased by $61.8 million, as we continued to increase manufacturing capacity for our snack bars and yogurt products and began consolidating manufacturing for our Old El Paso business. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $550 million in fiscal 2009, including initiatives that will: increase manufacturing capacity for Yoplait yogurt, Nature Valley bars, and Progresso soup; increase productivity throughout the supply chain; and continue upgrades to our International segment information technology systems. 25 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Financing Activities Fiscal Year In Millions 2008 2007 2006 Change in notes payable $ 946.6 $ (280.4 ) $ 1,197.4 Issuance of long-term debt 1,450.0 2,650.0 Payment of long-term debt (1,623.4 ) (2,323.2 ) (1,386.0 ) Settlement of Lehman Brothers forward purchase contract 750.0 Repurchase of Series B-1 limited membership interests in GMC (843.0 ) Repurchase of General Mills Capital, Inc. preferred stock (150.0 ) Proceeds from sale of Class A limited membership interests in GMC 92.3 Common stock issued 191.4 317.4 157.1 Tax benefit on exercised options 55.7 73.1 Purchases of common stock for treasury (1,432.4 ) (1,320.7 ) (884.8 ) Dividends paid (529.7 ) (505.2 ) (484.9 ) Other, net (0.5 ) (9.1 ) (3.1 ) Net cash used by financing activities $ (1,093.0 ) $ (1,398.1 ) $ (1,404.3 ) Net cash used by financing activities decreased by $305.1 million in fiscal 2008. Further details for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 financing actions are described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. On April 11, 2007, we issued $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of floating-rate convertible senior notes. On April 11, 2008, the holders of those notes put $1.14 billion of the aggregate principal amount to us for repurchase. We issued commercial paper to fund the repurchase. On March 17, 2008, we sold $750.0 million of 5.2 percent fixed-rate notes due March 17, 2015 and on August 29, 2007, we sold $700.0 million of 5.65 percent fixed-rate notes due September 10, 2012. The proceeds of the notes were used to repay outstanding commercial paper. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. The notes may be redeemed at our option at any time for a specified make-whole amount. The notes are senior unsecured, unsubordinated obligations and contain a change of control provision, as defined in the instruments governing the notes. On October 15, 2007, we settled the forward contract established with Lehman Brothers in October 2004 in conjunction with the issuance by Lehman Brothers of $750.0 million of notes that were mandatorily exchangeable for shares of our common stock. In settlement of that forward contract, we issued 14.3 million shares of our common stock and received $750.0 million in cash from Lehman Brothers. We used the cash received to reduce outstanding commercial paper balances. On August 7, 2007, we repurchased for a net amount of $843.0 million all of the outstanding Series B-1 Interests in GMC as part of a required remarketing of those interests. The purchase price reflected the Series B-1 Interests original capital account balance of $835.0 million and $8.0 million of capital account appreciation attributable and paid to the third party holder of the Series B-1 Interests. The capital appreciation paid to the third party holder of the Series B-1 Interests was recorded as a reduction to retained earnings, a component of stockholders equity, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and reduced net earnings available to common stockholders in our basic and diluted EPS calculations. We and the third party holder of all of GMC outstanding Class A limited membership interests (Class A Interests) agreed to reset, effective on June 28, 2007, the preferred rate of return applicable to the Class A Interests to the sum of three- month LIBOR plus 65 basis points. On June 28, 2007, we sold $92.3 million of additional Class A Interests to the same third party. There was no gain or loss associated with these transactions. As of May 25, 2008, the carrying value of all outstanding Class A Interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets was $242.3 million, and the capital account balance of the Class A Interests upon which preferred distributions are calculated was $248.1 million. On June 28, 2007, we repurchased for $150.0 million all of the outstanding Series A preferred stock of our subsidiary General Mills Capital, Inc. using proceeds from the sale of the Class A Interests and commercial paper. There was no gain or loss associated with this repurchase. During fiscal 2008, we repurchased 23.6 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1,368.0 million, of which $0.1 million settled after the end of our fiscal year. In fiscal 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 75 million shares of our common stock. Purchases under the authorization can be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including the use of call options and other derivative instruments, Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, and accelerated repurchase programs. The authorization has no specified termination date. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 25.3 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $1,385.2 million, of 26 Table of Contents which $64.5 million settled after the end of our fiscal year. In fiscal 2006, we repurchased 18.8 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $892.3 million. Dividends paid in fiscal 2008 totaled $529.7 million, or $1.57 per share, a 9.0 percent per share increase from fiscal 2007. Dividends paid in fiscal 2007 totaled $505.2 million, or $1.44 per share, a 7.5 percent per share increase from fiscal 2006 dividends of $1.34 per share. Our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend increase from $0.40 per share to $0.43 per share effective with the dividend payable on August 1, 2008. CAPITAL RESOURCES May 25, May 27, In Millions 2008 2007 Notes payable $ 2,208.8 $ 1,254.4 Current portion of long-term debt 442.0 1,734.0 Long-term debt 4,348.7 3,217.7 Total debt 6,999.5 6,206.1 Minority interests 242.3 1,138.8 Stockholders equity 6,215.8 5,319.1 Total capital $ 13,457.6 $ 12,664.0 The following table details the fee-paid committed credit lines we had available as of May 25, 2008: In Billions Amount Credit facility expiring: October 2010 $ 1.1 October 2012 1.9 Total committed credit facilities $ 3.0 Commercial paper is a continuing source of short-term financing. We can issue commercial paper in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Our commercial paper borrowings are supported by $3.0 billion of fee-paid committed credit lines and $403.8 million in uncommitted lines. As of May 25, 2008, there were no amounts outstanding on the fee-paid committed credit lines and $133.8 million was drawn on the uncommitted lines, all by our international operations. In October 2007, we entered into a new five-year credit agreement with an initial aggregate revolving commitment of $1.9 billion which is scheduled to expire in October 2012. Concurrent with the execution of the new credit agreement, we terminated our five-year credit agreement dated January 20, 2004, which provided $750.0 million of revolving credit and was scheduled to expire in January 2009, and our amended and restated credit agreement dated October 17, 2006, which provided $1.1 billion of revolving credit and was scheduled to expire in October 2007. We then terminated our credit agreement dated August 3, 2007, which provided an aggregate revolving commitment of $750.0 million and was scheduled to expire on December 6, 2007. Our credit facilities, certain of our long-term debt agreements, and our minority interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May 25, 2008, we were in compliance with all of these covenants. We have $442.0 million of long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current, including $109.5 million of notes that may mature based on the put rights of the note holders. We also have classified $150.6 million of long-term debt as current based on our intention to redeem the debt within the next 12 months. We believe that cash flows from operations, together with available short- and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. As of May 25, 2008, our total debt, including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges, was 65.7 percent in fixed-rate and 34.3 percent in floating-rate instruments compared to 50.0 percent each in fixed-rate and floating-rate instruments as of May 27, 2007. The change in the fixed-rate and floating-rate percentages were driven by the refinancing of $1.5 billion of commercial paper and minority interests with fixed-rate notes, and the new swap of $500.0 million of floating-rate debt to fixed-rate during fiscal 2008. The Board of Directors approved the retirement of 125.0 million shares of common stock in treasury effective December 10, 2007. This action reduced common stock by $12.5 million, reduced additional paid-in capital by $5,068.3 million, and reduced common stock in treasury by $5,080.8 million on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) covering the sale of debt securities, common stock, preference stock, depository shares, securities warrants, purchase contracts, purchase units, and units. As of May 25, 2008, $2.2 billion remained available under the shelf registration for future use. We believe that growth in return on average total capital is a key performance measure. Return on average total capital improved from 11.1 percent in fiscal 2007 to 12.1 percent in fiscal 27 Table of Contents 2008 due to higher operating results, the impact of net mark-to-market gains on certain commodity positions, and the effect of a discrete tax item. We also believe important measures of financial strength are the ratio of fixed charge coverage and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt. Our fixed charge coverage ratio in fiscal 2008 was 4.87 compared to 4.37 in fiscal 2007. The measure increased from fiscal 2007 as earnings before income taxes and after-tax earnings from joint ventures increased by $174.8 million and fixed charges decreased by $2.2 million. Our operating cash flow to debt ratio decreased 3.5 percent to 24.7 percent in fiscal 2008, driven by a slight decrease in cash flows from operations and an increase in our year end debt balance. Currently, Standard and Poor (S&P) has ratings of BBB+ on our publicly held long-term debt and A-2 on our commercial paper. Moody Investors Services (Moody s) has ratings of Baa1 for our long-term debt and P-2 for our commercial paper. Fitch Ratings (Fitch) rates our long-term debt BBB+ and our commercial paper F-2. These ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. We intend to manage our financial condition and ratios to maintain these ratings levels for the foreseeable future. In April 2002, we contributed assets with an aggregate fair market value of $4.2 billion to our subsidiary GMC. The contributed assets consist primarily of manufacturing assets and intellectual property associated with the production and retail sale of Big G cereals, Progresso soups, and Old El Paso products in the United States. In exchange for the contribution of these assets, GMC issued its managing membership interest and its limited preferred membership interests to certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries. We continue to hold the entire managing membership interest, and therefore direct the operations of GMC. Other than the right to consent to certain actions, holders of the limited preferred membership interests do not participate in the management of GMC. We currently hold all interests in GMC other than the Class A Interests. The terms of the Class A Interests are described in the Fifth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of GMC (the LLC Agreement). The holder of the Class A Interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate, currently equal to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 65 basis points, to the holder capital account balance established in the most recent mark-to-market valuation (currently $248.1 million). The LLC Agreement requires that the preferred return rate of the Class A Interests be adjusted every five years through a negotiated agreement between the Class A Interest holder and GMC, or through a remarketing auction. The next remarketing is scheduled to occur in June 2012 and thereafter in five year intervals. Upon a failed remarketing, the preferred return rate over three-month LIBOR will be increased by 75 basis points until the next remarketing, which will occur in 3 month intervals until a successful remarketing occurs or the managing member purchases the Class A Interests. The managing member may at any time elect to purchase all of the Class A Interests for an amount equal to the holder capital account balance (as adjusted in a mark-to-market valuation), plus any accrued but unpaid preferred returns and the prescribed make-whole amount. Holders of the Class A Interests may initiate a liquidation of GMC under certain circumstances, including, without limitation, the bankruptcy of GMC or its subsidiaries, GMC failure to deliver the preferred distributions on the Class A Interests, GMC failure to comply with portfolio requirements, breaches of certain covenants, lowering of our senior debt rating below either Baa3 by Moody or BBB- by S&P, and a failed attempt to remarket the Class A Interests as a result of GMC failure to assist in such remarketing. In the event of a liquidation of GMC, each member of GMC will receive the amount of its then current capital account balance. The managing member may avoid liquidation by exercising its option to purchase the Class A Interests. For financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash flows of GMC are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The return to the third party investor is reflected in net interest in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The third party investor interests in GMC are classified as minority interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As discussed above, we may exercise our option to purchase the Class A Interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value, plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed make-whole amount. If we purchase these interests, any change in the unrelated third party investor capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate EPS in that period. 28 Table of Contents OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS As of May 25, 2008, we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of $670.1 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries, and guarantees and comfort letters of $340.3 million for the debt and other obligations of non-consolidated affiliates, mainly CPW. In addition, off-balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under noncancelable operating leases, which totaled $315.3 million as of May 25, 2008. As of May 25, 2008, we had invested in 3 variable interest entities (VIEs). We have an interest in a contract manufacturer at our former facility in Geneva, Illinois. We are the primary beneficiary (PB) and have consolidated this entity as of May 25, 2008. This entity had property and equipment with a carrying value of $31.0 million and long-term debt of $31.8 million as of May 25, 2008. We also have an interest in a contract manufacturer in Greece that is a VIE. Although we are the PB, we have not consolidated this entity because it is not material to our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity as of and for the year ended May 25, 2008. This entity had assets of $4.2 million and liabilities of $0.9 million as of May 25, 2008. We are not the PB of the remaining VIE. Our maximum exposure to loss from the 3 VIEs is limited to the $31.8 million of long-term debt of the contract manufacturer in Geneva, Illinois and our $1.1 million equity investment in the VIE of which we are not the PB. On August 17, 2006, the Pension Protection Act (PPA) became law in the United States. The PPA revised the basis and methodology for determining defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements as well as maximum contributions to and benefits paid from tax-qualified plans. Most of these provisions are first applicable to our domestic defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2009 on a phased-in basis. The PPA may ultimately require us to make additional contributions to our domestic plans. However, due to our historical funding practices and current funded status, we do not expect to have significant statutory or contractual funding requirements for our major defined benefit plans during the next several years. No fiscal 2009 domestic plan contributions are currently expected. Actual fiscal 2009 contributions could exceed our current projections, and may be influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities, or by future changes in government requirements. Additionally, our projections concerning timing of the PPA funding requirements are subject to change and may be influenced by factors such as general market conditions affecting trust asset performance, interest rates, and our future decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the PPA. The following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations, including payments due by period: Payments Due by Fiscal Year 2014 and In Millions Total 2009 2010 11 2012 13 Thereafter Long-term debt (a) $ 4,789.8 $ 437.6 $ 511.4 $ 2,058.3 $ 1,782.5 Accrued interest 146.8 146.8 Operating leases 315.3 94.3 120.7 80.7 19.6 Capital leases 23.7 5.7 8.0 7.0 3.0 Purchase obligations (b) 2,770.9 2,324.1 279.8 112.7 54.3 Total $ 8,046.5 $ 3,008.5 $ 919.9 $ 2,258.7 $ 1,859.4 (a) Excludes $19.8 million related to capital leases and $18.9 million of bond premium and original issue discount. (b) Subsequent to May 25, 2008, we entered into sourcing contracts with contractual obligations of $391.1 million in 2009, $782.2 million in 2010-11, and $22.8 million in 2012-13. Principal payments due on long-term debt are based on stated contractual maturities or put rights of certain note holders. The majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw material and packaging to be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumer marketing spending commitments that support our brands. The fair value of our interest rate and equity swaps with a payable position to the counterparty was $220.1 million as of May 25, 2008, based on fair market values as of that date. Future changes in market values will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or received to settle those instruments in the future. Other long-term obligations mainly consist of liabilities for uncertain income tax positions, accrued compensation and benefits, including the underfunded status of certain of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans, and miscellaneous liabilities. We expect to pay $16.6 million of benefits from our unfunded postemployment benefit plans in fiscal 2009. Further information on 29 Table of Contents all of these plans is included in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Our significant accounting estimates are those that have meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations. These estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures, intangible assets, stock compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement and postemployment benefits. Promotional Expenditures Our promotional activities are conducted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers. These activities include: payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf, such as advertising or in-store displays; discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices and payments to gain distribution of new products; coupons, contests, and other incentives; and media and advertising expenditures. The media and advertising expenditures are recognized as expense when the advertisement airs. The cost of payments to customers and other consumer activities are recognized as the related revenue is recorded, which generally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels. These estimates are made based on the forecasted customer sales, the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities, and other factors. Differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are normally insignificant and are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. Our accrued trade, coupon, and consumer marketing liabilities were $446.0 million as of May 25, 2008, and $410.1 million as of May 27, 2007. Because our total promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as a reduction of revenues) are significant, if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments that could have a material effect on our results of operations. Valuation of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have identifiable cash flows independent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals, as appropriate. Intangible Assets Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units. We compare the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit. Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we revalue all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, excluding goodwill, to determine if the fair value of the net assets is greater than the net assets including goodwill. If the fair value of the net assets is less than the net assets including goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our annual long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly intangible assets associated with the Pillsbury, Totino s, Progresso, Green Giant , Old El Paso, H agen-Dazs and Uncle Tobys brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets, mainly brands, are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be 30 Table of Contents recoverable. We performed our fiscal 2008 assessment of our brand intangibles as of December 1, 2007. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands was based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which included: projected revenues from our annual long-range plan; assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands; and a discount rate. All brand intangibles had fair values in excess of their carrying values by at least 20 percent, except for the Pillsbury brand, which we estimated had a fair value 3 percent higher than its carrying value. This brand comprises nearly one-half of our total indefinite-lived intangible assets. If the growth rate for the global revenue from all uses of the Pillsbury brand decreases 50 basis points from the current planned growth rate, fair value would be reduced by approximately $150 million, assuming all other components of the fair value estimate remain unchanged. If the assumed royalty rate for all uses of the Pillsbury brand decreases by 50 basis points, fair value would be reduced by approximately $130 million, assuming all other components of the fair value estimate remain unchanged. If the applicable discount rate increases by 50 basis points, fair value of the Pillsbury brand would be reduced by approximately $170 million, assuming all other components of the fair value estimate remain unchanged. As of May 25, 2008, we reviewed each of the assumptions used in the annual impairment assessment performed as of December 1, 2007, and found them to still be appropriate. As of May 25, 2008, we had $10.6 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. While we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses and amortization expense. Stock Compensation Effective May 29, 2006, we adopted SFAS 123R, which changed the accounting for compensation expense associated with stock options, restricted stock awards, and other forms of equity compensation. We elected the modified prospective transition method as permitted by SFAS 123R; accordingly, results from prior periods were not restated. Under this method, stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2007 was $127.1 million, which included amortization related to the remaining unvested portion of all equity compensation awards granted prior to May 29, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS 123), and amortization related to all equity compensation awards granted on or subsequent to May 29, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. The incremental effect on net earnings in fiscal 2007 of our adoption of SFAS 123R was $68.8 million of expense ($42.9 million after-tax). All our stock compensation expense is recorded in SG&A expense in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Prior to May 29, 2006, we used the intrinsic value method for measuring the cost of compensation paid in our common stock. No compensation expense for stock options was recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings prior to fiscal 2007, as the exercise price was equal to the market price of our stock at the date of grant. Expense attributable to other types of share-based awards was recognized in our results under SFAS 123. The estimated weighted-average fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows: Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 Estimated fair values of stock options granted $10.55 $10.74 $8.04 Assumptions: Risk-free interest rate 5.1 % 5.3 % 4.3 % Expected term 8.5 years 8.0 years 7.0 years Expected volatility 15.6 % 19.7 % 20.0 % Dividend yield 2.7 % 2.8 % 2.9 % The valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate which requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements. Annually, we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, and dividend yield. We estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility over the expected term of the option, excluding time periods of volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in estimating our stock price volatility. For the fiscal 2008 grants, we have excluded historical volatility for fiscal 2002 and prior, primarily because volatility driven by our acquisition of The 31 Table of Contents Pillsbury Company in fiscal 2002 does not reflect what we believe to be expected future volatility. We also have considered, but did not use, implied volatility in our estimate, because trading activity in options on our stock, especially those with tenors of greater than 6 months, is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility. If all other assumptions are held constant, a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2008 volatility assumption would increase the grant-date fair value of our fiscal 2008 option awards by 4.3 percent. For fiscal 2007 and all prior periods, our estimate of expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility determined on a daily basis over the expected term of the options. We considered but did not use implied volatility because we believed historical volatility provided an appropriate expectation for our volatility in the future. Our expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model. Separate groups of employees have similar historical exercise behavior and therefore were aggregated into a single pool for valuation purposes. The weighted-average expected term for all employee groups is presented in the table above. An increase in the expected term by 1 year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would change the grant date fair value by significantly less than 1 percent. Our valuation model assumes that dividends and our share price increase in line with earnings, resulting in a constant dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to final intrinsic values. However, these differences can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options, as explained in the following two paragraphs. Furthermore, historical data has a significant bearing on our forward-looking assumptions. Significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then significantly impact the year-over-year comparability of stock-based compensation expense. SFAS 123R also provides that any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfall tax benefit ) is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a financing (rather than an operating) cash flow. For fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, the windfall tax benefits classified as financing cash flow were $55.7 million and $73.1 million. The actual impact on future years financing cash flow will depend, in part, on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise-date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant-date fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes. Realized windfall tax benefits are credited to additional paid-in capital within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Realized shortfall tax benefits (amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings) are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits, if any, and then charged directly to income tax expense, potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate. We calculated a cumulative amount of windfall tax benefits from post-1995 fiscal years for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits and currently have sufficient cumulative windfall tax benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls, such that we do not currently expect future earnings to be affected by this provision. However, as employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control, it is possible that materially different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. Income Taxes We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 as of the beginning of fiscal 2008. Prior to adoption, our policy was to establish reserves that reflected the probable outcome of known tax contingencies. The effects of final resolution, if any, were recognized as changes to the effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. FIN 48 requires application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. FIN 48 permits us to recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. It further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter of such change. Annually we file more than 350 income tax returns in approximately 100 global taxing jurisdictions. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or 32 Table of Contents the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position would usually require the use of cash. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions include the United States (federal and state) and Canada. We are no longer subject to United States federal examinations by the IRS for fiscal years before 2002. During fiscal 2008, we received a favorable District Court decision on an uncertain tax matter related to the fiscal years prior to 2002 and reduced our liability for uncertain tax positions by $21.0 million and related accrued interest by $9.7 million. The IRS has appealed the District Court decision, and accordingly, its ultimate resolution is subject to change. During the fiscal 2008, we also concluded various matters for fiscal years 1998-2001 which included a payment of $31.7 million. The IRS recently concluded field examinations for our 2002 and 2003 fiscal years. A payment of $24.8 million was made to cover the additional tax liability plus interest related to all agreed adjustments for this audit cycle. The IRS also proposed additional adjustments for the 2002-2003 audit cycle including several adjustments to the tax benefits associated with the sale of minority interests in our GMC subsidiary. We believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to vigorously defend our position. Our potential liability for this matter is significant and, notwithstanding our reserves against this potential liability, an unfavorable resolution could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations. We do not expect the amount of our tax reserves for these issues to materially change in the next 12 months. The IRS initiated its audit of our fiscal 2004 through 2006 tax years during fiscal 2008. Various tax examinations by United States state taxing authorities could be conducted for any open tax year, which vary by jurisdiction, but are generally from 3 to 5 years. Currently, several state examinations are in progress. The Canada Revenue Agency is conducting an audit of our income tax returns in Canada for fiscal years 2003 (which is our earliest tax year still open for examination) through 2005. We do not anticipate that any United States state tax or Canadian tax adjustments will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations. Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement, and Postemployment Benefit Plans We have defined benefit pension plans covering most domestic, Canadian, and United Kingdom employees. Benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation. Benefits for hourly employees include various monthly amounts for each year of credited service. Our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws. We made $14.2 million of voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2008. Our principal domestic retirement plan covering salaried employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would vest if the plan is terminated within five years of a change in control. We also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to the majority of our domestic and Canadian retirees. The salaried health care benefit plan is contributory, with retiree contributions based on years of service. We fund related trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis. We did not make voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2008. Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits to former or inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and members of our Board of Directors, including severance and certain other benefits payable upon death. We recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service. Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service (such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded. We recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants active working life. Accordingly, we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations. Assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans, and the health care cost trend rates. Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our 33 Table of Contents actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan, however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. The investment objective for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit obligations to participants at a reasonable cost to us. Our goal is to optimize the long-term return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk. The defined benefit pension and other postretirement portfolios are broadly diversified across asset classes. Within asset classes, the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations. For the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the long-term investment policy allocations are: 30 percent to equities in the United States; 20 percent to international equities; 10 percent to private equities; 30 percent to fixed income; and 10 percent to real assets (real estate, energy and timber). The actual allocations to these asset classes may vary tactically around the long-term policy allocations based on relative market valuations. Our historical investment returns (compound annual growth rates) for our United States defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan assets were 4 percent, 15 percent, 10 percent, 11 percent, and 12 percent for the 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 year periods ended May 25, 2008. For fiscal 2008, we assumed, on a weighted-average basis for all defined benefit plans, a rate of return of 9.4 percent. For fiscal 2007, we assumed, on a weighted-average basis for all defined benefit plans, a rate of return of 9.4 percent. For fiscal 2006, we assumed, on a weighted-average basis for all defined benefit plan assets, a rate of return of 9.6 percent. Our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the United States have an expected return on plan assets of 9.6 percent. During fiscal 2007, we lowered the expected rate of return on one of our other postretirement plans in the United States based on costs associated with insurance contracts owned by that plan. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by 50 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by $21 million for fiscal 2009. A 50 basis point shortfall between the assumed and actual rate of return on plan assets for fiscal 2009 would result in a similar amount of arising asset-experience loss. Any arising asset-experience loss is recognized on a market-related valuation basis, which reduces year-to-year volatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Since the market-related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. Our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income. Discount Rates Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of the last day of our fiscal year for all of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. Those same discount rates also are used to determine defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan income and expense for the following fiscal year. We work with our actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the top quartile of AA-rated corporate bond yields, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions. Our weighted-average discount rates were as follows: Weighted-Average Discount Rates Defined Other Benefit Postretirement Postemployment Pension Benefit Benefit Plans Plans Plans Obligation as of May 25, 2008, and fiscal 2009 expense 6.88 % 6.90 % 6.64 % Obligation as of May 27, 2007, and fiscal 2008 expense 6.18 % 6.15 % 6.05 % Fiscal 2007 expense 6.45 % 6.50 % 6.44 % Lowering the discount rates by 50 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2009 by approximately $18 million. All obligation-related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants. 34 Table of Contents Health Care Cost Trend Rates We review our health care trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 10.25 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 9.25 percent for retirees under age 65. These rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 5.2 percent is reached in 2016 for all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. A one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects: One One Percentage Percentage Point Point In Millions Increase Decrease Effect on the aggregate of the service and interest cost components in fiscal 2009 $ 7.6 $ (6.6 ) Effect on the other postretirement accumulated benefit obligation as of May 25, 2008 84.2 (74.3 ) Any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims. Once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over 15 years, resulting in at least the minimum amortization required being recorded. Financial Statement Impact In fiscal 2008, we recorded net defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan expense of $18.9 million compared to $36.2 million in fiscal 2007 and $29.7 million in fiscal 2006. As of May 25, 2008, we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of $276.8 million on our defined benefit pension plans, $115.6 million on our other postretirement benefit plans, and $8.0 million on our postemployment benefit plans, mainly as the result of decreases in our discount rate assumptions. These unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in decreases in our future pension income and increases in postretirement expense since they currently exceed the corridors defined by GAAP. We use the Retirement Plans (RP) 2000 Mortality Table projected forward to our plans measurement dates for calculating the year end defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit obligations and annual expense. Actual future net defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance, changes in future discount rates, changes in health care trend rates, and various other factors related to the populations participating in these plans. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In April 2008, the FASB finalized Staff Position No. 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP 142-3). This position amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . FSP 142-3 applies to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets and both intangible assets acquired in business combinations and asset acquisitions. This position is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We are evaluating the impact of FSP 142-3 on our results of operations and financial condition. In March 2008, the FASB approved the issuance of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 07-5, Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) is Indexed to an Entity Own Stock (EITF 07-5). EITF 07-5 defines when adjustment features within contracts are considered to be equity-indexed and will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We are evaluating the impact of EITF 07-5 on our results of operations and financial condition. In December 2007, the FASB approved the issuance of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any controlling interest; recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from 35 Table of Contents a bargain purchase; and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141R applies to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after December 15, 2008. SFAS 141R also changes the accounting for acquisition-related tax contingencies, requiring all such changes in these contingency reserves to be recorded in earnings after the effective date. We have significant unrecognized tax positions related to our acquisition of Pillsbury. Adjustments to these liabilities after the adoption of SFAS 141R could be material to our net earnings. In December 2007, the FASB approved the issuance of SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment to ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards that require the ownership interest in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified and presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets within equity, but separate from the parent equity; the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings; and changes in a parent ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary be accounted for consistently. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We are evaluating the impact of SFAS 160 on our results of operations and financial condition. In June 2007, the FASB approved the issuance of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 06-11, Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment Awards (EITF 06-11). EITF 06-11 requires that tax benefits from dividends paid on unvested restricted shares be charged directly to stockholders equity instead of benefiting income tax expense. EITF 06-11, which will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, is expected to increase our effective income tax rate by 20 basis points, or from 34.4 percent to 34.6 percent based on our actual 2008 effective tax rate. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of SFAS No. 115 (SFAS 159). This statement provides companies with an option to measure, at specified election dates, many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently measured at fair value. A company that adopts SFAS 159 will report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. This statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We do not believe that the adoption of SFAS 159 will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). This statement provides a single definition of fair value, a framework for measuring fair value, and expanded disclosures concerning fair value. Previously, different definitions of fair value were contained in various accounting pronouncements creating inconsistencies in measurement and disclosures. SFAS 157 applies under those previously issued pronouncements that prescribe fair value as the relevant measure of value, except SFAS 123R and related interpretations and pronouncements that require or permit measurement similar to fair value but are not intended to measure fair value. This pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2009. However, SFAS 157 as it relates to fair value measurement requirements for non-financial assets and liabilities that are not remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We are evaluating the impact of SFAS 157 on our results of operations and financial condition. NON-GAAP MEASURES We have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure, an explanation of why our management or the Board of Directors believes the non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors, and any additional purposes for which our management or Board of Directors uses the non-GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable GAAP measure. 36 Table of Contents Total Segment Operating Profit This non-GAAP measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the Board of Directors measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. Management and the Board of Directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate segment performance. A reconciliation of this measure to operating profit, the relevant GAAP measure, is included in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Return on Average Total Capital This ratio is not defined by GAAP, and is used in internal management reporting and as a component of the Board of Directors rating of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. Management and the Board of Directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is important for assessing the utilization of capital.
