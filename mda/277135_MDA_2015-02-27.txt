Item 7: Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview General . Grainger is a broad-line distributor of maintenance, repair and operating supplies, and other related products and services used by businesses and institutions. Grainger operations are primarily in the United States and Canada, with presence also in Europe, Asia and Latin America. Grainger uses a combination of multichannel and single channel online business models to provide customers with a range of options for finding and purchasing products, utilizing sales representatives, catalogs, direct marketing materials and eCommerce. Grainger serves more than 2 million customers worldwide through a network of highly integrated branches, distribution centers and websites. Grainger two reportable segments are the United States and Canada. The United States segment reflects the results of Grainger U.S. operating segment. The Canada segment reflects the results for Acklands Grainger, Grainger Canadian operating segment. Other businesses, which include Zoro and operations in Europe, Asia and Latin America, are not material individually. Business Environment . Given Grainger's large number of customers and the diverse industries it serves, several economic factors and industry trends tend to shape Grainger business environment. The overall economy and leading economic indicators provide general insight into projecting Grainger growth. Grainger sales in the United States and Canada tend to positively correlate with Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Industrial Production, Exports and Business Investment. In the United States, sales also tend to positively correlate with Business Inventory. In Canada, sales also tend to positively correlate with oil prices. The table below provides these estimated indicators for 2014 and 2015: United States Canada Estimated 2014 Forecasted 2015 Estimated 2014 Forecasted 2015 GDP 2.4 % 3.0 % 2.4 % 1.9 % Industrial Production 4.3 % 3.0 % 3.7 % (0.2 )% Exports 3.1 % 3.3 % 5.1 % 3.9 % Business Investment 6.3 % 8.4 % 0.3 % (0.8 )% Business Inventory 3.8 % 3.7 % Oil Prices $93/barrel $42/barrel Source: Global Insight (February 2015) In the United States, business investment and exports are two major indicators of MRO spend. After growing 11% for two straight quarters, business investment slowed to 1% in the fourth quarter of 2014, according to Global Insight. However, given the economy's momentum at the end of 2014, as demonstrated through the November and December employment reports, business spending is expected to rebound in the first quarter of 2015. However, investment in equipment is expected to face headwinds if weak foreign demand continues. Export growth is expected to remain in the low single-digits due to subpar world growth and a strong U.S. dollar. The light and heavy manufacturing customer sectors, which comprised approximately 30% of Grainger total 2014 sales, have historically correlated with manufacturing employment levels and manufacturing production. The United States Department of Labor reported an increase of 1.5% in manufacturing employment levels from December 2013 to December 2014 . According to the Federal Reserve, manufacturing output increased 4.9% from December 2013 to December 2014 . These increases contributed to a high single-digit percent sales increase in the heavy manufacturing customer sector and a mid single-digit percent sales increase in the light manufacturing customer sector for Grainger in 2014. While full year 2014 economic growth for Canada was positive, the Canadian economy experienced pressure throughout the year as the Canadian dollar weakened to new five-year lows versus the U.S. dollar. The weak Canadian dollar, combined with a 1% drop in the commodity price index for metals and minerals from December 2013 to December 2014, have impacted the performance of the Canadian business, which is heavily dependent on the natural resources sector. These market factors led to declines in the agriculture and mining sectors for the Canadian business in 2014. In addition, the recent decline of oil prices has caused investment in Canada's oil and gas industries to slow, according to the Royal Bank of Canada. Outlook . In 2015, Grainger plans to continue to make investments in its supply chain, information systems, eCommerce, sales force and inventory management services. These investments are expected to accelerate market share growth and increase Grainger's size and scale. 14 On January 26, 2015, Grainger revised its 2015 earnings per share guidance from a range of $12.90 to $13.80 to a range of $12.60 to $13.60 and also revised its 2015 sales guidance from a range of 5 to 9 percent to a range of 3 to 7 percent. This change is driven by unfavorable foreign exchange and the weak economy in Canada. Matters Affecting Comparability. Grainger completed several acquisitions throughout 2014 , 2013 and 2012, all of which were immaterial individually and in the aggregate. Grainger operating results have included the results of each business acquired since the respective acquisition dates. Results of Operations The following table is included as an aid to understanding changes in Grainger's Consolidated Statements of Earnings: For the Years Ended December 31, As a Percent of Net Sales Percent Increase/(Decrease) from Prior Year 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 5.6 % 5.4 % Cost of merchandise sold 56.7 56.2 56.2 6.6 5.3 Gross profit 43.3 43.8 43.8 4.3 5.6 Operating expenses 29.8 30.1 31.2 4.5 2.0 Operating earnings 13.5 13.7 12.6 3.9 14.7 Other income (expense) (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.1 ) 37.6 (30.6 ) Income taxes 5.2 5.1 4.7 8.8 14.5 Noncontrolling interest 0.1 0.1 0.1 (1.4 ) 19.5 Net earnings attributable to W.W.

The 6% increase for the year consisted of the following contributors: Percent Increase/ (Decrease) Volume 5 Business acquisition, net of divestitures 1 Price 1 Foreign exchange (1) Total 6% Net sales to most customer end markets increased for 2014 . The increase in net sales was led by growth in sales to heavy and light manufacturing customers, as well as diversified commercial services customers. Refer to the Segment Analysis below for further details. Gross profit of $ 4,314 million for 2014 increased 4% . The gross profit margin for 2014 was 43.3% , down 0.5 percentage point versus 2013 , primarily driven by lower margins from the newly acquired businesses, faster growth with lower margin customers, charges related to closing the business in Brazil and restructuring the business in Europe, partially offset by price inflation exceeding cost inflation. Operating expenses of $ 2,967 million for 2014 increased 4% from $ 2,840 million for 2013 . The increase was primarily driven by an incremental $78 million in growth-related spending on eCommerce, new sales representatives, supply chain and inventory management solutions, as well as charges related to closing the business in Brazil, restructuring costs and the transition of the retirement plan in Europe, and an impairment charge for the business in Colombia. 15 Operating earnings of $ 1,347 million for 2014 increased 4% from $ 1,297 million for 2013 . Operating earnings in 2014 included a $29 million charge related to closing the business in Brazil, a $14 million charge related to the transition of the employee retirement plan in Europe, a $12 million impairment charge for the business in Colombia and $10 million in restructuring costs for the business in Europe. Operating earnings in 2013 included a $26 million expense related to impairment charges for the business in Brazil and Grainger Lighting Services, as well as $10 million of restructuring costs for the businesses in Europe and China. Excluding these charges from both years, operating earnings increased 6%, primarily due to higher sales and operating expenses increasing at a slower rate than sales. Net earnings attributable to Grainger for 2014 increased by 1% to $ 802 million from $ 797 million in 2013 . The increase in net earnings primarily resulted from an increase in operating earnings. Diluted earnings per share of $11.45 in 2014 were 3% higher than $11.13 for 2013 , due to increased net earnings and lower average shares outstanding. The table below reconciles reported diluted earnings per share determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States to adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure. Management believes adjusted diluted earnings per share is an important indicator of operations because it excludes items that may not be indicative of core operating results. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare this financial measure with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2014 2013 % Diluted earnings per share reported $11.45 $11.13 3 % Brazil business shutdown 0.40 Pension change 0.15 Restructuring 0.15 0.10 Goodwill impairment 0.11 0.29 Subtotal 0.81 0.39 Diluted earnings per share adjusted $12.26 $11.52 6 % Segment Analysis The following comments at the reportable segment and other business unit level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. United States Net sales were $ 7,926 million for 2014 , an increase of $ 512 million , or 7% , when compared with net sales of $ 7,414 million for 2013 . The 7% increase for the year consisted of the following contributors: Percent Increase Volume 4 Business acquisition, net of divestitures 2 Price 1 Total 7% Net sales to most customer end markets increased for 2014 . The increase was led by low double-digit growth to the natural resources end market, followed by high single-digit growth to heavy manufacturing customers and mid-single digit growth to light manufacturing, commercial services, retail and government customers. Resellers were up in the low single digits and contractors were down in the low single digits. The segment gross profit margin decreased 0.4 percentage point in 2014 compared to 2013 , primarily driven by lower margins from the acquired businesses and faster growth with lower margin customers, partially offset by price increases exceeding product cost increases. 16 Operating expenses were up 3% for 2014 versus 2013 . Operating expenses in 2013 included a $13 million expense related to goodwill impairment charges for Grainger Lighting Services. Excluding this expense from the prior year, the growth in operating expenses was primarily driven by an incremental $57 million in growth-related spending on new sales representatives, supply chain and inventory management solutions. For the segment, operating earnings of $ 1,444 million for 2014 increased 11% over $ 1,304 million in 2013 . Excluding the expense mentioned above in the prior year, operating earnings were up 10%. The improvement in operating earnings for 2014 was due to an increase in net sales and operating expenses increasing at a slower rate than sales. Canada Net sales were $ 1,076 million for 2014 , a decrease of $ 38 million , or 3% , when compared with $ 1,114 million for 2013 . In local currency, sales increased 4% for 2014. The 3% decrease for the year consisted of the following contributors: Percent Increase/ (Decrease) Business acquisition 2 Volume 1 Price 1 Foreign exchange (7) Total (3)% Sales performance in Canada was driven by double-digit growth in the utilities market, followed by high single-digit growth in the forestry market and mid-single digit growth to commercial services and heavy manufacturing customers. Net sales in the construction, agriculture and mining end markets were down in the high single digits. The segment gross profit margin decreased 1.7 percentage points in 2014 versus 2013 , primarily driven by product cost inflation exceeding price inflation driven by unfavorable foreign exchange, higher freight costs and lower supplier rebates as well as negative mix from the WFS acquisition. Operating expenses increased 3% in 2014 . In local currency, operating expenses increased 10% , primarily due to the WFS acquisition, higher payroll and information technology expenses, as well as costs associated with opening a new DC. Operating earnings of $ 88 million for 2014 decreased $ 41 million , or 32% , versus 2013 . In local currency, operating earnings decreased 27% . The decrease in earnings was due to operating expenses increasing at a faster rate than sales and lower gross profit margins. Other Businesses Net sales were $1,182 million for 2014 , an increase of $142 million, or 14%, when compared with $1,040 million for 2013 . The net sales increase was primarily due to incremental sales from Zoro and the businesses in Japan and Mexico. The 14% increase for the year consisted of the following contributors: Percent Increase/ (Decrease) Volume/Price 18 Foreign exchange (4) Total 14% Operating earnings for other businesses were a loss of $ 38 million for 2014 compared to earnings of $ 8 million for 2013 . The year 2014 included a $29 million charge related to closing the business in Brazil, a $14 million charge related to the transition of the employee retirement plan in Europe, a $12 million impairment charge for the business in Colombia and $10 million in restructuring costs for the business in Europe. The year 2013 included $13 million of expense related to impairment charges for the business in Brazil and $10 million of expense in structural changes to the businesses in Europe and China. Excluding these charges in both years, operating earnings decreased $3 million, or 10%, primarily driven by incremental expenses associated with the start-up of the single channel online business model in Europe. 17 Other Income and Expense Other income and expense was $13 million of expense in 2014 compared with $9 million of expense in 2013. The following table summarizes the components of other income and expense (in thousands of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Interest income (expense) - net $ (8,025 ) $ (9,991 ) Other non-operating income 483 2,732 Other non-operating expense (5,189 ) (1,996 ) Total $ (12,731 ) $ (9,255 ) Other non-operating expense increased in 2014 due to higher foreign exchange transaction losses. Income Taxes Income taxes of $ 522 million in 2014 increased 9% as compared with $ 480 million in 2013 . Grainger's reported tax rates were 39.1% and 37.3% in 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Excluding the effect of the separately identified charges reported in both 2014 and 2013, Grainger's reported tax rate was 38.2% and 37.3% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in the reported tax rate in 2014 was primarily due to a higher proportion of earnings in the United States versus geographies with lower tax rates and losses with no tax benefit. 2013 Compared to 2012 Grainger's net sales of $9,438 million for 2013 increased 5% when compared with net sales of $8,950 million for 2012. The 5% increase for the year consisted of the following contributors: Percent Increase/ (Decrease) Volume 3 Business acquisitions 2 Price 1 Foreign exchange (1) Total 5% Net sales to most customer end markets increased for 2013. The increase in net sales was led by growth in sales to heavy and light manufacturing customers, followed by diversified commercial services customers. Refer to the Segment Analysis below for further details. Gross profit of $4,136 million for 2013 increased 6%. The gross profit margin for 2013 was 43.8%, flat versus 2012, primarily driven by price increases exceeding product cost increases, offset by lower margins from the acquired businesses and faster growth with lower margin customers. Operating expenses of $2,840 million for 2013 increased 2% from $2,785 million for 2012. Operating expenses in 2013 included a $26 million expense related to the impairment charges for the business in Brazil and Grainger Lighting Services in the United States. Also included was $10 million of expense related to restructuring charges for improving the long-term performance of the businesses in Europe and China. Operating expenses in 2012 included a $76 million expense related to the settlement of disputes involving the GSA and USPS contracts. Also included in 2012 was $24 million of expense related to branch closure costs, restructuring charges related to improving the long-term performance of the businesses in Europe, India and China and an impairment charge for Grainger Lighting Services. Excluding these expenses from both years, operating expenses increased 4%, primarily driven by the acquisitions and an incremental $132 million in growth-related spending on new sales representatives, eCommerce and inventory management solutions, primarily in the United States. Operating earnings of $1,297 million for 2013 increased 15% from $1,131 million for 2012. Excluding the expenses mentioned above for both years, operating earnings increased 8%, primarily due to higher sales and operating expenses increasing at a slower rate than sales. 18 Net earnings attributable to Grainger for 2013 increased by 16% to $797 million from $690 million in 2012. The increase in net earnings primarily resulted from an increase in operating earnings. Diluted earnings per share of $11.13 in 2013 were 17% higher than $9.52 for 2012, due to increased net earnings and lower average shares outstanding. The table below reconciles reported diluted earnings per share determined in accordance with GAAP in the United States to adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure. Management believes adjusted diluted earnings per share is an important indicator of operations because it excludes items that may not be indicative of core operating results.

Government was up in the low single digits and net sales to resellers were down in the low single digits. The segment gross profit margin decreased 0.3 percentage point in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily driven by lower margins from the acquired businesses and faster growth with lower margin customers, partially offset by price increases exceeding product cost increases.

Net sales to heavy manufacturing customers were down in the mid-single digits and the government end market was down in the low single digits. The segment gross profit margin increased 0.4 percentage point in 2013 over 2012, primarily driven by price increases exceeding product cost increases and favorable freight rates, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange on purchases. Operating expenses increased 2% in 2013. In local currency, operating expenses increased 5%, primarily due to higher volume-related payroll, occupancy and technology investments, partially offset by lower warehouse expenses. Operating earnings of $129 million for 2013 were up $1 million, or 1%, versus 2012. In local currency, operating earnings increased 4%. The increase in earnings was due to sales growth and improved gross profit margins, partially offset by operating expenses increasing at a faster rate than sales. Other Businesses Net sales were $1,040 million for 2013, an increase of $33 million, or 3%, when compared with $1,007 million for 2012. The net sales increase was primarily due to incremental sales from Zoro, Brazil and Mexico, partially offset by lower sales in India due to a change in its business model.

The year 2013 included $13 million of expense related to impairment charges for the business in Brazil and $10 million of expense in structural changes to the businesses in Europe and China. The year 2012 included $14 million of charges related to restructuring the businesses in Europe, India and China. Excluding these charges, operating earnings decreased $4 million, or 11%, primarily driven by lower earnings from the businesses in Latin America, partially offset by higher earnings at Zoro and Japan. 20 Other Income and Expense Other income and expense was $9 million of expense in 2013 compared with $13 million of expense in 2012. The following table summarizes the components of other income and expense (in thousands of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Interest income (expense) - net $ (9,991 ) $ (13,418 ) Other non-operating income 2,732 1,866 Other non-operating expense (1,996 ) (1,784 ) Total $ (9,255 ) $ (13,336 ) Net interest expense decreased in 2013 due to lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher average outstanding debt. Income Taxes Income taxes of $480 million in 2013 increased 15% as compared with $419 million in 2012. Grainger's reported tax rates were 37.3% and 37.5% in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Financial Condition Grainger expects its strong working capital position, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue, allowing it to fund its operations, including growth initiatives, capital expenditures, acquisitions and repurchase of shares, as well as to pay cash dividends. Cash Flow 2014 Compared to 2013 Cash from operating activities continues to serve as Grainger's primary source of liquidity. Net cash flows from operations in 2014 were $960 million versus $986 million in 2013. Cash flows from operations were lower in 2014 primarily due to higher inventory purchases in 2014 compared to 2013. In 2013, the inventory position at the start of the year was higher due to lower sales in December 2012 as well as an inventory build to facilitate the move of Grainger's Chicago-area distribution center. Net cash used in investing activities was $384 million and $399 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The lower use of cash was primarily driven by acquisition activity. Less cash was spent on acquisitions in 2014 versus 2013. The lower use of cash from acquisition activity in 2014 was partially offset by more cash expended in 2014 for additions to property, buildings and equipment, primarily related to supply chain investments. Net cash used in financing activities of $758 million in 2014 increased $167 million from $591 million in 2013. The increase was primarily due to a partial repayment of the term loan in the United States as well as an increase in the purchase of treasury stock and dividends paid. This was partially offset by proceeds from the new revolving credit facility in the Canadian business. 2013 Compared to 2012 Cash from operating activities served as Grainger's primary source of liquidity. Net cash flows from operations in 2013 were $986 million and increased $170 million from $816 million in 2012. The primary driver of the improvement was an increase in net earnings of $109 million. In addition, changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net use of cash of $58 million for 2013 compared to $129 million for 2012. The lower use of cash for operating assets and liabilities was driven primarily by higher trade accounts payable due to higher inventory purchases at year-end in 2013 compared to 2012, partially offset by higher accounts receivable from increased sales. Net cash used in investing activities was $399 million and $306 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. The higher use of cash in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily driven by the increased cash paid for acquisitions and cash expended for property, buildings, equipment and software. 21 Net cash used in financing activities of $591 million in 2013 increased $197 million from $394 million in 2012. The increase was primarily due to higher treasury share repurchases. Cash paid for treasury share purchases was $438 million in 2013 versus $341 million in 2012, an increase of $97 million. The prior year also included $300 million in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt. Working Capital Internally generated funds are the primary source of working capital and funds used in business expansion, supplemented by debt. In addition, funds are expended to support growth initiatives, as well as for business and systems development and other infrastructure improvements. Working capital consists of current assets (less non-operating cash) and current liabilities (less short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt). Working capital was $1,697 million at December 31, 2014 , compared with $1,621 million at December 31, 2013 . At these dates, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.4 and 2.5 , respectively. The increase in working capital was primarily related to higher receivable balances driven by sales volume and an increase in extended terms given to customers. Capital Expenditures In each of the past three years, a portion of operating cash has been used for additions to property, buildings, equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table (in thousands of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Land, buildings, structures and improvements $ 159,793 $ 60,419 $ 57,929 Furniture, fixtures, machinery and equipment 140,358 152,328 145,483 Subtotal 300,151 212,747 203,412 Capitalized software 87,239 59,398 46,448 Total $ 387,390 $ 272,145 $ 249,860 In 2014, Grainger made significant capital investments to build new distribution centers in the United States and Canada. In the United States, Grainger began construction of a new 1.3 million square-foot distribution center in New Jersey. In Canada, Grainger continued construction of the new distribution center in the Toronto area. Grainger also invested in technology infrastructure, vending machines for the KeepStock program and normal recurring replacement of equipment. In 2013 and 2012, significant capital expenditures included investments in the distribution center network in the United States and Canada. In the United States, Grainger opened a new 1 million square-foot and highly automated Chicago-area distribution center in 2013. In Canada, Grainger began construction of the 535,000 square-foot distribution center in the Toronto area. Other significant investments in 2013 and 2012 included investing in a new eCommerce platform, sustaining capital investments for Grainger's branches and distribution centers and other technology infrastructure. In 2015, capital expenditures are expected to range from $375 million to $425 million. Projected spending includes continued investments in the supply chain, technology infrastructure, eCommerce and in support of sales initiatives. Grainger expects to fund 2015 capital spending from operating cash. Debt Grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long-term cash requirements. In addition to internally generated funds, Grainger has various sources of financing available, including bank borrowings under lines of credit. Refer to Note 6 and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 12.9% and 14.0% as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The reduction in total debt as a percent of total capitalization was primarily due to the partial repayment of the term loan in the United States in 2014. Grainger believes any circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt obligations would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position. 22 Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations At December 31, 2014, Grainger's contractual obligations, including estimated payments due by period, are as follows (in thousands of dollars): Payments Due by Period Total Amounts Committed Less than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 4 - 5 Years More than 5 Years Debt obligations $ 484,836 $ 80,300 $ 250,494 $ 149,826 $ 4,216 Interest on debt 27,270 9,557 10,869 6,834 10 Operating lease obligations 186,153 65,901 80,702 31,737 7,813 Purchase obligations: Uncompleted additions to property, buildings and equipment 116,839 116,839 Commitments to purchase inventory 415,582 415,582 Other purchase obligations 307,948 190,559 101,646 15,743 Other liabilities 359,039 187,117 25,717 26,397 119,808 Total $ 1,897,667 $ 1,065,855 $ 469,428 $ 230,537 $ 131,847 Purchase obligations for inventory are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs. While purchase orders for both inventory purchases and non-inventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract. Other liabilities represent future payments for profit sharing and employee benefits plans as determined by actuarial projections, and other employee benefit plans. Other employment-related benefits costs of $59 million have not been included in this table as the timing of benefit payments is not predictable. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Note 7 and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail related to the interest on long-term debt and operating lease obligations, respectively. Grainger has recorded a noncurrent liability of approximately $49 million for tax uncertainties and interest at December 31, 2014 . This amount is excluded from the table above, as Grainger cannot make reliable estimates of these cash flows by period. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Grainger does not have any material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements. Grainger does not have any variable interest entities or activities that include non-exchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair value. 23 Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions, which it believes are reasonable. If actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates, the revisions are included in Grainger's results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. Accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made and when there are different estimates that management reasonably could have made, which would have a material impact on the presentation of Grainger's financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow. Actual results in these areas could differ materially from management's estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts . Grainger considers several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivables, the percent past due and the historical ratio of actual write-offs to the age of the receivables. The analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry, group of customers or a specific customer. Based on analysis of actual historical write-offs of uncollectible accounts receivable, Grainger's estimates and assumptions have been materially accurate in regards to the valuation of its allowance for doubtful accounts. However, write-offs could be materially different than the reserves established if business or economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends, and Grainger's estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate to reflect these changes. For fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012 , actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts. Inventory Reserves . Grainger establishes inventory reserves for obsolete inventory. Grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities. Grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value. Estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand, market conditions and liquidation values. As Grainger's inventory consists of approximately 1.4 million stocked products, it is not practical to quantify the actual disposition of excess and obsolete inventory against estimated amounts at a stock keeping unit (SKU) level and no individual SKU is material. There were no material differences noted between reserve levels compared to the level of write-offs historically. Grainger's methodology for estimating reserves is continually evaluated based on current experience and the methodology provides for a materially accurate level of reserves at any reporting date. Actual results could differ materially from projections and require changes to reserves which could have a material effect on Grainger's results of operations based on significant changes in product demand, market conditions or liquidation value. If business or economic conditions change, Grainger's estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate. For fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012 , actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets . Business acquisitions result in the recording of goodwill and identified intangible assets which affect the amount of amortization expense and possible impairment write-downs that may occur in future periods. Grainger annually reviews goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment in the fourth quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. Grainger tests for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level and performs a qualitative assessment of factors such as a reporting unit's current performance and overall economic factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. In the two-step test, Grainger compares the carrying value of assets of the reporting unit to its calculated fair value. If the carrying value of assets of the reporting unit exceeds its calculated fair value, the second step is performed, where the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying value of assets, to determine the amount of impairment. 24 The fair value of reporting units is calculated primarily using the discounted cash flow (DCF) method and incorporating value indicators from a market approach to evaluate the reasonableness of the resulting fair values. The DCF method incorporates various assumptions including the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, including revenues, gross margins, operating expenses, capital expenditures and working capital based on operational budgets, long range strategic plans and other estimates. The terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period and reflects management best estimates for perpetual growth for the reporting units. Estimates of market-participant risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital (WACC) are used as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to the reporting units future expected cash flows and terminal value. Grainger completed the annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of 2014, and identified two reporting units for which it could not determine whether or not the fair value would be less than the carrying value. For one of these reporting units, Grainger Colombia, the two-step quantitative test indicated that the carrying value of assets exceeded the calculated fair value and step two impairment calculations were required. During the testing in the fourth quarter, Grainger considered management revised outlook on the business, which included lower projected sales growth and incremental investment necessary to execute on the strategy. Grainger incorporated this revised outlook into the two-step quantitative test, resulting in lowered projected sales growth, operating earnings and cash flows. Grainger recorded a full goodwill impairment charge of $12 million on the Grainger Colombia reporting unit. Fabory, with $118 million of goodwill, had a calculated fair value which exceeded the carrying value of assets by 31%, and step two calculations were not required for this reporting unit. The risk of potential failure of step one of the impairment test for Fabory in future reporting periods is highly dependent upon key assumptions including the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, sales growth rates, gross margins, capital expenditures, discount rates and estimates of market-participant risk-adjusted WACC. These assumptions require considerable management judgment and are subject to uncertainty. Grainger performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the reasonableness of the step one results, and evaluated the impact of a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate or a 100 basis point decrease in the terminal growth rate. No indications of impairment resulted from this sensitivity analysis. Changes in assumptions regarding future performance and a continued unfavorable economic environment in Europe may also have a significant impact on cash flows in the future. Given the sensitivity of the calculated fair value to changes in these key assumptions, Grainger may be required to recognize an impairment for Fabory goodwill in the future due to changes in market conditions or other factors related to these key assumptions. For Grainger remaining reporting units, the estimated fair values substantially exceeded the carrying values. 25 Stock Incentive Plans . Grainger maintains stock incentive plans under which a variety of incentive grants may be awarded to employees and directors. Grainger uses a binomial lattice option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants. The model requires projections of the risk-free interest rate, expected life, volatility, dividend yield and forfeiture rate of the stock option grants. The fair value of options granted used the following assumptions: For the Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Risk-free interest rate 2.0% 0.9% 1.1% Expected life 6 years 6 years 6 years Expected volatility 25.0% 25.5% 25.9% Expected dividend yield 1.7% 1.5% 1.6% The risk-free interest rate is selected based on yields from U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected term of the options being valued. The expected life selected for options granted during each year presented represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding based on historical data of option holders' exercise and termination behavior. Expected volatility is based upon implied and historical volatility of the closing price of Grainger's stock over a period equal to the expected life of each option grant. Historical information is also the primary basis for selection of the expected dividend yield assumptions. Because stock option compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures, using historical forfeiture experience. The amount of stock option compensation expense is significantly affected by the valuation model and these assumptions. If a different valuation model or different assumptions were used, the stock option compensation expense could be significantly different from what is recorded in the current period. Compensation expense for other stock-based awards is based upon the closing market price on the last trading date preceding the date of the grant. Because the expense for other stock-based awards should reflect the awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures, using historical forfeiture experience. For additional information concerning stock incentive plans, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Postretirement Healthcare Benefits . The postretirement healthcare obligation and net periodic cost are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts. The assumptions used include, among others, discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates, and certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality rates. Changes in these and other assumptions (caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience, for example) could have a material effect on Grainger's postretirement benefit obligation and expense, and could affect its results of operations and financial condition. These changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation. The discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on high-quality fixed income debt instruments as of December 31, the measurement date, of each year. A higher discount rate reduces the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs. As of December 31, 2014 , Grainger decreased the discount rate used in the calculation of the postretirement plan obligation from 4.90% to 3.89% to reflect the decrease in market interest rates. Grainger estimates that this decrease could decrease 2015 pretax earnings by approximately $4.4 million. However, other changes in assumptions may increase, decrease or eliminate this effect. Grainger considers the long-term historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index and the Total International Composite Index in developing its expected long-term return on plan assets. In 2014, Grainger increased the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets from 5.70% (net of tax) to 6.65% (net of tax) based on the historical average of long-term rates of return net of estimated tax rates. Grainger estimates this change could increase 2015 pretax earnings by approximately $1.5 million. 26 A 1 percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have had the following effects on December 31, 2014 results (in thousands of dollars): 1 Percentage Point Increase (Decrease) Effect on total of service and interest cost $ 1,978 $ (1,613 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation 36,470 (29,404 ) Grainger changed the mortality improvement table used to project mortality rates into the future from Mortality Table RP-2000 with Mortality Improvement Scale BB to Mortality Table RP-2014 with Mortality Improvement Scale MP 2014 at December 31, 2014, which was published by the Society of Actuaries in October 2014, and reflects longer life expectancies than under the previous table and scale. Grainger estimates this change could reduce 2015 pretax earnings by approximately $0.9 million. Grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time, subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. In the event the postretirement plan is terminated, all assets of the Group Benefit Trust inure to the benefit of the participants. The foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue. Were the postretirement plan to terminate, different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable. Grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate. Changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience or new trends or plan changes and, therefore, may affect Grainger's retirement plan obligations and future expense. For additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Insurance Reserves . Grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers' compensation, auto liability, general liability and property losses through the utilization of high deductibles and self-insured retentions. There are also certain other risk areas for which Grainger does not maintain insurance. Grainger is responsible for establishing accounting policies on insurance reserves. Although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs, it retains control over actuarial assumptions, including loss development factors and claim payment patterns. Grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks, which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve levels. In calculating the liability, historical trends, claims experience and loss development patterns are analyzed and appropriate loss development factors are applied to the incurred costs associated with the claims made. The use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time. Any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current period's results of operations. Grainger believes its estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available and the methodology used to estimate these reserves has been consistently applied. There were no material adjustments based on Grainger's historical experience in 2014, 2013 and 2012 . If actual trends, including the nature, severity or frequency of claims differ from Grainger's estimates, or if business or economic conditions change, Grainger's estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate and the results of operations could be materially impacted. Income Taxes . Grainger recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The tax balances and income tax expense recognized by Grainger are based on management's interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions. Income tax expense reflects Grainger's best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other items, the level of future taxable income, interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities, plans for reinvestment of cash overseas and uncertain tax positions. Future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation, changes in projected levels of taxable income, changes in planned need for cash overseas and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by Grainger. 27 Contingent Liabilities . At any time, Grainger may be subject to investigations, legal proceedings, or claims related to the ongoing operation of its business, including claims both by and against Grainger. Such proceedings typically involve claims related to product liability, general negligence, contract disputes, environmental issues, wage and hour laws, intellectual property, employment practices, regulatory compliance or other matters and actions brought by employees, consumers, competitors, suppliers or governmental entities. Grainger routinely assesses the likelihood of any adverse outcomes related to these matters on a case by case basis, as well as the potential ranges of losses and fees. Grainger establishes accruals for its potential exposure, as appropriate, for claims against Grainger when losses become probable and reasonably estimable. Where Grainger is able to reasonably estimate a range of potential losses, Grainger records the amount within that range that constitutes Grainger's best estimate. Grainger also discloses the nature of and range of loss for claims against Grainger when losses are reasonably possible and material. These accruals and disclosures are determined based on the facts and circumstances related to the individual cases and require estimates and judgments regarding the interpretation of facts and laws, as well as the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond Grainger's control. Other . Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements. Policies such as revenue recognition, depreciation, intangibles, long-lived assets, fair value measurements and valuations, and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of Grainger. More information on these additional accounting policies can be found in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Effects of Inflation and Changing Prices Grainger is affected by inflation through increased product and operating costs, and the ability to pass on cost increases to customers over time is dependent upon market conditions. The ability to achieve sales growth through increased prices is also subject to inflation and normal competitive conditions. The predominant use of the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements. Some of Grainger's products contain significant amounts of commodity-priced materials, such as steel, copper, petroleum derivatives or rare earth minerals, and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market. Grainger has been able to successfully pass on cost increases to its customers minimizing the effect of inflation on results of operations. Grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lie in the continued application of basic business principles, which include improving productivity, maintaining working capital turnover and offering products and services that can command appropriate prices in the marketplace. 28 Forward-Looking Statements This Form 10-K contains statements that are not historical in nature but concern future results and business plans, strategies and objectives and other matters that may be deemed to be forward-looking statements under the federal securities laws. Such forward-looking statements are identified by words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, forecast, intend, plan, predict" and "project or similar expressions, and include Grainger's expected earnings per share, sales growth and capital expenditures. Grainger cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although Grainger does believe that its assumptions underlying its forward-looking statements are reasonable. Achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause Grainger's results to differ materially from those which are presented. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in a forward-looking statement include, without limitation: higher product costs or other expenses; a major loss of customers; loss or disruption of source of supply; increased competitive pricing pressures; failure to develop or implement new technologies or business strategies; the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings; investigations, inquiries, audits and changes in laws and regulations; disruption of information technology or data security systems; general industry or market conditions; general global economic conditions; currency exchange rate fluctuations; market volatility; commodity price volatility; labor shortages; litigation involving appropriate payment for wages; facilities disruptions or shutdowns; higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services; natural and other catastrophes; unanticipated weather conditions; and the factors identified in Item 1A: Risk Factors. Caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on Grainger's forward-looking statements and Grainger undertakes no obligation to publicly update the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 29
