Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview The following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented. This overview and the remainder of this management's discussion and analysis supplements, and should be read in conjunction with, the Consolidated Financial Statements of Invesco Ltd. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the company or Invesco ) and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Financial markets began 2011 on an upswing due to optimism that the global economy was finally recovering from the 2008 financial crisis. However, the optimism was replaced by volatility as a number of shocks hit the global economy, negatively impacting equity markets around the world. First, Japan suffered a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami and nuclear emergency. While markets outside of Japan recovered from the initial shock, the Nikkei 225 index declined over 17% for the year. Additionally, Continental Europe's sovereign debt issues worsened during 2011, resulting in deepening concern about the financial condition of Greece and other countries. Efforts by European authorities to address the crisis repeatedly fell short of market expectations and, as a result, equity markets in Europe suffered declines in 2011, with the FTSE 100 index down almost 6%. In the U.S., concern of default on the country's debt payments intensified in early August 2011, followed immediately thereafter by the first-ever downgrade of the U.S.'s credit rating by S&P to AA+ from AAA. U.S. equity markets, as illustrated by the movement in the S&P 500, were able to recover from double digit declines in the third quarter of 2011 to finish at levels consistent with the beginning of 2011. Although global equity markets have staged a strong recovery after December 2008, many still remain below their 2007 highs. The table below summarizes the year ended December 31 returns based on price appreciation of several major market indices for 2011 , 2010 , and 2009 : Index Year ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 S&P 500 0.0% 12.8% 23.5% FTSE 100 (5.6)% 9.0% 22.1% Nikkei 225 (17.3)% (3.0%) 19.0% MSCI Emerging Markets (20.4)% 16.4% 74.5% Despite the downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, returns on U.S. Treasury securities increased significantly in 2011 as investors' concern about the solvency of European sovereigns and continued uncertainty on the economic recovery resulted in a flight to perceived safety. The increased demand for Treasury securities caused 10-year Treasury prices to soar, pushing yields to record lows during the year, briefly touching 1.70% during the third quarter. For the year of 2011, the 10-year Treasury returned 17.2%. Invesco made progress in a number of areas that further enhanced our competitive position as the markets continued their 24 Table of Contents measured return to pre-financial crisis levels. Throughout 2011, the company's financial performance strengthened. In addition, Invesco continued to deliver strong, long-term investment performance, maintained its focus on its clients, and enhanced its profile in the industry. As a global investment management firm dedicated to delivering investment excellence to our clients, Invesco is committed to further strengthening and enhancing our best-in-class risk management approach. A key factor in Invesco's ability to weather the economic storms of the past three years was our integrated approach to risk management. Invesco's enterprise risk management (ERM) approach is embedded in its management processes across the organization. Broadly, our approach includes two governance structures - one for investments and another for business risk. Investment risk oversight is supported by the Global Performance Measurement and Risk group and the investment teams. Business risk oversight is supported by the Corporate Risk Management Committee and related committees. Our Global Performance Measurement and Risk group provides senior management and the Board with insight into core investment risks, while our Corporate Risk Management Committee facilitates a focus on strategic, operational and other key business risks. Further, business component, functional, and geographic risk management committees maintain an ongoing risk assessment process that provides a bottom-up perspective on the specific risk areas existing in various domains of our business. A key value of a robust enterprise risk management process is facilitating the flow of information and insight across the organization and applying that information to more effectively managing risk. Through this regular and consistent risk communication, the Board has reasonable assurance that all material risks of the company are being addressed and that the company is propagating a risk-aware culture in which effective risk management is sewn into the fabric of the business. As a result of our efforts in this area, Invesco is one of only four publicly rated asset managers designated with a strong enterprise risk management rating by S&P. In addition, we benefited from our long-term efforts to ensure a diversified base of assets under management. One of Invesco's core strengths, and a key differentiator for the company within the industry, is our broad diversification across client domiciles, asset classes and distribution channels. Our geographical diversification recognizes growth opportunities in different parts of the world. This broad diversification enables Invesco to withstand different market cycles and take advantage of growth opportunities in various markets and channels. The addition of Morgan Stanley's retail asset management business, including Van Kampen Investments (the "acquired business" or "acquisition") in 2010 and our anticipated successful integration of the business during 2011 enabled Invesco to further strengthen our competitive position in the U.S. The depth and breadth of our investment capabilities, our strong investment performance and a focused client engagement effort resulted in solid momentum in our U.S. retail business throughout 2011. European Infrastructure As part of the transformational initiative announced earlier this year, the company is in the process of outsourcing its transfer agency function in Europe, which is presently operated internally. This outsourcing activity is expected to be completed by December 2012. We believe that taking steps today to outsource our European transfer agency will allow the firm to better respond in the future to the pending but still uncertain regulatory environment. It is too early to accurately forecast the implications of all the proposed regulations (e.g., MIFID II in Europe and the Retail Distribution Review in the U.K.), but it is clear that these have the potential to significantly change the relationships between distributors, clients and investment managers. Under any likely scenario, we believe outsourcing our European transfer agency will reduce both the cost and risk of operations for us and will allow us to react more swiftly to changes in the marketplace, and therefore further solidify and strengthen our competitive position. During the year ended December 31, 2011 , the company incurred $18.8 million of costs directly related to the implementation of this initiative and will incur total implementation costs of up to $40 million by the projected completion date of December 2012. The $40 million estimate is based on the expected cost to outsource our European transfer agency and on our plans to make certain structural changes to our product and distribution platforms. As regulations become more clear in the future, we will be able to provide updated estimates of the implementation costs and benefits of this initiative, to the extent that clarity of regulations affects the scope of the initiative. The implementation costs associated with the European transformation will include primarily systems and data conversion, surplus leased space, staff severance related to a reduction in headcount of approximately 330 employees, fund redomicile, legal, and consulting costs. These costs will be included within the respective expense line items in the U.S. GAAP Condensed Consolidated Income Statement and will be excluded in arriving at non-GAAP earnings information. This initiative is expected to generate material ongoing cost savings (approximately $15 million per year) that will more than fully offset the implementation expense within a three year time frame after completion. 25 Table of Contents Presentation of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The company provides investment management services to, and has transactions with, various private equity, real estate, fund-of-funds, collateralized loan obligation products (CLOs), and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. The company serves as the investment manager, making day-to-day investment decisions concerning the assets of the products. Certain of these entities are consolidated under variable interest or voting interest entity consolidation guidance. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1, Accounting Policies and Note 20, Consolidated Investment Products, for additional details. Effective January 1, 2010, the company adopted guidance now encompassed in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810, Consolidation. The adoption of this new guidance had a significant impact on the presentation of the company's financial statements in 2011 and 2010, as its provisions required the company to consolidate certain CLOs that were not previously consolidated. In accordance with the standard, prior periods have not been restated to reflect the consolidation of these CLOs. The majority of the company's consolidated investment products balances were CLO-related as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. The collateral assets of the CLOs are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs. The company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the CLOs, beyond the company's minimal direct investments in, and management fees generated from, the CLOs. If the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. Additionally, the investors in the CLOs have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the CLOs. The company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability. The impact of consolidation of investment products is so significant to the presentation of company's financial statements (but not to the underlying financial condition or results of operations of the company) that, combined with the presentation of newly-incurred transaction and integration costs and additional intangible asset amortization resulting from the acquired business, the company expanded its use of non-GAAP measures beginning with the presentation of the company's results for the three months ended March 31, 2010. The discussion that follows therefore combines results presented under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with the company's non-GAAP presentation. There are four distinct sections within this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations after the Assets Under Management discussion: Results of Operations (for the year ended December 31, 2011 , compared with the year ended December 31, 2010 , and for the year ended December 31, 2010 , compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 ); Schedule of Non-GAAP Information; Balance Sheet Discussion; and Liquidity and Capital Resources. The Results of Operations, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow (within the Liquidity and Capital Resources section) discussions begin with tables illustrating the impact of the consolidation of investment products. The narrative that follows each of these sections separately provides discussion of the underlying financial statement activity for the company, before consolidation of investment products, as well as of the financial statement activity of consolidated investment products. Additionally, wherever a non-GAAP measure is referenced, a disclosure will follow in the narrative or in the note referring the reader to the Schedule of Non-GAAP Information, where additional details regarding the use of the non-GAAP measure by the company are disclosed, along with reconciliations of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures to the non-GAAP measures. To further enhance the readability of the Results of Operations section, separate tables for each of the revenue, expense, and non-operating income/expense sections of the income statement introduce the narrative that follows, providing a section-by-section review of the company's income statements for the periods presented. 26 Table of Contents Reclassifications In 2011, the company changed its presentation of marketing support expenses from marketing expenses to third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Such reclassifications had no impact on total operating expenses, net income, or equity attributable to common shareholders. The impact to 2010, 2009, 2008 and 2007 is illustrated below: For the year ended December 31, $ in millions 2010 2009 2008 2007 Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, as previously reported 972.7 693.4 875.5 1,051.1 Reclassification 81.1 43.6 52.3 58.6 Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, as reclassified 1,053.8 737.0 927.8 1,109.7 Marketing expenses, as previously reported 159.6 108.9 148.2 157.6 Reclassification (81.1 ) (43.6 ) (52.3 ) (58.6 ) Marketing expenses, as reclassified 78.5 65.3 95.9 99.0 Net revenues, as previously reported 2,602.2 1,984.6 2,490.2 2,881.9 Reclassification (81.1 ) (43.6 ) (52.3 ) (58.6 ) Net revenues, as reclassified $ 2,521.1 $ 1,941.0 $ 2,437.9 $ 2,823.3 Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, all periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation. In addition, all measures calculated from net revenues and operating expenses, such as net revenue yield and adjusted operating margin, have been recalculated based on the new presentation. 27 Table of Contents Summary Operating Information Summary operating information for 2011 , 2010 and 2009 is presented in the table below. $ in millions, other than per share amounts, operating margins and AUM Year ended December 31, U.S. GAAP Financial Measures Summary 2011 2010 2009 Operating revenues $4,092.2 $3,487.7 $2,627.3 Operating income $898.1 $589.9 $484.3 Operating margin 21.9 % 16.9 % 18.4 % Net income attributable to common shareholders $729.7 $465.7 $322.5 Diluted EPS $1.57 $1.01 $0.76 Non-GAAP Financial Measures Summary Net revenues (1) $2,898.4 $2,521.1 $1,941.0 Adjusted operating income (2) $1,068.9 $897.7 $565.6 Adjusted operating margin (2) 36.9 % 35.6 % 29.1 % Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders (3) $781.6 $639.7 $378.1 Adjusted diluted EPS (3) $1.68 $1.38 $0.89 Assets Under Management Ending AUM (billions) $625.3 $616.5 $459.5 Average AUM (billions) $634.3 $532.3 $415.8 _________ (1) Net revenues are operating revenues less third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, plus our proportional share of the net revenues of our joint venture investments, plus management and performance fees earned from, less other revenue recorded by, consolidated investment products. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for the reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues. (2) Adjusted operating margin is adjusted operating income divided by net revenues. Adjusted operating income includes operating income plus our proportional share of the operating income of our joint venture investments, transaction and integration charges, amortization of acquisition-related prepaid compensation and other intangibles, compensation expense related to market valuation changes in deferred compensation plans, the operating income impact of the consolidation of investment products, European infrastructure expenses and other reconciling items. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for the reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income. (3) Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders is net income attributable to common shareholders adjusted to add back transaction and integration charges, amortization of acquisition-related prepaid compensation and other intangibles, and the tax cash flow benefits resulting from tax amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders excludes the net income of consolidated investment products, and the net income impact of deferred compensation plans, European infrastructure expenses and other reconciling items. By calculation, adjusted diluted EPS is adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for the reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income. A significant portion of our business and AUM is based outside of the U.S. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, primarily the Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen will impact our reported revenues and expenses from period to period. Additionally, our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our AUM. Therefore, movements in global capital market levels, net new business inflows (or outflows) and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period. The returns from most global capital markets decreased in the year ended December 31, 2011 . These market value decreases were offset by net new business inflows which resulted in a net increase in AUM of $8.8 billion during the year. AUM at January 31, 2012 were $648.3 billion . 28 Table of Contents Investment Capabilities Performance Overview Invesco's first strategic priority is to achieve strong investment performance over the long-term for our clients. Long-term performance in our equities capabilities, as measured by the percentage of AUM ahead of benchmark and ahead of peer median, is generally strong with some pockets of outstanding performance. Within our equity asset class, Asian, European, Global Ex U.S. and Emerging Markets have had strong relative performance versus competitors and versus benchmark over three- and five-year periods. Our U.S. Value funds have exceptional long-term performance with over 96% of assets ahead of benchmarks and peer group medians on a three- and five-year basis. U.K. and European equity funds reflect strong performance with 96% and 93%, respectively, of assets beating benchmarks and peers on a five-year basis. Within our fixed income asset class, Stable Value products have achieved excellent long-term performance with 100% of AUM ahead of benchmarks and peers on a one-, three-, and five-year basis.

Peer group rankings are sourced from a widely-used third party ranking agency in each fund's market (Lipper, Morningstar, Russell, Mercer, eVestment Alliance, SITCA) and asset-weighted in USD. Rankings are as of prior quarter-end for most institutional products and prior month-end for Australian retail funds due to their late release by third parties. Rankings for the most representative fund in each GIPS composite are applied to all products within each GIPS composite. Excludes passive products, closed-end funds, private equity limited partnerships, non-discretionary direct real estate, unit investment trusts and CDOs. Certain other funds and products were excluded from the analysis because of limited benchmark or peer group data. Had these been available, results may have been different. These results are preliminary and subject to revision. Performance assumes the reinvestment of dividends. Past performance is not indicative of future results and may not reflect an investor's experience. 29 Table of Contents Assets Under Management The company's rolling presentation of AUM from period to period (on the following pages) illustrates long-term inflows and outflows separately from the net flows into institutional money market funds. Long-term inflows and the underlying reasons for the movements in this line item include investments from new clients, existing clients adding new accounts/funds or contributions/subscriptions into existing accounts/funds, and new funding commitments into private equity funds. We present net flows into institutional money market funds separately because shareholders of those funds typically use them as short-term funding vehicles and because their flows are particularly sensitive to short-term interest rate movements. There are numerous drivers of AUM inflows and outflows, including individual investor decisions to change their investment preferences, fiduciaries making broad asset allocation decisions on behalf of advised clients and reallocation of investments within portfolios. We are not a party to these asset allocation decisions, as the company does not generally have access to the underlying investor's decision-making process, including their risk appetite or liquidity needs. Therefore, the company is not in a position to provide meaningful information regarding the drivers of inflows and outflows. AUM at December 31, 2011 were $625.3 billion ( December 31, 2010 : $616.5 billion ; December 31, 2009 : $459.5 billion ). During the year ended December 31, 2011 , net long-term inflows increased AUM by $19.2 billion , while negative market movements decreased AUM by $15.3 billion . We experienced net inflows in institutional money market funds of $5.3 billion and decreases in AUM of $0.4 billion due to changes in foreign exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2011 . During the year ended December 31, 2010 , net inflows increased AUM by $5.5 billion and positive market movements increased AUM by $43.9 billion. We experienced net outflows in institutional money market funds of $15.5 billion and increases in AUM of $1.6 billion due to changes in foreign exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2010 . Morgan Stanley's retail asset management business, including Van Kampen Investments (the acquired business or the acquisition ) added $114.6 billion in AUM at June 1, 2010. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2010 , other acquisitions added $6.9 billion of AUM, net of dispositions. During the year ended December 31, 2009 , net inflows increased AUM by $16.6 billion and positive market movements increased AUM by $54.7 billion. We experienced net outflows in institutional money market funds of $0.1 billion and increases in AUM of $11.2 billion due to changes in foreign exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2009 . Average AUM during the year ended December 31, 2011 were $634.3 billion , compared to $532.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 and $415.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 . Net inflows during the year ended December 31, 2011 included net long-term inflows of ETF, UIT and passive AUM of $17.5 billion and other net long-term inflows of $1.7 billion . Net flows were driven by net inflows into both our retail and institutional distribution channels of $9.1 billion and $8.9 billion , respectively, primarily in the fixed income asset class, while our equity asset class experienced net outflows of $7.9 billion. Market gains and losses/reinvestment of AUM includes the net change in AUM resulting from changes in market values of the underlying investments from period to period and reinvestment of client dividends. Of the total decrease in AUM resulting from market losses during the year ended December 31, 2011 , $14.8 billion of this decrease was due to the change in value of our equity asset class across all of our business components. Our balanced and alternatives asset classes were also negatively impacted by the change in market valuations during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2011 , our equity AUM decreased in line with equity markets globally. As discussed in the Executive Overview section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis, the equity markets were extremely volatile during the year ended December 31, 2011 . Of the $43.9 billion increase in AUM resulting from market gains during the year ended December 31, 2010, $33.4 billion was due to the change in value of our equity asset class, in line with increases in the S&P 500 and the FTSE 100 indices of 12.8% and 9.0%, respectively, during that period. Of the $54.7 billion increase in AUM resulting from market increases during the year ended December 31, 2009 , $42.1 billion of this increase was due to the change in value of our equity asset class, in line with increases in the S&P 500 and the FTSE 100 indices of 23.5% and 22.1%, respectively, during that period. Foreign exchange rate movements in our AUM result from the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates from period to period as non-U.S. Dollar denominated AUM is translated into U.S. Dollars, the reporting currency of the company. The impact of the change in foreign exchange rates in the year ended December 31, 2011 was driven primarily by the weakening of the Pound Sterling relative to the U.S. Dollar, which was reflected in the translation of our Pound Sterling-based AUM into U.S. Dollars, the weakening of the Canadian Dollar relative to the U.S. Dollar, which was reflected in the translation of our Canadian Dollar-based AUM into U.S. Dollars, the weakening of the Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar, which was reflected in the translation of our Euro-based AUM into U.S. Dollars, partly offset by the strengthening of the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. Dollar, which was reflected in the translation of our Yen-based AUM into U.S. Dollars. The impact of the change in foreign exchange rates in the year ended December 31, 2010 was driven primarily by the strengthening of the Japanese Yen and Canadian Dollar relative to the U.S. Dollar, partially offset by the weakening of the Pound Sterling and Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar. The impact of the change in foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2009 was driven by the strengthening of the Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar and Euro relative 30 Table of Contents to the U.S. Dollar. The table below illustrates the spot foreign exchange rates for translation into the U.S. Dollar, the reporting currency of the company, at December 31, 2011 , 2010 , and 2009 : December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Pound Sterling ($ per ) 1.555 1.565 1.614 Canadian Dollar (CAD per $) 1.018 0.994 1.048 Japan ( per $) 76.950 81.080 93.035 Euro ($ per Euro) 1.299 1.342 1.434 Net revenue yield decreased 1.7 basis points to 45.7 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2011 from the year ended December 31, 2010 level of 47.4 basis points. Market driven changes in our asset mix significantly impact our net revenue yield. Our equity AUM generally earn a higher net revenue rate than money market AUM. At December 31, 2011 , equity AUM were $271.0 billion , representing 43% of our total AUM at that date; whereas at December 31, 2010 , equity AUM were $294.0 billion, representing 48% of our total AUM at that date. In addition, ETF, UIT and Passive AUM generally earn a lower effective fee rate than active asset classes. At December 31, 2011 , ETF, UIT and Passive AUM were $96.3 billion , representing 15.4% of total AUM at that date; whereas at December 31, 2010 , ETF, UIT and Passive AUM were $80.8 billion, representing 13.1% of our total AUM at that date. Gross revenue yield on AUM decreased 1.1 basis points to 64.9 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2011 from the year ended December 31, 2010 level of 66.0 basis points. Management does not consider gross revenue yield, the most comparable U.S. GAAP-based measure to net revenue yield, to be a meaningful effective fee rate measure. The numerator of the gross revenue yield measure, operating revenues, excludes the management fees earned from consolidated investment products; however, the denominator of the measure includes the AUM of these investment products. Therefore, the gross revenue yield measure is not considered representative of the company's true effective fee rate from AUM. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for a reconciliation of operating revenues (gross revenues) to net revenues. 31 Table of Contents Changes in AUM were as follows: $ in billions Total AUM Active ETF, UIT & Passive Total AUM Active ETF, UIT & Passive Total AUM Active ETF, UIT & Passive 2011 2011 2011 2010 2010 2010 2009 2009 2009 January 1 616.5 535.7 80.8 459.5 406.5 53.0 377.1 346.6 30.5 Long-term inflows 177.6 106.3 71.3 154.7 84.6 70.1 106.1 65.7 40.4 Long-term outflows (158.4 ) (104.6 ) (53.8 ) (149.2 ) (83.4 ) (65.8 ) (89.5 ) (59.9 ) (29.6 ) Long-term net flows 19.2 1.7 17.5 5.5 1.2 4.3 16.6 5.8 10.8 Net flows in institutional money market funds 5.3 5.3 (15.5 ) (15.5 ) (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Market gains and losses/reinvestment (15.3 ) (13.2 ) (2.1 ) 43.9 36.3 7.6 54.7 43.3 11.4 Acquisitions/dispositions, net 121.5 107.1 14.4 Foreign currency translation (0.4 ) (0.5 ) 0.1 1.6 0.1 1.5 11.2 10.9 0.3 December 31 625.3 529.0 96.3 616.5 535.7 80.8 459.5 406.5 53.0 Average long-term AUM 566.0 474.7 91.3 463.5 393.8 69.7 328.8 291.2 37.6 Average institutional money market AUM 68.3 68.3 68.8 68.8 87.0 87.0 Average AUM 634.3 543.0 91.3 532.3 462.6 69.7 415.8 378.2 37.6 Gross revenue yield on AUM (1) 64.9bps 74.0bps 10.8bps 66.0bps 74.3bps 10.8bps 63.8bps 68.8bps 13.4bps Gross revenue yield on AUM before performance fees (1) 64.3bps 73.3bps 10.8bps 65.5bps 73.8bps 10.8bps 63.0bps 68.0bps 13.4bps Net revenue yield on AUM (2) 45.7bps 51.6bps 10.8bps 47.4bps 52.9bps 10.8bps 46.7bps 50.0bps 13.4bps Net revenue yield on AUM before performance fees (2) 45.1bps 50.8bps 10.8bps 46.9bps 52.3bps 10.8bps 46.0bps 49.2bps 13.4bps ____________ (1) Gross revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized total operating revenues divided by average AUM, excluding joint venture (JV) AUM. Our share of the average AUM in 2011 for our JVs in China was $3.3 billion ( 2010 : $3.6 billion , 2009 : $3.7 billion ). It is appropriate to exclude the average AUM of our JVs for purposes of computing gross revenue yield on AUM, because the revenues resulting from these AUM are not presented in our operating revenues. Under U.S. GAAP, our share of the pre-tax earnings of the JVs is recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on our Consolidated Statements of Income. (2) Net revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized net revenues divided by average AUM.

Retail AUM arose from client investments into funds available to the public with shares or units. Institutional AUM originated from individual corporate clients, endowments, foundations, government authorities, universities, or charities. Private Wealth Management AUM arose from high net worth client investments. (2) The beginning balances were adjusted to reflect certain asset reclassifications. (3) Asset classes are descriptive groupings of AUM by common type of underlying investments. (4) See Part I, Item 1, Business - Objectives by Asset Class for a description of the investment objectives included within the Alternatives asset class. (5) Ending Money Market AUM includes $69.4 billion in institutional money market AUM and $4.6 billion in retail money market AUM. (6) Client domicile disclosure groups AUM by the domicile of the underlying clients. (7) Net flows in Asia in 2010 were driven by an inflow of $15.8 billion in the three months ended June 30, 2010 and an outflow of $18.6 billion in the three months ended December 31, 2010 related to a passive mandate in Japan which was a post-close direct consequence of the acquired business. 38 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2011 , compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2010 Adoption of Guidance now encompassed in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 810, Consolidation The company provides investment management services to, and has transactions with, various private equity, real estate, fund-of-funds, collateralized loan obligation products (CLOs), and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. The company serves as the investment manager, making day-to-day investment decisions concerning the assets of the products. Certain of these entities are consolidated under variable interest or voting interest entity consolidation guidance. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1, Accounting Policies and Note 20, Consolidated Investment Products, for additional details. The guidance now encompassed in ASC Topic 810, which was effective January 1, 2010, had a significant impact on the presentation of the company's financial statements in 2011 and 2010, as its provisions required the company to consolidate certain CLOs that were not previously consolidated. In accordance with the standard, prior periods have not been restated to reflect the consolidation of these CLOs. The majority of the company's consolidated investment products balances were CLO-related as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. The collateral assets of the CLOs are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs. The company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the CLOs, beyond the company's minimal direct investments in, and management fees generated from, the CLOs. If the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. Additionally, the investors in the CLOs have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the CLOs. The company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability. The discussion that follows will separate consolidated investment product results of operations from the company's investment management operations through the use of non-GAAP financial measures. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional details and reconciliations of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures to the non-GAAP measures.

Upon consolidation of the CLOs, the company's and the CLOs' accounting policies are effectively aligned, resulting in the reclassification of the company's gain for the year ended December 31, 2011 of $20.3 million (representing the increase in the market value of the company's holding in the consolidated CLOs) from other comprehensive income into other gains/losses (year ended December 31, 2010 : $6.4 million ). The company's gain on its investment in the CLOs (before consolidation) eliminates with the company's share of the offsetting loss on the CLOs' debt. The net income arising from consolidation of CLOs is therefore completely attributed to other investors in these CLOs, as the company's share has been eliminated through consolidation. The Before Consolidation column does not include any other adjustments related to non-GAAP financial measure presentation. (2) Adjustments include the elimination of intercompany transactions between the company and its consolidated investment products, primarily the elimination of management fees expensed by the funds and recorded as operating revenues (before consolidation) by the company. Operating Revenues and Net Revenues The main categories of revenues, and the dollar and percentage change between the periods, are as follows: $ in millions 2011 2010 $ Change % Change Investment management fees 3,138.5 2,720.9 417.6 15.3 % Service and distribution fees 780.3 645.5 134.8 20.9 % Performance fees 37.9 26.1 11.8 45.2 % Other 135.5 95.2 40.3 42.3 % Total operating revenues 4,092.2 3,487.7 604.5 17.3 % Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses (1,282.5 ) (1,053.8 ) (228.7 ) 21.7 % Proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments 41.4 42.2 (0.8 ) (1.9 )% Management fees earned from consolidated investment products 46.8 45.3 1.5 3.3 % Performance fees earned from consolidated investment products 0.5 0.5 N/A Other revenues recorded by consolidated investment products (0.3 ) 0.3 (100.0 )% Net revenues 2,898.4 2,521.1 377.3 15.0 % Operating revenues increased by 17.3% in the year ended December 31, 2011 to $4,092.2 million (year ended December 31, 2010 : $3,487.7 million ). Net revenues increased by 15.0% in in the year ended December 31, 2011 to $2,898.4 million (year ended December 31, 2010 : $2,521.1 million ). Net revenues are operating revenues less third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, plus our proportional share of net revenues from joint venture arrangements, plus management and performance fees 40 Table of Contents earned from, less other revenues recorded by, consolidated investment products. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. A significant portion of our business and managed AUM are based outside of the U.S. The income statements of foreign currency subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars, the reporting currency of the company, using average foreign exchange rates. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements accounted for $74.9 million ( 12.4% ) of the increase in operating revenues, and was 1.8% of total operating revenues, during the year ended December 31, 2011 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 . Additionally, our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our AUM as more fully discussed below. Movements in global capital market levels, net new business inflows (or outflows) and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period. The company acquired Morgan Stanley's retail asset management business, including Van Kampen Investments (the acquired business or the acquisition ) on June 1, 2010. The operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 include the operating results of the acquired business from the purchase date of June 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010 , while the operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 include the results of the acquisition for the entire year. The integration of the acquired business was largely completed at the end of 2010; as such, accurate segregated revenue and expense information for the acquired business is not available, resulting in the inability of the company to quantify the impact of the acquisition on operating revenues and expenses in the detailed variance discussion that follows. As part of the acquisition-related U.S. mutual fund product alignment, 70 of the 71 planned U.S. funds mergers are complete as of December 31, 2011 . As a consequence of the alignment, certain 1 year and 2 year fee waivers were agreed between the company and the fund boards which will reduce the company annual management fees by approximately $30 million commencing June 1, 2011. Investment Management Fees Investment management fees are derived from providing professional services to manage client accounts and include fees earned from retail mutual funds, unit trusts, investment companies with variable capital (ICVCs), exchange-traded funds, investment trusts and institutional and private wealth management advisory contracts. Investment management fees for products offered in the retail distribution channel are generally calculated as a percentage of the daily average asset balances and therefore vary as the levels of AUM change resulting from inflows, outflows and market movements. Investment management fees for products offered in the institutional and private wealth management distribution channels are calculated in accordance with the underlying investment management contracts and also vary over contractually determined periods in relation to the level of client assets managed. Investment management fees increased by $417.6 million ( 15.3% ) in the year ended December 31, 2011 , to $3,138.5 million (year ended December 31, 2010 : $2,720.9 million ). The increase compares to a 19.2% increase in average AUM and a 22.1% increase in average long-term AUM. As discussed above in the Assets Under Management section, the mix of our AUM asset classes changed partly due to the AUM acquired through acquisitions, and partly due to market value changes and investor flows such that the revenue yield on our average AUM was lower in 2011 when compared to 2010. The percentage increase in investment management fees is therefore lower than the percentage increase in average AUM and average long-term AUM. The lower yield also reflects the acquisition-related U.S. mutual fund fee waivers that commenced in June 2011. Foreign exchange rate movements accounted for $67.2 million ( 16.1% ) of the increase in investment management fees during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 . Service and Distribution Fees Service fees are generated through fees charged to cover several types of expenses, including fund accounting fees and other maintenance costs for mutual funds, unit trusts and ICVCs, and administrative fees earned from closed-ended funds. Service fees also include transfer agent fees, which are fees charged to cover the expense of processing client share purchases and redemptions, call center support and client reporting. U.S. distribution fees include 12b-1 fees earned from certain mutual funds to cover allowable sales and marketing expenses for those funds and also include asset-based sales charges paid by certain mutual funds for a period of time after the sale of those funds. Distribution fees typically vary in relation to the amount of client assets managed. Generally, retail products offered outside of the U.S. do not generate a separate distribution fee; the quoted management fee rate is inclusive of these services. In the year ended December 31, 2011 , service and distribution fees increased by $134.8 million ( 20.9% ) to $780.3 million (year ended December 31, 2010 : $645.5 million ) primarily due to the acquisition and due to the increase in average AUM during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 . 41 Table of Contents Performance Fees Performance fee revenues are generated on certain management contracts when performance hurdles are achieved. Such fee revenues are recorded in operating revenues as of the performance measurement date, when the contractual performance criteria have been met and when the outcome of the transaction can be measured reliably in accordance with Method 1 of ASC Topic 605-20-S99, Revenue Recognition - Services - SEC Materials. Cash receipt of earned performance fees occurs after the measurement date. The performance measurement date is defined in each contract in which incentive and performance fee revenue agreements are in effect. We have performance fee arrangements that include monthly, quarterly and annual measurement dates. Given the uniqueness of each transaction, performance fee contracts are evaluated on an individual basis to determine if revenues can and should be recognized. Performance fees are not recorded if there are any future performance contingencies. If performance arrangements require repayment of the performance fee for failure to perform during the contractual period, then performance fee revenues are recognized no earlier than the expiration date of these terms. Performance fees will fluctuate from period to period and may not correlate with general market changes, since most of the fees are driven by relative performance to the respective benchmark rather than by absolute performance. Of our $625.3 billion in AUM at December 31, 2011 , approximately $48.0 billion or 7.7% , could potentially earn performance fees. In the year ended December 31, 2011 , performance fees increased by $11.8 million ( 45.2% ) to $37.9 million (year ended December 31, 2010: $26.1 million ). The performance fees generated in 2011 arose primarily due to products managed by the European Real Estate group ($11.9 million), Atlantic Trust ($11.9 million), Invesco Perpetual ($5.3 million) and the U.S. private equity business ($4.5 million). The performance fees generated in 2010 arose primarily due to products managed by the European Real Estate group ($4.3 million), Invesco Perpetual ($3.4 million), and Atlantic Trust ($11.8 million). Other Revenues Other revenues include fees derived from our UIT operations, transaction commissions earned upon the sale of new investments into certain of our funds, and fees earned upon the completion of transactions in our direct real estate and private equity asset groups. Real estate transaction fees are derived from commissions earned through the buying and selling of properties. Private equity transaction fees include commissions associated with the restructuring of, and fees from providing advice to, portfolio companies held by the funds. These transaction fees are recorded in our financial statements on the date when the transactions are legally closed. Other revenues also include the revenues of consolidated investment products. Following the acquisition, the company is the sponsor of UITs. In its capacity as sponsor of UITs, the company earns other revenues related to transactional sales charges resulting from the sale of UIT products and from the difference between the purchase or bid and offer price of securities temporarily held to form new UIT products. These revenues are recorded as other revenues net of concessions to dealers who distribute UITs to investors. In the year ended December 31, 2011 , other revenues increased by $40.3 million ( 42.3% ) to $135.5 million (year ended December 31, 2010 : $95.2 million ). Other revenues included an increase of $15.3 million in UIT revenues reflecting a full year of the acquisition, higher real estate acquisition and disposition fees of $11.5 million , due to increased real estate fund property activity, an $11.3 million increase in transaction commissions generated by our private equity group, and an increase in mutual funds front end fees of $1.3 million , offset by a $0.7 million decline in other revenues during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 . The impact of foreign exchange rate movements accounted for $1.4 million ( 3.5% ) of the increase in other revenues during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 . Third-Party Distribution, Service and Advisory Expenses Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses include periodic renewal commissions paid to brokers and independent financial advisors for their continuing oversight of their clients' assets, over the time they are invested, and are payments for the servicing of client accounts. Renewal commissions are calculated based upon a percentage of the AUM value. Third-party distribution expenses also include the amortization of upfront commissions paid to broker-dealers for sales of fund shares with a contingent deferred sales charge (a charge levied to the investor for client redemption of AUM within a certain contracted period of time). The distribution commissions are amortized over the redemption period. Also included in third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses are sub-transfer agency fees that are paid to third parties for processing client share purchases and redemptions, call center support and client reporting. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses may increase or decrease at a rate different from the rate of change in service and distribution fee revenues due to the inclusion of distribution, service and advisory expenses for the U.K. and Canada, where the related revenues are recorded as investment management fee revenues, as noted above. 42 Table of Contents Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses increased by $228.7 million ( 21.7% ) in the year ended December 31, 2011 to $1,282.5 million (year ended December 31, 2010 : $1,053.8 million ), which is consistent with the increase in investment management and service and distribution fee revenues, reflecting the impact of the acquired business. Foreign exchange rate movements accounted for $24.7 million ( 10.8% ) of the increase in third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 . Proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments Management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture arrangements should be added to operating revenues to arrive at net revenues, as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that our joint venture arrangements are making. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. The company's most significant joint venture arrangement is our 49% investment in Invesco Great Wall Fund Management Company Limited (the Invesco Great Wall joint venture). The 1.9% decrease in our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments to $41.4 million in 2011 (year ended December 31, 2010 : $42.2 million ), is driven by the decline in average AUM of the Invesco Great Wall joint venture. Our share of the Invesco Great Wall joint venture's average AUM for the year ended December 31, 2011 , was $3.3 billion , a 8.3% decline in average AUM from $3.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 . Management and performance fees earned from consolidated investment products Management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a reader's analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. Accordingly, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues for the impact of consolidated investment products in calculating net revenues. As management and performance fees earned by Invesco from the consolidated products are eliminated upon consolidation of the investment products, management believes that it is appropriate to add these operating revenues back in the calculation of net revenues. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. Management and performance fees earned from consolidated investment products increased by $2.0 million to $47.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 (year ended December 31, 2010 : $45.3 million ). The increase reflects the management fees from real estate products consolidated as of December 31, 2010 in connection with the acquisition of AIG Asia Real Estate. 43 Table of Contents Operating Expenses The main categories of operating expenses are as follows: $ in millions 2011 2010 $ Change % Change Employee compensation 1,246.2 1,114.9 131.3 11.8 % Third-party distribution, service and advisory 1,282.5 1,053.8 228.7 21.7 % Marketing 86.0 78.5 7.5 9.6 % Property, office and technology 254.6 238.4 16.2 6.8 % General and administrative 295.4 262.2 33.2 12.7 % Transaction and integration 29.4 150.0 (120.6 ) (80.4 )% Total operating expenses 3,194.1 2,897.8 296.3 10.2 % The table below sets forth these expense categories as a percentage of total operating expenses and operating revenues, which we believe provides useful information as to the relative significance of each type of expense. $ in millions 2011 % of Total Operating Expenses % of Operating Revenues 2010 % of Total Operating Expenses % of Operating Revenues Employee compensation 1,246.2 39.0 % 30.5 % 1,114.9 38.5 % 32.0 % Third-party distribution, service and advisory 1,282.5 40.2 % 31.3 % 1,053.8 36.4 % 30.2 % Marketing 86.0 2.7 % 2.1 % 78.5 2.7 % 2.3 % Property, office and technology 254.6 8.0 % 6.2 % 238.4 8.2 % 6.8 % General and administrative 295.4 9.2 % 7.2 % 262.2 9.0 % 7.5 % Transaction and integration 29.4 0.9 % 0.7 % 150.0 5.2 % 4.3 % Total operating expenses 3,194.1 100.0 % 78.0 % 2,897.8 100.0 % 83.1 % During the year ended December 31, 2011 , operating expenses increased by $296.3 million ( 10.2% ) to $3,194.1 million (year ended December 31, 2010 : $2,897.8 million ). As discussed above, the acquisition occurred on June 1, 2010, which increased expenses across all categories, except transaction and integration expenses, which have decreased during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 . In addition to the acquired business, foreign exchange differences have an impact on our reported expense variances. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements accounted for $61.8 million ( 20.9% ) of the increase in operating expenses, and was 1.9% of total operating expenses, during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 . Employee Compensation Employee compensation includes salary, cash bonuses and share-based payment plans designed to attract and retain the highest caliber employees. Employee staff benefit plan costs and payroll taxes are also included in employee compensation. Employee compensation increased $131.3 million ( 11.8% ) to $1,246.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 (year ended December 31, 2010 : $1,114.9 million ). The compensation increase includes the incremental impact of the acquisition. Base salaries and variable compensation increased $94.2 million . Staff related costs, principally payroll taxes and termination costs, increased $15.0 million . Staff benefits expense decreased by $2.5 million due to a $5.0 million reduction in the prepaid compensation amortization expenses in the year ended December 31, 2011 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 related to the 2006 acquisition of W.L. Ross & Co. This prepaid compensation was fully amortized as of September 30, 2011. Also included in compensation expenses during the year ended December 31, 2011 are share-based costs which decreased $1.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 . The impact of foreign exchange rate movements accounted for $26.5 million ( 20.2% ) of the increase in employee compensation expenses the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 . Headcount at December 31, 2011 was 6,162 (year ended December 31, 2010 : 5,617). The 2011 increase is primarily driven by the insourcing of our Hyderabad, India, facility, which commenced in late 2010 with the hiring of 83 employees and continued into early 2011 with the hiring of an additional 474 individuals by late February 2011. Third-Party Distribution, Service and Advisory Expenses 44 Table of Contents Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses are discussed above in the operating and net revenues section. Marketing Marketing expenses include the cost of direct advertising of our products through trade publications, television and other media, and public relations costs, such as the marketing of the company's products through conferences or other sponsorships, and the cost of marketing-related employee travel. Marketing expenses increased by $7.5 million ( 9.6% ) in the year ended December 31, 2011 to $86.0 million (year ended December 31, 2010 : $78.5 million ). The increase in marketing includes the impact of the acquisition. Additionally, the increase during the year ended December 31, 2011 includes an increase in advertising expense of $15.1 million as our U.S. retail business launched an advertising program focusing on re-branding after the acquisition. The full year expense in 2011 of the acquisition-related additional sales force resulted in an increase in travel expense of $3.2 million and increase in other marketing costs of $2.5 million . These increases were partly offset by a decrease in marketing expense of $13.4 million due to the reversal of a cumulative deferred credit, as well as a reduction in recurring costs, from the termination of our sponsorship and naming rights commitments related to a sports stadium in Denver, Colorado, a decrease in client event costs of $0.9 million , and a decrease in sales literature and research of $0.9 million , as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 . The impact of foreign exchange rate movements accounted for $2.1 million ( 28.0% ) of the increase in marking expense during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 . Property, Office and Technology Property, office and technology expenses include rent and utilities for our various leased facilities, depreciation of company-owned property and capitalized computer equipment costs, minor non-capitalized computer equipment and software purchases and related maintenance payments, and costs related to externally provided operations, technology, and other back office management services. Property, office and technology costs increased by $16.2 million ( 6.8% ) to $254.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 (year ended December 31, 2010 : $238.4 million ). Property and office expenses increased $14.8 million over the comparable 2010 period, due to an increase of $11.5 million in property management fees, service charges and rent expense related to new properties associated with business acquisitions, and increases of $2.1 million in depreciation expense and $1.2 million in other property costs. Technology and communications expenses decreased $3.5 million due to decreases in outsourced administration expenses, partly due to the Hyderabad internalization, of $12.9 million , a decrease in telephone and communication line expenses of $1.8 million and a decrease in programming and consulting expenses of $1.0 million , offset by increases in depreciation and maintenance expenses of $11.7 million and hardware and software purchases of $0.5 million , during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 . The impact of foreign exchange rate movements accounted for $4.9 million ( 30.2% ) of the increase in property, office and technology expenses during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 . General and Administrative General and administrative expenses include professional services costs, such as information service subscriptions, consulting fees, professional insurance costs, audit, tax and legal fees, non-marketing related employee travel expenditures, recruitment and training costs, and the amortization of certain intangible assets. General and administrative expenses increased by $33.2 million ( 12.7% ) to $295.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 (year ended December 31, 2010 : $262.2 million ). Increases in general and administrative expenses include the impact of the acquisition. Professional services expenses increased $8.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 due to increases in consultant fees of $9.2 million , contractor and recruitment fees of $5.6 million , information services of $4.5 million , legal fees of $3.1 million (including legal fees associated with settlement litigation arising from the 2007 departure of certain investment professionals to a competitor of $3.6 million), and other professional services of $1.2 million . Travel expenses increased $11.1 million , driven by higher levels of business activity, and mutual fund expenses increased $7.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 . Expenditure related tax increases, including U.K. value added tax (VAT), resulted in an additional $4.5 million of irrecoverable VAT expense during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 , as VAT rates increased in the U.K. These increases are offset by reduced regulatory fees of $13.3 million relating to a levy from the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme in 2010 of $15.3 million to cover claims resulting from failures of non-affiliated investment firms, professional insurance costs of $1.0 million , accounting services of $0.6 million and directors fees and expenses of $0.4 million . Included in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $8.9 million representing fund 45 Table of Contents reimbursement costs from the correction of historical foreign exchange allocations. Other net decreases of $2.1 million in general and administrative expenses consist of a reduction in acquisition-related contingent consideration payable, gains on disposal of property, plant and equipment and fund reimbursement costs on trade corrections, offset by an increase in intangible amortization expense due to the acquisitions and that includes a write down of certain management contract intangibles. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements accounted for $3.6 million ( 10.8% ) of the increase in general and administrative costs during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 . Transaction and integration Transaction and integration expenses include acquisition-related charges incurred during the period to effect a business combination, including legal, regulatory, advisory, valuation, integration-related employee incentive awards and other professional or consulting fees, general and administrative costs, including travel costs related to the transaction and the costs of temporary staff involved in executing the transaction, and post-closing costs of integrating the acquired business into the company's existing operations. Additionally, transaction and integration expenses include legal costs related to the defense of auction rate preferred securities complaints raised in the pre-acquisition period with respect to various closed-end funds included in the acquisition. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies for additional information. Transaction and integration charges were $29.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 (year ended December 31, 2010 : $150.0 million ) related to the integration of acquired businesses. Transaction and integration expenses during the year ended December 31, 2011 include $19.9 million of professional services and other costs, principally legal, proxy solicitation, consultancy and insurance, $4.9 million of property and office, $2.8 million of employee compensation costs, $1.4 million of technology and communication costs and $0.4 million of marketing and client services. Transaction and integration expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 include $39.1 million of staff costs, $53.4 million of technology contractor and related costs, and $57.5 million of professional services, principally legal, proxy solicitation, consultancy and insurance. Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income, Operating Margin and Adjusted Operating Margin Operating income increased by $308.2 million ( 52.2% ) to $898.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 (year ended December 31, 2010 : $589.9 million ). Operating margin (operating income divided by operating revenues), increased from 16.9% in the year ended December 31, 2010 to 21.9% in the year ended December 31, 2011 . The increase in operating income and margin resulted from a greater relative increase in operating revenues ( 17.3% ) than in operating expenses ( 10.2% ) during the period. Adjusted operating income, increased by $171.2 million ( 19.1% ) to $1,068.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 from $897.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 . Adjusted operating margin increased to 36.9% in the year ended December 31, 2011 from 35.6% in the year ended December 31, 2010 . See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues, a reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income and additional important disclosures regarding net revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin. Other Income and Expenses The main categories of other income and expenses, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods are as follows: Year ended December 31, $ in millions 2011 2010 $ Change % Change Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 30.5 40.2 (9.7 ) (24.1 )% Interest and dividend income 11.0 10.4 0.6 5.8 % Interest income of consolidated investment products 307.2 240.9 66.3 27.5 % Gains/(losses) of consolidated investment products, net (138.9 ) 114.0 (252.9 ) N/A Interest expense (61.8 ) (58.6 ) (3.2 ) 5.5 % Interest expense of consolidated investment products (187.0 ) (118.6 ) (68.4 ) 57.7 % Other gains and losses, net 49.0 15.6 33.4 214.1 % Total other income and expenses 10.0 243.9 (233.9 ) (95.9 )% Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased by $9.7 million ( 24.1% ) to $30.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 (year ended December 31, 2010 : $40.2 million ). Included in equity in earnings from affiliates is our share of the income from our joint ventures in China, which declined by $2.4 million to $21.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 from $23.9 million earned during the year ended December 31, 2010 . Declines in equity in earnings from our joint ventures are due to declines 46 Table of Contents in revenues that are in turn attributable to lower average AUM in those entities during the year. Earnings from our affiliate in Poland increased by $0.2 million to $1.3 million in year ended December 31, 2011 from $1.1 million earned in the year ended December 31, 2010 . The remainder of the variance is due to our share of the market-driven valuation changes in the underlying holdings of certain partnership investments which decreased by $7.4 million to $7.7 million earned in the year ended December 31, 2011 from $15.1 million earned during the year ended December 31, 2010 . Interest and dividend income and interest expense Interest and dividend income increased by $0.6 million ( 5.8% ) to $11.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 (year ended December 31, 2010 : $10.4 million ). The year ended December 31, 2011 includes dividend income of $4.9 million on investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans ( December 31, 2010 : $2.7 million ). This dividend income is passed through to employee participants in the deferred compensation plans. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional details. The increase in dividend income of $2.2 million is offset by the decreases in investment income and interest earned on cash and cash equivalents of $1.6 million resulting from lower average cash and cash equivalent balances during the year ended December 31, 2011 . Interest expense increased by $3.2 million ( 5.5% ) to $61.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 (year ended December 31, 2010 : $58.6 million ). Higher average debt balances were partly offset by lower average cost of debt during the year ended December 31, 2011 . Interest income and interest expense of consolidated investment products Interest income of consolidated investment products results from interest generated by the collateral assets held by consolidated CLOs, which is used to satisfy the interest expenses of the notes issued by the consolidated CLOs and other CLO operating expense requirements, including the payment of the management and performance fees to the company as investment manager. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 20, Consolidated Investment Products, for additional details. In the year ended December 31, 2011 , interest income of consolidated investment products increased by $66.3 million ( 27.5% ) to $307.2 million (year ended December 31, 2010 : $240.9 million ) reflecting the acquisition and higher interest rates on variable rate asset collateral held by the CLOs. Interest expense of consolidated investment products increased by $68.4 million ( 57.7% ) to $187.0 million (year ended December 31, 2010 : $118.6 million ) reflecting the acquisition and higher variable interest rates on outstanding principal balances of CLO notes in 2011. Gains and losses of consolidated investment products, net income impact of consolidated investment products, and noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities Included in other income and expenses are gains and losses of consolidated investment products, net, which are driven by realized and unrealized gains and losses of underlying investments held by consolidated investment products. In the year ended December 31, 2011 other gains and losses of consolidated investment products were a net loss of $138.9 million , as compared to a net gain of $114.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 . The net loss in the 2011 period is primarily due to losses in CLO investments and long-term debt which more than offset gains in the market value of investments held by consolidated private equity funds. The net gain in the 2010 period is primarily due to changes in market values of investments held by consolidated private equity funds. As illustrated in the Condensed Consolidating Statements of Income at the beginning of this Results of Operations section, the consolidation of investment products during the year ended December 31, 2011 resulted in a decrease to net income of $87.4 million before attribution to noncontrolling interests. Invesco invests in only a portion of these products, and as a result this net loss is offset by noncontrolling interests of $107.6 million , resulting in a net increase in net income of the company of $20.2 million . The consolidation of investment products during the year ended December 31, 2010 resulted in an increase to net income of $180.7 million before attribution to noncontrolling interests. This net income is offset by noncontrolling interests of $170.9 million, resulting in a net increase in net income of the company of $9.8 million. Noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities represent the profit or loss amounts attributed to third party investors in consolidated investment products. Movements in amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the company's Consolidated Statements of Income generally offset the gains and losses, interest income and interest expense of consolidated investment products. 47 Table of Contents Other gains and losses, net Other gains and losses, net were a net gain of $49.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to a net gain of $15.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 . Included within other gains and losses in the year ended December 31, 2011 is a credit of $45.0 million related to the settlement of litigation arising from the 2007 departure of certain investment professionals to a competitor. Also included in other gains and losses is a net loss of $2.6 million as a result of the deprecation of assets held for our deferred compensation plans (year ended December 31, 2010 : a net gain of $14.2 million), together with $8.1 million of net realized gains from seed investments (year ended December 31, 2010 : $9.2 million net realized gains). The 2011 other gains and losses also included $0.9 million in other-than-temporary impairment charges related to other seed money in affiliated funds (year ended December 31, 2010 : $6.6 million). In the year ended December 31, 2011 , we incurred $0.6 million in net foreign exchange losses (year ended December 31, 2010 : $0.2 million in net foreign exchange losses) on the revaluation of intercompany foreign currency denominated loans into the various functional currencies of our subsidiaries. Income Tax Expense Our effective tax rate, excluding noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, for 2011 was 28.2%, down from 29.7% for 2010. The rate decrease was primarily due to changes in the mix of pre-tax income and favorable adjustments to reconcile our tax provisions to reflect actual tax returns filed, partially offset by a smaller benefit from the release of provisions for uncertain tax positions in 2011 versus 2010. 2010 also included non-deductible transaction and integration costs related to the acquired business. The inclusion of income from noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities increased our effective tax rate to 31.5% in 2011 and decreased it to 23.6% in 2010. The 2011 rate was higher than 2010 due to a larger impact from losses in non-controlling interests in 2011. 48 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2010 , compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2009 Condensed Consolidating Statements of Income $ in millions Before Consolidation (1) Consolidated Investment Products (2) Adjustments (1)(3) Total Year ended December 31, 2010 Total operating revenues 3,532.7 0.3 (45.3 ) 3,487.7 Total operating expenses 2,887.8 55.3 (45.3 ) 2,897.8 Operating income 644.9 (55.0 ) 589.9 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 40.8 (0.6 ) 40.2 Interest and dividend income 10.4 246.0 (5.1 ) 251.3 Other investment income/(losses) 15.6 107.6 6.4 129.6 Interest expense (58.6 ) (123.7 ) 5.1 (177.2 ) Income before income taxes 653.1 174.9 5.8 833.8 Income tax provision (197.0 ) (197.0 ) Net income 456.1 174.9 5.8 636.8 (Gains)/losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, net (0.2 ) (170.8 ) (0.1 ) (171.1 ) Net income attributable to common shareholders 455.9 4.1 5.7 465.7 $ in millions Before Consolidation Consolidated Investment Products (2) Adjustments (3) Total Year ended December 31, 2009 Total operating revenues 2,633.3 1.9 (7.9 ) 2,627.3 Total operating expenses (2,139.5 ) (11.4 ) 7.9 (2,143.0 ) Operating income 493.8 (9.5 ) 484.3 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 24.5 2.5 27.0 Interest and dividend income 9.8 9.8 Other investment income/(losses) 7.8 (106.9 ) (99.1 ) Interest expense (64.5 ) (64.5 ) Income before income taxes 471.4 (116.4 ) 2.5 357.5 Income tax provision (148.2 ) (148.2 ) Net income 323.2 (116.4 ) 2.5 209.3 (Gains)/losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, net (0.7 ) 113.9 113.2 Net income attributable to common shareholders 322.5 (2.5 ) 2.5 322.5 ____________ (1) The Before Consolidation column includes Invesco's equity interests in the investment products accounted for as equity method (private equity and real estate partnership funds) and available-for-sale investments (CLOs). Upon consolidation of the CLOs, the company's and the CLOs' accounting policies are effectively aligned, resulting in the reclassification of the company's gain for the year ended December 31, 2010 of $6.4 million (representing the increase in the market value of the company's holding in the consolidated CLOs) from other comprehensive income into other gains/losses. The company's gain on its investment in the CLOs (before consolidation) eliminates with the company's share of the offsetting loss on the CLOs' debt. The net income arising from consolidation of CLOs is therefore completely attributed to other investors in these CLOs, as the company's share has been eliminated through consolidation. The Before Consolidation column does not include any other adjustments related to non-GAAP financial measure presentation. (2) The company adopted guidance now encompassed in ASC Topic 810 on January 1, 2010 resulting in the consolidation of certain CLOs. In accordance with the standard, prior periods have not been restated to reflect the consolidation of these CLOs. Prior to January 1, 2010, the company was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of these CLOs. (3) Adjustments include the elimination of intercompany transactions between the company and its consolidated investment products, primarily the elimination of management fees expensed by the funds and recorded as operating revenues (before consolidation) by the company. 49 Table of Contents Operating Revenues and Net Revenues The main categories of revenues, and the dollar and percentage change between the periods, are as follows: $ in millions 2010 2009 $ Change % Change Investment management fees 2,720.9 2,120.2 600.7 28.3 % Service and distribution fees 645.5 412.6 232.9 56.4 % Performance fees 26.1 30.0 (3.9 ) (13.0 )% Other 95.2 64.5 30.7 47.6 % Total operating revenues 3,487.7 2,627.3 860.4 32.7 % Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses (1,053.8 ) (737.0 ) (316.8 ) 43.0 % Proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments 42.2 44.7 (2.5 ) (5.6 )% Management fees earned from consolidated investment products 45.3 8.0 37.3 N/A Other revenues recorded by consolidated investment products (0.3 ) (2.0 ) 1.7 85.0 % Net revenues 2,521.1 1,941.0 580.1 29.9 % Operating revenues increased by 32.7% in 2010 to $3,487.7 million (year ended December 31, 2009 : $2,627.3 million). Net revenues increased by 29.9% in 2010 to $2,521.1 million (year ended December 31, 2009 : $1,941.0 million). Net revenues are operating revenues less third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, plus our proportional share of net revenues from joint venture arrangements. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements accounted for $18.0 million (2.1%) of the increase in operating revenues, and was 0.5% of total operating revenues, during the year ended December 31, 2010 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 . As discussed above, the company acquired Morgan Stanley's retail asset management business, including Van Kampen Investments (the acquired business or the acquisition ) on June 1, 2010. The acquisition had a significant impact on our results for the 2010 period. The operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 include the operating results of the acquired business from the purchase date of June 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010. The integration of the acquired business was largely completed at the end of 2010; as such, accurate segregated expense information for the acquired business was not available to include in the detailed variance discussion that follows. Prior to any significant product mergers, revenues associated with the acquired business could be separately identified, and as a result, the impact was estimated. Operating revenues of the acquired business for the year ended December 31, 2010 were approximately $468 million, which represented the incremental impact of the acquired business and does not represent the stand-alone results of the acquired business. Investment Management Fees Investment management fees increased by $600.7 million (28.3%) in the year ended December 31, 2010 , to $2,720.9 million (year ended December 31, 2009 : $2,120.2 million) due to the acquisition, increases in average AUM, primarily retail AUM, changes in the mix of AUM between asset classes and foreign exchange rate movement. The acquisition contributed to the increase in investment management fees with an estimated $257 million in these fees during the year ended December 31, 2010 . Average long-term AUM, which generally earn higher fee rates than money market AUM, increased 41.0% to $463.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $328.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 , while average institutional money market AUM decreased 20.9% to $68.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $87.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 . The increase in average long-term AUM includes the impact of the acquired business. See the company's disclosures regarding the changes in AUM during the year ended December 31, 2010 in the Assets Under Management section above for additional information regarding the movements in AUM. Foreign exchange rate movements led to an increase in investment management fees of $17.0 million (2.8%) during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 . Additionally, the change in investment management fee revenues reflects the adoption of guidance now encompassed in ASC Topic 810 on January 1, 2010. As part of the consolidation, management fees earned from consolidated CLOs and other products of $45.3 million were eliminated from the company's operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 . In accordance with the standard, prior periods have not been restated to reflect the consolidation of these CLOs. 50 Table of Contents Service and Distribution Fees In 2010, service and distribution fees increased by $232.9 million (56.4%) to $645.5 million (year ended December 31, 2009 : $412.6 million). The acquisition contributed an estimated $172 million of the increase in service and distribution fees in the year ended December 31, 2010 . The remaining increase is largely attributable to the increase in average AUM during the year. Performance Fees In the year ended December 31, 2010 , performance fees decreased by $3.9 million (13.0%) to $26.1 million (year ended December 31, 2009 : $30.0 million). The performance fees generated in 2010 arose primarily due to products managed by the European Real Estate group ($4.3 million), Invesco Perpetual ($3.4 million), and Atlantic Trust ($11.8 million). The performance fees generated in 2009 arose primarily due to products managed by the Invesco Global Strategies group ($2.4 million), Invesco Perpetual ($13.4 million), and Atlantic Trust ($5.7 million). Of our $616.5 billion in AUM at December 31, 2010 , only approximately $36.8 billion, or 5.9%, could potentially earn performance fees. Of the $114.6 billion AUM acquired on June 1, 2010 through the acquisition, $2.7 billion, or 2.4%, are eligible to earn performance fees. Other Revenues In the year ended December 31, 2010 , other revenues increased by $30.7 million (47.6%) to $95.2 million (year ended December 31, 2009 : $64.5 million). Increases in other revenues included $38.9 million in UIT revenues during the year, a result of the acquired business, and higher real estate acquisition and disposition fees of $2.4 million which were offset by a $5.2 million decline in transaction commissions. Third-Party Distribution, Service and Advisory Expenses Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses increased by $316.8 million ( 43.0% ) in the year ended December 31, 2010 to $1,053.8 million (year ended December 31, 2009 : $737.0 million ), which is consistent with the increase in investment management and service and distribution fee revenues. Foreign exchange rate movements increased third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses by $5.3 million (1.9%) during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 . Proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments The 5.6% decrease in our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, to $42.2 million in 2010 (year ended December 31, 2009 : $44.7 million), is driven by the decline in average AUM of the Invesco Great Wall joint venture. Our share of the Invesco Great Wall joint venture's average AUM for the year ended December 31, 2010 , was $3.6 billion, a 2.7% decline in average AUM from $3.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 . Management fees earned from consolidated investment products Management fees earned from consolidated investment products increased by $37.3 million to $45.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 (year ended December 31, 2009 : $8.0 million). The increase reflects the adoption of guidance now encompassed in ASC Topic 810 on January 1, 2010. CLO management fees of $35.4 million were eliminated from the company's operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 . In accordance with the standard, prior periods have not been restated to reflect the consolidation of these CLOs. 51 Table of Contents Operating Expenses The main categories of operating expenses are as follows: $ in millions 2010 2009 $ Change % Change Employee compensation 1,114.9 950.8 164.1 17.3 % Third-party distribution, service and advisory 1,053.8 737.0 316.8 43.0 % Marketing 78.5 65.3 13.2 20.2 % Property, office and technology 238.4 212.3 26.1 12.3 % General and administrative 262.2 166.8 95.4 57.2 % Transaction and integration 150.0 10.8 139.2 N/A Total operating expenses 2,897.8 2,143.0 754.8 35.2 % The table below sets forth these expense categories as a percentage of total operating expenses and operating revenues, which we believe provides useful information as to the relative significance of each type of expense. $ in millions 2010 % of Total Operating Expenses % of Operating Revenues 2009 % of Total Operating Expenses % of Operating Revenues Employee compensation 1,114.9 38.5 % 32.0 % 950.8 44.4 % 36.2 % Third-party distribution, service and advisory 1,053.8 36.4 % 30.2 % 737.0 34.4 % 28.0 % Marketing 78.5 2.7 % 2.3 % 65.3 3.0 % 2.5 % Property, office and technology 238.4 8.2 % 6.8 % 212.3 9.9 % 8.1 % General and administrative 262.2 9.0 % 7.5 % 166.8 7.8 % 6.3 % Transaction and integration 150.0 5.2 % 4.3 % 10.8 0.5 % 0.4 % Total operating expenses 2,897.8 100.0 % 83.1 % 2,143.0 100.0 % 81.5 % During 2010 , operating expenses increased by $754.8 million (35.2%) to $2,897.8 million (year ended December 31, 2009 : $2,143.0 million), reflecting increases in all cost categories from 2009 expense levels. As discussed above, the Morgan Stanley acquisition took place on June 1, 2010, which increased expenses across all categories. As the integration of the acquired business was largely completed at end of 2010, segregated expense data is not available. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements accounted for $13.2 million (1.7%) of the increase in operating expenses, and was 0.5% of total operating expenses, during the year ended December 31, 2010 . Employee Compensation Employee compensation increased $164.1 million (17.3%) to $1,114.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 (year ended December 31, 2009 : $950.8 million). Base salaries and variable compensation increased $114.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 from the year ended December 31, 2009 due to incremental costs associated with the acquisition, the impact of annual merit increases, and the increase in variable compensation accruals to reflect the overall earnings growth of the company, including improving operating results and sales. Included in compensation expenses during the year ended December 31, 2010 are share-based costs of $114.1 million compared to $90.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 , also due to the incremental impact of the acquisition and to the additional amortization of share awards granted February 28, 2010 as part of the company's annual share award cycle. Foreign exchange rate movement led to an increase in employee compensation expenses of $6.3 million (3.9%) in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 . Additionally, employee compensation costs for the year ended December 31 , 2010 and 2009 included $20.0 million of prepaid compensation amortization expenses related to the 2006 acquisition of W.L. Ross & Co. Headcount at December 31, 2010 was 5,617 (year ended December 31, 2009 : 4,890). The acquisition added 580 employees at June 1, 2010. Formal hiring of staff in our Hyderabad, India, facility commenced with 83 individuals becoming our employees in late 2010, and more thereafter. 52 Table of Contents Third-Party Distribution, Service and Advisory Expenses Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses are discussed above in the operating and net revenues section. Marketing Marketing expenses increased by $13.2 million ( 20.2% ) in 2010 to $78.5 million (year ended December 31, 2009 : $65.3 million ) due primarily to travel/client events and sales literature/research expenses increased $11.3 million and $4.3 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2010 from the year ended December 31, 2009 , offset by a decrease in advertising expenses of $3.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 . Property, Office and Technology Property, office and technology costs increased by $26.1 million (12.3%) to $238.4 million in 2010 from $212.3 million in 2009 . Increases in property, office and technology costs include increases in outsourced administration expense and depreciation expense of $14.7 million and $7.1 million, respectively, along with other additional costs resulting from the acquisition. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased by $95.4 million (57.2%) to $262.2 million in 2010 from $166.8 million in 2009 , due to several factors, including an increase in amortization of certain intangible assets related to the acquisition of $18.0 million, a charge recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2010 , relating to a levy from the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme of $15.3 million to cover claims resulting from failures of non-affiliated investment firms, a charge representing reimbursement costs from the correction of historical foreign exchange allocations in the fund accounting process that impacted the reporting of fund performance of certain funds of $8.9 million, an increase in non-marketing travel and entertainment costs of $10.4 million and an increase in market information services of $10.1 million for increased services across the business. Additionally, general and administrative expenses increased in 2010 from 2009 due to an insurance recovery received in 2009 related to legal costs associated with the market-timing regulatory settlement which offset 2009 expenses by $9.5 million. Transaction and integration Transaction and integration charges were $150.0 million in 2010 , as compared to $10.8 million in 2009 ($26.7 million of these costs were recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2010 ) and relate primarily to the acquisition of Morgan Stanley's retail asset management business, including Van Kampen Investments. The acquisition was announced in October 2009 and closed on June 1, 2010. Transaction and integration charges incurred during the year ended December 31, 2010 include $39.1 million of staff costs, $53.4 million of technology contractor and related costs, and $57.5 million of professional services, principally legal, proxy solicitation, consultancy and insurance. Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income, Operating Margin and Adjusted Operating Margin Operating income increased 21.8% to $589.9 million in 2010 from $484.3 million in 2009 , driven by the increase in operating revenues from increased AUM. Operating margin (operating income divided by operating revenues) was 16.9% in 2010 , down from 18.4% in 2009 . Adjusted operating margin increased to 35.6% in 2010 from 29.1% in 2009 . See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues, a reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income and additional important disclosures regarding net revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin. 53 Table of Contents Other Income and Expenses The main categories of other income and expenses, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods are as follows: Year ended December 31, $ in millions 2010 2009 $ Change % Change Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 40.2 27.0 13.2 48.9 % Interest and dividend income 10.4 9.8 0.6 6.1 % Interest income of consolidated investment products 240.9 240.9 N/A Gains/(losses) of consolidated investment products, net 114.0 (106.9 ) 220.9 N/A Interest expense (58.6 ) (64.5 ) 5.9 9.1 % Interest expense of consolidated investment products (118.6 ) (118.6 ) N/A Other gains and losses, net 15.6 7.8 7.8 100 % Total other income and expenses 243.9 (126.8 ) 370.7 N/A Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased by $13.2 million (48.9%) to $40.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 (year ended December 31, 2009 : $27.0 million). Included in equity in earnings from affiliates is our share of the income from our joint ventures in China, which declined by $5.5 million to $23.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 from $29.4 million earned during the year ended December 31, 2009 . Declines in equity in earnings from our joint ventures are due to declines in average AUM in those entities during the year. Earnings from our affiliate in Poland also decreased by $1.1 million to $1.1 million in year ended December 31, 2010 from $2.2 million earned in the year ended December 31, 2009 . These declines were more than offset by our share of the market-driven valuation changes in the underlying holdings of certain partnership investments which increased by $19.6 million to $15.1 million earned in the year ended December 31, 2010 from $4.5 million of losses during the year ended December 31, 2009 . Interest and dividend income and interest expense Interest and dividend income increased by $0.6 million (6.1%) to $10.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 (year ended December 31, 2009 : $9.8 million). The year ended December 31, 2010 includes dividend income of $2.7 million on investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans. This dividend income is passed through to employee participants in the deferred compensation plans. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional details. Higher yields during the year ended December 31, 2010 offset lower average cash and cash equivalent balances. Interest expense decreased by $5.9 million (9.1%) to $58.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 (year ended December 31, 2009 : $64.5 million). Higher average debt balances were more than offset by lower average cost of debt during the year ended December 31, 2010 following the restructuring of our debt versus the comparative period. Interest income and interest expense of consolidated investment products In the year ended December 31, 2010 , interest income and interest expense of consolidated investment products were $240.9 million and $118.6 million, respectively. The balances reflect the adoption of guidance now encompassed in ASC Topic 810 on January 1, 2010. In accordance with the standard, prior periods have not been restated to reflect the consolidation. Gains and losses of consolidated investment products, net income impact of consolidated investment products, and noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities Included in other income and expenses are gains and losses of consolidated investment products, net, which are driven by realized and unrealized gains and losses of underlying investments held by consolidated investment products. In the year ended December 31, 2010 other gains and losses of consolidated investment products were a net gain of $114.0 million, as compared to a net loss of $106.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 . The net gain in the period is primarily due to changes in market values of investments held by consolidated private equity funds. As illustrated in the Condensed Consolidating Statements of Income for the year ended December 31 , 2010 and 2009 at the beginning of this Results of Operations section, the consolidation of investment products during the year ended December 31, 2010 resulted in an increase to net income of $180.7 million before attribution to noncontrolling interests. Invesco invests in only 54 Table of Contents a portion of these products, and as a result this net gain is offset by noncontrolling interests of $170.9 million, resulting in a net increase in net income of the company of $9.8 million. Consolidated investment products had no material net income impact to the company for the year ended December 31, 2009 . Noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities represent the profit or loss amounts attributed to third party investors in consolidated investment products. Movements in amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the company's Consolidated Statements of Income generally offset the gains and losses, interest income and interest expense of consolidated investment products. Other gains and losses, net Other gains and losses, net were a net gain of $15.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to a net gain of $7.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 . Included in other gains and losses is a net gain of $14.2 million as a result of the appreciation of assets held for our deferred compensation plans (year ended December 31, 2009 : none), together with $9.2 million of net realized gains from seed investments (year ended December 31, 2009 : $3.7 million net realized gains). The 2010 other gains and losses also included $6.6 million in other-than-temporary impairment charges related to other seed money in affiliated funds (year ended December 31, 2009 : $3.0 million) and $0.4 million in other-than-temporary impairment charges related to the valuations of investments in certain of our CLO products (year ended December 31, 2009 : $5.2 million). In the year ended December 31, 2010 , we incurred $0.2 million in net foreign exchange losses (year ended December 31, 2009 : $8.4 million in net foreign exchange gains) on the revaluation of intercompany foreign currency denominated loans into the various functional currencies of our subsidiaries. In addition, included in the 2009 net gain is a gross gain generated upon a debt tender offer of $4.3 million ($3.3 million net of related expenses). Income Tax Expense Our effective tax rate, excluding noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, for 2010 was 29.7%, down from 31.5% for 2009 . The rate decrease was primarily due to the mix of pre-tax income and favorable adjustments to reconcile our tax provisions to reflect actual tax returns filed. The rate decrease was partially offset by non-deductible transaction and integration costs related to the acquired business and a smaller benefit from the release of provisions for uncertain tax positions in 2010 versus 2009 . The inclusion of income from noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities decreased our effective tax rate to 23.6% in 2010 and increased it to 41.5% in 2009 . The 2010 rate was lower than 2009 due to a lower impact from losses in non-controlling interests. 55 Table of Contents Schedule of Non-GAAP Information Beginning with the presentation of the company's results for the three months ended March 31, 2010, the company expanded its use of non-GAAP measures to include reconciling items primarily relating to guidance now encompassed in the Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810 (discussed in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1, Accounting Policies ) and the acquisition of Morgan Stanley's retail asset management business, including Van Kampen Investments (the acquired business or the acquisition ). We are presenting the following non-GAAP measures: net revenue (and by calculation, net revenue yield on AUM), adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin), adjusted net income (and by calculation, adjusted earnings per share (EPS)). We believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency into our business and allow more appropriate comparisons with industry peers. Management uses these performance measures to evaluate the business, and they are consistent with internal management reporting. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are operating revenues (and by calculation, gross revenue yield on AUM), operating income (and by calculation, operating margin), net income (and by calculation, diluted EPS). Each of these measures is discussed more fully below. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Additional reconciling items may be added in the future to these non-GAAP measures if deemed appropriate. Also beginning with the presentation of the company's results for the three months ended March 31, 2010, the net revenue measure has been redefined from that previously used to adjust for the impact of consolidating certain investment products. The presentation of net revenue in this Report for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, 2008 and 2007 have been restated to conform the calculation to the current period's methodology. See Part II, Item 7 - "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Reclassifications," for additional information. The following are reconciliations of operating revenues, operating income (and by calculation, operating margin), and net income (and by calculation, diluted EPS) on a U.S. GAAP basis to net revenues, adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin), and adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders (and by calculation, adjusted diluted EPS): 56 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share data 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 Operating revenues, U.S. GAAP basis 4,092.2 3,487.7 2,627.3 3,307.6 3,878.9 Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses (1) (1,282.5 ) (1,053.8 ) (737.0 ) (927.8 ) (1,109.7 ) Proportional share of net revenues from joint venture arrangements (2) 41.4 42.2 44.7 57.3 60.6 Management fees earned from consolidated investment products eliminated upon consolidation (3) 46.8 45.3 8.0 6.2 8.7 Performance fees earned from consolidated investment products eliminated upon consolidation (3) 0.5 Other revenues recorded by consolidated investment products (3) (0.3 ) (2.0 ) (5.4 ) (15.2 ) Net revenues 2,898.4 2,521.1 1,941.0 2,437.9 2,823.3 Operating income, U.S. GAAP basis 898.1 589.9 484.3 747.8 994.3 Proportional share of operating income from joint venture investments (2) 19.2 22.9 28.4 39.7 45.5 Transaction and integration charges (4) 29.4 150.0 10.8 Amortization of acquisition-related prepaid compensation (4) 15.0 20.0 20.0 20.0 25.0 Amortization of other intangibles (4) 42.2 30.3 12.6 13.3 12.0 Change in contingent consideration estimates (13.2 ) (3.8 ) Compensation expense related to market valuation changes in deferred compensation plans (5) 5.8 9.3 Consolidation of investment products (3) 60.3 54.9 9.5 5.3 1.8 European infrastructure (6) 18.8 Other reconciling items (7) (6.7 ) 24.2 Adjusted operating income 1,068.9 897.7 565.6 826.1 1,078.6 Operating margin* 21.9 % 16.9 % 18.4 % 22.6 % 25.6 % Adjusted operating margin** 36.9 % 35.6 % 29.1 % 33.9 % 38.2 % Net income attributable to common shareholders, U.S. GAAP basis 729.7 465.7 322.5 481.7 673.6 Transaction and integration charges, net of tax (4) 18.2 103.1 8.9 Amortization of acquisition-related prepaid compensation (4) 15.0 20.0 20.0 20.0 25.0 Amortization of other intangibles, net of tax (4) 37.8 27.4 12.3 13.0 11.7 Change in contingent consideration estimates (4) (13.2 ) (2.5 ) Deferred compensation plan market valuation changes and dividend income less compensation expense, net of tax (5) 2.5 (5.3 ) Deferred income taxes on intangible assets (4) 27.0 21.1 14.4 12.4 7.9 Consolidation of investment products (3) (20.2 ) (6.8 ) European infrastructure, net of tax (6) 16.9 Other reconciling items (7) (32.1 ) 17.0 Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders 781.6 639.7 378.1 527.1 718.2 Average shares outstanding - diluted 464.7 463.2 423.6 399.1 411.9 Diluted EPS $1.57 $1.01 $0.76 $1.21 $1.64 Adjusted diluted EPS*** $1.68 $1.38 $0.89 $1.32 $1.74 ____________ * Operating margin is equal to operating income divided by operating revenues. ** Adjusted operating margin is equal to operating income divided by net revenues. *** Adjusted diluted EPS is equal to adjusted net income divided by the weighted average shares outstanding amount used in the calculation of diluted EPS. 57 Table of Contents (1) Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses include renewal commissions, management fee rebates and distribution costs (12b-1 and marketing support) paid to brokers and independent financial advisors. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1, "Accounting Policies, Revenue Recognition" for additional details. While the terms used for these types of expense vary by geography, they are all expense items that are closely linked to the value of AUM and the revenue earned by Invesco from AUM. Since the company has been deemed to be the principal in the third-party arrangements, the company must reflect these expenses gross of operating revenues under U.S. GAAP. Management believes that the deduction of third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses from operating revenues in the computation of net revenues (and by calculation, net revenue yield on AUM) and the related computation of adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin) appropriately reflects the nature of these expenses as revenue-sharing activities, as these costs are passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of, and distribute, the company managed funds. Further, these expenses vary extensively by geography due to the differences in distribution channels. The net presentation assists in identifying the revenue contribution generated by the business, removing distortions caused by the differing distribution channel fees and allowing for a fair comparison with U.S. peer investment managers and within Invesco own investment units. Additionally, management evaluates net revenue yield on AUM, which is equal to net revenues divided by average AUM during the reporting period. This financial measure is an indicator of the basis point net revenues we receive for each dollar of AUM we manage and is useful when evaluating the company performance relative to industry competitors and within the company for capital allocation purposes. (2) Proportional share of net revenues and operating income from joint venture investments The company has two joint venture investments in China. The Invesco Great Wall joint venture is one of the largest Sino-foreign managers of equity products in China, with AUM of approximately $6.7 billion as of December 31, 2011 . The company has a 49.0% interest in Invesco Great Wall. The company also has a 50% joint venture with Huaneng Capital Services to assess private equity investment opportunities in power generation in China through Huaneng Invesco WLR Investment Consulting Company Ltd. Enhancing our operations in China is one effort that we believe could improve our competitive position over time. Accordingly, we believe that it is appropriate to evaluate the contribution of our joint venture investments to the operations of the business. Management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues, net of distribution expenses, from joint venture investments in the computation of net revenues and the addition of our proportional share of operating income in the related computations of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin also provide useful information to investors and other users of the company's financial statements, as management considers it appropriate to evaluate the contribution of its joint ventures to the operations of the business. It is also consistent with the presentation of AUM and net flows (where our proportional share of the ending balances and related activity are reflected) and therefore provides a more meaningful calculation of net revenue yield on AUM. (3) Consolidated investment products See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 20 - Consolidated Investment Products for a detailed analysis of the impact to the company Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements from the consolidation of investment products. The reconciling items add back the management and performance fees earned by Invesco from the consolidated products and remove the revenues and expenses recorded by the consolidated products that have been included in the U.S. GAAP Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a reader's analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. Accordingly, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues, operating income and operating margin for the impact of consolidated investment products in calculating the respective net revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin. The reconciling items add back the management and performance fees earned by Invesco from the consolidated products and remove the operating and non-operating income and expenses recorded by the consolidated products that have been included in the U.S. GAAP Consolidated Statements of Income. (4) Acquisition-related reconciling items Acquisition-related adjustments include transaction and integration expenses and intangible asset amortization related 58 Table of Contents to acquired assets, amortization of prepaid compensation related to the 2006 acquisition of W.L. Ross & Co., and tax cash flow benefits resulting from tax amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. These charges reflect the legal, regulatory, advisory, valuation, integration-related employee incentive awards and other professional or consulting fees, general and administrative costs, including travel costs related to the transaction and the costs of temporary staff involved in executing the transaction, and the post closing costs of integrating the acquired business into the company existing operations including incremental costs associated with achieving synergy savings. Transaction and integration expenses include legal costs related to the defense of auction rate preferred securities complaints raised in the pre-acquisition period with respect to various closed-end funds included in the acquisition. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies for additional information. Additionally, acquisition-related reconciling items include changes in estimates of acquisition earn-out liabilities booked from prior acquisitions, which is offset in the period by increased amortization related to the write-off of related management contract intangible assets. The U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciling items also include acquisition-related amortization charges related to previous business combinations. The tax benefit is recorded on a portion of the intangible amortization expense that does not generate a cash tax benefit. Management believes it is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements to adjust for the transaction and integration charges and the amortization expenses in arriving at adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS, as this will aid comparability of our results period to period, and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar acquisition-related charges. While finite-lived intangible assets are amortized under U.S. GAAP, there is no amortization charge on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. In certain qualifying situations, these can be amortized for tax purposes, generally over a 15-year period, as is the case in the U.S. These cash flows (in the form of reduced taxes payable) represent tax benefits that are not included in the Consolidated Statements of Income absent an impairment charge or the disposal of the related business. We believe it is useful to include these tax cash flow benefits in arriving at the adjusted EPS measure. The company receives these cash flow benefits but does not anticipate a sale or impairment of these assets in the foreseeable future, and therefore the deferred tax liability recognized under U.S. GAAP is not expected to be used either through a credit in the Consolidated Statements of Income or through settlement of tax obligations. (5) Market movement on deferred compensation plan liabilities Certain deferred compensation plan awards involve a return to the employee linked to the appreciation (depreciation) of specified investments, typically the funds managed by the employee. Invesco hedges economically the exposure to market movements by holding these investments on its balance sheet. U.S. GAAP requires the appreciation (depreciation) in the compensation liability to be expensed over the award vesting period in proportion to the vested amount of the award as part of compensation expense. The full value of the investment appreciation (depreciation) is immediately recorded below operating income in other gains and losses. This creates a timing difference between the recognition of the compensation expense and the investment gain or loss impacting net income attributable to common shareholders and diluted EPS which will reverse over the life of the award and net to zero at the end of the multi-year vesting period. During periods of high market volatility these timing differences impact compensation expense, operating income and operating margin in a manner which, over the life of the award, will ultimately be offset by gains and losses recorded below operating income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The non-GAAP measures exclude the mismatch created by differing U.S. GAAP treatments of the market movement on the liability and the investments. Since these plans are hedged economically, management believes it is useful to reflect the offset ultimately achieved from hedging the investment market exposure in the calculation of adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin) and adjusted net income (and by calculation, adjusted EPS), to produce results that will be more comparable period to period. The related fund shares will have been purchased on or around the date of grant, eliminating any ultimate cash impact from market movements that occur over the vesting period. The non-GAAP measures therefore exclude the mismatch created by differing U.S. GAAP treatments of the market movement on the liability and the investments. Additionally, dividend income from investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans is recorded as dividend income and as compensation expense on the company Consolidated Statements of Income on the record dates. This dividend income is passed through to the employee participants in the plan and is not retained by the company. The non-GAAP measures exclude this dividend income and related compensation expense. 59 Table of Contents (6) European infrastructure expenses Expenses related to the company's European infrastructure alignment efforts represent primarily severance and consulting costs associated with the company's fund rationalization and distribution efforts in Europe. For the year ended December 31, 2011, this adjustment includes $7.6 million in compensation expenses, primarily due to severance costs ; $5.3 million in general and administrative costs, primarily related to consulting services; and $5.9 million of property and technology costs. The company's income tax provision included tax benefits of $1.9 million in the the year ended December 31, 2011. Management does not include these costs in internal reporting, and these costs do not form part of the overall evaluation of the business. Management therefore believes that the exclusion of these costs, due to their incremental nature and projected magnitude, from total operating expenses provides useful information to investors, as this view is consistent with how management evaluates the performance of the business. Exclusion of these costs will aid in comparability of our results from periods to period and the comparability of our results with those of peer investment managers. (7) Other reconciling items Included within other gains and losses in the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2011 is a credit of $45.0 million related to the settlement of litigation arising from the 2007 departure of certain investment professionals to a competitor. Included within general and administrative expenses are legal fees associated with this litigation of $3.6 million. The company's income tax provision included a taxation charge of $15.6 million related to the settlement credit, net of legal fees. Included within marketing expenses in the year ended December 31, 2011 is a credit of $10.4 million related to the termination of naming rights to the Denver Broncos stadium. The company's income tax provision included a taxation charge of $4.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 relating to the credit. Included within general and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2010 was a charge of $15.3 million relating to a levy from the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme.The company's tax provision included tax benefits of $4.3 million relating to this charge. An additional $0.4 million charge was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2011 reflecting revised estimates of the levy. The company's tax provision included tax benefits of $0.1 million relating to this revision. Included within general and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2010 is a charge of $8.9 million representing reimbursement costs from the correction of historical foreign exchange allocations in the fund accounting process that impacted the reporting of fund performance in certain funds. The company income tax provision includes tax benefits of $2.9 million relating to this charge. A $0.3 million credit was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2011 reflecting the final amount reimbursed, together with an associated $0.1 million tax charge. Management does not include these items in internal reporting and these items do not form part of the overall evaluation of the business. Management therefore believes that the exclusion of these items, due to their unique character and magnitude, from net income provides useful information to investors, as this view is consistent with how management evaluates the performance of the business. Exclusion of these items will aid in comparability of our results from period to period and the comparability of our results with those of peer investment managers. 60 Table of Contents Balance Sheet Discussion Condensed Consolidating Balance Sheets are presented below and reflect the consolidation of investment products, including the adoption of guidance now encompassed in ASC Topic 810 on January 1, 2010. The majority of the company's consolidated investment products balances were CLO related as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 . The collateral assets of the CLOs are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs. The company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the CLOs, beyond the company's minimal direct investments in, and management fees generated from, CLOs. If the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. Additionally, the investors in the CLOs have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the CLOs. The company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability.

The following table presents a comparative analysis of significant detailed balance sheet assets and liabilities: $ in millions 2011 2010 $ Change % Change Cash and cash equivalents 727.4 740.5 (13.1 ) (1.8 )% Unsettled fund receivables 444.4 513.4 (69.0 ) (13.4 )% Current investments 283.7 308.8 (25.1 ) (8.1 )% Assets held for policyholders 1,243.5 1,295.4 (51.9 ) (4.0 )% Non-current investments 200.8 164.4 36.4 22.1 % Investments of consolidated investment products 6,629.0 7,206.0 (577.0 ) (8.0 )% Intangible assets, net 1,322.8 1,337.2 (14.4 ) (1.1 )% Goodwill 6,907.9 6,980.2 (72.3 ) (1.0 )% Unsettled fund payables 439.6 504.8 (65.2 ) (12.9 )% Policyholder payables 1,243.5 1,295.4 (51.9 ) (4.0 )% Current maturities of total debt 215.1 215.1 N/A Long-term debt 1,069.6 1,315.7 (246.1 ) (18.7 )% Long-term debt of consolidated investment products 5,512.9 5,865.4 (352.5 ) (6.0 )% Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $13.1 million from $740.5 million at December 31, 2010 to $727.4 million at December 31, 2011 . See Cash Flows in the following section within this Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional discussion regarding the movements in cash flows during the periods. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1, Accounting Policies - Cash and Cash Equivalents, regarding requirements to mandate the retention of liquid resources in certain jurisdictions. Unsettled fund receivables and payables Unsettled fund receivables decreased by $69.0 million from $513.4 million at December 31, 2010 to $444.4 million at December 31, 2011 , due primarily to lower transaction activity between funds and investors in late December 2011 when compared to late December 2010 in our offshore funds. In the company's capacity as sponsor of UITs, the company records receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations for unsettled sell trades of securities and UITs in addition to receivables from customers for unsettled sell trades of UITs. In our U.K. and offshore activities, unsettled fund receivables are created by the normal settlement periods on transactions initiated by certain clients. The presentation of the unsettled fund receivables and substantially offsetting payables ( $439.6 million at December 31, 2011 down from $504.8 million at December 31, 2010 ) at trade date reflects the legal relationship between the underlying investor and the company. Investments (current and non-current) As of December 31, 2011 we had $484.5 million in investments, of which $283.7 million were current investments and $200.8 million were non-current investments. Included in current investments are $63.5 million of seed money investments in affiliated funds used to seed funds as we launch new products, and $184.4 million of investments related to assets held for deferred compensation plans, which are also held primarily in affiliated funds. Seed investments decreased by $35.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 , due primarily to market decreases and net disposals of seed money investments. Investments held to hedge deferred compensation awards increased by $18.9 million during the year, primarily due to additional investments in affiliated funds to hedge economically new employee plan awards. Included in non-current investments are $193.1 million in equity method investments in our Chinese joint ventures and in certain of the company private equity partnerships, real estate partnerships and other investments ( December 31, 2010 : $156.9 million). The increase of $36.2 million in equity method investments includes an increase of $32.1 million in partnership investments due to a $40.2 million co-investment in new European and Asian real estate funds, other capital calls and valuation improvements offset by distributions and capital returns during the period. The value of the joint venture investments and other non-controlling equity method investments increased by $4.1 million during the year as a result of current year earnings of $17.2 million, foreign exchange rate movements which added $2.8 million to the value and capital injections of $1.6 million, offset by annual dividends paid of $17.5 million to the company. 62 Table of Contents Assets held for policyholders and policyholder payables One of our subsidiaries, Invesco Perpetual Life Limited, is an insurance company that was established to facilitate retirement savings plans in the U.K. The entity holds assets that are managed for its clients on its balance sheet with an equal and offsetting liability. The decrease in the balance of these accounts from $1,295.4 million at December 31, 2010 , to $1,243.5 million at December 31, 2011 , was the result of a decline due to foreign exchange movements and a third party transfer of administration contracts to another provider, offset by the increase in the market values of these assets and liabilities. Investments of consolidated investment products As of December 31, 2011 , investments of consolidated investment products totaled $6,629.0 million ( December 31, 2010 : $7,206.0 million ). These investments are offset primarily in long-term debt of consolidated investment products, noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, and retained earnings appropriated for investors in consolidated investment products on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, as the company's equity investment in these structures is not significant. The decrease from December 31, 2010, primarily reflects sales of investments to fund paydowns of CLO long-term debt by CLOs in their amortization period. Goodwill Goodwill decreased from $6,980.2 million at December 31, 2010 , to $6,907.9 million at December 31, 2011 . See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7, "Goodwill," for an analysis of the change in goodwill balances between periods. The company's annual goodwill impairment review is performed as of October 1 of each year. As a result of that analysis, the company determined that no impairment existed at that date. See Critical Accounting Policies - Goodwill for additional details of the company's goodwill impairment analysis process. Current Portion of total debt The balance increased from December 31, 2010 as a result of the reclassification out of long-term and into current of the $215.1 million 5.625% senior notes that mature on April 17, 2012. Long-term debt The non-current portion of our total debt, excluding long-term debt of consolidated investment products, decreased from $1,315.7 million at December 31, 2010 , to $1,069.6 million at December 31, 2011 , due primarily to the reclassification out of long-term into current of the $215.1 million 5.625% senior notes that mature on April 17, 2012. The company also made net repayments on the credit facility of $31.0 million , further decreasing the balance. As of December 31, 2011 there was $539.0 million outstanding on the credit facility. Long-term debt of consolidated investment products Long-term debt of consolidated investment products was $5,512.9 million at December 31, 2011 , as compared to $5,865.4 million at December 31, 2010 . The decrease from December 31, 2010 is primarily related to paydowns of CLO long-term debt during 2011. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our capital structure, together with available cash balances, cash flows generated from operations, existing capacity under our credit facility, proceeds from the public offering of our shares and further capital market activities, if necessary, should provide us with sufficient resources to meet present and future cash needs, including operating, debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements. The company's 5.625% senior notes of $215.1 million at December 31, 2011 mature on April 17, 2012. As of the date of this Report, the company expects to use its existing cash flows from operations and credit facility to satisfy the upcoming maturity and has no plans to issue new senior notes. During 2010, S&P announced an upgrade of our credit rating from BBB+/Positive to A-/Stable. Also in 2010, Invesco became, and remains as of the date of this Report, one of only four publicly rated investment managers designated with a Strong enterprise risk management rating from S&P. Standard & Poor's rates companies' enterprise risk management capabilities on a scale of Fair, Adequate, Strong, and Excellent. On June 1, 2010, we used a combination of existing cash balances and $650.0 million credit facility borrowing to satisfy the $770.0 million cash consideration related to the acquisition. We issued 30.9 million shares of new equity, in the form of common and non-voting common equivalent preferred shares (with economic rights identical to common stock, other than no right to vote such shares) to Morgan Stanley, without holding restrictions, in conjunction with the close. (The preferred shares were subsequently 63 Table of Contents sold, as converted, to unrelated third parties.) During 2011 we repurchased 18.8 million common shares in open market transactions utilizing $436.5 million in cash. On June 3, 2011 the company amended and restated its existing five-year unsecured $1.25 billion credit agreement to, among other matters, provide for a term of five years. The amended and restated facility is now scheduled to expire on June 3, 2016 . Our ability to continue to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors including our credit rating, the condition of the global economy, investors' willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. If we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner, our business could be adversely impacted. The adoption of guidance now encompassed in ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, results in the consolidation of $6.1 billion and $5.6 billion of total assets and long-term debt of certain CLO products as of December 31, 2011 , respectively, which do not impact the company's liquidity and capital resources. The collateral assets of the CLOs are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs. The company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the CLOs, beyond the company's minimal direct investments in, and management fees generated from, these products, which are eliminated upon consolidation. If the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. Additionally, the investors in the CLOs debt tranches have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the CLOs. The company therefore does not consider this debt to be an obligation of the company. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 20, Consolidated Investment Products, for additional details. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1, Accounting Policies - Cash and Cash Equivalents, regarding requirements to mandate the retention of liquid resources in certain jurisdictions. 64 Table of Contents Cash Flows Discussion The ability to consistently generate cash from operations in excess of capital expenditures and dividend payments is one of our company's fundamental financial strengths. Operations continue to be financed from current earnings and borrowings. Our principal uses of cash, other than for operating expenses, include dividend payments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, purchase of our shares in the open market and investments in certain new investment products. Cash flows of consolidated investment products (discussed in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 20, Consolidated Investment Products ) are reflected in Invesco's cash provided by operating activities, provided by or used in investing activities and used in financing activities. Cash held by consolidated investment products is not available for general use by Invesco, nor is Invesco cash available for general use by its consolidated investment products. Accordingly, the table below presents the cash flows of the company separately and before consolidation of investment products, as the cash flows of consolidated investment products do not form part of the company's cash flow management processes, nor do they form part of the company's significant liquidity evaluations and decisions for the reasons noted. The discussion that follows the table will focus on the company's cash flows as presented in the Before Consolidation column of the table. Condensed Consolidating Statements of Cash Flows Cash flows for the years ended December 31 , 2011 , 2010 and 2009 are summarized as follows: $ in millions Before Consolidation Consolidated Investment Products Adjustments Total For the year ended December 31, 2011 Net income 709.4 (107.5 ) 20.1 622.0 Net purchases of trading investments (11.0 ) (11.0 ) Other adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities 231.4 159.2 (20.1 ) 370.5 Changes in cash held by consolidated investment products 264.2 264.2 Other changes in operating assets and liabilities (127.0 ) (153.9 ) (280.9 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 802.8 162.0 964.8 Net proceeds of investments by consolidated investment products 487.6 487.6 Purchases of available for sale and other investments (181.8 ) 7.0 (174.8 ) Proceeds from sales and returns of capital of available for sale and other investments 169.5 (8.1 ) 161.4 Other investing activities (126.1 ) (126.1 ) Net cash (used in)/provided by investing activities (138.4 ) 487.6 (1.1 ) 348.1 Net capital distributed by consolidated investment products (649.6 ) 1.1 (648.5 ) Other financing activities (673.6 ) (673.6 ) Net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities (673.6 ) (649.6 ) 1.1 (1,322.1 ) Decrease in cash and cash equivalents (9.2 ) (9.2 ) Foreign exchange movement on cash and cash equivalents (3.9 ) (3.9 ) Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 740.5 740.5 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period 727.4 727.4 65 Table of Contents $ in millions Before Consolidation Consolidated Investment Products Adjustments Total For the year ended December 31, 2010 Net income 456.1 181.4 (0.7 ) 636.8 Net purchases of trading investments (60.4 ) (60.4 ) Other adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities 232.6 (114.0 ) 0.7 119.3 Changes in cash held by consolidated investment products (336.2 ) (336.2 ) Other changes in operating assets and liabilities (27.1 ) 46.8 19.7 Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities 601.2 (222.0 ) 379.2 Net proceeds of investments by consolidated investment products 498.6 498.6 Purchases of available for sale and other investments (109.1 ) 5.8 (103.3 ) Proceeds from sales and returns of capital of available for sale and other investments 134.6 (2.2 ) 132.4 Other investing activities (865.5 ) (865.5 ) Net cash (used in)/provided by investing activities (840.0 ) 498.6 3.6 (337.8 ) Net capital distributed by consolidated investment products (276.6 ) (3.6 ) (280.2 ) Other financing activities 214.3 214.3 Net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities 214.3 (276.6 ) (3.6 ) (65.9 ) Decrease in cash and cash equivalents (24.5 ) (24.5 ) Foreign exchange movement on cash and cash equivalents 3.0 3.0 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 762.0 762.0 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period 740.5 740.5 $ in millions Before Consolidation Consolidated Investment Products Total For the year ended December 31, 2009 Net income 323.2 (113.9 ) 209.3 Net purchases of trading investments (28.8 ) (28.8 ) Other adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities 193.6 106.9 300.5 Changes in cash held by consolidated investment products 45.0 45.0 Other changes in operating assets and liabilities (162.2 ) (1.1 ) (163.3 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 325.8 36.9 362.7 Net proceeds of investments by consolidated investment products 8.0 8.0 Other investing activities (110.4 ) (110.4 ) Net cash (used in)/provided by investing activities (110.4 ) 8.0 (102.4 ) Net capital distributed by consolidated investment products (44.9 ) (44.9 ) Other financing activities (55.8 ) (55.8 ) Net cash used in financing activities (55.8 ) (44.9 ) (100.7 ) Decrease in cash and cash equivalents 159.6 159.6 Foreign exchange movement on cash and cash equivalents 17.2 17.2 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 585.2 585.2 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period 762.0 762.0 Operating Activities Operating cash flows are generated by the receipt of investment management and other fees generated from AUM, offset by operating expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Although some receipts and payments are seasonal, particularly bonus payments, in general, after allowing for the change in cash held by consolidated investment products, our operating cash flows move in the same direction as our operating income. In 2011 , cash generated by operating activities increased $585.6 million million to $964.8 million from $379.2 million in 2010 . 66 Table of Contents As shown in the tables above, consolidated investment products provided $162.0 million of cash in operating activities in 2011 compared to utilizing $222.0 million in 2010 . The sum of the operating, investing and financing cash flows of consolidated investment products offsets to a zero impact to the company's change in cash and cash equivalent balances from period to period. Excluding the impact of consolidated investment products, cash generated by operations was $802.8 million in 2011 compared to $601.2 million in 2010 . The generation of $802.8 million of cash from operations in 2011 included: net purchases of trading investments of $11.0 million . Trading investments are held to provide an economic hedge against staff deferred compensation plan awards together with investments held for a short period, often only a few days, for the purpose of creating a UIT. net cash generated from the other operating activities of $813.8 million , representing net income as adjusted for non-cash items and the changes in operating assets and liabilities. This twelve month period included the use of $383.1 million of cash to pay the annual staff bonuses, related payroll taxes, payroll taxes on annual share award vesting, and annual pension contributions. The generation of $601.2 million of cash from operations in 2010 included: net purchases of trading investments of $60.4 million. Trading investments are held to provide an economic hedge against staff deferred compensation plan awards together with investments held for a short period, often only a few days, for the purpose of creating a UIT. net cash generated from the other operating activities of $661.6 million, representing net income as adjusted for non-cash items and the changes in operating assets and liabilities. This twelve month period included the use of $273.0 million of cash to pay the annual staff bonuses, related payroll taxes, payroll taxes on annual share award vesting, and annual pension contributions, all of which result in increased operating cash utilization in the first half of the calendar year. Excluding the net purchase of trading investments, cash generated from other operating activities in 2011 improved by $152.2 million from $661.6 million in 2010 to $813.8 million in 2011 . This reflects improved operating income together with the timing differences on staff bonus and other staff compensation related payments. The acquisition also had an impact on the 2011 to 2010 comparison, as 2011 included a full year of the acquired business while 2010 included the acquisition from June 1 forward. Excluding the net purchase of trading investments, cash generated from other operating activities in 2010 improved by $307.0 million from $354.6 million in 2009 to $661.6 million in 2010 . This reflects the improved operating income together with the timing differences on staff bonus and other staff compensation related payments. The acquisition also increased 2010 as compared to 2009, as 2010 included the results of the acquired business from June 1 forward. Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $348.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 ( 2010 : net cash used of $337.8 million). As shown in the tables above, consolidated investment products, including investment purchases, sales and returns of capital, contributed $487.6 million ( 2010 : $498.6 million contributed). Excluding these consolidated investment product cash flows, net cash used in investing activities was $138.4 million ( 2010 : net cash used of $840.0 million). Investing activities in 2010 included acquisition related payments totaling $775.9 million, as compared to 2011 , which reflected acquisition payments totaling $31.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2011 the company purchased available-for-sale investments and other investments of $181.8 million ( 2010 : $109.1 million) and had capital expenditures of $107.0 million ( 2010 : $89.6 million). These cash outflows were partly offset from collected proceeds of $169.5 million from sales and returns of capital of investments ( 2010 : $134.6 million) and $12.6 million from the sale of property and equipment (2010: none). The increase in capital expenditure cash outflow in 2011 when compared to 2010 was in large part due to $12.9 million more cash spent on leasehold improvements in 2011 than in 2010 related to office moves occurring in Tokyo, Taipei and Hong Kong and refurbishment in our Houston offices. In addition technology equipment capital purchases increased in 2011 associated with a company-wide upgrade to our primary operating platform software. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $337.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 ( 2009 : net cash used of $102.4 million). As shown in the table above, consolidated investment products, including investment purchases, sales and returns of capital, contributed $498.6 million ( 2009 : $8.0 million contributed). Excluding these consolidated investment product cash flows, net cash used in investing activities was $840.0 million ( 2009 : net cash used of $110.4 million). The closing of the acquisition on June 1, 2010 resulted in a net cash outflow of $712.2 million. In 2010 , additional net acquisition payments were $37.4 million together with acquisition earn-out payments of $26.3 million ( 2009 : $34.2 million). 67 Table of Contents In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2010 the company purchased available-for-sale investments and other investments of $109.1 million ( 2009 : $104.1 million) and had capital expenditures of $89.6 million ( 2009 : $39.5 million). These cash outflows were partly offset from collected proceeds of $134.6 million from sales and returns of capital of investments in 2010 ( 2009 : $60.6 million). The increase in capital expenditure cash outflows in 2010 when compared to 2009 was primarily related to technology and computer hardware needed for the acquired business. Our capital expenditures related principally in each year to technology initiatives, including new platforms from which we maintain our portfolio management systems and fund accounting systems, improvements in computer hardware and software desktop products for employees, new telecommunications products to enhance our internal information flow, and back-up disaster recovery systems. Also, in each year, a portion of total capital expenditures were related to leasehold improvements made to the various buildings and workspaces used in our offices. These projects have been funded with proceeds from our operating cash flows. During the years ended December 31 , 2010 and 2009 , our capital divestitures were not significant relative to our total fixed assets. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,322.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 ( 2010 : $65.9 million). As shown in the tables above, the financing activities of the consolidated investment products used cash of $649.6 million during the year ( 2010 : $276.6 million). Excluding the impact of the consolidated investment products, financing activities used cash of $673.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 ( 2010 : cash provided $214.3 million). Financing cash outflows during the year ended December 31, 2011 included $220.9 million of dividend payments for the dividends declared in January, April, July and October 2011 ( 2010 : dividends paid of $197.9 million), the purchase of treasury shares through market transactions totaling $436.5 million ( 2010 : $192.2 million), $31.0 million (2010: $80.0 million) utilized to repay a portion of the company's credit facility drawdowns, bringing the balance to $539.0 million as of December 31, 2011 , and $12.3 million for the purchase of a third-party's non-controlling interest in a consolidated investment product (2010: none). Financing cash inflows during 2011 include cash received from the exercise of options of $12.4 million ( 2010 : $19.6 million) and excess tax benefits cash inflows from share-based compensation of $14.7 million ( 2010 : $14.8 million). Net cash used in financing activities totaled $65.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 ( 2009 : $100.7 million). As shown in the table above, the financing activities of the consolidated investment products used cash of $276.6 million during the year ( 2009 : $44.9 million). Excluding the impact of the consolidated investment products, financing activities provided cash of $214.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 ( 2009 : cash utilized $55.8 million). To provide the cash funding needed to complete the business acquisition in late May 2010, $650.0 million was borrowed from the company's $1,250.0 million credit facility. The balance on the facility at December 31, 2010 was $570.0 million as $80.0 million of cash generated from operating activities was utilized to partially repay the initial amount borrowed. Financing cash activities in 2009 included an equity issuance generating cash proceeds of $441.8 million and the redemption of senior notes of $397.2 million. Other financing cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2010 included $197.9 million of dividend payments for the dividends declared in January, April, July and October 2010 ( 2009 : dividends paid of $168.9 million), the purchase of treasury shares through market transactions totaling $192.2 million ( 2009 : none), cash inflows from the exercise of options of $19.6 million ( 2009 : $80.0 million), and excess tax benefits cash inflows from share-based compensation of $14.8 million ( 2009 : $9.4 million). Dividends Invesco declares and pays dividends on a quarterly basis in arrears. The 2011 quarterly dividend was $0.1225 per Invesco Ltd. common share. On January 26, 2012 , the company declared a fourth quarter cash dividend, which will be paid on March 9, 2012 , to shareholders of record as of February 23, 2012 . The total dividend attributable to the 2011 fiscal year of $0.49 per share represented an 11.4% increase over the total dividend attributable to the 2010 fiscal year of $0.44 per share. The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be declared by our board of directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our earnings, financial condition and capital requirements at the time such declaration and payment are considered. The board has a policy of managing dividends in a prudent fashion, with due consideration given to profit levels, overall debt levels, and historical dividend payouts. 68 Table of Contents Share Repurchase Plan On April 23, 2008, the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $1.5 billion with no stated expiration date. During the year ended December 31, 2011 , the company repurchased 18.8 million shares in the market at a cost of $436.5 million (three months ended December 31, 2011: 5.3 million shares at a cost of $103.4 million ); (year ended December 31, 2010 : 9.4 million shares at a cost of $192.2 million ). Separately, an aggregate of 3.1 million shares were withheld on vesting events during the year ended December 31, 2011 to meet employees' withholding tax obligations ( December 31, 2010 : 1.9 million ). The fair value of these shares withheld at the respective withholding dates was $76.6 million ( December 31, 2010 : $47.9 million ). Approximately $732 million remained authorized under the company's share repurchase plan at December 31, 2011 ( December 31, 2010 : $1.2 billion ). Debt Our total indebtedness at December 31, 2011 was $1,284.7 million ( December 31, 2010 : $1,315.7 million ) and was comprised of the following: $ in millions December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 Unsecured Senior Notes: 5.625% - due April 17, 2012 215.1 215.1 5.375% - due February 27, 2013 333.5 333.5 5.375% - due December 15, 2014 197.1 197.1 Floating rate credit facility expiring June 3, 2016 539.0 570.0 Total debt 1,284.7 1,315.7 Less: current maturities of total debt (215.1 ) Long-term debt 1,069.6 1,315.7 For the three months and year ended December 31, 2011 , the company's weighted average cost of debt was 3.63% and 3.50% , respectively (three months and year ended December 31, 2010 : 3.68% and 4.30% , respectively). Total debt decreased from $1,315.7 million at December 31, 2010 , to $1,284.7 million at December 31, 2011 , due to reduced borrowings under our credit facility. On May 24, 2010, the company terminated its $500.0 million credit facility and entered into a new $1.25 billion credit facility maturing on May 23, 2013. On June 3, 2011, the company amended and restated its unsecured $1.25 billion credit agreement to, among other matters, provide for a term of five years. The amended and restated facility is now scheduled to expire on June 3, 2016. Financial covenants under the credit agreement include: (i) the quarterly maintenance of a debt/EBITDA leverage ratio, as defined in the credit agreement, of not greater than 3.25:1.00 through December 31, 2011 , and not greater than 3.00:1.00 thereafter, (ii) a coverage ratio (EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement/interest payable for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended before the date of determination) of not less than 4.00:1.00. As of December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with our financial covenants. At December 31, 2011, our leverage ratio was 1.01 :1.00 ( December 31, 2010 : 1.34:1.00), and our interest coverage ratio was 20.93 :1.00 ( December 31, 2010 : 17.27:1.00). The coverage ratios, as defined in our credit facility, were as follows during 2011 , 2010 and 2009 : 2011 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Leverage Ratio 1.27 1.33 1.13 1.01 Interest Coverage Ratio 17.35 18.89 19.78 20.93 2010 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Leverage Ratio 0.99 1.60 1.52 1.34 Interest Coverage Ratio 13.06 13.03 16.43 17.26 Long-term AUM 350.6 N/A* N/A* N/A* 69 Table of Contents 2009 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Leverage Ratio 1.48 1.63 1.77 1.11 Interest Coverage Ratio 11.31 9.64 9.12 11.01 Long-term AUM N/A* 299.0 329.7 343.6 ____________ * Long-term AUM became a debt covenant measure as part a prior credit facility agreement and was discontinued as a financial covenant measure in a later agreement. Long-term AUM was not required to be restated as part of the agreement and therefore amounts have not been adjusted from what was previously reported. The December 31, 2011 , coverage ratio calculations are as follows: Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 $ millions Total 2011 2011 2011 2011 Net income attributable to common shareholders 729.7 202.3 166.9 183.0 177.5 Net income attributable to Consolidated Investment Products (20.2 ) (1.9 ) (3.5 ) (5.2 ) (9.6 ) Tax expense 286.1 76.0 59.1 75.4 75.6 Amortization/depreciation 117.4 22.1 35.3 32.1 27.9 Interest expense 61.8 14.3 15.3 16.0 16.2 Share-based compensation expense 115.1 29.1 29.2 30.5 26.3 Unrealized gains and losses from investments, net* 3.6 (3.8 ) 11.4 (1.9 ) (2.1 ) EBITDA** 1,293.5 338.1 313.7 329.9 311.8 Adjusted debt** $1,304.7 Leverage ratio (Debt/EBITDA - maximum 3.25:1.00) 1.01 Interest coverage (EBITDA/Interest Expense - minimum 4.00:1.00) 20.93 ____________ * Adjustments for unrealized gains and losses from investments, as defined in our credit facility, include non-cash gains and losses on investments to the extent that they do not represent anticipated future cash receipts or expenditures. ** EBITDA and Adjusted debt are non-GAAP financial measures; however management does not use these measures for anything other than these debt covenant calculations. The calculation of EBITDA above (a reconciliation from net income attributable to common shareholders) is defined by our credit agreement, and therefore net income attributable to common shareholders is the most appropriate GAAP measure from which to reconcile to EBITDA. The calculation of adjusted debt is defined in our credit facility and equals total debt of $1,284.7 million plus $20.0 million in letters of credit. We have received credit ratings of A3/Stable and A-/Stable from Moody's and Standard and Poor's credit rating agencies, respectively, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Disclosure of these ratings is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our debt. These credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at anytime by Moody's or Standard & Poor's. Each rating should be evaluated independently. See also Part I, Item 1A - "Risk Factors," for more detailed discussion on reliance on credit ratings. The discussion that follows identifies risks associated with the company's liquidity and capital resources. The Executive Overview of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains a broader discussion of the company's overall approach to risk management. Credit and Liquidity Risk Capital management involves the management of the company's liquidity and cash flows. The company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit, liquidity and market risks, such as interest rate and foreign currency risks (as discussed in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ), through measurement and analysis. The company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits, which are held by external firms. The company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products, as well as with 70 Table of Contents external high credit-quality financial institutions; however, we have chosen to limit the number of firms with which we invest. These arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation. The company is subject to credit risk in the following areas of its business: All cash and cash equivalent balances are subject to credit risk, as they represent deposits made by the company with external banks and other institutions. As of December 31, 2011 , our maximum exposure to credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalent balances is $727.4 million . Of this amount, cash and cash equivalents invested in affiliated money market funds (related parties) totaled $257.7 million at December 31, 2011 . Certain trust subsidiaries of the company accept deposits and place deposits with other institutions on behalf of our customers. As of December 31, 2011 , our exposure to credit risk related to these transactions is $2.9 million . The company does not utilize credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk. The company does not expect any counterparties to its financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities. The company is exposed to liquidity risk through its $1,284.7 million in total debt. The company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods, reviewing them regularly with senior management, maintaining a committed credit facility, scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialog. Effects of Inflation Inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways. First, inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure, especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted. To the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment, our profitability could be negatively impacted. Secondly, the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment. Declines in the values of these AUM could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of AUM. Off Balance Sheet Commitments See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies - Off Balance Sheet Commitments, for more information regarding undrawn capital commitments and support agreements. 71 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations We have various financial obligations that require future cash payments. The following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our commitments as of December 31, 2011 : $ in millions Total (4)(5) Within 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Total debt 1,284.7 215.1 530.6 539.0 Estimated interest payments on total debt (1) 90.6 40.1 39.2 11.3 Operating leases (2) 618.0 69.4 133.1 127.0 288.5 Defined benefit pension and postretirement medical obligations (3) 43.8 8.3 26.3 9.2 N/A Total 2,037.1 332.9 729.2 686.5 288.5 ____________ (1) Total debt includes $745.7 million of fixed rate debt. Fixed interest payments are therefore reflected in the table above in the periods they are due. The credit facility, $539.0 million outstanding at December 31, 2011 , provides for borrowings of various maturities. Interest is payable based upon LIBOR, Prime, Federal Funds or other bank-provided rates in existence at the time of each borrowing. (2) Operating leases reflect obligations for leased building space. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 14, Operating Leases for sublease information. (3) Expected future contributions to defined benefit plans of $43.8 million are estimated for the next five years, and are comprised of $31.8 million related to pension plans and $12.0 million related to a postretirement medical plan. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 13, Retirement Benefit Plans for detailed benefit pension and postretirement plan information. (4) The company has capital commitments into co-invested funds that are to be drawn down over the life of the partnership as investment opportunities are identified. At December 31, 2011 , the company's undrawn capital commitments were $161.2 million . See Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies for additional details. (5) Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2011 , the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $19.5 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 16 - Taxation for a discussion on income taxes. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1, Accounting Policies to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made. These accounting policies and estimates are discussed below; however, the additional accounting policy detail in the footnote previously referenced is important to the discussion of each of the topics. Different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these financial statements, and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from period-to-period in the future. Taxation. We operate in several countries and several states through our various subsidiaries, and must allocate our income, expenses, and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions. Accordingly, our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations. Annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions within each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities. Each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations. Because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates, it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements. As a result, it is likely that additions to, or reductions of, income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled. 72 Table of Contents Net deferred tax assets have been recognized in the U.S., U.K., and Canada based on management's belief that taxable income of the appropriate character, more likely than not, will be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time. In the event that actual results differ from our expectations, or if our historical trends of positive operating income in any of these locations changes, we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The company utilizes a specific recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The prescribed two-step process for evaluating a tax position involves first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities. If it is, the second step then requires a company to measure this tax position benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The company recognizes any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Income as components of income tax expense. Goodwill. Our goodwill impairment testing conducted during 2011 and 2010 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, indicating that step two of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary; however, the company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled $6,907.9 million and $6,980.2 million at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 , respectively. Such events include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on the company's assets under management, or any other material negative change in assets under management and related management fees. The October 1, 2011 annual goodwill impairment test was performed using a consistent methodology to that used for the 2010 annual impairment tests, with assumptions updated for current market conditions, including the company's updated forecasts for changes in AUM due to market gains and long-term net flows and the corresponding changes in revenue and expenses. Market gains are based upon historical returns of the S&P 500 index, treasury bond returns and treasury bill returns, as applicable to the company's AUM mix on the testing date. The most sensitive of these assumptions are the estimated cash flows and the use of a weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate to determine present value. The most significant change in assumptions from 2010 related to an increase in the market risk premium, which resulted in a discount rate of 16.0% for the October 1, 2011 analysis (2010: 14.9%). The discount rates used are estimates of the weighted average cost of capital for the investment management sector reflecting the overall industry risks associated with future cash flows and have been calculated consistently across the various tests dates. A 30% decline in fair value or more than a 400 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption used during our October 1, 2011 goodwill impairment analysis would be required to cause the carrying value of the reporting unit to be in excess of the market value, thus triggering step two of the goodwill impairment test. The second step could have resulted in an impairment loss for goodwill. While the company believes all assumptions utilized in our assessment are reasonable and appropriate, changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different goodwill impairment assessments. Intangible Assets. Where evidence exists that the underlying arrangements have a high likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost to the company, the intangible asset is assigned an indefinite life and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. Definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable (i.e. the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the fair value of the intangible). In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which definite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the company's cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a definite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the company's amortization expense, which was $42.2 million , $30.3 million and $12.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually as of October 1 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Fair value is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount. The income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment, including AUM growth rates, product mix, effective fee rates, pre-tax profit margins, effective tax rates and discount rates. The most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of the estimated fair value are the AUM growth rate and discount rate. Changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different impairment conclusions. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, annual impairment reviews of indefinite-lived intangible assets determined that no impairment existed at the respective review dates, the classifications of indefinite-lived and definite-lived remain appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the definite-lived intangible assets were required. 73 Table of Contents Investments. Most of our investments are carried at fair value on our balance sheet with the periodic mark-to-market recorded either in accumulated other comprehensive income in the case of available-for-sale investments or directly to earnings in the case of trading assets. Since assumptions are made in determining the fair values of investments for which active markets do not exist, the actual value that may be realized upon the sale or other disposition of these investments could differ from the current carrying values. Fair value calculations are also required in association with our quarterly impairment testing of investments. The accuracy of our other-than-temporary impairment assessments is dependent upon the extent to which we are able to accurately determine fair values. Of our $484.5 million total investments at December 31, 2011 , those most susceptible to impairment include $63.5 million seed money investments in our affiliated funds. Seed money investments are investments held in Invesco managed funds with the purpose of providing capital to the funds during their development periods. These investments are recorded at fair value using quoted market prices in active markets; there is no modeling or additional information needed to arrive at the fair values of these investments. The value of investments may decline for various reasons. The market price may be affected by general market conditions which reflect prospects for the economy as a whole or by specific information pertaining to an industry or individual company. Such declines require further investigation by management, which considers all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of the investment, including, but not limited to, the following factors: The probability that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a debt security not impaired at acquisition; The length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost; The financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer; The intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value; The decline in the security's value due to an increase in market interest rates or a change in foreign exchange rates since acquisition; Determination that the security is not realizable; or An adverse change in estimated cash flows of a beneficial interest. Our other-than-temporary impairment analysis of seed money holdings includes a review of the market returns required for each fund portfolio to enable us to recover our original investment. As part of the review, we analyze several scenarios to project the anticipated recovery period of our original investments based on one-, three-, and five-year historical index returns and historical trends in the equity markets. We also analyze the absolute amount of any loss to date, the trend of the losses, and percent declines in values of the seed money investments. Along with intent and ability to hold, all of these scenarios are considered as part of our other-than-temporary impairment analysis of seed money holdings. Consolidated Investment Products. Assessing if an entity is a VIE or voting interest entity (VOE) involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. Factors included in this assessment include the legal organization of the entity, the company's contractual involvement with the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the company's involvement with the entity. Generally, limited partnership entities where the general partner does not have substantive equity investment at risk and where the other limited partners do not have substantive (greater than 50%) rights to remove the general partner or to dissolve the limited partnership are VIEs. Determining if the company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE also requires significant judgment, as the calculation of expected losses and residual returns (for investment products other than CLOs) involves estimation and probability assumptions. For CLOs, there is judgment involved to assess if the company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly effect the CLOs economic results and to assess if the company's interests could be deemed significant. If current financial statements are not available for consolidated VIEs or VOEs, estimation of investment valuation is required, which includes assessing available quantitative and qualitative data. Significant changes in these estimates could impact the reported value of the investments held by consolidated investment products and the related offsetting equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the other gains and losses of consolidated investment products, net, and related offsetting gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, net, amounts on the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2011 the company consolidated VIEs that held investments of $5,725.1 million ( December 31, 2010 : $6,264.2 million ) and VOE fund investments of $903.8 million ( December 31, 2010 : $941.3 million ). As circumstances supporting estimates and factors change, the determination of VIE and primary beneficiary status may change, as could the determination of the necessity of consolidation of VOEs. Contingencies. Contingencies arise when we have a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event that is 74 Table of Contents both probable and reasonably estimable. We must from time to time make material estimates with respect to legal and other contingencies. The nature of our business requires compliance with various state and federal statutes, as well as various contractual obligations, and exposes us to a variety of legal proceedings and matters in the ordinary course of business. While the outcomes of matters such as these are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict, we maintain reserves reflected in other current and other non-current liabilities, as appropriate, for identified losses that are, in our judgment, probable and reasonably estimable. Management's judgment is based on the advice of legal counsel, ruling on various motions by the applicable court, review of the outcome of similar matters, if applicable, and review of guidance from state or federal agencies, if applicable. Contingent consideration payable in relation to a business acquisition is recorded as of the acquisition date as part of the fair value transferred in exchange for the acquired business.
