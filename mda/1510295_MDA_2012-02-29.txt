Item 7: Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the information included under Item 1. Business, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 6. Selected Financial Data and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes various forward-looking statements concerning trends or events potentially affecting our business. You can identify our forward-looking statements by words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, forecast, goal, intend, plan, predict, project, seek, target, could, may, should or would or other similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. In accordance with safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, which could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in forward-looking statements. The Spinoff and Basis of Presentation On May 25, 2011, the Marathon Oil board of directors approved the spinoff of its RM&T Business into an independent, publicly traded company, MPC, through the distribution of MPC common stock to the stockholders of Marathon Oil common stock. In accordance with a separation and distribution agreement between Marathon Oil and MPC, the distribution of MPC common stock was made on June 30, 2011, with Marathon Oil stockholders receiving one share of MPC common stock for every two shares of Marathon Oil common stock. Marathon Oil received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that, among other things, the distribution of shares of MPC common stock in the Spinoff qualifies as tax-free to Marathon Oil, MPC and Marathon Oil stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a) and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Following the Spinoff, Marathon Oil retained no ownership interest in MPC, and each company had separate public ownership, boards of directors and management. On July 1, 2011, our common stock began trading regular-way on the NYSE under the ticker symbol MPC . Prior to the Spinoff on June 30, 2011, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows consisted of the RM&T Business, which represented a combined reporting entity. Subsequent to the Spinoff, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows consist of consolidated MPC activities and balances. The assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements have been reflected on a historical basis, as immediately prior to the Spinoff all of the assets and liabilities presented were wholly owned by Marathon Oil and were transferred within the Marathon Oil consolidated group. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. The consolidated statements of income for periods prior to the Spinoff include expense allocations for certain corporate functions historically performed by Marathon Oil, including allocations of general corporate expenses related to executive oversight, accounting, treasury, tax, legal, procurement and information technology. Those allocations were based primarily on specific identification, headcount or computer utilization. Our management believes the assumptions underlying the consolidated financial statements, including the assumptions regarding allocating general corporate expenses from Marathon Oil, are reasonable. However, the consolidated financial statements do not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred had we been a stand-alone company during those periods presented prior to the Spinoff and may not reflect our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows had we been a stand-alone company during the periods presented. Actual costs that would have been incurred if we had been a stand-alone company would depend on multiple factors, including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas, including information technology and infrastructure. Subsequent to the Spinoff, we are performing these functions using internal resources or services provided by third parties, certain of which are being provided by Marathon Oil during a transition period pursuant to a transition services agreement. 40 Table of Contents Corporate Overview We are an independent petroleum refining, marketing and transportation company. We currently own and operate six refineries, all located in the United States, with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 1.2 mmbpcd. Our refineries supply refined products to resellers and consumers within our market areas, including the Midwest, Gulf Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. We distribute refined products to our customers through one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges, one of the largest terminal operations in the United States, and a combination of MPC-owned and third-party-owned trucking and rail assets. We currently own, lease or have ownership interests in approximately 8,300 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines to deliver crude oil to our refineries and other locations and refined products to wholesale and retail market areas. We are one of the largest petroleum pipeline companies in the United States on the basis of total volumes delivered. Our operations consist of three reportable operating segments: Refining & Marketing; Speedway; and Pipeline Transportation. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services they offer. See Item 1. Business for additional information on our segments. Refining & Marketing refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our six refineries in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States, purchases ethanol and refined products for resale and distributes refined products through various means, including barges, terminals and trucks that we own or operate. We sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, to buyers on the spot market, to our Speedway business segment and to dealers and jobbers who operate Marathon retail outlets; Speedway sells transportation fuels and convenience products in the retail market in the Midwest, primarily through Speedway convenience stores; and Pipeline Transportation transports crude oil and other feedstocks to our refineries and other locations, delivers refined products to wholesale and retail market areas and includes, among other transportation-related assets, a majority interest in LOOP LLC, which is the owner and operator of the only U.S. deepwater oil port. On December 1, 2010, we completed the sale of the Minnesota Assets. These assets included the 74,000 barrel per day St. Paul Park refinery and associated terminals, 166 convenience stores primarily branded SuperAmerica (including six stores in Wisconsin) along with the SuperMom bakery and commissary (a baked goods and sandwich supply operation) and certain associated trademarks, SuperAmerica Franchising LLC, interests in pipeline assets in Minnesota and associated inventories. Our results of operations, financial position, cash flows and operating statistics for all periods prior to the disposition include amounts for the Minnesota Assets. We reported net income of $2.39 billion, or $6.67 per diluted share, for 2011 compared to net income of $623 million, or $1.74 per diluted share, for 2010. The increase was primarily due to our Refining & Marketing segment operations, which generated income from operations of $3.59 billion in 2011 compared to $800 million in 2010. The increase in Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was due to an improved refining and marketing gross margin, which was primarily a result of wider differentials between West Texas Intermediate crude oil ( WTI ) and other light sweet crudes such as Light Louisiana Sweet crude oil ( LLS ), larger LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads and wider sweet/sour differentials. The Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project continues to be a significant part of our capital spending. As of December 31, 2011, the project was approximately 85 percent complete and on schedule to complete construction in the third quarter of 2012. Immediately following the completion of construction, there will be a 70-day turnaround with the expanded Detroit refinery anticipated to be online by year end. In addition, 41 Table of Contents we continued to optimize our other refineries in 2011, with increases in our crude oil refining capacity as of December 31, 2011 at our Garyville refinery from 464 mbpcd to 490 mbpcd, at our Catlettsburg refinery from 212 mbpcd to 233 mbpcd and at our Texas City refinery from 76 mbpcd to 80 mbpcd. Our Speedway segment generated income from operations of $271 million for 2011 compared to income from operations of $293 million for 2010. Increases in light product and merchandise margins were more than offset by the decrease in income attributed to the sale of 166 convenience stores that were part of the Minnesota Assets disposition in December 2010. In 2011, Speedway purchased 23 convenience stores in Illinois and Indiana. All of the locations have been rebranded and are now integrated into Speedway operations. We intend to grow our Speedway segment through a combination of new construction and selective acquisitions. Our Pipeline Transportation segment continued to generate steady income, with income from operations of $199 million for 2011 compared to income from operations of $183 million for 2010. As a result of the Spinoff, we issued $3.0 billion of senior notes in February 2011. We used a portion of the proceeds to repay our long-term debt payable to Marathon Oil. As additional sources of liquidity, during 2011 we entered into a four-year revolving credit agreement with an initial borrowing capacity of $2.0 billion and a three-year trade receivables securitization facility with an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $1.0 billion. As of December 31, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.08 billion and no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under either the revolving credit agreement or the trade receivables securitization facility. The above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project and Speedway segment growth. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals, other risks customarily associated with construction projects, and our ability to successfully implement growth opportunities. These factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Overview of Segments Refining & Marketing Refining & Marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our refining and marketing gross margin and refinery throughputs. Our refining and marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries, the costs of purchased products and manufacturing expenses, including depreciation and amortization. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate Midwest (Chicago) and U.S. Gulf Coast ( USGC ) crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. LLS prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products (6 barrels of LLS crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline, 2 barrels of ultra-low sulfur diesel and 1 barrel of 3 percent sulfur residual fuel) are used for these crack-spread calculations. Our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. The amount of this discount, the sweet/sour differential, can vary significantly, causing our refining and marketing gross margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude. In general, a larger sweet/sour differential will enhance our refining and marketing gross margin. 42 Table of Contents Historically, WTI has traded at prices similar to LLS. During 2011, WTI traded at prices significantly less than LLS, which favorably impacted our refining and marketing gross margin. The following table provides sensitivities showing the estimated change in net income due to potential changes in market conditions: (In millions, after-tax) LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread sensitivity (a) (per $1.00/barrel change) $ 300 Sweet/sour differential sensitivity (b) (per $1.00/barrel change) 150 LLS-WTI differential sensitivity (c) (per $1.00/barrel change) 65 (a) Weighted 52% Chicago and 48% USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads and assumes all other differentials and pricing relationships remain unchanged. (b) LLS (prompt) - [delivered cost of sour crude oil: Arab Light, Kuwait, Maya, Western Canadian Select and Mars]. (c) Assumes 25% of crude oil throughput volumes are WTI-based domestic crudes. In addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads, the sweet/sour differential and the discount of WTI to LLS, our refining and marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as: the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed; the selling prices realized for refined products; the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to manage price risk; the cost of products purchased for resale; and changes in manufacturing costs, which include depreciation and amortization. Changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries and the level of maintenance costs. Planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. The following table lists the refineries that had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities for each of the last three years: Year Refinery 2011 Canton and Catlettsburg 2010 Catlettsburg, Detroit, Garyville, Robinson and Texas City 2009 Catlettsburg, Garyville and Robinson The table below sets forth the location and daily crude oil refining capacity of each of our refineries at December 31 of each year.

Numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand throughout the year, including local competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions. The demand for gasoline in the Midwest region of the U.S. is estimated to have declined more than two percent in 2011 associated with higher prices, following essentially flat demand during 2010 and 2009. After decreasing in 2009, distillate demand in the Midwest region of the U.S. increased in 2010. Higher prices contributed to an estimated one percent decrease in distillate demand in 2011. Market demand increases for gasoline and distillates generally increase the product margin we can realize. The gross margin on merchandise sold at convenience stores historically has been less volatile. Pipeline Transportation The profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. A majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our common carrier pipelines serve our Refining & Marketing segment. The volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines. Key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. The volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines. In most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillates peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from May through September of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. As with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements. 44 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 Consolidated Results of Operations (In millions) 2011 2010 Variance Revenues and other income: Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) $ 78,583 $ 62,387 $ 16,196 Sales to related parties 55 100 (45) Income from equity method investments 50 70 (20) Net gain on disposal of assets 12 11 1 Other income 59 37 22 Total revenues and other income 78,759 62,605 16,154 Costs and expenses: Cost of revenues (excludes items below) 65,748 51,685 14,063 Purchases from related parties 1,916 2,593 (677) Consumer excise taxes 5,114 5,208 (94) Depreciation and amortization 891 941 (50) Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,106 920 186 Other taxes 239 247 (8) Total costs and expenses 75,014 61,594 13,420 Income from operations 3,745 1,011 2,734 Related party net interest and other financial income 35 24 11 Net interest and other financial income (costs) (61) (12) (49) Income before income taxes 3,719 1,023 2,696 Provision for income taxes 1,330 400 930 Net income $ 2,389 $ 623 $ 1,766 Consolidated net income was $1.77 billion higher in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to a higher refining and marketing gross margin, which increased to $7.75 per barrel in 2011 from $2.81 per barrel in 2010. Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) increased $16.20 billion in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to higher refined product selling prices. Sales to related parties decreased $45 million in 2011 compared to 2010. The decrease resulted from sales to Marathon Oil after the Spinoff no longer being classified as related party and lower refined product volumes sold to Centennial, partially offset by higher refined product selling prices. Income from equity method investments decreased $20 million from 2010 to 2011, primarily due to $12 million of increased losses from our investment in Centennial. Centennial experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 compared to the corresponding period of 2010. Also, 2010 included $4 million of income from an investment in a pipeline company that was included in the Minnesota Assets disposition. Other income increased $22 million in 2011 compared with 2010, due primarily to income from transition services provided to the purchaser of the Minnesota Assets and to Marathon Oil. Cost of revenues increased $14.06 billion in 2011 from 2010. The increase was primarily the result of higher acquisition costs of crude oil, refinery charge and blendstocks and refined products in the Refining & Marketing segment, largely due to higher market prices. Crude oil acquisition prices were up 31 percent, charge and blendstock prices were up 28 percent and purchased refined product prices were up 40 percent. 45 Table of Contents Purchases from related parties decreased $677 million in 2011 compared to 2010. The decrease was primarily due to purchases of crude oil from Marathon Oil after the Spinoff not being classified as related party transactions. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $186 million in 2011 compared with 2010. Employee compensation and benefits expenses comprised $81 million of the increase, which is partially due to an increase in the number of administrative employees associated with being a stand-alone public company, higher incentive compensation accruals related to 2011 performance and increased pension and postretirement benefit costs. Contract services expenses increased $62 million, primarily due to higher information technology costs associated with being a separate stand-alone company. In addition, bankcard processing fees related to Marathon brand sales increased $41 million, primarily due to higher transportation fuel selling prices. Following the Spinoff, we no longer receive allocated corporate overhead costs from Marathon Oil. Related party net interest and other financial income increased $11 million in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily reflecting higher average balances of our short-term investments in preferred stock of MOC Portfolio Delaware, Inc. ( PFD ), a subsidiary of Marathon Oil, prior to the Spinoff. The agreement with PFD was terminated on June 30, 2011. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 for further discussion of the PFD preferred stock. Net interest and other financial costs increased $49 million in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily reflecting increased interest expense associated with the $3.0 billion of long-term debt we issued in February 2011. We capitalized third-party interest of $104 million in 2011 compared to $17 million in 2010. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 18 for further details relating to our debt. Provision for income taxes increased $930 million from 2010 to 2011, primarily due to the $2.70 billion increase in income before income taxes. The effective income tax rate decreased from 39 percent in 2010 to 36 percent in 2011. The 2011 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by an increase in income qualifying for the domestic manufacturing deduction and a decrease in the effective tax rate for state taxes. The year 2011 included a $19 million adverse tax impact of state legislative changes, primarily in Michigan, and 2010 included a $26 million adverse tax impact of federal legislative changes. The provision for income taxes for periods prior to the Spinoff has been computed as if we were a stand-alone company. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11 for further details. Segment Results Revenues are summarized by segment in the following table: (In millions) 2011 2010 Refining & Marketing $ 73,381 $ 57,333 Speedway 13,490 12,494 Pipeline Transportation 403 401 Segment revenues 87,274 70,228 Elimination of intersegment revenues (8,636) (7,741) Total revenues $ 78,638 $ 62,487 Items included in both revenues and costs: Consumer excise taxes $ 5,114 $ 5,208 46 Table of Contents Refining & Marketing segment revenues increased $16.05 billion in 2011 from 2010, primarily due to increased refined product selling prices. Our average refined product selling prices were $2.93 per gallon in 2011 compared to $2.24 per gallon in 2010. The table below shows the average refined product benchmark prices for our marketing areas. (Dollars per gallon) 2011 2010 Chicago spot unleaded regular gasoline $ 2.79 $ 2.09 Chicago spot ultra-low sulfur diesel 2.98 2.17 USGC spot unleaded regular gasoline 2.75 2.05 USGC spot ultra-low sulfur diesel 2.97 2.16 Refining & Marketing intersegment sales to our Speedway segment were $8.30 billion in 2011 compared to $7.39 billion in 2010. Intersegment refined product sales volumes were 2.66 billion gallons in 2011 compared to 3.11 billion gallons in 2010, with the decreased volumes primarily due to the Minnesota Assets disposition. Speedway segment revenues increased $996 million from 2010 to 2011, mainly due to higher gasoline and distillate selling prices, which averaged $3.44 per gallon in 2011 compared to $2.70 per gallon in 2010. These impacts were partially offset by decreased gasoline and distillate sales volumes and lower merchandise sales primarily due to the Minnesota Assets disposition in December 2010. Income before income taxes and income from operations by segment are summarized in the following table: (In millions) 2011 2010 Income from operations by segment: Refining & Marketing $ 3,591 $ 800 Speedway 271 293 Pipeline Transportation 199 183 Items not allocated to segments: Corporate and other unallocated items (a) (316) (236) Impairments (b) - (29) Income from operations 3,745 1,011 Net interest and other financial income (costs) (c) (26) 12 Income before income taxes $ 3,719 $ 1,023 (a) Corporate and other unallocated items consists primarily of MPC corporate administrative expenses, including allocations from Marathon Oil for periods prior to the Spinoff, and costs related to certain non-operating assets. (b) The impairment in 2010 was related to a maleic anhydride plant. (c) Includes related party net interest and other financial income. The following table presents certain market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our Refining & Marketing segment business. (Dollars per barrel) 2011 2010 Chicago LLS 6-3-2-1 (a) (b) $ 3.81 $ 3.02 USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 (a) 2.84 2.13 Blended 6-3-2-1 (a)(c) 3.35 2.64 LLS 112.37 82.83 WTI 95.11 79.61 LLS - WTI differential (a) 17.26 3.22 Sweet/Sour differential (a) (d) 9.11 7.57 (a) All spreads and differentials are measured against prompt LLS. (b) Calculation utilizes USGC 3% Bunker value as a proxy for Chicago residual fuel price. (c) Blended Chicago/USGC crack spread is 53%/47% in 2011 and 57%/43% in 2010 based on MPC refining capacity by region in each period. (d) LLS (prompt) - [delivered cost of sour crude oil: Arab Light, Kuwait, Maya, Western Canadian Select and Mars]. 47 Table of Contents Refining & Marketing segment income from operations increased $2.79 billion in 2011 from 2010, primarily due to a higher refining and marketing gross margin per barrel, which averaged $7.75 per barrel in 2011 compared to $2.81 per barrel in 2010. Our realized refining and marketing gross margin for 2011 improved from 2010 primarily due to wider differentials between WTI and other light sweet crudes such as LLS, larger LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads, and wider sweet/sour differentials. The discount of WTI to LLS increased $14.04 per barrel as a result of logistical constraints in the U.S. mid-continent markets which prevented the price of WTI from rising with the prices of crudes produced in other regions. We estimate this had a $1.69 billion positive impact on our refining and marketing gross margin. The Chicago and USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads increased $0.79 per barrel and $0.71 per barrel, respectively, and we estimate this had a $349 million positive impact on our refining and marketing gross margin. The sweet/sour differential widened $1.54 per barrel and we estimate this had a $277 million positive impact on our refining and marketing gross margin. Within our refining system, sour crude accounted for 52 percent and 54 percent of our crude oil processed in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Direct operating costs declined $248 million from 2010 to 2011, primarily due to a $188 million reduction in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs, which also contributed to the increase in gross margin. Our total refinery throughputs of 1,358 mbpd were two percent higher in 2011 compared to 2010, which included throughputs at our former St. Paul Park refinery. The increased throughputs in 2011 were the result of improved refinery utilization and decreased turnaround activity compared to 2010, primarily at our Garyville refinery. Crude oil refined was essentially flat in 2011 compared to 2010, while other charge and blendstock throughputs increased 12 percent over the same period. The following table includes certain key operating statistics for the Refining & Marketing segment for 2011 and 2010: 2011 2010 Refining & Marketing gross margin (Dollars per barrel) (a) $ 7.75 $ 2.81 Direct operating costs in Refining & Marketing gross margin (Dollars per barrel) : (b) Planned turnaround and major maintenance $ 0.78 $ 1.19 Depreciation and amortization 1.29 1.32 Other manufacturing (c) 3.16 3.32 Total $ 5.23 $ 5.83 Refined products sales volumes (Thousands of barrels per day) (d) 1,581 1,573 (a) Sales revenue less cost of refinery inputs, purchased products and manufacturing expenses, including depreciation and amortization, divided by Refining & Marketing segment refined products sales volumes. (b) Per barrel of total refinery throughputs. (c) Includes utilities, labor, routine maintenance and other operating costs. (d) Includes intersegment sales. Speedway segment income from operations decreased $22 million from 2010 to 2011, with $45 million attributable to the sale of 166 convenience stores that were part of the Minnesota Assets disposition in December 2010 and $33 million attributable to increased operating expenses partially due to higher employee costs. These decreases were partially offset by a $30 million increase associated with a higher gasoline and distillate gross margin and a $26 million increase associated with a higher merchandise gross margin. Speedway gasoline and distillate gross margin per gallon averaged 13.08 cents in 2011, compared with 12.07 cents in 2010. Gasoline and distillate sales volumes declined in 2011 primarily reflecting the sale of the Minnesota Assets. Merchandise gross margin was $719 million in 2011 compared to $789 million in 2010, also reflecting the Minnesota Assets disposition. Same-store gasoline sales volume decreased 1.7 percent in 2011 compared to 2010, while same-store merchandise sales increased 1.1 percent for the same period. The primary factor affecting same store gasoline sales volume was the higher average retail price of gasoline. 48 Table of Contents Pipeline Transportation segment income from operations increased $16 million in 2011 from 2010. The increase primarily reflects the absence of non-routine maintenance and impairment expenses incurred in 2010, partially offset by a reduction in income from pipeline equity method investments. Refined product trunk line volumes increased seven percent in 2011 compared to 2010, while crude oil trunk line volumes decreased two percent in the same period. Corporate and other unallocated items increased $80 million in 2011 compared to 2010 due to higher information technology, employee benefits and other administrative expenses, partially resulting from costs associated with being a stand-alone company. Following the Spinoff, we no longer receive allocated corporate overhead costs from Marathon Oil. Impairment expense in 2010 was a $29 million property impairment related to a maleic anhydride plant, which was operated by our Refining & Marketing segment.

Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) increased by $16.93 billion in 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily due to higher refined product selling prices. Income from equity method investments increased $40 million in 2010 from 2009, primarily due to higher earnings from our investments in crude oil pipeline companies, which increased approximately $22 million, and ethanol production facilities, which increased approximately $10 million. Cost of revenues increased $14.68 billion in 2010 from 2009. The increase was primarily the result of higher acquisition costs for crude oil, charge and blendstocks and purchased refined products in the Refining & Marketing segment, largely due to higher market prices. Crude oil acquisition prices increased 26 percent, charge and blendstock prices increased 30 percent and purchased refined product prices increased 19 percent. These price-related impacts accounted for approximately $8.68 billion of the total increase. Volumes of purchased crude oil were 20 percent higher, which also contributed to increased costs of approximately $4.22 billion, primarily reflecting impacts of the Garyville major expansion project. Purchases from related parties increased $1.28 billion from 2009 to 2010, primarily reflecting both higher acquisition costs of crude oil from Marathon Oil and increased volumes. Higher crude oil volumes accounted for approximately $630 million of the increase and higher crude prices accounted for about $600 million of the increase. Depreciation and amortization increased $271 million in 2010 from 2009, primarily related to the Garyville major expansion project, which we completed near the end of 2009. Related party net interest and other financial income decreased $21 million in 2010 from 2009, primarily reflecting lower average balances of short-term investments in PFD preferred stock. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 for further discussion of the PFD preferred stock. Provision for income taxes increased $164 million from 2009 to 2010, primarily due to the $338 million increase in income before income taxes and a $26 million expense for legislative changes, which are described in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11. The effective income tax rate increased from 34 percent in 2009 to 39 percent in 2010, primarily due to legislative changes and a decrease in the effect of deductions for dividends received from a related party. The provision for income taxes was computed as if we were a stand-alone company. Segment Results Revenues are summarized by segment in the following table: (In millions) 2010 2009 Refining & Marketing $ 57,333 $ 40,665 Speedway 12,494 10,838 Pipeline Transportation 401 381 Segment revenues 70,228 51,884 Elimination of intersegment revenues (7,741) (6,354) Total revenues $ 62,487 $ 45,530 Items included in both revenues and costs: Consumer excise taxes $ 5,208 $ 4,924 50 Table of Contents Refining & Marketing segment revenues increased $16.67 billion in 2010 from 2009, consistent with relative price level changes. Our average refined product selling prices were $2.24 per gallon in 2010 as compared to $1.86 per gallon in 2009, with the higher prices in 2010 contributing about 55 percent of the increase in segment revenues. In addition, refined product sales volumes increased 15 percent in 2010, in part due to the higher production from our Garyville refinery following the completion of the major expansion project, contributing about 35 percent of the segment revenue increase. The table below shows the average refined product benchmark prices for our marketing areas. (Dollars per gallon) 2010 2009 Chicago spot unleaded regular gasoline $ 2.09 $ 1.69 Chicago spot ultra-low sulfur diesel 2.17 1.66 USGC spot unleaded regular gasoline 2.05 1.64 USGC spot ultra-low sulfur diesel 2.16 1.66 Refining & Marketing intersegment sales to our Speedway segment were $7.39 billion in 2010 as compared to $6.02 billion in 2009. Intersegment refined product sales volumes were 3.11 billion gallons in 2010 as compared to 3.03 billion gallons in 2009. Speedway segment revenues increased $1.66 billion from 2009 to 2010, mainly due to higher gasoline and distillate prices, which increased nearly 20 percent and accounted for approximately $1.40 billion of the increase in segment revenues. Income before income taxes and income from operations by segment are summarized in the following table: (In millions) 2010 2009 Income from operations by segment: Refining & Marketing $ 800 $ 452 Speedway 293 212 Pipeline Transportation 183 172 Items not allocated to segments: Corporate and other unallocated items (a) (236) (172) Impairments (b) (29) (10) Income from operations 1,011 654 Net interest and other financial income (c) 12 31 Income before income taxes $ 1,023 $ 685 (a) Corporate and other unallocated items consists primarily of MPC corporate administrative expenses, including allocations from Marathon Oil for periods prior to the Spinoff, and costs related to certain non-operating assets. (b) The impairment in 2010 was related to a maleic anhydride plant. The impairment in 2009 reflects the write-down of our equity method investment in a pipeline company. (c) Includes related party net interest and other financial income. 51 Table of Contents The following table presents certain market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our Refining & Marketing segment business. (Dollars per barrel) 2010 2009 Chicago LLS 6-3-2-1 (a) (b) $ 3.02 $ 3.47 USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 (a) 2.13 2.46 Blended 6-3-2-1 (a)(c) 2.64 3.14 LLS 82.83 64.54 WTI 79.61 62.09 LLS - WTI differential (a) 3.22 2.45 Sweet/Sour differential (a) (d) 7.57 5.72 (a) All spreads and differentials are measured against prompt LLS. (b) Calculation utilizes USGC 3% Bunker value as a proxy for Chicago residual fuel price. (c) Blended Chicago/USGC crack spread is 57%/43% in 2010 and 67%/33% in 2009 based on MPC refining capacity by region in each period. (d) LLS (prompt) - [delivered cost of sour crude oil: Arab Light, Kuwait, Maya, Western Canadian Select and Mars]. Refining & Marketing segment income from operations increased $348 million in 2010 from 2009, primarily due to a higher refining and marketing gross margin per barrel, which averaged $2.81 per barrel in 2010 compared to $2.42 per barrel in 2009, and accounted for approximately $240 million of the increase in segment income. The gross margin increase was primarily a result of a $1.85 per barrel widening of the sweet/sour differential, thereby decreasing the relative cost of crude processed by our refineries. We estimate that the widening of the sweet/sour differential positively impacted our refining and marketing gross margin by $766 million. Within our refining system, sour crude accounted for 54 percent and 50 percent of our crude oil processed in 2010 and 2009 respectively. These favorable impacts to the refining and marketing gross margin were partially offset by lower LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads in 2010 compared to 2009 and increased manufacturing costs incurred related to the additional units at the Garyville refinery. Also contributing to the increase in segment income from operations were increases in our refined product sales volumes, due primarily to increased refinery production, which accounted for approximately $185 million of the increase in segment income. We averaged 1,173 mbpd of crude oil throughput in 2010 and 957 mbpd in 2009. Total refinery throughputs averaged 1,335 mbpd in 2010 and 1,153 mbpd in 2009. These throughputs were higher in 2010 than in 2009, primarily due to the Garyville major expansion, slightly offset by the reduction caused by the sale of the St. Paul Park refinery effective December 1, 2010. The following table includes certain key operating statistics for the Refining & Marketing segment for 2010 and 2009. 2010 2009 Refining & Marketing gross margin (Dollars per barrel) (a) $ 2.81 $ 2.42 Direct operating costs in Refining & Marketing gross margin (Dollars per barrel) : (b) Planned turnaround and major maintenance $ 1.19 $ 0.88 Depreciation and amortization 1.32 0.93 Other manufacturing (c) 3.32 3.49 Total $ 5.83 $ 5.30 Refined products sales volumes (Thousands of barrels per day) (d) 1,573 1,365 (a) Sales revenue less cost of refinery inputs, purchased products and manufacturing expenses, including depreciation and amortization, divided by Refining & Marketing segment refined products sales volumes. (b) Per barrel of total refinery throughputs. (c) Includes utilities, labor, routine maintenance and other operating costs. (d) Includes intersegment sales. 52 Table of Contents Speedway segment income from operations increased $81 million from 2009 to 2010, primarily due to a higher gasoline and distillates gross margin, which averaged 12.07 cents per gallon in 2010 compared to 10.30 cents per gallon in 2009. Same-store gasoline sales volume increased 3.0 percent compared to 2009, while same-store merchandise sales increased by 4.4 percent for the same period. Pipeline Transportation segment income from operations increased $11 million in 2010 from 2009, primarily due to higher earnings from our equity method investments in crude oil pipeline companies. This was partially offset by increased depreciation expense, primarily reflecting an impairment charge for the 2010 cancellation of a pipeline project associated with the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project and the impact of pipeline assets associated with the Garyville major expansion project, which were placed in service near the end of 2009. Corporate and other unallocated items reflected an increase in expenses of $64 million from 2009 to 2010, primarily due to higher benefits-related costs. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows Net cash provided from operating activities totaled $3.31 billion in 2011, compared to $2.22 billion in 2010 and $2.46 billion in 2009. The $1.09 billion increase in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to higher net income in 2011, partially offset by changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were a net $13 million source of cash in 2011, compared to a net $318 million source of cash in 2010, primarily due to the impact of higher crude oil and refined product prices on accounts payable and accounts receivable at year-end 2011 compared to year-end 2010 and higher inventory volumes at December 31, 2011. The $238 million decrease in 2010 compared to 2009 was mainly due to a smaller cash source from working capital changes, primarily reflecting the impact of higher crude oil and refined product prices on accounts payable and accounts receivable at year-end 2010 as compared to year-end 2009. Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $1.30 billion in 2011, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $2.15 billion in 2010 and $2.64 billion in 2009. The $3.45 billion change in 2011 from 2010 was primarily due to net redemptions of related party debt securities in 2011, as further discussed below. The favorable $499 million change in 2010 from 2009 was primarily due to decreased capital spending resulting from completion of our Garyville major expansion project at the end of 2009 and increased cash received from asset disposals, partially offset by net purchases of related party debt securities in 2010. The consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash. A reconciliation of additions to property, plant and equipment to reported total capital expenditures and investments follows for each of the last three years: (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Additions to property, plant and equipment $ 1,185 $ 1,217 $ 2,891 Acquisitions (a) 74 - - Increase (decrease) in capital accruals 53 (51 ) (312 ) Total capital expenditures 1,312 1,166 2,579 Investments in equity method investees 11 7 6 Total capital expenditures and investments $ 1,323 $ 1,173 $ 2,585 (a) Speedway acquisition of 23 convenience stores in 2011. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 15. 53 Table of Contents Capital expenditures and investments for each of the last three years are summarized by segment below: (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Refining & Marketing $ 900 $ 961 $ 2,241 Speedway (a) 164 84 49 Pipeline Transportation 121 24 56 Corporate and Other (b) 138 104 239 Total $ 1,323 $ 1,173 $ 2,585 (a) Includes $74 million acquisition of 23 convenience stores in 2011. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 15. ( b ) Includes capitalized interest of $114 million, $103 million and $236 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project comprised 59 percent, 50 percent and 14 percent (excluding capitalized interest associated with this project) of our Refining & Marketing segment capital spending in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project was approximately 85 percent complete and on schedule to complete construction in the third quarter of 2012. The above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project. Factors that could affect the project include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. These factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. The Garyville major expansion project was a major component of our 2009 spending, accounting for approximately 64 percent (excluding capitalized interest associated with this project) of our Refining & Marketing segment capital spending in 2009. The $74 million cash used in acquisitions in 2011 resulted from our Speedway segment purchase of 23 convenience stores in Illinois and Indiana. Disposal of assets totaled $144 million, $763 million and $53 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The $144 million of cash from asset disposals in 2011 primarily included the collection of a receivable associated with the sale of the Minnesota Assets. In 2010, disposal of assets primarily included proceeds from the sale of the Minnesota Assets. Net investments in related party debt securities was a source of cash of $2.40 billion in 2011, a use of cash of $1.69 billion in 2010 and a source of cash of $160 million in 2009. All such activity reflected the net cash flow from redemptions and purchases of PFD preferred stock. Prior to the Spinoff, all investments in PFD preferred stock were redeemed, and the agreement with PFD was terminated. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 for further discussion of our investments in PFD preferred stock. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1.64 billion in 2011, compared with cash used in financing activities of $82 million in 2010 and cash provided by financing activities of $209 million in 2009. The use of cash in 2011 was primarily due to the net repayment of debt payable to Marathon Oil and its subsidiaries and net distributions to Marathon Oil, partially offset by cash provided from the issuance of long-term debt. These activities were undertaken to effect the Spinoff. The year 2011 also included a use of cash of $60 million for debt issuance costs associated with the $3.0 billion of senior notes, our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility and our $1.0 billion trade receivables securitization facility. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 18 for additional information on our long-term debt. 54 Table of Contents Net borrowings and repayments under our long-term debt payable to Marathon Oil and its subsidiaries was a use of cash of $3.62 billion in 2011 compared with sources of cash of $1.26 billion in 2010 and $15 million in 2009. The agreements with Marathon Oil and its subsidiaries were terminated in 2011. In 2010, net borrowings included $1.26 billion under the revolving credit agreement with PFD. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 for further discussion of these financing agreements. Contributions from (distributions to) Marathon Oil totaled net distributions of $783 million in 2011 and $1.33 billion in 2010 and a net contribution of $207 million in 2009. The net distribution in 2011 was primarily related to $1.47 billion in net cash distributions paid to Marathon Oil, partially offset by income taxes it incurred on our behalf. The net distribution in 2010 was primarily related to $1.48 billion in cash distributions paid to Marathon Oil. The net contribution in 2009 was primarily capitalized interest and corporate overhead cost allocations incurred by Marathon Oil on our behalf. In accordance with the separation and distribution agreement between Marathon Oil and us relating to the Spinoff, Marathon Oil determined that our cash and cash equivalents balance as of June 30, 2011 should be approximately $1.625 billion. Our actual cash and cash equivalents balance as of June 30, 2011 was $1.622 billion and it increased to $3.08 billion at December 31, 2011 due to the factors discussed above. Derivative Instruments See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk. Capital Resources As of December 31, 2011 our liquidity totaled $6.08 billion consisting of: (In millions) December 31, 2011 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,079 Revolving credit facility 2,000 Trade receivables securitization facility 1,000 Total $ 6,079 Because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements, including capital spending programs, the repurchase of shares of our common stock, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. On February 1, 2011, we completed a private placement of $3.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes (collectively, the Notes ), consisting of $750 million aggregate principal amount of our 3 1 / 2 % Senior Notes due March 1, 2016, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of our 5 1/8% Senior Notes due March 1, 2021 and $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of our 6 1 / 2 % Senior Notes due March 1, 2041. On November 18, 2011 we completed a registered exchange offer for the Notes. Interest on each series of Notes is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. 55 Table of Contents The indenture governing the Notes includes covenants that, among other things, limit our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to incur debt secured by mortgages and other liens with respect to principal properties, enter into sale and leaseback transactions with respect to principal properties and merge or consolidate with any other entity or sell or convey all or substantially all of our assets. These covenants are subject to a number of important qualifications and limitations as set forth in the indenture. In addition, if we experience a change of control repurchase event (as defined in the indenture) with respect to a series of Notes, we will be required, unless we have exercised our right to redeem the Notes of such series, to offer to purchase the Notes of such series at a purchase price equal to 101 percent of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We entered into a four-year revolving credit agreement dated March 11, 2011, as amended and effective July 1, 2011 (the Credit Agreement ) with a syndicate of lenders, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, as administrative agent. Under the Credit Agreement, we have an initial borrowing capacity of up to $2.0 billion. We have the right to seek an increase of the total amount available under the Credit Agreement to $2.5 billion, subject to certain conditions. We may obtain up to $1.5 billion of letters of credit and up to $100 million of swingline loans under the Credit Agreement. We may, subject to certain conditions, request that the term of the Credit Agreement be extended for up to two additional one-year periods. Each such extension would be subject to the approval of lenders holding greater than 50 percent of the commitments then outstanding, and the commitment of any lender that does not consent to an extension of the maturity date will be terminated on the then-effective maturity date. At December 31, 2011, we had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under this Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains covenants that we consider usual and customary for an agreement of this type, including a maximum ratio of Net Consolidated Indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for each consecutive four fiscal quarter period of 3.0 to 1.0 and a minimum ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for each consecutive four fiscal quarter period of 3.5 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with these debt covenants with a ratio of Net Consolidated Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 0.6 to 1.0 and a ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 78.4 to 1.0. The Credit Agreement includes limitations on indebtedness of our subsidiaries, other than subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under the Credit Agreement. Borrowings of revolving loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at our option, at either (i) the sum of the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus a margin ranging between 1.75 percent to 3.00 percent, depending on our credit ratings, or (ii) the sum of the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus a margin ranging between 0.75 percent to 2.00 percent, depending on our credit ratings. The Credit Agreement also provides for customary fees, including administrative agent fees, commitment fees of 0.30 percent of the unused portion, fees in respect of letters of credit and other fees. On July 1, 2011, we entered into a three-year trade receivables securitization facility with a syndicate group of committed purchasers, conduit purchasers and letter of credit issuers arranged by J.P. Morgan Securities LLC for an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $1.0 billion. The facility involves one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Marathon Petroleum Company LP ( MPC LP ), selling or contributing on an on-going basis all of its trade receivables (other than receivables arising in connection with the extension of credit under proprietary credit card services), together with all related security and interests in the proceeds thereof, without recourse, to another wholly owned, bankruptcy-remote, subsidiary, MPC Trade Receivables Company LLC ( TRC ) in exchange for a combination of cash, equity or a subordinated note issued by TRC to MPC LP. TRC, in turn, has the ability to sell undivided percentage ownership interests in qualifying trade receivables, together with all related security and interests in the proceeds thereof, without recourse, to certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and/or financial institutions in exchange for cash proceeds. Effective October 1, 2011, we amended and restated the trade receivables securitization facility to, among other things, include trade receivables originated by our wholly owned subsidiary, Marathon Petroleum Trading Canada LLC ( MPTC ). 56 Table of Contents To the extent that TRC retains an ownership interest in the receivables it has purchased or received from MPC LP or MPTC, such interest will be included in our consolidated financial statements solely as a result of the consolidation of the financial statements of TRC with those of MPC. The receivables sold or contributed to TRC are available first and foremost to satisfy claims of the creditors of TRC and are not available to satisfy the claims of creditors of MPC LP, MPTC or MPC. Proceeds from the sale of undivided percentage ownership interests in qualifying receivables under this facility will be reflected as debt on our consolidated balance sheet. We will remain responsible for servicing the receivables sold to third-party entities and financial institutions and will pay certain fees related to our sale of receivables under this facility. At December 31, 2011, we had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under this facility. The facility includes representations and covenants that we consider usual and customary for arrangements of this type. Trade receivables are subject to customary criteria, limits and reserves before being deemed to qualify for sale by TRC pursuant to the facility. In addition, further purchases of qualified trade receivables under the facility are subject to termination upon the occurrence of certain amortization events that we consider usual and customary for an arrangement of this type. As of December 31, 2011, the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows: Rating Agency Rating Moody Baa2 (stable outlook) Standard & Poor BBB (stable outlook) The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant. Neither our Credit Agreement nor our trade receivables securitization facility contains credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. However, any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings would increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under our revolving credit facility and trade receivables securitization facility. In addition, a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment grade levels could, under certain circumstances, decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables securitization facility. 57 Table of Contents Debt-to-Capital Ratios Our cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (total debt-minus-cash to total debt-plus-stockholders equity-minus-cash) was 2 percent at December 31, 2011, compared to 16 percent at June 30, 2011, when we became a stand-alone company. Our debt-to-total capital ratio (total debt to total debt-plus-stockholders equity) was 26 percent at December 31, 2011, compared to 27 percent at June 30, 2011. (In millions) December 31, 2011 June 30, 2011 Long-term debt due within one year $ 15 $ 12 Long-term debt 3,292 3,262 Total debt $ 3,307 $ 3,274 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,079 $ 1,622 Stockholders equity 9,505 8,977 Calculation of cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio: Total debt $ 3,307 $ 3,274 Minus cash 3,079 1,622 Total debt minus cash $ 228 $ 1,652 Total debt $ 3,307 $ 3,274 Plus stockholders equity 9,505 8,977 Minus cash 3,079 1,622 Total debt plus stockholders equity minus cash $ 9,733 $ 10,629 Cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio 2% 16% Calculation of debt-to-total capital ratio: Total debt $ 3,307 $ 3,274 Plus stockholders equity 9,505 8,977 Total debt plus stockholders equity $ 12,812 $ 12,251 Debt-to-total capital ratio 26% 27% Capital Requirements We have a capital and investment budget of $1.42 billion, excluding capitalized interest, for 2012. Additional details related to the 2012 capital and investment budget are discussed in the Outlook section below. We plan to make contributions of approximately $240 million to our funded pension plans in 2012. Dividends of 45 cents per share or $160 million were paid in 2011. On February 1, 2012, our board of directors approved a 25 cents per share dividend, payable March 12, 2012 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 16, 2012. On February 1, 2012, we announced that our board of directors authorized a share repurchase plan, enabling us to purchase up to $2.0 billion of MPC common stock over a two-year period. We may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market purchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated share repurchases ( ASR ) or open market solicitations for shares. On February 3, 2012, we entered into an $850 million ASR program with a major financial institution as part of this authorization. The total number of shares to be repurchased will be based generally on the volume-weighted average price of MPC common stock during the repurchase period, subject to provisions that set a minimum and maximum number of shares. Under the ASR, we received 9.986 million shares of MPC common stock on February 3, 2012 and expect to receive a majority of the additional shares by the end of the first quarter of 2012. As received, shares will be reflected in our treasury stock component of stockholders equity in the first quarter of 2012. The remaining shares under the ASR will be 58 Table of Contents delivered to us over the term of the transaction, with all shares to be delivered by the end of the third quarter of 2012. The timing of repurchases, if any, outside of the ASR will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time. The above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to the share repurchase authorization. Factors that could affect the share repurchase program and its timing include, but are not limited to business conditions, availability of liquidity, and the market price of our common stock. Contractual Cash Obligations The table below provides aggregated information on our consolidated obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of December 31, 2011. (In millions) Total 2012 2013-2014 2015-2016 Later Years Long-term debt (excludes interest) (a) $ 3,000 $ - $ - $ 750 $ 2,250 Capital lease obligations 576 34 88 88 366 Operating lease obligations 663 141 247 174 101 Purchase obligations: Crude oil, feedstock, refined product and ethanol contracts (b) 9,906 8,538 795 383 190 Transportation and related contracts 624 129 130 100 265 Contracts to acquire property, plant and equipment (c) 347 326 21 - - Service and materials contracts (d) 1,304 261 345 244 454 Total purchase obligations 12,181 9,254 1,291 727 909 Other long-term liabilities reported in the consolidated balance sheet (e) 1,549 284 346 340 579 Total contractual cash obligations $ 17,969 $ 9,713 $ 1,972 $ 2,079 $ 4,205 (a) We anticipate cash payments for interest of $159 million for 2012, $318 million for 2013-2014, $304 million for 2015-2016 and $2.22 billion for later years for a total of $3.00 billion. (b) These contracts include variable price arrangements. (c) Includes obligations to advance funds to equity method investees. (d) Includes contracts to purchase services such as utilities, supplies and various other maintenance and operating services. (e) Primarily includes obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits including medical and life insurance, which we have estimated through 2021. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 20. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under 59 Table of Contents accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Although off-balance sheet arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on these arrangements to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources. We have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees. In conjunction with the Spinoff, we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to Marathon Oil. These arrangements are described in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 23. Outlook We have a capital and investment budget of $1.42 billion, excluding capitalized interest, for 2012. This represents about a 17 percent increase from our 2011 spending. The primary focus of the 2012 budget is continuation of the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project, which is expected to complete construction in the third quarter of 2012 with full integration into the refinery by year-end 2012. The budget also includes increased spending on transportation, logistics and marketing projects as well as amounts designated for corporate activities. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant. Refining & Marketing The 2012 capital budget includes $745 million for Refining & Marketing segment projects, with approximately $350 million representing continued spending on the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project. When completed, this project will increase the refinery heavy oil upgrading capacity, including Canadian bitumen blends, by about 80 mbpd, and will increase its total crude oil refining capacity by approximately 15 mbpd. The remainder of the budget is primarily allocated to maintaining facilities and meeting regulatory requirements. Speedway The 2012 capital budget includes $353 million for our Speedway segment, relating to new construction and acquisitions to expand our markets and remodeling and rebuilding projects for existing convenience stores to upgrade and enhance our existing facilities. Also included in the capital budget are expenditures for dispenser, equipment and technology upgrades. The Speedway segment capital budget includes funding to acquire 88 convenience stores situated throughout Indiana and Ohio from GasAmerica Services Inc. ( GasAmerica ), plus several parcels of undeveloped real estate for future development. The GasAmerica transaction is anticipated to close by the end of May 2012, subject to receipt of regulatory approvals, customary due diligence and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. Pipeline Transportation The 2012 capital budget includes $230 million for our Pipeline Transportation segment, relating primarily to upgrades to replace or enhance our existing facilities and projects for new infrastructure. Included in new infrastructure is $20 million, which will be used to construct a new section of pipeline to connect an existing pipeline to our Detroit refinery. This connection will allow us to deliver additional supplies of Canadian crude to that refinery. Corporate and Other The remaining 2012 capital budget includes $91 million related to corporate activities. In addition, we expect to record $116 million in capitalized interest, primarily associated with the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project. 60 Table of Contents Midstream Asset Evaluation On February 1, 2012, we announced that we are evaluating strategic alternatives with respect to certain of our midstream assets, including, but not limited to, the possible formation and initial public offering of an MLP. Midstream assets are generally considered those involved in transportation, storage and logistics operations. If we determine to further pursue an initial public offering of an MLP, we would not expect to file a registration statement before the end of the second quarter of 2012. The above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to our midstream asset evaluation. There can be no assurance that this evaluation will lead to an initial public offering of an MLP or any other transaction, or that if any transaction is further pursued, that it will be consummated. Some of the factors that could affect the midstream asset evaluation and the outcome of such evaluation include risks relating to securities markets generally, the impact of adverse market conditions affecting our midstream business, adverse changes in laws including with respect to tax and regulatory matters and other risks. Our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors, including cash provided by operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. The discussion of liquidity and capital resources above also contains forward-looking statements regarding expected capital and investment spending. The forward-looking statements about our capital and investment budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for crude oil and refinery feedstocks, natural gas and refined products, actions of competitors, delays in obtaining necessary third-party approvals, disruptions or interruptions of our refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations. Transactions with Related Parties Following completion of the Spinoff on June 30, 2011, Marathon Oil retained no ownership interest in us and is no longer a related party. Purchases of crude oil and natural gas from Marathon Oil accounted for five percent or less of our total cost of revenues and purchases from related parties for the periods prior to the Spinoff. Related party purchases of crude oil and natural gas from Marathon Oil were at market-based contract prices. The crude oil prices were based on indices that represented market value for time and place of delivery and that were also used in third-party contracts. The natural gas prices equaled the price at which Marathon Oil purchased the natural gas from third parties plus the cost of transportation. We believe that transactions with related parties, other than certain transactions with Marathon Oil to effect the Spinoff and related to the provision of administrative services, were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties. On May 25, 2011, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and several other agreements with Marathon Oil to effect the Spinoff and to provide a framework for our relationship with Marathon Oil. Because 61 Table of Contents the terms of our separation from Marathon Oil and these agreements were entered into in the context of a related-party transaction, the terms may not be comparable to terms that would be obtained in a transaction between unaffiliated parties. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 for further discussion of activity with related parties. Environmental Matters and Compliance Costs We have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products. Legislation and regulations pertaining to fuel specifications, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including costs of compliance and permitting delays. The extent and magnitude of these adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific regulatory and legislative requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists with respect to the measures being considered, the costs and the time frames for compliance, and our ability to pass compliance costs on to our customers. For additional information see Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our environmental expenditures, based on the American Petroleum Institute definition of environmental expenditures, for each of the last three years were: (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Capital $ 167 $ 223 $ 308 Compliance: Operating and maintenance 354 403 350 Remediation (a) 27 20 27 Total $ 548 $ 646 $ 685 (a) These amounts include spending charged against remediation reserves, where permissible, but exclude non-cash provisions recorded for environmental remediation. We accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. As environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required. New or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future. We believe we comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation or regulations, it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed. Our environmental capital expenditures accounted for 13 percent of capital expenditures in 2011, 19 percent of capital expenditures in 2010 and 12 percent in 2009. Our environmental capital expenditures are expected to approximate $64 million, or 5 percent, of total capital expenditures in 2012. Predictions beyond 2012 can only be broad-based estimates, which have varied, and will continue to vary, due to the ongoing evolution of specific 62 Table of Contents regulatory requirements, the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies, among other matters. Based on currently identified projects, we anticipate that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately $64 million in 2013; however, actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed. We have spent $620 million from 2008 through December 31, 2011 to comply with MSAT II regulations relating to benzene content in refined products. We have finalized our strategic approach to comply with MSAT II regulations and all MSAT II compliance units were in operation as of December 31, 2011. For more information on environmental regulations that impact us, or could impact us, see Item 1. Business Environmental Matters, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( US GAAP ) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. Fair Value Estimates Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach, each of which includes multiple valuation techniques. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset. This is often referred to as current replacement cost. The cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence. The fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and does not prioritize among the techniques. These standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques. Inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions, including assumptions about risk. Level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while Level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: Level 1 Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. 63 Table of Contents Level 2 Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. These are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management best estimate of fair value. Valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy. We use a market or income approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to use the best information available. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16 for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements. Significant uses of fair value measurements include: assessment of impairment of long-lived assets; assessment of impairment of goodwill; assessment of impairment of equity method investments; recorded value of derivative instruments; and recorded value of investments in debt and equity securities. Impairment Assessments of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Equity Method Investments Fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our long-lived assets, goodwill and equity method investments for impairment is estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate. Significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted assumptions. Significant assumptions include: Future margins on products produced and sold . Our estimates of future product margins are based on our analysis of various supply and demand factors, which include, among other things, industry-wide capacity, our planned utilization rate, end-user demand, capital expenditures and economic conditions. Such estimates are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews. Future volumes. Our estimates of future pipeline throughput volumes are based on internal forecasts prepared by our Pipeline Transportation segment operations personnel. Discount rate commensurate with the risks involved . We apply a discount rate to our cash flows based on a variety of factors, including market and economic conditions, operational risk, regulatory risk and political risk. This discount rate is also compared to recent observable market transactions, if possible. A higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows. Future capital requirements . These are based on authorized spending and internal forecasts. We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable. However, actual results may differ from these projections. The need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators, including a significant reduction in prices of or demand for products produced, a poor outlook for profitability, a significant reduction in pipeline throughput volumes, significant reduction in refining margins, other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment in which the asset or equity method investment is located. 64 Table of Contents Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. For purposes of impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which generally is the refinery and associated distribution system level for Refining & Marketing segment assets, site level for Speedway segment convenience stores or the pipeline system level for Pipeline Transportation segment assets. If the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group, fair value is calculated, and the carrying value is written down if greater than the calculated fair value. Unlike long-lived assets, goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually, or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. At December 31, 2011 we had a total of $842 million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of our reporting units exceeded book value appreciably for each of our reporting units in 2011. Equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary loss in value. Factors providing evidence of such a loss include the fair value of an investment that is less than its carrying value, absence of an ability to recover the carrying value or the investee inability to generate income sufficient to justify our carrying value. At December 31, 2011 we had $302 million of investments in equity method investments recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. An estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions (e.g., pricing, volumes and discount rates) that can materially affect our estimates. That is, unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions. Derivatives We record all derivative instruments at fair value. A large volume of our commodity derivatives are exchange-traded and require few assumptions in arriving at fair value. Fair value estimation for all our derivative instruments is discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16. Additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Investments in Debt and Equity Securities We record all of our investments in debt and equity securities at fair value. Our investments in related party debt securities were redeemable on any business day at a stated price which had been determined to approximate fair value. Our investments in other equity securities are exchange-traded, and fair value is determined from quoted market prices. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following: the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; the expected long-term return on plan assets; the rate of future increases in compensation levels; and health care cost projections. We develop our demographics and utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. We have selected different discount rates for our funded pension plans and our unfunded retiree health care plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns. The selected rates are compared to 65 Table of Contents various similar bond indexes for reasonableness. In determining the assumed discount rates, we use our third-party actuary discount rate model. This model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a yield curve derived from Aa bond yields. The yield curve represents a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 0.5 to 99 years. The bonds used are rated Aa or higher by a recognized rating agency and only non-callable bonds are included. Outlier bonds that have a yield to maturity that deviate significantly from the average yield within each maturity grouping are not included. Each issue is required to have at least $250 million par value outstanding. Of the assumptions used to measure the year-end obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. Decreasing the discount rates of 4.30 percent for our pension plans and 4.65 percent for our other postretirement benefit plans by 0.25 would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by $131 million and $21 million, respectively, and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by $11 million and $1 million, respectively. The asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans (currently targeted at approximately 75 percent equity securities and 25 percent fixed income securities for the funded pension plans), past performance and other factors. Certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation and returns. Our long term asset rate of return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to historical returns for reasonableness. After evaluating activity in the capital markets, we reduced the asset rate of return from 8.50 percent to 7.50 percent effective for 2012 defined benefit pension expense. Decreasing the 7.50 percent asset rate of return assumption by 0.25 would increase our defined benefit pension expense by $4 million. Compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans. Health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 20 includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our annual defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense, as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive loss reported on the year-end balance sheets. Contingent Liabilities We accrue contingent liabilities for legal actions, claims, litigation, environmental remediation, tax deficiencies related to operating taxes and third party indemnities for specified tax matters when such contingencies are both probable and estimable. We regularly assess these estimates in consultation with legal counsel to consider resolved and new matters, material developments in court proceedings or settlement discussions, new information obtained as a result of ongoing discovery and past experience in defending and settling similar matters. Actual costs can differ from estimates for many reasons. For instance, settlement costs for claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on degree of responsibility and assessments of the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation may vary from estimates because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation; additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination; and improvements in technology. We generally record losses related to these types of contingencies as cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income, except for tax deficiencies unrelated to income taxes, which are recorded as other taxes. For additional information on contingent liabilities, see Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters and Compliance Costs. 66 Table of Contents An estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, in terms of both the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an accounting standards update that requires disclosure of additional information related to recognized financial and derivative instruments that are offset or are not offset but are subject to an enforceable netting agreement. The purpose of the requirement is to help users evaluate the effect or potential effect of offsetting and related netting arrangements on an entity financial position. The update is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for annual periods that begin on or after January 1, 2013 and interim periods within those annual periods. Adoption of this update will not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In September 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standards update giving an entity the option to use a qualitative assessment to determine whether or not the entity is required to perform the two step goodwill impairment test. If, through a qualitative assessment, an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, the entity is not required to perform the two step goodwill impairment test. The amendments in the update are effective for annual and interim goodwill testing performed in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this accounting standards update will not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In May 2011, the FASB issued an update amending the accounting standards for fair value measurement and disclosure, resulting in common principles and requirements under US GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ). The amendments change the wording used to describe certain of the US GAAP requirements either to clarify the intent of existing requirements, to change measurement or expand disclosure principles or to conform to the wording used in IFRS. The amendments are to be applied prospectively and will be effective in interim and annual periods beginning with the first quarter of 2012 for us. Early application is not permitted. We do not expect adoption of these amendments to have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 67 Table of Contents
