Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in combination with our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 herein. OVERVIEW Background We are a public utility holding company whose indirect wholly owned subsidiaries include: CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC (CenterPoint Houston), which engages in the electric transmission and distribution business in a 5,000-square mile area of the Texas Gulf Coast that includes the city of Houston; and CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. (CERC Corp. and, together with its subsidiaries, CERC), which owns and operates natural gas distribution systems in six states. Subsidiaries of CERC Corp. own interstate natural gas pipelines and gas gathering systems and provide various ancillary services. A wholly owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. offers variable and fixed-price physical natural gas supplies primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities. Business Segments In this Management Discussion and Analysis, we discuss our results from continuing operations on a consolidated basis and individually for each of our business segments. We also discuss our liquidity, capital resources and certain critical accounting policies. We are first and foremost an energy delivery company and it is our intention to remain focused on this segment of the energy business. The results of our business operations are significantly impacted by weather, customer growth, economic conditions, cost management, rate proceedings before regulatory agencies and other actions of the various regulatory agencies to whose jurisdiction we are subject. Our electric transmission and distribution services are subject to rate regulation and are reported in the Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment, as are impacts of generation-related stranded costs and other true-up balances recoverable by the regulated electric utility. Our natural gas distribution services are also subject to rate regulation and are reported in the Natural Gas Distribution business segment. A summary of our reportable business segments as of December 31, 2011 is set forth below: Electric Transmission & Distribution Our electric transmission and distribution operations provide electric transmission and distribution services to retail electric providers (REPs) serving over two million metered customers in a 5,000-square-mile area of the Texas Gulf Coast that has a population of approximately six million people and includes the city of Houston. On behalf of REPs, CenterPoint Houston delivers electricity from power plants to substations, from one substation to another and to retail electric customers in locations throughout CenterPoint Houston certificated service territory. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (ERCOT) serves as the regional reliability coordinating council for member electric power systems in Texas. ERCOT membership is open to consumer groups, investor and municipally-owned electric utilities, rural electric cooperatives, independent generators, power marketers, river authorities and REPs. The ERCOT market represents approximately 85% of the demand for power in Texas and is one of the nation largest power markets. Transmission and distribution services are provided under tariffs approved by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (Texas Utility Commission). Natural Gas Distribution CERC owns and operates our regulated natural gas distribution business (Gas Operations), which engages in intrastate natural gas sales to, and natural gas transportation for, approximately 3.3 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas. Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services CERC operations also include non-rate regulated natural gas sales to, and transportation services for, commercial and industrial customers in 21 states in the central and eastern regions of the United States. 29 Interstate Pipelines CERC interstate pipelines business owns and operates approximately 8,000 miles of natural gas transmission lines primarily located in Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. It also owns and operates six natural gas storage fields with a combined daily deliverability of approximately 1.3 billion cubic feet (Bcf) and a combined working gas capacity of approximately 59 Bcf. It owns a 50% interest in Southeast Supply Header, LLC (SESH). SESH owns a 1.0 Bcf per day, 274-mile interstate pipeline that runs from the Perryville Hub in Louisiana to Coden, Alabama. Most storage operations are in north Louisiana and Oklahoma. Field Services CERC field services business owns and operates approximately 3,900 miles of gathering pipelines and processing plants that collect, treat and process natural gas primarily from three regions located in major producing fields in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. It also owns a 50% general partnership interest in Waskom Gas Processing Company (Waskom). Waskom owns a natural gas processing plant and natural gas gathering assets located in East Texas. Waskom's plant is capable of processing approximately 320 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of natural gas, and its gathering assets are capable of gathering approximately 75 MMcf per day of natural gas. Other Operations Our other operations business segment includes office buildings and other real estate used in our business operations and other corporate operations which support all of our business operations. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Factors Influencing Our Business We are an energy delivery company. The majority of our revenues are generated from the gathering, processing, transportation and sale of natural gas and the transportation and delivery of electricity by our subsidiaries. We do not own or operate electric generating facilities or make retail sales to end-use electric customers. To assess our financial performance, our management primarily monitors operating income and cash flows from our business segments. Within these broader financial measures, we monitor margins, operation and maintenance expense, interest expense, capital spending and working capital requirements. In addition to these financial measures we also monitor a number of variables that management considers important to the operation of our business segments, including the number of customers, throughput, use per customer, commodity prices and heating and cooling degree days. We also monitor system reliability, safety factors and customer satisfaction to gauge our performance. To the extent adverse economic conditions affect our suppliers and customers, results from our energy delivery businesses may suffer. Reduced demand and lower energy prices could lead to financial pressure on some of our customers who operate within the energy industry. Also, adverse economic conditions, coupled with concerns for protecting the environment, may cause consumers to use less energy or avoid expansions of their facilities, resulting in less demand for our services. Performance of our Electric Transmission & Distribution and Natural Gas Distribution business segments is significantly influenced by the number of customers and energy usage per customer. Weather conditions can have a significant impact on energy usage, and we compare our results on a weather adjusted basis. The Houston area experienced extremely hot and dry weather during 2011, and each month from April through September was one of the ten warmest months on record. In recent years, we have seen evidence that customers are seeking to reduce their energy consumption. Reduced consumption can adversely affect our results. However, due to a stabilization of energy prices and continued economic recovery in the areas we serve, the trend toward lower usage has slowed somewhat. In addition, in many of our service areas, particularly in the Houston area and in Minnesota, we have benefited from growth in the number of customers that also tends to mitigate the effects of reduced consumption. We anticipate that this growth will continue as the regions experience a continued economic recovery. The profitability of our businesses is influenced significantly by the regulatory treatment we receive from the various state and local regulators who set our electric and gas distribution rates. In recent rate filings, we have sought rate mechanisms that help to decouple our results from the impacts of weather and conservation, but such rate mechanisms have not yet been approved in all jurisdictions. We plan to continue to pursue such decoupling mechanisms in our rate filings. Our Field Services and Interstate Pipelines business segments are currently benefiting from their proximity to new natural gas producing regions in Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. Our Interstate Pipelines business segment benefited from new projects placed into service in 2009 on our Carthage to Perryville line, including a backhaul agreement that expired in 2011. In our Field Services business segment, the development of shale formations has helped offset declines in production from more 30 traditional basins. The recent decline in natural gas prices has contributed to reductions in drilling activity in dry gas shale formations as well, including those served by our Field Services business segment. Many producers have shifted their focus to liquids-rich natural gas or crude oil basins. A reduction in drilling activity may result in lower throughput volumes on our systems as the wells decline over time. However, a significant amount of the volumes gathered by systems we recently developed in shale basins such as the Haynesville and Fayetteville shales are supported by contracts with annual volume commitments, or price adjustment mechanisms that provide for minimum returns on capital deployed. In monitoring performance of the segments, we focus on throughput of the pipelines and gathering systems, and in the case of Field Services, on well-connects. Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment contracts with customers for transportation, storage and sales of natural gas on an unregulated basis. Its operations serve customers in the central and eastern regions of the United States. The segment benefits from favorable price differentials, either on a geographic basis or on a seasonal basis. While it utilizes financial derivatives to hedge its exposure to price movements, it does not engage in speculative or proprietary trading and maintains a low value at risk level, or VaR, to avoid significant financial exposures. Lower geographic and seasonal price differentials during 2010 and 2011 adversely affected results for this business segment. The nature of our businesses requires significant amounts of capital investment, and we rely on internally generated cash, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from commercial paper and issuances of debt and equity in the capital markets to satisfy these capital needs. We strive to maintain investment grade ratings for our securities in order to access the capital markets on terms we consider reasonable. Our goal is to improve our credit ratings over time. A reduction in our ratings generally would increase our borrowing costs for new issuances of debt, as well as borrowing costs under our existing revolving credit facilities, and may prevent us from accessing the commercial paper markets. Disruptions in the financial markets, such as occurred in the last half of 2008 and continued during 2009, can also affect the availability of new capital on terms we consider attractive. In those circumstances, companies like us may not be able to obtain certain types of external financing or may be required to accept terms less favorable than they would otherwise accept. For that reason, we seek to maintain adequate liquidity for our businesses through existing credit facilities and prudent refinancing of existing debt. As it did with many businesses, the sharp decline in stock market values during the latter part of 2008 had a significant adverse impact on the value of our pension plan assets. While that impact did not require us to make additional contributions to the pension plan, it significantly increased the pension expense we recognized during 2009. We expect to make a minimum required contribution to our pension plan of $116 million in 2012 and may need to make larger contributions in subsequent years. Consistent with the regulatory treatment of such costs, we can defer the amount of pension expense that differs from the level of pension expense included in our base rates for our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment. Legislation effective in September 2011 allows a gas utility in Texas to defer until the utility's next rate case the difference between what is currently being included in its rates and the amount determined actuarially for pension and post-employment benefits. Significant Events Resolution of True-Up Appeal In March 2004, CenterPoint Houston filed a true-up application with the Texas Utility Commission requesting recovery of associated costs of $3.7 billion, excluding interest, as allowed under the Texas Electric Choice Plan. In December 2004, the Texas Utility Commission issued its final order (True-Up Order) allowing CenterPoint Houston to recover a true-up balance of approximately $2.3 billion, which included interest through August 31, 2004, and provided for adjustment of the amount to be recovered to include interest on the balance until recovery, along with the principal portion of additional excess mitigation credits returned to customers after August 31, 2004 and certain other adjustments. To reflect the impact of the True-Up Order, in 2004 and 2005, we recorded a net after-tax extraordinary loss of $947 million. Various parties, including CenterPoint Houston, appealed the True-Up Order. These appeals were heard first by a district court in Travis County, Texas, then by the Texas Third Court of Appeals and finally by the Texas Supreme Court. In March 2011, the Texas Supreme Court issued a unanimous ruling on such appeals in which it affirmed in part and reversed in part the decision of the Texas Utility Commission. In June 2011, the Texas Supreme Court issued a final mandate remanding the case to the Texas Utility Commission for further proceedings (the Remand Proceeding). In September 2011, CenterPoint Houston reached an agreement in principle with the staff of the Texas Utility Commission and certain intervenors to settle the issues in the Remand Proceeding (the Settlement). In October 2011, the Texas Utility Commission approved a final order (the Final Order) in the Remand Proceeding consistent with the Settlement. The Final Order provided that (i) CenterPoint Houston was entitled to recover an additional true-up balance of $1.695 billion (the Recoverable True-Up Balance) in the Remand Proceeding, (ii) no further interest would accrue on the Recoverable True-Up Balance, and (iii) CenterPoint Houston would reimburse certain parties for their reasonable rate case expenses. 31 In October 2011, the Texas Utility Commission also issued a financing order (the Financing Order) that authorized the issuance of transition bonds by CenterPoint Houston to securitize the Recoverable True-Up Balance. In January 2012, CenterPoint Energy Transition Bond Company IV, LLC (Bond Company IV), a new special purpose subsidiary of CenterPoint Houston, issued $1.695 billion of transition bonds in three tranches with interest rates ranging from 0.9012% to 3.0282% and final maturity dates ranging from April 15, 2018 to October 15, 2025. Through the issuance of these transition bonds, CenterPoint Houston recovered the Recoverable True-Up Balance, less approximately $10.4 million of offering expenses. The transition bonds will be repaid over time through a charge imposed on customers in CenterPoint Houston's service territory. As a result of the Final Order, CenterPoint Houston recorded a pre-tax extraordinary gain of $921 million ($587 million after- tax) and $352 million ($224 million after-tax) of Other Income related to a portion of interest on the appealed amount. An additional $405 million ($258 million after-tax) will be recorded as an equity return over the life of the transition bonds. Magnolia and Olympia Gathering Systems In September 2009, CenterPoint Energy Field Services, LLC (CEFS) entered into long-term agreements with an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Encana Corporation (Encana) and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell plc (Shell) to provide gathering and treating services for their natural gas production from certain Haynesville Shale and Bossier Shale formations in Louisiana. Pursuant to these agreements, CEFS acquired from Encana and Shell and expanded jointly-owned gathering facilities (the Magnolia Gathering System) in northwest Louisiana. The Magnolia Gathering System was initially expanded to gather and treat up to 700 MMcf per day of natural gas. Pursuant to an expansion election made by Encana and Shell, CEFS completed an expansion of the Magnolia Gathering System in February 2011 that increased the aggregate gathering and treating capacity of the system to 900 MMcf per day. In April 2010, CEFS entered into additional long-term agreements with an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Encana and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Shell to provide gathering and treating services for their natural gas production from certain Haynesville Shale and Bossier Shale formations in Texas and Louisiana. Pursuant to these agreements, CEFS acquired jointly-owned gathering facilities (the Olympia Gathering System) from Encana and Shell in northwest Louisiana. Under the terms of the agreements, CEFS agreed to expand the Olympia Gathering System in order to permit the system to gather and treat up to 600 MMcf per day of natural gas. During the fourth quarter of 2011, CEFS substantially completed the construction of the Olympia Gathering System at a cost of approximately $406 million, including the purchase of the original facilities. CEFS is in the second year of the 10-year volume commitment of 600 MMcf per day provided for under the long-term agreements. Under the long-term agreements, Encana and Shell may elect to require CEFS to expand the capacity of the Olympia Gathering System by up to an additional 520 MMcf per day, bringing the total system capacity to approximately 1.1 Bcf per day. CEFS estimates that the cost to expand the capacity of the Olympia Gathering System by an additional 520 MMcf per day would be as much as $200 million. Encana and Shell would provide incremental volume commitments in connection with an election to expand the system's capacity. As of December 31, 2011, the combined contracted capacity of the Magnolia and Olympia gathering systems was 1.5 Bcf per day. CenterPoint Energy - Mississippi River Transmission LLC Rate Settlement Proceeding In an effort to avoid the expense of a rate case, CenterPoint Energy-Mississippi River Transmission, LLC (MRT) initiated a settlement process with its customers. Should these discussions fail, MRT will consider filing for a general rate increase later in 2012. MRT will attempt to reach a mutually agreeable rate solution with its customers to recover its increased costs to maintain a safe and reliable system, but there can be no assurance that it will be successful and will avoid the initiation of a rate case. Advanced Metering System and Distribution Grid Automation (Intelligent Grid) In October 2009, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) selected CenterPoint Houston for a $200 million grant to help fund its advanced metering system (AMS) and intelligent grid (IG) projects. As of December 31, 2011 , CenterPoint Houston had received substantially all of the $200 million of grant funding from the DOE. CenterPoint Houston has used $150 million of the grant funding to accelerate completion of its deployment of advanced meters to 2012, instead of 2014 as originally scheduled. CenterPoint Houston estimates that capital expenditures of approximately $645 million for the installation of the advanced meters 32 and corresponding communication and data management systems will be incurred over the advanced meter deployment period, of which approximately $590 million had been spent as of December 31, 2011. CenterPoint Houston is using the other $50 million from the grant for an initial deployment of an IG in a portion of its service territory. This initial deployment is expected to be completed in 2013. It is expected that the portion of the IG project subject to partial funding by the DOE will cost approximately $115 million. The IG is expected to result in fewer and shorter outages, better customer service, improved operation costs, improved security and more effective use of CenterPoint Houston's workforce. In March 2010, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced through the issuance of Revenue Procedure 2010-20 that it was providing a safe harbor to corporations that receive a Smart Grid Investment Grant. The IRS stated that it would not challenge a corporation treatment of the grant as a non-taxable non-shareholder contribution to capital as long as the corporation properly reduced the tax basis of specified property. CenterPoint Houston Rate Case As required under the final order in its 2006 rate proceeding, in June 2010 CenterPoint Houston filed an application to change rates with the Texas Utility Commission and the cities in its service area. Following hearings in the fall of 2010, the Texas Utility Commission issued its order in May 2011. In response to motions filed by several parties, including CenterPoint Houston, in June 2011, the Texas Utility Commission issued an order on rehearing, which addressed certain errors and inconsistencies identified in its prior decision. CenterPoint Houston implemented revised rates on September 1, 2011 based on the order on rehearing. The order on rehearing has been appealed to the Texas courts by various parties; however, a procedural schedule has not been established. The order on rehearing provides for a base rate increase for CenterPoint Houston of approximately $14.7 million per year for delivery charges to the REPs and a decrease to charges to wholesale transmission customers of $12.3 million per year. Further, the order adopts a mechanism to track amounts for uncertain tax positions and provide for ultimate recovery of those costs. The order authorizes a return on equity for CenterPoint Houston of 10%, a cost of debt of 6.74%, a capital structure comprised of 55% debt and 45% common equity, and an overall rate of return of 8.21%. The decision also implements CenterPoint Houston request to reconcile costs incurred for the AMS project and to shorten the period for collecting the AMS surcharge from twelve to six years for residential customers in order to reflect the funds received from the DOE. As part of the process to reconcile AMS costs, $138 million of the capital investment (net of related deferred taxes) used to determine the AMS surcharge was transferred to CenterPoint Houston's rate base and used in calculating delivery rates. As a result of the Texas Utility Commission order, CenterPoint Houston anticipates that 2012 operating income will be reduced by approximately $35 million compared to 2011 performance. Debt Financing Transactions In January 2011, CERC Corp. issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2021 with an interest rate of 4.50% and $300 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2041 with an interest rate of 5.85%. The proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used for the repayment of $550 million of CERC Corp. 7.75% senior notes at their maturity in February 2011. Also in January 2011, CERC Corp. issued an additional $343 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50% senior notes due 2021 and provided cash consideration of $114 million in exchange for $397 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.875% senior notes due 2013. The premium of $58 million paid on exchanged notes has been deferred and will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the 4.50% senior notes due 2021. In February 2012, we purchased $275 million aggregate principal amount of pollution control bonds issued on our behalf at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued interest pursuant to the mandatory tender provisions of the bonds. The purchased pollution control bonds will remain outstanding and may be remarketed. Prior to the purchase, the pollution control bonds had fixed interest rates ranging from 5.15% to 5.95%. Additionally, in February 2012, we called for a March 2012 redemption of $100 million aggregate principal amount of pollution control bonds issued on our behalf at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued interest pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of the bonds. The pollution control bonds called for redemption have a fixed interest rate of 5.25%. Financial Reform Legislation On July 21, 2010, the President signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), which makes substantial changes to regulatory oversight regarding banks and financial institutions. Many provisions of Dodd-Frank will also affect non-financial businesses such as those conducted by us and our subsidiaries. It is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate impacts this legislation may have on us and our subsidiaries since most of the provisions in the law 33 require extensive rulemaking by various regulatory agencies and authorities, including, among others, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Nevertheless, in a number of areas, the resulting rules are expected to have direct or indirect impacts on our businesses. Dodd-Frank provisions will increase required disclosures regarding executive compensation, and rules adopted by the SEC in January 2011 required advisory votes at our annual meetings by shareholders on executive compensation (say-on-pay) and on the frequency that such say-on-pay votes will be submitted in future years. New rules adopted by the SEC were intended to provide shareholders with access to the director nomination process, but those rules were vacated on procedural grounds by a federal appellate court in response to legal challenges. Although Dodd-Frank includes significant new provisions regarding the regulation of derivatives, the impact of those requirements will not be known definitively until regulations have been adopted by the SEC and the CFTC. The SEC and certain federal banking agencies are charged with adopting new regulations regarding asset-backed securities transactions such as the asset-backed securitizations CenterPoint Houston has sponsored for recovery of transition and storm restoration costs. The new regulations will include rules to implement the Dodd-Frank requirement that securitization sponsors retain a portion of the credit risk of asset-backed securities sold to third parties. Although our securitization of the $1.695 billion Recoverable True-Up Balance was completed while the new risk retention rules were not yet in effect, future securitization transactions may be subject to these rules. Dodd-Frank also makes substantial changes to the regulatory oversight of the credit rating agencies that are typically engaged to rate our securities and those of our subsidiaries. It is presently unknown what effect implementation of these new provisions ultimately will have on the activities or costs associated with the credit rating process. CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE EARNINGS Our past earnings and results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future earnings and results of operations. The magnitude of our future earnings and results of our operations will depend on or be affected by numerous factors including: state and federal legislative and regulatory actions or developments affecting various aspects of our business, including, among others, energy deregulation or re-regulation, pipeline integrity and safety, health care reform, financial reform and tax legislation; state and federal legislative and regulatory actions or developments relating to the environment, including those related to global climate change; timely and appropriate rate actions and increases, allowing recovery of costs and a reasonable return on investment; the timing and outcome of any audits, disputes and other proceedings related to taxes; problems with construction, implementation of necessary technology or other issues with respect to major capital projects that result in delays or in cost overruns that cannot be recouped in rates; industrial, commercial and residential growth in our service territory and changes in market demand, including the effects of energy efficiency measures and demographic patterns; the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices, particularly natural gas and natural gas liquids, and the effects of geographic and seasonal commodity price differentials, including the effects of these circumstances on re-contracting available capacity on our interstate pipelines ; the timing and extent of changes in the supply of natural gas, including supplies available for gathering by our field services business and transporting by our interstate pipelines; competition in our mid-continent region footprint for access to natural gas supplies and to markets; weather variations and other natural phenomena; any direct or indirect effects on our facilities, operations and financial condition resulting from terrorism, cyber-attacks, data security breaches or other attempts to disrupt our businesses or the businesses of third parties, or other catastrophic events; the impact of unplanned facility outages; 34 timely and appropriate regulatory actions allowing securitization or other recovery of costs associated with any future hurricanes or natural disasters; changes in interest rates or rates of inflation; commercial bank and financial market conditions, our access to capital, the cost of such capital, and the results of our financing and refinancing efforts, including availability of funds in the debt capital markets; actions by credit rating agencies; effectiveness of our risk management activities; inability of various counterparties to meet their obligations to us; non-payment for our services due to financial distress of our customers; the ability of GenOn Energy, Inc. (GenOn) (formerly known as RRI Energy, Inc., Reliant Energy, Inc. and Reliant Resources, Inc. (RRI)) and its subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations to us, including indemnity obligations, or obligations in connection with the contractual arrangements pursuant to which we are their guarantor; the ability of REPs, including REP affiliates of NRG Energy, Inc. and REP affiliates of Energy Future Holdings Corp., which are CenterPoint Houston two largest customers, to satisfy their obligations to us and our subsidiaries; the outcome of litigation brought by or against us; our ability to control costs; the investment performance of our pension and postretirement benefit plans; our potential business strategies, including restructurings, acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses, which we cannot assure you will be completed or will have the anticipated benefits to us; acquisition and merger activities involving us or our competitors; and other factors we discuss under Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report and in other reports we file from time to time with the SEC. 35 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS All dollar amounts in the tables that follow are in millions, except for per share amounts. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2010 2011 Revenues $ 8,281 $ 8,785 $ 8,450 Expenses 7,157 7,536 7,152 Operating Income 1,124 1,249 1,298 Gain on Marketable Securities 82 67 19 Gain (Loss) on Indexed Debt Securities (68 ) (31 ) 35 Interest and Other Finance Charges (513 ) (481 ) (456 ) Interest on Transition and System Restoration Bonds (131 ) (140 ) (127 ) Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates 15 29 30 Return on True-Up Balance 352 Other Income, net 39 12 23 Income Before Income Taxes and Extraordinary Item 548 705 1,174 Income Tax Expense 176 263 404 Income Before Extraordinary Item 372 442 770 Extraordinary Item, net of tax 587 Net Income $ 372 $ 442 $ 1,357 Basic Earnings Per Share: Income Before Extraordinary Item $ 1.02 $ 1.08 $ 1.81 Extraordinary Item, net of tax 1.38 Net Income $ 1.02 $ 1.08 $ 3.19 Diluted Earnings Per Share: Income Before Extraordinary Item $ 1.01 $ 1.07 $ 1.80 Extraordinary Item, net of tax 1.37 Net Income $ 1.01 $ 1.07 $ 3.17 2011 Compared to 2010 Net Income. We reported net income of $1.357 billion ($3.17 per diluted share) for 2011 compared to $442 million ($1.07 per diluted share) for the same period in 2010. The increase in net income of $915 million was primarily due to the resolution of the true-up appeal resulting in an after-tax extraordinary gain of $587 million and a $352 million return on the true-up balance, a $66 million increase in the gain on our indexed debt securities, a $49 million increase in operating income and a $38 million decrease in interest expense due to lower levels of debt, which were partially offset by a $141 million increase in income tax expense and a $48 million decrease in the gain on our marketable securities. Income Tax Expense. We reported an effective tax rate of 34.4% for 2011 compared to 37.3% for the same period in 2010. The decrease in the effective tax rate of 2.9% is due to an $18 million reduction to the uncertain tax liability primarily related to the resolution of the tax normalization issue, a $21 million reduction to the deferred tax asset due to the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act recognized in 2010, a $24 million decrease to state tax expense due to the restructuring of certain subsidiaries in December 2010, and a $17 million state tax benefit primarily attributable to lower blended state tax rates and a reduction to the state deferred tax liability recorded in December 2011. 36 2010 Compared to 2009 Net Income. We reported net income of $442 million ($1.07 per diluted share) for 2010 compared to $372 million ($1.01 per diluted share) for the same period in 2009. The increase in net income of $70 million was primarily due to a $125 million increase in operating income, a $37 million decrease in the loss on our indexed debt securities, a $32 million decrease in interest expense due to lower levels of debt, excluding transition and system restoration bond-related interest expense, and a $14 million increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, which were partially offset by an $87 million increase in income tax expense, a $27 million decrease in Other Income, net, primarily due to the $23 million of carrying costs related to Hurricane Ike restoration costs in 2009, a $15 million decrease in the gain on our marketable securities and a $9 million increase in interest expense on transition and system restoration bonds. Income Tax Expense. Our 2010 effective tax rate of 37.3% differed from the 2009 effective tax rate of 32.1% primarily due to the settlement in 2009 of our federal income tax return examinations for tax years 2004 and 2005 and a reduction in state income taxes in 2009 related to adjustments in prior years state estimates. The 2010 effective tax rate included the effects of remeasuring accumulated deferred income taxes associated with the restructuring of certain subsidiaries in December 2010 (decrease in income tax expense of $24 million) as well as a change in tax law upon the enactment in March 2010 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the related Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (increase in income tax expense of $21 million). In combination, these 2010 events did not have a material impact on our 2010 effective tax rate. For more information, see Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT The following table presents operating income (in millions) for each of our business segments for 2009 , 2010 and 2011 . Included in revenues are intersegment sales. We account for intersegment sales as if the sales were to third parties, that is, at current market prices. Operating Income by Business Segment Year Ended December 31, 2009 2010 2011 Electric Transmission & Distribution $ 545 $ 567 $ 623 Natural Gas Distribution 204 231 226 Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services 21 16 6 Interstate Pipelines 256 270 248 Field Services 94 151 189 Other Operations 4 14 6 Total Consolidated Operating Income $ 1,124 $ 1,249 $ 1,298 37 Electric Transmission & Distribution The following tables provide summary data of our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment, CenterPoint Houston, for 2009 , 2010 and 2011 (in millions, except throughput and customer data): Year Ended December 31, 2009 2010 2011 Revenues: Electric transmission and distribution utility $ 1,673 $ 1,768 $ 1,893 Transition and system restoration bond companies 340 437 444 Total revenues 2,013 2,205 2,337 Expenses: Operation and maintenance, excluding transition and system restoration bond companies 774 841 908 Depreciation and amortization, excluding transition and system restoration bond companies 277 293 279 Taxes other than income taxes 208 207 210 Transition and system restoration bond companies 209 297 317 Total expenses 1,468 1,638 1,714 Operating Income $ 545 $ 567 $ 623 Operating Income: Electric transmission and distribution operations $ 414 $ 427 $ 496 Transition and system restoration bond companies (1) 131 140 127 Total segment operating income $ 545 $ 567 $ 623 Throughput (in gigawatt-hours (GWh)): Residential 24,815 26,554 28,511 Total 74,579 76,973 80,013 Number of metered customers at end of period: Residential 1,838,700 1,867,251 1,904,818 Total 2,076,464 2,110,608 2,155,710 ___________________ (1) Represents the amount necessary to pay interest on the transition and system restoration bonds. 2011 Compared to 2010. Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment reported operating income of $623 million for 2011, consisting of $496 million from our regulated electric transmission and distribution utility operations (TDU) and $127 million related to transition and system restoration bond companies. For 2010, operating income totaled $567 million, consisting of $427 million from the TDU and $140 million related to transition and system restoration bond companies. TDU operating income increased $69 million due to increased usage ($51 million), primarily due to favorable weather, customer growth ($22 million) from the addition of over 45,000 new customers, lower depreciation expense ($16 million) and higher transmission-related revenues net of the costs billed by transmission providers ($13 million), partially offset by the impact of the 2010 rate case implemented in September 2011 ($12 million) and other operating expense increases ($12 million). 2010 Compared to 2009. Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment reported operating income of $567 million for 2010, consisting of $427 million from our regulated electric transmission and distribution utility operations (TDU) and $140 million related to transition and system restoration bond companies. For 2009, operating income totaled $545 million, consisting of $414 million from the TDU and $131 million related to transition and system restoration bond companies. TDU revenues increased $95 million primarily due to increased revenues from implementation of AMS ($34 million), increased usage ($30 million), in part caused by favorable weather, higher transmission-related revenues ($26 million) and higher revenues due to customer growth ($20 million) from the addition of over 34,000 new customers, partially offset by a customer credit related to deferred income taxes associated with Hurricane Ike storm restoration costs ($21 million). Operation and maintenance expenses increased $67 million primarily due to higher transmission costs billed by transmission providers ($28 million), increased AMS project expenses ($11 million), increased labor costs ($10 million), increased contracts and services ($10 million) and increased 38 environmental remediation costs ($7 million). Increased depreciation expense is related to increased investment in AMS ($19 million). Natural Gas Distribution The following table provides summary data of our Natural Gas Distribution business segment for 2009 , 2010 and 2011 (in millions, except throughput and customer data): Year Ended December 31, 2009 2010 2011 Revenues $ 3,384 $ 3,213 $ 2,841 Expenses: Natural gas 2,251 2,049 1,675 Operation and maintenance 639 639 655 Depreciation and amortization 161 166 166 Taxes other than income taxes 129 128 119 Total expenses 3,180 2,982 2,615 Operating Income $ 204 $ 231 $ 226 Throughput (in Bcf): Residential 173 177 172 Commercial and industrial 233 249 251 Total Throughput 406 426 423 Number of customers at end of period: Residential 3,002,114 3,016,333 3,036,267 Commercial and industrial 244,101 246,891 246,220 Total 3,246,215 3,263,224 3,282,487 2011 Compared to 2010. Our Natural Gas Distribution business segment reported operating income of $226 million for 2011 compared to $231 million for 2010. Operating income decreased $5 million primarily as a result of higher benefit costs ($8 million), lower miscellaneous revenues ($7 million) and higher other expenses ($9 million). These were partially offset by the addition of 19,000 customers ($8 million), lower bad debt expense ($8 million) and rate increases ($7 million). Increased expense related to energy efficiency programs ($19 million) and decreased expense related to lower gross receipt taxes ($10 million) were offset by the related revenues. 2010 Compared to 2009. Our Natural Gas Distribution business segment reported operating income of $231 million for 2010 compared to $204 million for 2009. Operating income increased $27 million primarily as a result of revenue from base rate increases and annual rate adjustments ($24 million), lower pension and other benefits costs ($14 million), customer growth, higher throughput and increased other revenues ($8 million) and lower bad debt expense ($5 million). These were partially offset by higher labor costs ($7 million), higher contracts and services ($5 million) and increased other expenses ($7 million). Depreciation and amortization expense increased $5 million primarily due to higher plant balances. 39 Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services The following table provides summary data of our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment for 2009 , 2010 and 2011 (in millions, except throughput and customer data): Year Ended December 31, 2009 2010 2011 Revenues $ 2,230 $ 2,651 $ 2,511 Expenses: Natural gas 2,165 2,591 2,458 Operation and maintenance 39 38 41 Depreciation and amortization 4 4 5 Taxes other than income taxes 1 2 1 Total expenses 2,209 2,635 2,505 Operating Income $ 21 $ 16 $ 6 Throughput (in Bcf) 504 548 558 Number of customers at end of period (1) 11,168 12,193 14,267 ___________________ (1) These numbers do not include 13,354 natural gas customers as of December 31, 2011 that are under residential and small commercial choice programs invoiced by their host utility. 2011 Compared to 2010. Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment reported operating income of $6 million for 2011 compared to $16 million for 2010. The decrease in operating income of $10 million was primarily due to reduced basis spreads on pipeline transport opportunities and decreased seasonal storage spreads of $9 million in 2011, which included a $5 million charge related to an early capacity release on pipeline transportation, as compared to 2010. Additionally, an $11 million write-down of natural gas inventory to the lower of cost or market occurred in 2011 as compared to a $6 million write-down in 2010. Offsetting these decreases to operating income is an increase in operating income of $4 million related to the favorable impact of the mark-to-market valuation for non-trading financial derivatives for 2011 of $8 million versus the favorable impact of $4 million for 2010. 2010 Compared to 2009. Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment reported operating income of $16 million for 2010 compared to $21 million for 2009. The decrease in operating income of $5 million was primarily due to reduced basis spreads on pipeline transport opportunities and decreased seasonal storage spreads of $32 million in 2010 as compared to 2009. Offsetting this decrease to operating income is an increase in operating income of $27 million related to the favorable impact of the mark-to-market valuation for non-trading financial derivatives for 2010 of $4 million versus the unfavorable impact of $23 million for 2009. Additionally, a $6 million write-down of natural gas inventory to the lower of cost or market occurred in both 2009 and 2010. 40 Interstate Pipelines The following table provides summary data of our Interstate Pipelines business segment for 2009 , 2010 and 2011 (in millions, except throughput data): Year Ended December 31, 2009 2010 2011 Revenues $ 598 $ 601 $ 553 Expenses: Natural gas 97 93 67 Operation and maintenance 166 153 152 Depreciation and amortization 48 52 54 Taxes other than income taxes 31 33 32 Total expenses 342 331 305 Operating Income $ 256 $ 270 $ 248 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates $ 7 $ 19 $ 21 Transportation throughput (in Bcf) 1,592 1,693 1,579 2011 Compared to 2010. Our Interstate Pipeline business segment reported operating income of $248 million for 2011 compared to $270 million for 2010. Margins (revenues less natural gas costs) decreased by $22 million primarily due to the effects of the restructured 10-year agreement with our natural gas distribution affiliate ($11 million), lower off-system revenues ($11 million), and lower revenues on the Carthage to Perryville pipeline ($22 million) related to an expiring backhaul contract which was partially offset by new firm transportation contracts and higher ancillary revenues ($22 million). Lower operation and maintenance expenses ($1 million) and lower taxes other than income ($1 million) were offset by increased depreciation and amortization expenses ($2 million) related to new assets. 2010 Compared to 2009. Our Interstate Pipeline business segment reported operating income of $270 million for 2010 compared to $256 million for 2009. Margins (revenues less natural gas costs) increased by $7 million primarily due to new contracts for the Phase IV Carthage to Perryville pipeline expansion ($42 million) and new power plant transportation contracts ($4 million), partially offset by reduced ancillary services, off-system and other transportation margins ($39 million). Lower operation and maintenance expenses ($13 million) were partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expenses ($4 million) related to new assets and increased taxes other than income taxes ($2 million). Equity Earnings. In addition, this business segment recorded equity income of $7 million, $19 million and $21 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively, from its 50% interest in Southeast Supply Header, LLC (SESH), a jointly-owned pipeline. The 2009 results include a non-cash pre-tax charge of $16 million to reflect SESH's decision to discontinue the use of guidance for accounting for regulated operations, which was partially offset by the receipt of a one-time payment related to the construction of the pipeline and a reduction in estimated property taxes, of which our 50% share was $5 million. Excluding the effect of this adjustment, equity earnings from normal operations was $18 million in 2009. These amounts are included in Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates under the Other Income (Expense) caption in the Statements of Consolidated Income. 41 Field Services The following table provides summary data of our Field Services business segment for 2009 , 2010 and 2011 (in millions, except throughput data): Year Ended December 31, 2009 2010 2011 Revenues $ 241 $ 338 $ 412 Expenses: Natural gas 51 72 68 Operation and maintenance 77 85 112 Depreciation and amortization 15 25 37 Taxes other than income taxes 4 5 6 Total expenses 147 187 223 Operating Income $ 94 $ 151 $ 189 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates $ 8 $ 10 $ 9 Gathering throughput (in Bcf) 426 650 823 2011 Compared to 2010. Our Field Services business segment reported operating income of $189 million for 2011 compared to $151 million for 2010. Margins (revenues less natural gas costs) increased by $78 million primarily due to higher throughput from gathering projects in the Haynesville and Fayetteville shales and growth in core gathering services, including revenues from annual contracted volume commitments ($88 million), partially offset by lower commodity prices ($10 million) and reduced processing margins. Increases in operation and maintenance expenses ($6 million), depreciation expense ($12 million) and taxes other than income ($1 million) resulted primarily from the expansion of the Magnolia and Olympia gathering systems in North Louisiana. In addition, operating expenses in 2010 benefited from a gain on the sale of non-strategic gathering assets ($21 million). 2010 Compared to 2009. Our Field Services business segment reported operating income of $151 million for 2010 compared to $94 million for 2009. Margins increased by $76 million primarily due to new projects, including the Magnolia and Olympia Gathering Systems in the North Louisiana Haynesville Shale and core gathering services ($74 million), along with increased commodity prices ($2 million). Increases in operating expenses ($29 million) and depreciation ($10 million) associated with new projects were partially offset by a gain on the sale of non-strategic gathering assets in October 2010 ($21 million). Equity Earnings. In addition, this business segment recorded equity income of $8 million, $10 million and $9 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively, from its 50% interest in Waskom. The decrease is driven primarily by lower processing volumes. These amounts are included in Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates under the Other Income (Expense) caption in the Statements of Consolidated Income. Other Operations The following table provides summary data for our Other Operations business segment for 2009 , 2010 and 2011 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2009 2010 2011 Revenues $ 11 $ 11 $ 11 Expenses (Income) 7 (3 ) 5 Operating Income $ 4 $ 14 $ 6 42 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Historical Cash Flows The net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for 2009 , 2010 and 2011 is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2009 2010 2011 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,841 $ 1,386 $ 1,888 Investing activities (896 ) (1,420 ) (1,206 ) Financing activities (372 ) (507 ) (661 ) Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased $502 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to increased tax refunds ($412 million), increased cash related to gas storage inventory ($41 million), decreased net margin deposits ($27 million) and increased cash provided by net regulatory assets and liabilities ($17 million), which were partially offset by decreased cash provided by net accounts receivable/payable ($108 million) and decreased cash provided by fuel cost recovery ($61 million). Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $455 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to decreased cash related to gas storage inventory ($274 million), increased tax payments ($216 million) and increased net margin deposits ($109 million), which were partially offset by increased income ($70 million), increased cash provided by net accounts receivable/payable ($21 million) and increased cash provided by net regulatory assets and liabilities ($14 million). Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities decreased $214 million in 2011 compared to 2010 due to decreased capital expenditures ($206 million) and increased cash received from the DOE grant ($20 million). Net cash used in investing activities increased $524 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to increased capital expenditures ($349 million), primarily related to Field Services projects ($320 million), decreased cash from notes receivable from unconsolidated affiliates ($323 million) and increased restricted cash of transition bond and system restoration companies ($31 million), which were partially offset by decreased investment in unconsolidated affiliates ($97 million) and cash received from the DOE grant ($90 million). Cash Used in Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities increased $154 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to decreased proceeds from the issuance of common stock ($410 million), increased payments of long-term debt ($126 million), decreased proceeds from commercial paper ($81 million), increased cash paid for debt exchange ($58 million), increased debt issuance costs ($22 million) and increased common stock dividend payments ($18 million), which were partially offset by increased proceeds from long-term debt ($550 million) and increased short-term debt borrowings ($11 million). Net cash used in financing activities increased $135 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to decreased proceeds from long-term debt ($1.2 billion), increased payments of long-term debt ($561 million), decreased proceeds from the issuance of common stock ($88 million) and increased common stock dividend payments ($43 million), which were offset by decreased repayments of borrowings under revolving credit facilities ($1.4 billion), increased proceeds from commercial paper ($183 million) and increased short-term debt borrowings ($96 million). 43 Future Sources and Uses of Cash Our liquidity and capital requirements are affected primarily by our results of operations, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, tax payments, working capital needs, various regulatory actions and appeals relating to such regulatory actions. Our principal anticipated cash requirements for 2012 include the following: capital expenditures of approximately $1.3 billion; scheduled principal payments on transition and system restoration bonds of $369 million, including $62 million for transition bonds issued in January 2012; February 2012 purchases of pollution control bonds issued on our behalf which have an aggregate principal amount of $275 million; a required pension contribution of $116 million; the March 2012 redemption of pollution control bonds issued on our behalf which have an aggregate principal amount of $100 million; the retirement of long-term debt aggregating $46 million; and dividend payments on CenterPoint Energy common stock and interest payments on debt. We expect that cash on hand, including the approximately $1.7 billion proceeds from the issuance of transition bonds in January 2012 and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs in 2012. Longer term cash requirements or discretionary financing or refinancing may result in the issuance of equity or debt securities in the capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. Issuances of equity or debt in the capital markets, funds raised in the commercial paper markets and additional credit facilities may not, however, be available to us on acceptable terms. The following table sets forth our capital expenditures for 2011 and estimates of our capital expenditures for currently identified or planned projects for 2012 through 2016 (in millions): 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Electric Transmission & Distribution $ 538 $ 575 $ 571 $ 557 $ 514 $ 440 Natural Gas Distribution 295 354 365 361 363 349 Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services 5 14 17 9 8 8 Interstate Pipelines 98 181 125 96 121 91 Field Services 201 139 59 73 104 74 Other Operations 54 23 27 27 29 27 Total $ 1,191 $ 1,286 $ 1,164 $ 1,123 $ 1,139 $ 989 Our capital expenditures are expected to be used for investment in infrastructure for our electric transmission and distribution operations, and our natural gas transmission, distribution and gathering operations. These capital expenditures are anticipated to both maintain reliability and safety as well as to expand our systems through value-added projects. 44 The following table sets forth estimates of our contractual obligations, including payments due by period (in millions): Contractual Obligations Total 2012 2013-2014 2015-2016 2017 and thereafter Transition and system restoration bond debt (1) $ 2,522 $ 307 $ 565 $ 515 $ 1,135 Other long-term debt (2) 7,268 46 1,775 1,029 4,418 Interest payments transition and system restoration bond debt (3) 570 116 187 140 127 Interest payments other long-term debt(3) 3,889 402 690 530 2,267 Short-term borrowings 62 62 Capital leases 1 1 Operating leases (4) 54 14 16 8 16 Benefit obligations (5) Purchase obligations (6) 1 1 Non-trading derivative liabilities 52 46 6 Other commodity commitments (7) 1,890 467 802 370 251 Income taxes (8) 8 8 Other 12 6 6 Total contractual cash obligations $ 16,329 $ 1,475 $ 4,047 $ 2,592 $ 8,215 ___________________ (1) These amounts exclude payments scheduled to be made with respect to the $1.695 billion principal amount of transition bonds issued by Bond Company IV in January 2012 of $62 million in 2012, $237 million in 2013-2014, $248 million in 2015-2016 and $1.148 billion in 2017 and thereafter. (2) 2.0% Zero-Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes due 2029 (ZENS) obligations are included in the 2017 and thereafter column at their contingent principal amount as of December 31, 2011 of $797 million. These obligations are exchangeable for cash at any time at the option of the holders for 95% of the current value of the reference shares attributable to each ZENS ($386 million at December 31, 2011 ), as discussed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. (3) We calculated estimated interest payments for long-term debt as follows: for fixed-rate debt and term debt, we calculated interest based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for variable-rate debt and/or non-term debt, we used interest rates in place as of December 31, 2011 . We typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operations and short-term borrowings. These amounts exclude estimated interest payments scheduled to be made with respect to the $1.695 billion transition bonds issued by Bond Company IV in January 2012 of $26 million in 2012, $67 million in 2013-2014, $63 million in 2015-2016 and $145 million in 2017 and thereafter. (4) For a discussion of operating leases, please read Note 13(c) to our consolidated financial statements. (5) We expect to make a minimum required contribution of $116 million in 2012 to our qualified pension plan. We expect to contribute approximately $9 million and $18 million, respectively, to our non-qualified pension and postretirement benefits plans in 2012. (6) Represents capital commitments for material in connection with our Interstate Pipelines business segment. (7) For a discussion of other commodity commitments, please read Note 13(a) to our consolidated financial statements. (8) As of December 31, 2011, the liability for uncertain income tax positions was $51 million, of which we expect to settle $8 million in 2012. However, due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these remaining liabilities, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which any such liabilities might be paid. 45 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. Other than the guaranties described below and operating leases, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements. Prior to the distribution of our ownership in RRI to our shareholders, CERC had guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became RRI trading subsidiary. When the companies separated, RRI agreed to secure CERC against obligations under the guaranties RRI had been unable to extinguish by the time of separation. Pursuant to such agreement, as amended in December 2007, RRI (now GenOn) agreed to provide to CERC cash or letters of credit as security against CERC obligations under its remaining guaranties for demand charges under certain gas transportation agreements if and to the extent changes in market conditions expose CERC to a risk of loss on those guaranties based on an annual calculation, with any required collateral to be posted each December. The undiscounted maximum potential payout of the demand charges under these transportation contracts, which will be in effect until 2018, was approximately $88 million as of December 31, 2011 . Market conditions in the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2011 required posting of security under the agreement, and GenOn posted approximately $7 million in collateral in December 2010 and an additional $21 million of collateral in December 2011. If GenOn should fail to perform the contractual obligations, CERC could have to honor its guarantee and, in such event, collateral provided as security may be insufficient to satisfy CERC obligations. Debt Financing Transactions . In January 2011, CERC Corp. issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2021 with an interest rate of 4.50% and $300 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2041 with an interest rate of 5.85%. The proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used for the repayment of $550 million of CERC Corp. 7.75% senior notes at their maturity in February 2011. Also in January 2011, CERC Corp. issued an additional $343 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50% senior notes due 2021 and provided cash consideration of $114 million in exchange for $397 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.875% senior notes due 2013. The premium of $58 million paid on exchanged notes has been deferred and will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the 4.50% senior notes due 2021. In January 2012, Bond Company IV, a new special purpose subsidiary of CenterPoint Houston, issued $1.695 billion of transition bonds in three tranches with interest rates ranging from 0.9012% to 3.0282% and final maturity dates ranging from April 15, 2018 to October 15, 2025. Through the issuance of the transition bonds, CenterPoint Houston recovered the Recoverable True-Up Balance, less approximately $10.4 million of offering expenses. The transition bonds will be repaid over time through a charge imposed on customers in CenterPoint Houston's service territory. In February 2012, we purchased $275 million aggregate principal amount of pollution control bonds issued on our behalf at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued interest pursuant to the mandatory tender provisions of the bonds. The purchased pollution control bonds will remain outstanding and may be remarketed. Prior to the purchase, the pollution control bonds had fixed interest rates ranging from 5.15% to 5.95%. The purchases reduced temporary investments and leverage while providing us with the flexibility to finance future capital needs in the tax-exempt market through the remarketing of these bonds. Additionally, in February 2012, we called for a March 2012 redemption of $100 million aggregate principal amount of pollution control bonds issued on our behalf at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued interest pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of the bonds. The pollution control bonds called for redemption have a fixed interest rate of 5.25%. Credit and Receivables Facilities. In the third quarter of 2011, the CERC Corp. receivables facility terminated in accordance with its terms and the revolving credit facilities of CenterPoint Energy, CenterPoint Houston and CERC Corp. were replaced with five-year revolving credit facilities of similar borrowing capacity. As of February 13, 2012 , we had the following facilities (in millions): Date Executed Company Size of Facility Amount Utilized at February 13, 2012 (1) Termination Date September 9, 2011 CenterPoint Energy $ 1,200 $ 13 (2) September 9, 2016 September 9, 2011 CenterPoint Houston 300 4 (2) September 9, 2016 September 9, 2011 CERC Corp. 950 September 9, 2016 ___________________ (1) Based on the debt (excluding transition and system restoration bonds) to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) covenant contained in our $1.2 billion credit facility, we would have been permitted to utilize the full capacity of our credit facilities of $2.5 billion at December 31, 2011 . (2) Represents outstanding letters of credit. 46 Our $1.2 billion credit facility can be drawn at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 175 basis points based on our current credit ratings. The facility contains a debt (excluding transition and system restoration bonds) to EBITDA covenant (as those terms are defined in the facility). The facility allows for a temporary increase of the permitted ratio in the financial covenant from 5 times to 5.5 times if CenterPoint Houston experiences damage from a natural disaster in its service territory and we certify to the administrative agent that CenterPoint Houston has incurred system restoration costs reasonably likely to exceed $100 million in a consecutive twelve-month period, all or part of which CenterPoint Houston intends to seek to recover through securitization financing. Such temporary increase in the financial covenant would be in effect from the date we deliver our certification until the earliest to occur of (i) the completion of the securitization financing, (ii) the first anniversary of our certification or (iii) the revocation of such certification. CenterPoint Houston's $300 million credit facility can be drawn at LIBOR plus 150 basis points based on CenterPoint Houston's current credit ratings. The facility contains a debt (excluding transition and system restoration bonds) to total capitalization covenant which limits debt to 65% of the borrower's total capitalization. CERC Corp.'s $950 million credit facility can be drawn at LIBOR plus 150 basis points based on CERC Corp.'s current credit ratings. The facility contains a debt to total capitalization covenant which limits debt to 65% of CERC's total capitalization. Borrowings under each of the facilities are subject to customary terms and conditions. However, there is no requirement that the borrower make representations prior to borrowings as to the absence of material adverse changes or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect. Borrowings under each of the credit facilities are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of events of default that we consider customary. The facilities also provide for customary fees, including commitment fees, administrative agent fees, fees in respect of letters of credit and other fees. In each of the three revolving credit facilities, the spread to LIBOR and the commitment fees fluctuate based on the borrower's credit rating. The borrowers are currently in compliance with the various business and financial covenants in the three revolving credit facilities. Our $1.2 billion credit facility backstops our $1.0 billion commercial paper program. The $950 million CERC Corp. credit facility backstops a $915 million commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2011 , CERC Corp. had $285 million of outstanding commercial paper. Securities Registered with the SEC. CenterPoint Energy, CenterPoint Houston and CERC Corp. have filed a joint shelf registration statement with the SEC registering indeterminate principal amounts of CenterPoint Houston general mortgage bonds, CERC Corp. senior debt securities and CenterPoint Energy senior debt securities and junior subordinated debt securities and an indeterminate number of CenterPoint Energy shares of common stock, shares of preferred stock, as well as stock purchase contracts and equity units. Temporary Investments. As of February 13, 2012 , CenterPoint Houston had external temporary investments aggregating $1.5 billion . Money Pool. We have a money pool through which the holding company and participating subsidiaries can borrow or invest on a short-term basis. Funding needs are aggregated and external borrowing or investing is based on the net cash position. The net funding requirements of the money pool are expected to be met with borrowings under our revolving credit facility or the sale of our commercial paper. Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings. The interest on borrowings under our credit facilities is based on our credit rating. As of February 13, 2012 , Moody Investors Service, Inc. (Moody s), Standard & Poor Rating Services (S&P), a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, and Fitch, Inc. (Fitch) had assigned the following credit ratings to senior debt of CenterPoint Energy and certain subsidiaries: Moody S&P Fitch Company/Instrument Rating Outlook (1) Rating Outlook(2) Rating Outlook(3) CenterPoint Energy Senior Unsecured Debt Baa3 Stable BBB Stable BBB- Positive CenterPoint Houston Senior Secured Debt A3 Stable A- Stable A- Positive CERC Corp. Senior Unsecured Debt Baa2 Stable BBB+ Stable BBB Stable ___________________ 47 (1) A Moody rating outlook is an opinion regarding the likely direction of a rating over the medium term. (2) An S&P rating outlook assesses the potential direction of a long-term credit rating over the intermediate to longer term. (3) A Fitch rating outlook encompasses a one- to two-year horizon as to the likely ratings direction. We cannot assure you that the ratings set forth above will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are included for informational purposes and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing, the cost of such financings and the execution of our commercial strategies. A decline in credit ratings could increase borrowing costs under our $1.2 billion credit facility, CenterPoint Houston $300 million credit facility and CERC Corp. $950 million credit facility. If our credit ratings or those of CenterPoint Houston or CERC Corp. had been downgraded one notch by each of the three principal credit rating agencies from the ratings that existed at December 31, 2011 , the impact on the borrowing costs under our bank credit facilities would have been immaterial. A decline in credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on long-term debt to be issued in the capital markets and could negatively impact our ability to complete capital market transactions and to access the commercial paper market. CERC Corp. and its subsidiaries purchase natural gas from one of their suppliers under supply agreements that contain an aggregate credit threshold of $120 million based on CERC Corp. S&P senior unsecured long-term debt rating of BBB+. Under these agreements, CERC may need to provide collateral if the aggregate threshold is exceeded. Upgrades and downgrades from this BBB+ rating will increase and decrease the aggregate credit threshold accordingly. CenterPoint Energy Services, Inc. (CES), a wholly owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. operating in our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment, provides comprehensive natural gas sales and services primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities throughout the central and eastern United States. In order to economically hedge its exposure to natural gas prices, CES uses derivatives with provisions standard for the industry, including those pertaining to credit thresholds. Typically, the credit threshold negotiated with each counterparty defines the amount of unsecured credit that such counterparty will extend to CES. To the extent that the credit exposure that a counterparty has to CES at a particular time does not exceed that credit threshold, CES is not obligated to provide collateral. Mark-to-market exposure in excess of the credit threshold is routinely collateralized by CES. As of December 31, 2011 , the amount posted as collateral aggregated approximately $73 million ($10 million of which is associated with price stabilization activities performed for our Natural Gas Distribution business segment). Should the credit ratings of CERC Corp. (as the credit support provider for CES) fall below certain levels, CES would be required to provide additional collateral up to the amount of its previously unsecured credit limit. We estimate that as of December 31, 2011 , unsecured credit limits extended to CES by counterparties aggregate $380 million and $33 million of such amount was utilized. Pipeline tariffs and contracts typically provide that if the credit ratings of a shipper or the shipper guarantor drop below a threshold level, which is generally investment grade ratings from both Moody and S&P, cash or other collateral may be demanded from the shipper in an amount equal to the sum of three months charges for pipeline services plus the unrecouped cost of any lateral built for such shipper. If the credit ratings of CERC Corp. decline below the applicable threshold levels, CERC Corp. might need to provide cash or other collateral of as much as $164 million as of December 31, 2011 . The amount of collateral will depend on seasonal variations in transportation levels. In September 1999, we issued ZENS having an original principal amount of $1.0 billion of which $840 million remains outstanding at December 31, 2011 . Each ZENS note was originally exchangeable at the holder option at any time for an amount of cash equal to 95% of the market value of the reference shares of Time Warner Inc. common stock (TW Common) attributable to such note. The number and identity of the reference shares attributable to each ZENS note are adjusted for certain corporate events. As of December 31, 2011 , the reference shares for each ZENS note consisted of 0.5 share of TW Common, 0.125505 share of Time Warner Cable Inc. common stock (TWC Common) and 0.045455 share of AOL Inc. common stock (AOL Common). If our creditworthiness were to drop such that ZENS note holders thought our liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the ZENS notes were to become illiquid, some ZENS note holders might decide to exchange their ZENS notes for cash. Funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of TW Common, TWC Common and AOL Common that we own or from other sources. We own shares of TW Common, TWC Common and AOL Common equal to approximately 100% of the reference shares used to calculate our obligation to the holders of the ZENS notes. ZENS note exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax deferrals related to the ZENS notes and TW Common, TWC Common and AOL Common shares would typically cease when ZENS notes are exchanged or otherwise retired and TW Common, TWC Common and AOL 48 Common shares are sold. The ultimate tax liability related to the ZENS notes continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year, and there could be a significant cash outflow when the taxes are paid as a result of the retirement of the ZENS notes. If all ZENS notes had been exchanged for cash on December 31, 2011 , deferred taxes of approximately $418 million would have been payable in 2011. Cross Defaults. Under our revolving credit facility, a payment default on, or a non-payment default that permits acceleration of, any indebtedness exceeding $75 million by us or any of our significant subsidiaries will cause a default. In addition, three outstanding series of our senior notes, aggregating $750 million in principal amount as of December 31, 2011 , provide that a payment default by us, CERC Corp. or CenterPoint Houston in respect of, or an acceleration of, borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations, in the aggregate principal amount of $50 million, will cause a default. A default by CenterPoint Energy would not trigger a default under our subsidiaries debt instruments or bank credit facilities. Possible Acquisitions, Divestitures and Joint Ventures . From time to time, we consider the acquisition or the disposition of assets or businesses or possible joint ventures or other joint ownership arrangements with respect to assets or businesses. Any determination to take any action in this regard will be based on market conditions and opportunities existing at the time, and accordingly, the timing, size or success of any efforts and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable. We may seek to fund all or part of any such efforts with proceeds from debt and/or equity issuances. Debt or equity financing may not, however, be available to us at that time due to a variety of events, including, among others, maintenance of our credit ratings, industry conditions, general economic conditions, market conditions and market perceptions. Other Factors that Could Affect Cash Requirements. In addition to the above factors, our liquidity and capital resources could be affected by: cash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain contracts, including our weather hedging arrangements, and gas purchases, gas price and gas storage activities of our Natural Gas Distribution and Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segments; acceleration of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts, under certain circumstances, as a result of increased gas prices and concentration of natural gas suppliers; increased costs related to the acquisition of natural gas; increases in interest expense in connection with debt refinancings and borrowings under credit facilities; various legislative or regulatory actions; incremental collateral, if any, that may be required due to regulation of derivatives; the ability of GenOn and its subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations in respect of GenOn indemnity obligations to us and our subsidiaries or in connection with the contractual obligations to a third party pursuant to which CERC is a guarantor; the ability of REPs, including REP affiliates of NRG and REP affiliates of Energy Future Holdings Corp., which are CenterPoint Houston two largest customers, to satisfy their obligations to us and our subsidiaries; delays in cash collections attributable to billing delays; slower customer payments and increased write-offs of receivables due to higher gas prices or changing economic conditions; the outcome of litigation brought by and against us; contributions to pension and postretirement benefit plans; restoration costs and revenue losses resulting from future natural disasters such as hurricanes and the timing of recovery of such restoration costs; and various other risks identified in Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report. 49 Certain Contractual Limits on Our Ability to Issue Securities and Borrow Money. CenterPoint Houston credit facilities limit CenterPoint Houston debt (excluding transition and system restoration bonds) as a percentage of its total capitalization to 65% . CERC Corp. bank facility limits CERC debt as a percentage of its total capitalization to 65% . Our $1.2 billion credit facility contains a debt, excluding transition and system restoration bonds, to EBITDA covenant which will temporarily increase if CenterPoint Houston experiences damage from a natural disaster in its service territory that meets certain criteria. Additionally, CenterPoint Houston has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certain exceptions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates. An accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element, item or account in the financial statements. Accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events, or the present status of an asset or liability. The accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made. Additionally, different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The circumstances that make these judgments difficult, subjective and/or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments. These estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates. Accordingly, these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors. Accounting for Rate Regulation Accounting guidance for regulated operations provides that rate-regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment, our Natural Gas Distribution business segment and portions of our Interstate Pipelines business segment apply this accounting guidance. Certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet as regulatory assets or liabilities and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. Regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded when it is probable that these items will be recovered or reflected in future rates. Determining probability requires significant judgment on the part of management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings, proposed regulatory decisions, final regulatory orders and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals. If events were to occur that would make the recovery of these assets and liabilities no longer probable, we would be required to write off or write down these regulatory assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2011 , we had recorded regulatory assets of $4.6 billion and regulatory liabilities of $1.0 billion. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including goodwill and identifiable intangibles, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable, and at least annually for goodwill as required by accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets. No impairment of goodwill was indicated based on our annual analysis at July 1, 2011. Unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in the value of long-lived assets and intangibles due to changes in estimates of future cash flows, interest rates, regulatory matters and operating costs could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge. Fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques, including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties, present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures. The fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques. Unbilled Energy Revenues Revenues related to electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services are generally recognized upon delivery to customers. However, the determination of deliveries to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which is performed on 50 a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, deliveries to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated. Unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on daily supply volumes, applicable rates and analyses reflecting significant historical trends and experience. Unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes, estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect. As additional information becomes available, or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised. Consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates. Pension and Other Retirement Plans We sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements. We use several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management, within certain guidelines. In addition, our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded. Please read Other Significant Matters Pension Plans for further discussion. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2(o) to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us. OTHER SIGNIFICANT MATTERS Pension Plans. As discussed in Note 6(b) to our consolidated financial statements, we maintain a non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees. Employer contributions for the qualified plan are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes. Under the terms of our pension plan, we reserve the right to change, modify or terminate the plan. Our funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under ERISA. The minimum funding requirements for the qualified pension plan were $-0-, $-0- and $35 million for 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively. We made contributions of $13 million, $-0- and $65 million in 2009, 2010 and 2011 for the respective years. We expect to make a required minimum contribution of $116 million in 2012. Additionally, we maintain an unfunded non-qualified benefit restoration plan that allows participants to receive the benefits to which they would have been entitled under our non-contributory pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated. Employer contributions for the non-qualified benefit restoration plan represent benefit payments made to participants and totaled $7 million, $8 million and $10 million in 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively. Changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension expense in the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension expense recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants. As the sponsor of a plan, we are required to (a) recognize on our balance sheet as an asset a plan's over-funded status or as a liability such plan's under-funded status, (b) measure a plan's assets and obligations as of the end of our fiscal year and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of our plans in the year that changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income and regulatory assets. As of December 31, 2011, the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plan assets of our pension plans by $579 million. Changes in interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plan during 2012 could materially, positively or negatively, change our funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions. Pension cost was $111 million, $86 million and $78 million for 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively, of which $60 million, $44 million and $49 million impacted pre-tax earnings. CenterPoint Houston actuarially determined pension expense for 2010 and 2011 in excess of the amount being recovered through rates is being deferred for rate making purposes and was addressed in its 2010 rate application pursuant to Texas law. CenterPoint Houston deferred as a regulatory asset $26 million and $16 million 51 in pension and other postemployment expenses during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively. The calculation of pension expense and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. Two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate. As of December 31, 2011, our qualified pension plan had an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.00%, which was unchanged from the rate assumed as of December 31, 2010. We believe that our actual asset allocation, on average, will approximate the targeted allocation and the estimated return on net assets. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance plan assets as appropriate. As of December 31, 2011, the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of 4.90%, which is a 0.35% decrease from the 5.25% discount rate assumed in 2010. The discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on high-quality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of our plan. Pension cost for 2012, including the benefit restoration plan, is estimated to be $82 million, of which we expect $68 million to impact pre-tax earnings, based on an expected return on plan assets of 8.00% and a discount rate of 4.90% as of December 31, 2011. If the expected return assumption were lowered by 0.50% from 8.00% to 7.50%, 2012 pension cost would increase by approximately $8 million. As of December 31, 2011, the pension plan projected benefit obligation, including the unfunded benefit restoration plan, exceeded plan assets by $579 million. If the discount rate were lowered by 0.50% from 4.90% to 4.40%, the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation and 2012 pension expense by approximately $105 million and $5 million, respectively. In addition, the assumption change would impact our Consolidated Balance Sheet by increasing the regulatory asset recorded as of December 31, 2011 by $85 million and would result in a charge to comprehensive income in 2011 of $12 million, net of tax. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plan will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be.
