Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented in Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Note references are to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Amounts and percentages in tables may not total due to rounding. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. All share and per share amounts for prior periods have been adjusted to reflect our 2-for-1 common stock split in March 2007. BUSINESS OVERVIEW General CarMax is the nation largest retailer of used vehicles. We pioneered the used car superstore concept, opening our first store in 1993. Our strategy is to better serve the auto retailing market by addressing the major sources of customer dissatisfaction with traditional auto retailers and to maximize operating efficiencies through the use of standardized operating procedures and store formats enhanced by sophisticated, proprietary management information systems. As of February 28, 2009, we operated 100 used car superstores in 46 markets, comprised of 34 mid-sized markets, 11 large markets and 1 small market. We define mid-sized markets as those with television viewing populations generally between 600,000 and 2.5 million people. We also operated six new car franchises. In fiscal 2009, we sold 345,465 used cars, representing 97% of the total 356,549 vehicles we sold at retail. We believe the CarMax consumer offer is distinctive within the auto retailing marketplace. Our offer provides customers the opportunity to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for items at other big box retailers. Our consumer offer is structured around our four customer benefits: low, no-haggle prices; a broad selection; high quality vehicles; and a customer-friendly sales process. Our website, carmax.com, is a valuable tool for communicating the CarMax consumer offer, a sophisticated search engine and an efficient channel for customers who prefer to conduct their shopping online. We generate revenues, income and cash flows primarily by retailing used vehicles and associated items including vehicle financing, extended service plans ( ESPs ) and vehicle repair service. We also generate revenues, income and cash flows from the sale of vehicles purchased through our appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards. These vehicles are sold through on-site wholesale auctions. Wholesale auctions are generally held on a weekly or bi-weekly basis, and as of February 28, 2009, we conducted auctions at 49 used car superstores. During fiscal 2009, we sold 194,081 wholesale vehicles. On average, the vehicles we wholesale are approximately 10 years old and have more than 100,000 miles. Participation in our wholesale auctions is restricted to licensed automobile dealers, the majority of whom are independent dealers and licensed wholesalers. CarMax provides financing to qualified retail customers through CarMax Auto Finance ( CAF ), our finance operation, and a number of third-party financing providers. As of February 28, 2009, these third parties included Bank of America Dealer Financial Services, Capital One Auto Finance, CitiFinancial Auto, Santander Consumer USA, Wachovia Dealer Services and Wells Fargo Auto. We collect fixed, prenegotiated fees from the majority of the third-party providers, and we periodically test additional providers. CarMax has no recourse liability for the financing provided by these third parties. We sell ESPs on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors. As of February 28, 2009, the used vehicle third-party ESP providers were CNA National Warranty Corporation and The Warranty Group. We have no contractual liability to the customer under these third-party service plans. Extended service plan revenue represents commissions from the unrelated third parties. Over the long term, we believe the primary driver for earnings growth will be vehicle unit sales growth, both from new stores and from stores included in our comparable store base. We target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold. The gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors, including its anticipated probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age; however, it is not primarily based on the vehicle selling price. 19 We are still at a relatively early stage in the national rollout of our retail concept, and as of February 28, 2009, we had used car superstores located in markets that comprised approximately 45% of the U.S. population. Prior to August 2008, we had planned to open used car superstores at a rate of approximately 15% of our used car superstore base each year. In August 2008, we announced that we would temporarily slow our store growth as a result of the weak economic and sales environment. In December 2008, following further deterioration in market conditions we announced a temporary suspension in store growth. We believe this suspension will reduce our capital needs and improve profitability. In the near term, our principal challenges are related to the recession, which caused a dramatic decline in industry-wide auto sales, and the disruption of the asset-backed securitization market, which historically has been used to provide funding for CAF loan originations. In fiscal 2009, we experienced a large decline in customer traffic, which led to significant reductions in our sales and gross profits and caused the deleveraging of our selling, general and administrative expenses. A decline in investor interest in asset-backed securities caused us to slow CAF share of originations in the second half of fiscal 2009, in an effort to slow the utilization of our warehouse facility. Longer term, when economic conditions improve and we resume geographic growth, we believe the principal challenges we face will include our ability to build our management bench strength to support the store growth and our ability to procure suitable real estate at reasonable costs. We staff each newly opened store with an experienced management team. Therefore, when we are expanding our store base, we must recruit, train and develop managers and associates to fill the pipeline necessary to support future store openings. Fiscal 2009 Highlights We believe the weakness in the economy and the stresses on consumer spending caused by the recession adversely affected industry-wide auto sales in fiscal 2009. Net sales and operating revenues decreased 15% to $6.97 billion from $8.20 billion in fiscal 2008, while net earnings decreased to $59.2 million, or $0.27 per share, from $182.0 million, or $0.83 per share. Total used vehicle revenues declined 14% to $5.69 billion versus $6.59 billion in fiscal 2008. Total used vehicle unit sales decreased 8%, reflecting the combination of a 16% decrease in comparable store used unit sales partially offset by the growth in our store base. The average used vehicle selling price declined 6%, primarily as a result of a decline in acquisition costs caused by the weak wholesale vehicle market. We opened 11 used car superstores in fiscal 2009, increasing our store base by 12%. We expanded our presence in five existing markets and we entered five new markets. Total wholesale vehicle revenues decreased 21% to $779.8 million versus $985.0 million in fiscal 2008, reflecting the combination of a 13% decline in wholesale unit sales and a 10% decline in average wholesale selling price. The decline in unit sales reflected a decrease in both our appraisal traffic and our appraisal buy rate (defined as the number of appraisal purchases as a percent of the number of vehicles appraised). Our total gross profit decreased to $968.2 million compared with $1.07 billion in fiscal 2008, primarily because of the significant decline in used and wholesale unit sales. Despite the difficult sales environment, our total gross profit dollars per unit decreased only $16 to $2,715 per unit from $2,731 per unit in fiscal 2008. We believe our ability to maintain a generally consistent level of gross profit per unit, despite the challenging sales environment and an unprecedented decline in wholesale market prices in fiscal 2009, was due in large part to the effectiveness of our proprietary inventory management systems and processes and our success in dramatically reducing inventories to keep them aligned with sales. CAF income decreased to $15.3 million compared with $85.9 million in fiscal 2008. In both periods, CAF results were reduced by adjustments related to loans originated in previous fiscal years. The adjustments totaled $81.8 million, or $0.23 per share, in fiscal 2009 and $9.6 million, or $0.03 per share, in fiscal 2008. The fiscal 2009 adjustments included approximately $32.0 million of mark-to-market write-downs on subordinated bonds, $31.8 million for increased cumulative net loss assumptions and $18.0 million for increased funding costs. CAF gain on loans originated and sold declined to $46.5 million compared with $58.1 million in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, CAF loan origination volume was adversely affected by the decreases in our used unit sales and average selling price and a decrease in the percentage of sales financed by CAF. Selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses increased 3% to $882.4 million from $858.4 million in fiscal 2008, significantly less than the 12% increase in our store base. SG&A as a percent of net sales and operating revenues (the SG&A ratio ), increased to 12.7% from 10.5% in fiscal 2008 reflecting the significant declines in comparable store used unit sales and average selling price, partially offset by reductions in variable costs. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $264.6 million compared with $79.5 million in fiscal 2008, primarily reflecting the large reduction in used vehicle inventories in fiscal 2009, partially offset by the decrease in net earnings. 20 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions. We continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions. Note 2 includes a discussion of significant accounting policies. The accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment. Our financial results might have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed. Securitization Transactions We use a securitization program to fund substantially all of the auto loan receivables originated by CAF. The securitization transactions are accounted for as sales. A gain, recorded at the time of the securitization transaction, results from recording a receivable equal to the present value of the residual cash flows we expect to receive over the life of the securitized receivables. The fair value of our retained interest in securitization transactions includes the present value of the residual cash flows we expect to receive over the life of the securitized receivables, reserve accounts, an undivided ownership interest in certain receivables and retained subordinated bonds. The present value of the residual cash flows we expect to receive over the life of the securitized receivables is determined by estimating the future cash flows using our assumptions of key factors, such as finance charge income, loss rates, prepayment rates, funding costs and discount rates appropriate for the type of asset and risk. These assumptions are derived from historical experience and projected economic trends. Adjustments to one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the fair value of the retained interest. The fair value of the retained interest could also be affected by external factors, such as changes in the behavior patterns of customers, changes in the strength of the economy and developments in the interest rate and credit markets. Note 2(C) includes a discussion of accounting policies related to securitizations. Note 4 includes a discussion of securitizations and provides a sensitivity analysis showing the hypothetical effect on the retained interest if there were variations from the assumptions used. Note 6 includes a discussion on fair value measurements. In addition, see the CarMax Auto Finance Income section of this MD&A for a discussion of the effect of changes in our assumptions. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete, generally either at the time of sale to a customer or upon delivery to a customer. We recognize used vehicle revenue when a sales contract has been executed and the vehicle has been delivered, net of a reserve for returns under our 5-day, money-back guarantee. A reserve for vehicle returns is recorded based on historical experience and trends, and it could be affected if future vehicle returns differ from historical averages. We also sell ESPs on behalf of unrelated third parties to customers who purchase a vehicle. Because we are not the primary obligor under these service plans, we recognize commission revenue on the ESPs at the time of sale, net of a reserve for returns. The reserve for ESP cancellations is recorded based on historical experience and trends, and it could be affected if future ESP cancellations differ from historical averages. Income Taxes Estimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets. In the ordinary course of business, transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain at the time of the transactions. We adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is probable that our actual results will differ from our estimates. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted. Note 8 includes information regarding income taxes. We evaluate the need to record valuation allowances that would reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. When assessing the need for valuation allowances, we consider available carrybacks, future reversals of existing temporary differences and future taxable income. Except for a valuation allowance recorded for a capital loss carryforward that may not be utilized before its expiration, we believe that our recorded deferred tax assets as of February 28, 2009, will more likely than not be realized. However, if a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period when the change in circumstances occurs. 21 In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payments of these amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result in the period of determination. Defined Benefit Retirement Plan The plan obligations and related assets of our defined benefit retirement plan are presented in Note 9. Plan assets, which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments, are valued using current market quotations. Plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries using a number of assumptions that we provide. Key assumptions used to measure the plan obligations include the discount rate, the rate of compensation increases, the future return on plan assets and the mortality rate. In determining the discount rate, we use the current yield on high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments that have maturities that approximate the expected timing of the anticipated benefit payments. Compensation increase assumptions for periods prior to December 31, 2008, were based upon our historical experience and anticipated future board and management actions. Asset returns are estimated based upon the anticipated average yield on the plan assets. Effective December 31, 2008, we froze the benefits under the plan, and no additional benefits will accrue to participants after that date. Other than the effects of the plan freeze, we do not believe that any significant changes in assumptions used to measure the plan obligations are likely to occur that would have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Used Vehicle Sales Fiscal 2009 Versus Fiscal 2008. Our 14% decrease in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2009 resulted from the combination of an 8% decline in unit sales and a 6% decrease in average retail selling price. The decline in unit sales reflected a 16% decrease in comparable store used units, partially offset by sales from newer superstores not yet in the comparable store base. The decrease in the average retail selling price was primarily caused by a significant industry-wide drop in used car prices during the first three quarters of the year, which reduced our inventory acquisition costs. Early in fiscal 2009, the steep increase in the cost of gasoline caused a temporary shift in consumer demand away from SUVs and trucks, toward more fuel-efficient vehicles. However, in the latter half of fiscal 2009, the combination of the decline in gasoline prices and the lower, more affordable prices for these less fuel-efficient vehicles caused our sales mix to return to the prior year levels. We began to see the initial effects of the slowdown in the automotive retail market in the latter part of fiscal 2008. However, the weakness in the economy and the stresses on consumer spending accelerated in fiscal 2009, causing customer traffic to decline sharply starting in late May 2008. These stresses included rising unemployment rates, decreases in home equity values and personal wealth, and record low levels of consumer confidence. For the year, the decline in customer traffic was slightly greater than the decrease in comparable store unit sales. Despite the more difficult environment, the solid execution by our store teams allowed us to modestly improve our conversion rate compared with fiscal 2008. While both CAF and our third-party providers tightened lending criteria for some higher-risk customer segments, lack of credit availability was not a major contributor to the reduction in sales. Our data for the year indicated that we modestly gained market share in the late-model used vehicle market in fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2008 Versus Fiscal 2007. The 12% increase in our used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2008 resulted from a corresponding increase in unit sales. The unit sales growth reflected sales from newer superstores not yet included in the comparable store base and a 3% increase in comparable store used units. This 3% increase in comparable store used units in fiscal 2008 reflected the challenging comparison with the 9% increase in fiscal 2007, as well as declining consumer confidence in the latter part of fiscal 2008. Our average used vehicle selling price in fiscal 2008 was similar to the prior year, as consumer-driven mix shifts from large and mid-sized SUVs to smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles in the latter half of the year offset normal price inflation. 23 In fiscal 2008, we experienced an overall increase in consumer traffic, which we believe was a benefit of the strength of our consumer offer, as well as a favorable response to improvements made to carmax.com. However, compared with fiscal 2007, our sales conversion rate declined slightly as consumers appeared to be somewhat more hesitant in committing to big-ticket purchases. Sales continued to be supported by the consistent availability of credit from CAF and from third-party financing providers. Despite the deceleration in automotive industry sales, our data indicated that we continued to gain share within our existing markets in fiscal 2008 in the late-model used vehicle market. New Vehicle Sales Fiscal 2009 Versus Fiscal 2008. New vehicle revenues declined 29% in fiscal 2009. The decline was the result of a 28% decrease in unit sales and a 1% decrease in average selling price. New vehicle unit sales primarily reflected the extremely soft new car industry sales trends, as well as the sale of our Orlando Chrysler-Jeep-Dodge franchise in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. For the fiscal year ended February 28, 2009, new car manufacturers reported a 23% decline in U.S. new car unit sales. Fiscal 2008 Versus Fiscal 2007. The 17% decrease in new vehicle revenues in fiscal 2008 was the result of a corresponding decrease in unit sales. The decline in new vehicle unit sales reflected soft new car industry sales trends, particularly for the domestic manufacturers that we represent, and the sale of our Orlando Chrysler-Jeep-Dodge franchise. Wholesale Vehicle Sales Our operating strategy is to build customer satisfaction by offering high-quality vehicles. Fewer than half of the vehicles acquired from consumers through the appraisal purchase process meet our standards for reconditioning and subsequent retail sale. Those vehicles that do not meet our standards are sold through on-site wholesale auctions. Our wholesale auction prices usually reflect the trends in the general wholesale market for the types of vehicles we sell, although they could also be affected by changes in vehicle mix or the average age, mileage or condition of the vehicles wholesaled. Fiscal 2009 Versus Fiscal 2008. The 21% decrease in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2009 resulted from a 13% decrease in wholesale unit sales combined with a 10% decrease in average wholesale selling price. The decline in unit sales primarily reflected a decrease in our appraisal traffic and, to a lesser extent, a decline in our appraisal buy rate. Industry wholesale prices for SUVs, trucks and other less fuel efficient vehicles fell sharply in the first two quarters of fiscal 2009, and prices for virtually all vehicle classes declined at an unprecedented rate during the third quarter, reflecting the weak demand environment. We believe the significant drop in wholesale market values, which resulted in corresponding decreases in our appraisal offers, contributed to the reduction in our buy rate. Appraisal traffic was affected by the overall slowdown in customer traffic. The decline in average wholesale selling price reflected the trends in the general wholesale market for the types of vehicles we sell. Fiscal 2008 Versus Fiscal 2007. The 7% increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2008 resulted from a 6% increase in wholesale unit sales combined with a 1% increase in average wholesale selling price. Our wholesale unit sales benefited from an increase in appraisal traffic driven by the combination of the expansion of our store base and our comparable store unit sales growth. However, our appraisal buy rate declined from the prior year level, reflecting, we believe, an increasing hesitancy of consumers to commit to purchasing big-ticket items. Other Sales and Revenues Other sales and revenues include commissions on the sale of ESPs, service department sales and net third-party finance fees. The fixed fees paid by third-party finance providers vary by provider, reflecting their differing levels of credit risk exposure. Providers who purchase the highest risk loans purchase these loans at a discount, which is reflected as an offset to finance fee revenues received from the other third-party providers. Fiscal 2009 Versus Fiscal 2008. Other sales and revenues decreased 5% in fiscal 2009. ESP revenues declined 5%. Compared with the 8% decrease in total used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2009, ESP revenues benefited from a slow down in the rate of ESP cancellations, which we believe was the result of the decline in auto industry sales and trade-ins. Third-party finance fees decreased 42% due to a combination of factors including the reduction in retail vehicle unit sales, a shift in mix among providers and a change in discount arrangements with certain of the providers during fiscal 2009. Collectively, the third-party providers financed a larger percentage of our retail unit sales in the second half of fiscal 2009, as we chose to route more credit applications to these providers. Doing so allowed us to slow the use of capacity in our warehouse facility, which is used to provide initial funding for substantially all of the auto loan receivables originated by CAF. 24 Fiscal 2008 Versus Fiscal 2007. Other sales and revenues increased 11% in fiscal 2008, similar to the 12% increase in used vehicle unit sales.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2008, we sold our Orlando Chrysler-Jeep-Dodge franchise. During fiscal 2009, we expanded our car-buying center test with the openings in Dallas, Texas, and Baltimore, Maryland. We now have a total of five car-buying centers at which we conduct appraisals and purchase, but do not sell, vehicles. We will continue to evaluate the performance of these five centers before deciding whether to open additional ones in future years. These test sites are part of our long-term program to increase both appraisal traffic and retail vehicle sourcing self-sufficiency (equal to the percentage of vehicles sold at retail that were purchased directly from consumers).

(2) Calculated as a percentage of its respective sales or revenue. Used Vehicle Gross Profit We target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold. The gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors, including its anticipated probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age; however, it is not primarily based on the vehicle selling price. Our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with the broader market trade-in trends and our rapid inventory turns reduce the exposure to the inherent continual depreciation in used vehicle values and contribute to our ability to manage gross profit dollars per unit. We employ a volume-based strategy, and we systematically mark down individual vehicle prices based on proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales trends, inventory turns and gross profit achievement. When customer traffic and sales are consistently strong, we generally take fewer pricing markdowns, which in turn benefits gross profit dollars per unit. When the sales pace slows, we may initially take more pricing markdowns, which could pressure gross profit dollars per unit. However, as we are successful in reducing inventories to align them with a slower sales pace, this may allow us to return to target levels of gross profit per unit. Over the past several years, we have continued to refine our car-buying strategies, which we believe has benefited used vehicle gross profit per unit. Fiscal 2009 Versus Fiscal 2008. Our used vehicle gross profit decreased by $64.2 million, or 9%, to $644.4 million from $708.6 million in fiscal 2008, primarily as a result of the 8% decline in total used unit sales. Despite the difficult sales environment in fiscal 2009, gross profit per unit decreased only $13 to $1,865 per unit. Several factors adversely affected our fiscal 2009 used vehicle gross profit per unit, including a reduction in the percent of vehicles purchased directly from customers and the sharp decrease in wholesale industry prices. These were largely offset, however, by our success in managing our inventories. During fiscal 2009, we experienced a decline in both appraisal traffic and buy rate, which required us to source a larger percentage of our used vehicles at auction. Vehicles purchased at auction typically generate less gross profit per unit compared with vehicles purchased directly from consumers. Additionally, wholesale industry prices for mid-sized and large SUVs and trucks declined sharply in the spring and early summer of 2008, and this rapid decline in valuation resulted in margin pressure on this segment of inventory in the first half of fiscal 2009. We believe that our ability to maintain a generally consistent level of gross profit per unit during fiscal 2009, despite the challenging sales environment and the unprecedented decline in wholesale market prices, was due in large part to the effectiveness of our proprietary inventory management systems and processes. In response to the sharp decline in traffic and sales that began in late May 2008, we rapidly reduced our used car inventories, which brought them back in line with the current sales rates and minimized required pricing markdowns in the second half of the fiscal year. Compared with inventory levels at stores open as of February 29, 2008, we had approximately 16,500 fewer total used vehicle units in inventory as of February 28, 2009, representing a 28% reduction. Due to the severe decline in customer traffic during fiscal 2009, we generally chose not to reduce our gross profit targets, as we believed doing so in the current economic environment would not have spurred a sufficient increase in sales to offset the reduction in per-unit profitability. Fiscal 2008 Versus Fiscal 2007. Our used vehicle gross profit increased by $67.4 million, or 11%, to $708.6 million from $641.2 million in fiscal 2007, primarily as a result of the 12% increase in total used unit sales. Our used vehicle gross profit per unit declined $25 to $1,878 per unit in fiscal 2008. The gross profit per unit increased modestly in the first half of the year before declining in the second half of the year. As the economic environment continued to weaken in the third quarter of fiscal 2008, we moderately reduced our gross profit targets at the beginning of the fourth quarter in an attempt to create additional value for customers and drive sales. 26 New Vehicle Gross Profit Fiscal 2009 Versus Fiscal 2008. Our new vehicle gross profit decreased $6.4 million to $9.0 million in fiscal 2009 from $15.4 million in fiscal 2008, reflecting the 28% reduction in total new unit sales and a $180 decline in gross profit per unit. These reductions resulted from the sharp decline in new car industry sales and the resulting increase in competitiveness in the new car market. Fiscal 2008 Versus Fiscal 2007. Our new vehicle gross profit decreased $6.3 million to $15.4 million in fiscal 2008 from $21.7 million in fiscal 2007, reflecting the 17% drop in total new unit sales and a $175 decline in gross profit per unit. The decline in overall consumer demand for new cars in fiscal 2008 pressured profits for many new car retailers, including CarMax. Wholesale Vehicle Gross Profit Our wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit has steadily increased over the last several years, reflecting the benefits realized from improvements and refinements in our car-buying strategies, appraisal delivery processes and in-store auction processes. We have made continuous improvements in these processes, which we believe has allowed us to become more efficient. Our in-store auctions have benefited from initiatives to increase our dealer-to-car ratio, which we believe has allowed us to achieve higher prices. In addition, the frequency of our auctions, which are generally held weekly or bi-weekly, minimizes the depreciation risk on these vehicles. Fiscal 2009 Versus Fiscal 2008. Our wholesale vehicle gross profit decreased by $14.2 million, or 8%, to $162.5 million in fiscal 2009 from $176.7 million in fiscal 2008. The reduction was driven by the 13% decline in wholesale vehicle unit sales, partially offset by an increase in wholesale gross profit per unit of $43, or 5%, to $837 per unit in fiscal 2009. We experienced a record dealer-to-car ratio at our auctions for the year, with the resulting price competition among bidders contributing to the strong wholesale gross profit per unit. Our wholesale vehicles are predominantly comprised of older, higher mileage vehicles, and we believe the demand for these types of vehicles remained strong from dealers who specialize in selling to credit-challenged customers. Fiscal 2008 Versus Fiscal 2007. Our wholesale vehicle gross profit increased by $21.7 million, or 14%, to $176.7 million in fiscal 2008 from $155.0 million in fiscal 2007. The increase was attributable to the 6% increase in wholesale vehicle unit sales and an increase in wholesale gross profit per unit of $52, or 7%, to $794 per unit in fiscal 2008. We continued to experience strong dealer attendance at our auctions throughout the year, despite the challenging economic environment. Other Gross Profit Other gross profit includes profits related to ESP revenues, third-party finance fees and service department sales. We have no cost of sales related to either ESP revenues or third-party finance fees, as these represent commissions paid to us by the third-party providers. Accordingly, changes in the mix of ESP revenues and third-party finance fees, relative to service department sales, can affect the composition of other gross profit. Fiscal 2009 Versus Fiscal 2008. Other gross profit decreased by $19.6 million, or 11%, to $152.2 million in fiscal 2009 from $171.8 million in fiscal 2008. This decrease primarily reflected the reductions in used and new retail unit sales and the related impact on ESP revenues and third-party finance fees and a $10 decline in other gross profit per unit in fiscal 2009. The decline in other gross profit per unit was primarily associated with the increase in mix of other revenues represented by service department sales. Fiscal 2008 Versus Fiscal 2007. Other gross profit increased by $18.6 million, or 12%, to $171.8 million in fiscal 2008 from $153.2 million in fiscal 2007. The increase was the result of the increase in used unit sales and the related affects on ESP sales and third-party finance fees, and a $6 increase in other gross profit per unit in fiscal 2008. The improvement in per unit profitability was the result of an increase in mix of other revenues represented by ESP sales and third-party finance fees. Impact of Inflation Historically, inflation has not been a significant contributor to results. Profitability is primarily affected by our ability to achieve targeted unit sales and gross profit dollars per vehicle rather than on average retail prices. However, increases in average vehicle selling prices benefit the SG&A ratio and CAF income, to the extent the average amount financed also increases. 27 In fiscal 2009, the weakness in the economy and the stresses on consumer spending contributed to the industry-wide slowdown in the sale of new and used vehicles and to the unprecedented decline in wholesale market prices for most vehicle classes during the first three quarters of the year. These lower wholesale values reduced our vehicle acquisition costs and contributed to the decline in our used and wholesale vehicle average selling price. CarMax Auto Finance Income CAF provides financing for a portion of our used and new car retail sales. Because the purchase of a vehicle is often reliant on the consumer ability to obtain on-the-spot financing, it is important to our business that financing be available to creditworthy customers. While financing can also be obtained from third-party sources, we believe that total reliance on third parties can create unacceptable volatility and business risk. Furthermore, we believe that our processes and systems, the transparency of our pricing and our vehicle quality provide a unique and ideal environment in which to procure high quality auto loans, both for CAF and for the third-party financing providers. Generally, CAF has provided us the opportunity to capture additional profits and cash flows from auto loan receivables while managing our reliance on third-party financing sources.

We present this information on a direct basis to avoid making arbitrary decisions regarding the indirect benefits or costs that could be attributed to CAF. Examples of indirect costs not included are retail store expenses and corporate expenses such as human resources, administrative services, marketing, information systems, accounting, legal, treasury and executive payroll. CAF originates auto loans to qualified customers at competitive market rates of interest. The majority of CAF income has typically been generated by the spread between the interest rates charged to customers and the related cost of funds. Substantially all of the loans originated by CAF are sold in securitization transactions. A gain, recorded at the time of securitization, results from recording a receivable approximately equal to the present value of the expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized receivables. Historically, the gain on loans originated and sold as a percent of loans originated and sold (the gain percentage ) has generally been in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. However, the gain percentage was substantially below the low end of this range in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, primarily as a result of the more challenging economic environment and the disruption in the global credit markets. These factors caused us to increase the loss and discount rate assumptions that affect the gain recognized on the sale of loans and increased our funding costs. 28 Gain (Loss) on Loans Sold Years Ended February 28 or 29 (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Gain on sales of loans originated and sold (1) $ 46.5 $ 58.1 $ 86.7 Other (losses) gains (1) (81.8 ) (9.6 ) 13.0 Total (loss) gain $ (35.3 ) $ 48.5 $ 99.7 Loans originated and sold $ 1,930.2 $ 2,430.8 $ 2,240.2 Receivables repurchased from term securitizations and resold 101.0 103.6 82.5 Total loans sold $ 2,031.2 $ 2,534.4 $ 2,322.7 Gain percentage on loans originated and sold 2.4 % 2.4 % 3.9 % Total (loss) gain as a percentage of total loans sold (1.7 )% 1.9 % 4.3 % (1) To the extent we recognize valuation or other adjustments related to loans originated and sold during previous quarters of the same fiscal year, the sum of amounts reported for the individual quarters may not equal the amounts reported for the corresponding full fiscal year. The gain on sales of loans originated and sold includes both the gain income recorded at the time of securitization and the effect of any subsequent changes in valuation assumptions or funding costs that are incurred in the same fiscal period that the loans were originated. Other losses or gains include the effects of changes in valuation assumptions or funding costs related to loans originated and sold during previous fiscal periods. In addition, other losses or gains could include the effects of new term securitizations, changes in the valuation of retained subordinated bonds and the repurchase and resale of receivables in existing term securitizations, as applicable. Our term securitizations typically contain an option to repurchase the securitized receivables when the outstanding balance in the pool of auto loan receivables falls below 10% of the original pool balance. This option was exercised two times in each of fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007. In each case, the remaining eligible receivables were subsequently resold into the warehouse facility. These transactions did not have a material effect on CAF income in fiscal 2009, 2008 or 2007. In future periods, the effects of refinancing, repurchase or resale activity could be favorable or unfavorable, depending on the securitization structure and the market conditions at the transaction date. Beginning in January 2008, we retained some or all of the subordinated bonds associated with our term securitizations. These bonds were retained either because the economics of doing so were more favorable than selling them or because there was no market for the subordinated bonds at the applicable issue date. The retained subordinated bonds, which had total face values of $115 million and $44.7 million, respectively, at February 28, 2009, and February 29, 2008, are subject to mark-to-market adjustments. Fiscal 2009 Versus Fiscal 2008. CAF income declined to $15.3 million in fiscal 2009 from $85.9 million in fiscal 2008. In both periods, CAF income was reduced by market-to-market write-downs and adjustments related to loans originated in previous fiscal years. In fiscal 2009, these adjustments totaled $81.8 million, or $0.23 per share, and they included: $32.0 million of mark-to-market write-downs in the carrying value of the subordinated bonds. The size of the write-down reflected the illiquidity in the credit markets in fiscal 2009, particularly for subordinated bonds. This non-cash charge primarily affects the timing of the recognition of CAF income. Assuming current conditions persist, the mark-to-market write downs should reverse as we get closer to the maturity dates of the underlying bonds, resulting in positive contributions to CAF income in future periods. $31.8 million for increases in cumulative net loss rate assumptions. The upper end of our cumulative net loss rate assumption range was 4.0% at the end of fiscal 2009 versus 3.0% at the end of fiscal 2008. $18.0 million for increases in funding costs related to loans originated in prior fiscal years. The majority of this increase related to loans that were securitized in the warehouse facility at the end of fiscal 2008 and which were subsequently resold in term securitizations during fiscal 2009. $3.8 million for increasing the discount rate assumption to 19% from 17%. Partly offset by $3.8 million of net favorable adjustments primarily related to reducing our prepayment rate assumption. 29 In fiscal 2008, the adjustments totaled $9.6 million, or $0.03 per share, for adjustments related to loans originated and sold in previous fiscal years. In fiscal 2009, CAF gain on sales of loans originated and sold declined to $46.5 million compared with $58.1 million in fiscal 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of the reduction in CAF loan originations, which were adversely affected by the decreases in our used unit sales and average retail selling price. In addition, it reflected a decrease in the percentage of sales financed by CAF resulting from our election to slow the use of capacity in our warehouse facility during the second half of fiscal 2009. The gain percentage was 2.4% in both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008. Compared with the prior year, the effects of using higher loss and discount rate assumptions and higher credit enhancement levels for fiscal 2009 originations were offset by the benefit of a significant drop in our funding cost benchmark rate. The increases in servicing fee income and direct CAF expenses in fiscal 2009 were proportionate to the growth in managed receivables during the year. The interest income component of other CAF income increased to 1.2% of average managed receivables in fiscal 2009 from 0.9% in fiscal 2008, primarily due to the increase in the discount rate assumption used to value the retained interest. The use of a higher discount rate reduces the gain recognized at the time the loans are sold, but increases the interest income recognized in subsequent periods. Additionally, interest income includes the interest earned on the retained subordinated bonds. Prior to January 2008, we had not retained any subordinated bonds. Fiscal 2008 Versus Fiscal 2007. CAF income declined to $85.9 million in fiscal 2008 from $132.6 million in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, CAF income was reduced by $9.6 million, or $0.03 per share, and they included the effects of increasing the discount rate to 17% from 12%, increasing cumulative net loss assumptions and a $2.7 million mark-to-market write-down of subordinated bonds. In fiscal 2007, CAF income was increased by $13.0 million, or $0.04 per share, which included the effects of reducing cumulative net loss assumptions on loans originated and sold in previous fiscal years. In fiscal 2008, CAF gain on sales of loans originated and sold decreased to $58.1 million compared with $86.7 million in fiscal 2007. Several factors contributed to this decrease. In the second half of fiscal 2008, credit spreads in the asset-backed securitization market widened, resulting in a substantial increase in CAF funding costs. In addition, we increased the discount rate assumption used to calculate our gain on sales of loans to 17% in fiscal 2008 from 12% in fiscal 2007, and we increased our cumulative net loss assumptions on loans originated and sold during fiscal 2008 to a range of 2.7% to 3.0%, which was significantly higher than the cumulative net loss assumptions used on loans originated in fiscal 2007. As a result, the gain percentage declined to 2.4% in fiscal 2008 compared with 3.9% in fiscal 2007. The increases in other CAF income and total direct CAF expenses in fiscal 2008 were proportionate to the growth in managed receivables during the year. Past Due Account Information As of February 28 or 29 (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Loans securitized $ 3,831.9 $ 3,764.5 $ 3,242.1 Loans held for sale or investment 154.8 74.0 68.9 Ending managed receivables $ 3,986.7 $ 3,838.5 $ 3,311.0 Accounts 31+ days past due $ 118.1 $ 86.1 $ 56.9 Past due accounts as a percentage of ending managed receivables 2.96 % 2.24 % 1.72 % Credit Loss Information Years Ended February 28 or 29 (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net credit losses on managed receivables $ 69.8 $ 38.3 $ 20.7 Average managed receivables $ 4,021.0 $ 3,608.4 $ 3,071.1 Net credit losses as a percentage of average managed receivables 1.74 % 1.06 % 0.67 % Recovery rate 44 % 50 % 51 % 30 We are at risk for the performance of the managed securitized receivables to the extent of our retained interest in the receivables. If the managed receivables do not perform in accordance with the assumptions used in determining the fair value of the retained interest, earnings could be affected. Our retained interest was $348.3 million as of February 28, 2009, compared with $270.8 million as of February 29, 2008. In fiscal 2009, we experienced increases in both past due accounts as a percentage of ending managed receivables and net credit losses as a percentage of average managed receivables. We believe these increases were primarily the result of the recession, which has adversely affected unemployment and industry trends for losses and delinquencies. We continually strive to refine CAF origination strategy in order to optimize profitability and sales while managing risk. Historically, we originated pools of loans targeted to have cumulative net loss rates in the range of 2.0% to 2.5%. Receivables originated in calendar years 2003, 2004 and early 2005 experienced loss rates well below both CAF historical averages and these targeted loss rates. We believe this favorability was due, in part, to the customized credit scorecard we implemented in late 2002. As it became evident that the scorecard was resulting in lower-than-expected loss rates, CAF gradually expanded its credit offers beginning in late 2004. As a result, receivables originated in late 2005 and periods thereafter have experienced higher loss and delinquency rates compared with the receivables originated in these earlier years. While the delinquency and projected loss rates on the more recent originations have trended higher than our initial expectations, we believe this has been primarily a reflection of the worsening economic climate. Consequently, we have increased our cumulative net loss assumptions on several recent securitizations, and we have continued to incorporate similar economic stress into the projections for our most recent originations. In addition, we have tightened CAF lending criteria for some applicants with higher-risk credit profiles. The recovery rate represents the average percentage of the outstanding principal balance we receive when a vehicle is repossessed and liquidated at wholesale auction. Historically, the annual recovery rate has ranged from a low of 42% to a high of 51%, and it is primarily affected by changes in the wholesale market pricing environment. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses SG&A expenses primarily include rent and occupancy costs; payroll expenses, other than payroll related to reconditioning and vehicle repair service, which is included in cost of sales; fringe benefits; advertising; and other general expenses. Fiscal 2009 Versus Fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, SG&A expenses increased to $882.4 million, or 12.7% of total revenues, from $858.4 million, or 10.5% of total revenues in fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2009, total SG&A expenses increased only 3%, despite the 12% increase in our store base. In response to the decline in sales, we focused on reducing store and corporate overhead costs, including payroll and advertising. Our total number of associates declined to 13,035 as of the end of fiscal 2009 from a peak of approximately 16,400 in May 2008. The fiscal 2009 SG&A expense also reflected reductions in growth-related costs, including pre-opening and relocation costs, resulting from the suspension of store growth. The increase in the SG&A ratio was mainly the result of the significant declines in comparable store used unit sales and average selling price. The fiscal 2009 SG&A expenses included a number of non-recurring items, which in the aggregate increased the SG&A ratio by 22 basis points and reduced net earnings by $0.04 per share. These non-recurring items included severance costs associated with reduction in our service operations workforce in October 2008, costs for the termination of store site acquisitions resulting from our decision to temporarily suspend store growth and litigation costs, partially offset by a benefit related to our decision to freeze our pension plan benefits as of December 31, 2008. Fiscal 2008 Versus Fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, SG&A expenses increased to $858.4 million, or 10.5% of total revenues, from $776.2 million, or 10.4% of total revenues in fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2008, total SG&A expenses increased 11% compared with the 16% increase in our store base. During fiscal 2008, we increased our SG&A spending related to specific strategic, operational and Internet initiatives intended to improve customer satisfaction and increase efficiencies over the long term. As a result, our 3% increase in comparable store used unit sales in fiscal 2008 did not generate sufficient overhead leverage to offset the increases in spending related to our store growth plan and these initiatives. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 38.8% in fiscal 2009, 38.7% in fiscal 2008 and 38.6% in fiscal 2007. 31 OPERATIONS OUTLOOK Store Openings and Capital Expenditures We currently estimate gross capital expenditures will total approximately $20 million in fiscal 2010, compared with $185.7 million in fiscal 2009 and $253.1 million in fiscal 2008. This reduction reflects our decision to temporarily suspend store growth and the related reduction in both construction and land purchases for future store openings. At the date we announced the suspension, we had four stores under construction. We opened the store in Potomac Mills, Virginia. The stores in Augusta, Georgia; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Dayton, Ohio, were substantially completed at the end of fiscal 2009, but they will not be opened until market conditions improve. Until we resume store growth, capital spending will be incurred primarily for maintenance capital items. Based on the relatively young average age of our store base, maintenance capital has represented a very small portion of our total capital spending in recent years. Fiscal 2010 Expectations As a result of the unprecedented declines in traffic and sales and the continuing volatility in the asset-backed securitization market, we do not believe we can make a meaningful projection of fiscal 2010 sales or earnings. However, assuming that sales trends do not improve from fourth quarter fiscal 2009 levels and given all of the uncertainties in the economy, we would anticipate a double-digit decline in comparable store used unit sales in fiscal 2010, particularly early in the year. Recent credit spreads in the public asset-backed securitization market have been significantly higher than the spreads implicit in our warehouse facility. As a result, we estimate CAF income will be reduced by incremental funding costs of between $60 million and $85 million before taxes, or $0.17 to $0.24 per share, upon refinancing the $1.22 billion that was funded in the warehouse facility at the end of fiscal 2009. The Federal Reserve launched the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility ( TALF ) program in March 2009, and it will continue through December 2009, unless extended. The TALF program is intended to facilitate the issuance of asset-backed securities and to improve market conditions for these securities. Prior to the launch of this program, there had been minimal new issuances of automotive asset-backed securities for several months. In April 2009, we completed a term securitization totaling $1.0 billion of auto loan receivables, which was eligible for investors to utilize the TALF program. Absent further substantial deterioration in sales and earnings, and given the assumptions set forth above, we believe we will remain in compliance with our financial covenants in fiscal 2010. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to CarMax, see Note 17. FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities . We generated net cash from operating activities of $264.6 million in fiscal 2009, $79.5 million in fiscal 2008 and $136.8 million in fiscal 2007. Cash generated by operating activities was $185.1 million higher in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008, primarily reflecting the significant decrease in inventory in fiscal 2009, partially offset by the decline in net earnings. Despite increasing our store base by 12%, we reduced inventories 28%, or $272.6 million, in fiscal 2009 compared with an increase in inventory of $139.7 million in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, we dramatically reduced our used vehicle inventory levels to bring them in line with the lower sales rate. In fiscal 2008, the inventory increase reflected the combination of additional inventories needed to support the expansion of our store base and the expansion of an inventory up test in select stores to determine whether a modest expansion of onsite vehicle inventory, generally in the range of 50 to 100 cars per store, would have a favorable effect on sales. Our retained interest in securitized receivables increased $77.5 million in fiscal 2009 compared with a $68.5 million increase in fiscal 2008. The fiscal 2009 growth reflected increases in the required excess receivables and the amount of retained subordinated bonds we hold, partially offset by a decrease in interest-only strip receivables. Cash generated by operating activities was $57.3 million lower in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. The decrease resulted from a higher level of working capital investment in fiscal 2008, combined with the $16.6 million decrease in net earnings. Our retained interest in securitized receivables increased $68.5 million in fiscal 2008 compared with a $44.0 million increase 32 in fiscal 2007. The fiscal 2008 increase reflected our decision to retain $44.7 million face value of subordinated bonds in the January 2008 term securitization and the growth in the total managed receivables. Inventories increased 17%, or $139.7 million, in fiscal 2008, which was greater than our 10% increase in vehicle revenues. The growth in inventories resulted from the increase in our store base and from the inventory up test. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, this test was being conducted in approximately 30% of our stores. The aggregate principal amount of outstanding auto loan receivables funded through securitizations, which are discussed in Notes 3 and 4, totaled $3.83 billion as of February 28, 2009; $3.76 billion as of February 29, 2008; and $3.24 billion as of February 28, 2007. During fiscal 2009, we completed two term securitizations of auto loan receivables, including $750 million in May 2008 and $525 million in July 2008. We retained a total of $70.3 million face value of subordinated bonds in these two securitizations. During fiscal 2008, we completed three term securitizations, funding a total of $1.78 billion of auto loan receivables. In the term securitization in January 2008, we retained $44.7 million face value of subordinated bonds. As of February 28, 2009, the warehouse facility limit was $1.4 billion. At that date, $1.22 billion of auto loan receivables were funded in the warehouse facility and unused warehouse capacity totaled $185 million. As of the beginning of fiscal 2009, the warehouse facility limit had been temporarily increased to $1.3 billion from $1.0 billion. During fiscal 2009, we increased the facility limit to $1.4 billion. The warehouse facility has an annual term and it expires in July 2009. We intend to enter into new, or renew or expand existing funding arrangements to meet CAF future funding needs. However, based on conditions in the credit markets, the cost and credit enhancements for these arrangements could be materially higher than historical levels and the timing and capacity of these transactions could be dictated by market availability rather than our requirements. Note 4 includes additional discussion of the warehouse facility. Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $155.3 million in fiscal 2009, $257.0 million in fiscal 2008 and $187.2 million in fiscal 2007. Capital expenditures were $185.7 million in fiscal 2009, $253.1 million in fiscal 2008 and $191.8 million in fiscal 2007. In addition to store construction costs, capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 included the cost of land acquired for future year store openings. The decline in capital spending in fiscal 2009 reflected our decision in December 2008 to temporarily suspend store growth. Historically, capital expenditures have been funded with internally generated funds, long-term debt and sale-leaseback transactions. Net proceeds from the sales of assets totaled $34.3 million in fiscal 2009, $1.1 million in fiscal 2008 and $4.6 million in fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2009, we completed sale-leaseback transactions for our two used car superstores in Austin, Texas valued at $31.3 million. As of February 28, 2009, we owned our home office in Richmond, Virginia, 41 used car superstores currently in operation and the three superstores that have been substantially completed, but which will not be opened until market conditions improve. In addition, five superstores were accounted for as capital leases. Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $18.4 million in fiscal 2009, $171.0 million in fiscal 2008 and $48.1 million in fiscal 2007. During the second half of fiscal 2009, due to the unprecedented conditions in the credit markets, we believed that it was prudent to maintain a higher-than-normal cash balance. As of February 28, 2009, we had cash and cash equivalents of $140.6 million compared with $13.0 million as of February 29, 2008, and $19.5 million as of February 28, 2007. Despite the increase in cash and the decline in earnings in fiscal 2009, total debt increased by only $7.8 million to $337.0 million as of February 28, 2009, primarily due to our significant reductions in inventory. In fiscal 2008, we increased total debt by $148.9 million, primarily to fund increased inventory and capital expenditures. In fiscal 2007, we used cash generated from operations to reduce total debt by $9.5 million. During fiscal 2009, we increased the aggregate borrowing limit under our revolving credit facility by $200 million to a total of $700 million. The credit facility expires in December 2011 and is secured by our vehicle inventory. Borrowings under this credit facility are limited to 80% of qualifying inventory, and they are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of February 28, 2009, $308.5 million was outstanding under the credit facility and $227.7 million of the remaining balance was available to us. The outstanding balance under the facility included $0.9 million classified as short-term debt, $157.6 million classified as current portion of long-term debt and $150.0 million classified as long-term debt. We classified $157.6 million of the outstanding balance as of February 29, 2008, as current portion of long-term debt based on our expectation that this balance will not remain outstanding for more than one year. 33 Cash received on equity issuances, which primarily related to employee stock option exercises, was $10.2 million in fiscal 2009, $14.7 million in fiscal 2008 and $35.4 million in fiscal 2007. The fiscal 2007 receipts included exercises by the former chief executive officer in connection with his retirement and other exercises prompted by the significant increase in our stock price during that fiscal year. We expect that cash generated by operations and proceeds from securitization transactions or other funding arrangements, sale-leaseback transactions and borrowings under existing or expanded credit facilities will be sufficient to fund capital expenditures and working capital for the foreseeable future. Fair Value Measurements. On March 1, 2008, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 Fair Value Measurements ( SFAS 157 ). SFAS 157 defines fair value and is applied in any situation where an asset or liability is measured at fair value under existing U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In accordance with SFAS 157, we reported money market securities, retained interest in securitized receivables and financial derivatives at fair value. As these financial assets were already reported at fair value, the implementation of SFAS 157 did not have a material impact on our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. See Note 6 for more information on the adoption and application of this standard. The retained interest in securitized receivables was valued at $348.3 million as of February 28, 2009, and $270.8 million as of February 29, 2008. Included in the retained interest were interest-only strip receivables, various reserve accounts and required excess receivables totaling $260.9 million and $227.7 million, respectively, as of these dates. In addition, the retained interest included retained subordinated bonds with a total fair value of $87.4 million as of February 28, 2009, and $43.1 million as of February 29, 2008. As described in Note 4, we use discounted cash flow models to measure the fair value of the retained interest, excluding the retained subordinated bonds. In addition to funding costs and prepayment rates, the estimates of future cash flows are based on certain key assumptions, such as finance charge income, loss rates and discount rates appropriate for the type of asset and risk, both of which are significant unobservable inputs. Changes in these inputs could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In measuring the fair value of the retained subordinated bonds, we use a widely accepted third-party bond pricing model. Our key assumption is determined based on current market spread quotes from third-party investment banks and is currently a significant unobservable input. Changes in this input could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. During fiscal 2009 changes were made to certain key assumptions used in measuring the fair value of the retained interest. See the CarMax Auto Finance Income section of MD&A for a discussion of the effects of these changes. As the key assumptions used in measuring the fair value of the retained interest (including the retained subordinated bonds) are significant unobservable inputs, the retained interest is classified as a Level 3 asset in accordance with the SFAS 157 hierarchy. As of February 28, 2009, the retained interest represented 69.0% of the total assets measured at fair value, as disclosed in Note 6. 34 Contractual Obligations As of February 28, 2009 (In millions) Total Less Than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More Than 5 Years Other Revolving credit agreement (1) $ 308.5 $ $ 308.5 $ $ $ Capital leases ( 2) 58.7 3.5 7.2 7.2 40.8 Operating leases (2) 1,004.3 82.3 163.3 162.8 595.9 Purchase obligations (3) 22.8 11.7 11.1 Asset retirement obligations (4) 1.1 1.1 Defined benefit retirement plans ( 5 ) 49.9 0.3 49.6 Unrecognized tax benefits ( 6 ) 22.9 3.6 19.3 Total $ 1,468.2 $ 101.4 $ 490.1 $ 170.0 $ 637.8 $ 68.9 (1) Due to the uncertainty of forecasting expected variable interest rate payments, those amounts are not included in the table. See Note 10. (2) Excludes taxes, insurance and other costs payable directly by us. These costs vary from year to year and are incurred in the ordinary course of business. See Note 14.

See Note 9. (6) Represents the net unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. The timing of payments associated with $19.3 million of these tax benefits could not be estimated as of February 28, 2009. See Note 8. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements CAF provides financing for a portion of our used and new car retail sales. We use a revolving securitization program ( warehouse facility ) to fund substantially all of the auto loan receivables originated by CAF until they can be funded through a term securitization or alternative funding arrangement. We sell the auto loan receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entity that transfers an undivided interest in the receivables to entities formed by third-party investors. Historically, we have used term securitizations to refinance the receivables previously securitized through the warehouse facility. The purpose of term securitizations is to provide permanent funding for these receivables. In these transactions, a pool of auto loan receivables is sold to a bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entity that in turn transfers the receivables to a special purpose securitization trust. Additional information regarding the nature, business purposes and importance of our off-balance sheet arrangement to our liquidity and capital resources can be found in the CarMax Auto Finance Income, Financial Condition and Market Risk sections of MD&A, as well as in Notes 3 and 4. 35
