Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. You should read the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Nasdaq in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K, as well as the discussion under Item 1A. Risk Factors. We have reclassified prior period amounts presented in the discussion and analysis to conform to the 2006 presentation. Overview Nasdaq had a highly successful year in 2006. Our financial performance improved substantially, going from net income of $61.7 million or $0.57 per diluted share in 2005, to net income of $127.9 million or $0.95 per diluted share in 2006. Our recent acquisitions contributed to our earnings and we expect further contributions from them in our future results. Our investment in the LSE also contributed to our 2006 earnings and included a $29.4 million unrealized gain, net of tax, on foreign currency option contracts purchased to hedge the foreign exchange exposure on our acquisition bid for the LSE. In August 2006, we began operating as a national securities exchange for Nasdaq-listed securities and on February 12, 2007 became operational as a national securities exchange in non-Nasdaq-listed securities. We recently completed the integration of Nasdaq legacy execution system and the Brut and INET execution systems onto a single platform. In October 2006, we migrated all trading in Nasdaq-listed securities to the INET platform, and all non-Nasdaq-listed securities trading on the Brut platform to INET platform in November 2006. In addition to the above, during 2006, we: Acquired a stake in the LSE totaling approximately 28.8% of the issued share capital of the LSE, after taking into account LSE recent share buybacks. Completed the acquisition of PrimeNewswire, a firm specializing in press release newswire services, enabling us to offer information distribution and multimedia services as part of our Corporate Client services. Acquired Shareholder.com, allowing us to offer shareholder communications and investor relations intelligence services to issuers, which is also a part of our Corporate Client services. Created The Nasdaq Global Select Market, a new listing tier with the highest initial listing standards in the world. Improved our matched market share in NYSE-listed securities to 10.4% for the year ended December 31, 2006, up from 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2005. Completed two offerings of our common stock: 1) 15,979,513 shares of common stock at $40.00 per share including 8,042,142 shares sold by Nasdaq with $104.7 million in proceeds used to redeem our Series C Cumulative preferred stock; 2) 18,500,000 shares of common stock at $37.36 per share with the net proceeds used to prepay a portion of the amount outstanding under our April 2006 Credit Facility. Redeemed the Series D preferred stock that had been issued to NASD. NASD no longer maintains voting control over us. Our 2006 results were impacted by the following: Improved gross margin (revenues less cost of revenues) from our Market Services segment. Gross margin from Market Services increased $138.2 million, or 46.1%, to $437.9 million in 2006, compared with $299.7 million in 2005 due to the following: Increases in our market share and average daily share volume partially offset by higher cost of revenues and a decline in the subscriber base for legacy access services products which we discontinued as of December 31, 2005. Nasdaq market share increased primarily due to the INET 38 Table of Contents acquisition as our 2006 results include INET operations for a full year compared with less than one month of operations in 2005. The increase in cost of revenues was due to an increase in liquidity rebates and an increase in clearance, brokerage and exchange fees also primarily due to our market share increase resulting from the INET acquisition. Increase in market subscription users which increased our Market Services subscriptions fees. Removal of Nasdaq Quotation Dissemination Services, or NQDS, from the UTP Plan, reducing overall shareable UTP revenues. Increase in revenues from our Issuer Services segment. Revenues increased $22.9 million, or 10.1%, to $249.0 million in 2006, compared with $226.1 million in 2005, primarily due to our recent acquisitions. Increase in total expenses of $61.0 million, or 14.8%, to $473.3 million in 2006 compared with $412.3 million in 2005 as a result of the INET integration and additional cost reduction activities and recent acquisitions. Increase in net interest expense of $58.9 million to $66.5 million in 2006 compared with $7.6 million in 2005 as a result of additional debt issued to finance the acquisition of INET and our investment in the LSE. Dividend income of $16.2 million in 2006 due to the receipt of ordinary dividends from our investment in the LSE. Gain on foreign currency option contracts of $48.4 million in 2006. We purchased foreign currency option contracts in order to hedge the foreign exchange exposure on our acquisition bid for the LSE. This position is marked-to-market at each reporting period resulting in gains and losses, which are included in net income. These current and prior year items are discussed in more detail below. Business Environment Nasdaq serves listed companies, market participants and investors by providing a high quality cash equity market, thereby enabling corporate growth and entrepreneurship. In broad terms, our business performance is impacted by a number of drivers including macroeconomic events affecting the risk and return of financial assets, investor sentiment regarding the outlook for equity investments, the regulatory environment for primary and secondary equity markets, and changing technology in the financial services industry. Our future revenues, gross margin and net income will continue to be influenced by domestic and international trends including: the number of companies seeking equity financing, which is affected by factors such as investor demand, the economy, alternative sources of financing, and tax and regulatory policies; trading volumes, particularly in U.S. equity securities, which are driven primarily by overall macroeconomic conditions; competition for listings and trading executions related to pricing, and product and service offerings; and other technological advancements and regulatory developments Currently our business drivers are characterized by moderate economic growth in response to the policy actions of a number of global central banks, positive U.S. investor sentiment evidenced by record highs in a number of major domestic stock market indices, significant regulatory changes in the U.S. and the European Union, and continued rapid evolution and deployment of new technology in the financial services industry. The business environment created by these drivers and driving our financial performance can be characterized as follows: a robust environment for equity issuance with capital raised by Nasdaq issuers hitting a six year high; 39 Table of Contents continuing growth of financing alternatives to public equity for both new and established companies; strong equity trading volumes in the U.S. and internationally; intense competition among U.S. exchanges for both equity trading volume and listings; globalization of customers and competitors extending competitive horizon beyond U.S.; customers demands for speed, capacity, and reliability require continuing investment in technology; and regulation NMS in the U.S. likely to increase competition for trading volume and data revenue. 2007 Outlook We believe the completion of the integration of Nasdaq legacy execution system and the Brut and INET execution systems onto a single platform has provided the foundation for improved execution quality and speed, while maintaining the attributes of The Nasdaq Market Center, including market making functionality, attributed quotes, and the Opening, Closing, Halt and IPO Crosses. Furthermore, the single platform will create additional cost savings as legacy trading and support hardware and systems are no longer required. These improvements in The Nasdaq Market Center are the foundations for our plans to continue to increase our market share of U.S. equity trading. Market share gains by The Nasdaq Market Center are expected to raise the value of our proprietary market data products, while the introduction of new data products currently under development and the continuing adoption of our flagship TotalView book feed are also expected to drive our results for the coming year. Beginning in the second quarter of 2007, we anticipate that the remaining elements of Regulation NMS will be implemented. We believe that the full implementation of this regulation will lead to moderate increases in average daily share volume as formerly manual exchanges complete their automation processes. These volume increases should benefit all aspects of our Market Services segment. Also during the coming year for our Issuer Services segment, company listings should continue to benefit as the climate for IPOs and secondary offerings remains positive. Finally, we will look for additional sources of revenue through enhanced product offerings and/or potential acquisitions that complement our business. Acquisition of LSE We, through our wholly-owned subsidiary NAL hold an investment in the LSE totaling approximately 28.8% of the issued ordinary share capital of the LSE. We acquired these shares from LSE shareholders in a series of purchases beginning in April 2006. On March 9, 2006, we submitted a non-binding indication of interest to acquire the LSE which was rejected by the board of LSE. In November 2006, we announced the terms of final offers to acquire all of the ordinary share capital of LSE not already owned by NAL at a price of 1,243 pence per share and all of the B Share Capital of LSE at a price of 200 pence (plus accrued dividend) per share. These final offers lapsed on February 10, 2007. We will continue to explore and evaluate strategic opportunities in the global markets to build on our existing position as the largest electronic equities exchange in the United States. We have a highly disciplined approach to acquisitions and will only consummate transactions to the extent they deliver clear and visible benefits for our shareholders, and enable us to allocate benefits to market participants. See Item 1. Business Acquisition Strategy and Item 1A. Risk factors Future acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures may require significant resources and/or result in significant unanticipated losses, costs and liabilities for further discussion. 40 Table of Contents Business Segments We manage, operate and provide our products and services in two business segments: Market Services and Issuer Services. Market Services segment includes our transaction-based business (The Nasdaq Market Center) and our market information services business (Nasdaq Market Services Subscriptions), which are interrelated because the transaction-based business generates the quote and trade information that we sell to market participants and data vendors. Issuer Services segment includes our securities listings business, insurance business, shareholder and newswire services (Corporate Client Group) and our financial products business (Nasdaq Financial Products). The companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market represent a diverse array of industries. This diversity of Nasdaq-listed companies allows us to develop industry-specific and other Nasdaq indexes that we use to develop and license financial products and associated derivatives. Because of these interrelationships, our management allocates resources, assesses performance and manages these businesses as two separate segments. See Note 20, Segments, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Cost Reductions and Operating Efficiencies During the past several years, we have taken significant steps to grow our business and enhance our competitive position. We have successfully reduced technology costs, eliminated non-core products, scaled back our workforce and consolidated our real estate facilities and operations. The INET integration has accelerated our migration to a low-cost trading platform and is resulting in significant operating synergies. During 2006, we incurred incremental pre-tax expenses of approximately $40.9 million in connection with taking actions to improve our operational efficiency, including the integration of INET. In 2005, we incurred similar charges of approximately $20.0 million, net. Excluding the release of a sublease loss reserve described in Note 5, Cost Reduction Program, INET Integration and Strategic Review, total pre-tax charges taken during 2005 were $32.1 million. Some of the key steps we have taken to reduce our costs and expenses include: Reducing our computer operations and data communications expense primarily through the renegotiation of contracts with major suppliers and a reduction in the number of technology operating platforms that we support. In 2006, our computer operations and data communications expense was $41.5 million compared with $62.4 million for 2005, a decrease of $20.9 million, or 33.5%. Reducing our headcount by eliminating 100 positions during 2006 as a result of our cost reduction program. However, headcount increased from 865 at December 31, 2005 to 904 at December 31, 2006, in part as a result of 119 employees acquired in the PrimeNewswire and Shareholder.com acquisitions. Further consolidating our real estate facilities. In July 2006, we completed the sale of our building and related assets located in Trumbull, Connecticut. Also, in 2006, we consolidated our data centers and reduced floor space without impact to our customers, which will result in lower annual technology costs. As of December 31, 2006, we occupy approximately 487,400 square feet and are committed to approximately 566,600 square feet; of this committed amount, we have sublet approximately 74,300 square feet and approximately 4,900 square feet remains available for sublease. 41 Table of Contents Sources of Revenues Market Services Nasdaq Market Center The Nasdaq Market Center is our transaction-based platform that provides our market participants with the ability to access to The Nasdaq Stock Market execution services, such as quoting and trading capabilities, and reporting services such as trade reporting and risk management. We provide these services for Nasdaq-listed and non-Nasdaq-listed securities. Until September 30, 2005, we also provided these services for securities authorized for trading on the OTCBB. Effective October 1, 2005, we transferred responsibility for the OTCBB to NASD. See Note 13, Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. On December 8, 2005, we completed our acquisition of INET. Our 2005 results include activity related to INET from December 8, 2005 through December 31, 2005 and our 2006 results include activity related to INET for the entire year. As noted above, we recently completed the integration of Nasdaq legacy execution system and the Brut and INET execution systems onto a single platform. We provide our customers with the ability to execute trades electronically in equity securities. The primary fee for these execution services is a transaction execution charge, assessed on a per share basis to the party that accesses the liquidity provided by another market participant. In most circumstances, we credit a portion of the per share execution charge as a rebate to the market participant that provides the liquidity. We also earn revenues based on our share of trading securities listed on the NYSE and Amex. Many of our competitors engage in aggressive price competition by reducing the transaction fees they charge customers for trade execution. As a result of this competition, during 2005, we significantly reduced the transaction fees we charge our customers for trade execution, particularly for large-volume customers. In early 2006, in connection with our acquisition of INET, we adjusted our transaction fees to harmonize our pricing structure with INET, whose fees had been higher than ours. In February 2007, we announced new equities pricing to harmonize the trading of Nasdaq-listed and non-Nasdaq-listed securities into one pricing schedule. Also, we announced a pricing change, effective March 1, 2007, that will lower access and routing fees for high volume customers. We periodically reexamine our pricing structure to ensure that our fees remain competitive. We also generate revenue by charging fees for trade reporting, trade comparison, order routing and providing risk management services. Although we do not currently charge market participants for most of the trades they report to us, we do earn revenues for all trades reported to us in the form of shared market information revenues under the UTP Plan for Nasdaq-listed securities, under the CTA Plan for NYSE-listed securities and the CQ Plan for Amex- and regional exchange-listed securities. Also, Nasdaq pays fees to the SEC pursuant to Section 31 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Section 31 fees. These fees are recorded as execution and trade reporting revenues with a corresponding amount recorded as cost of revenues. The Section 31 fees are designed to recover the costs to the government of supervision and regulation of securities markets and securities professionals. Nasdaq collects the fees as a pass-through charge from organizations executing eligible trades on Nasdaq legacy execution system or exchange platforms (INET and Brut platforms) and recognizes these amounts in cost of revenues when invoiced. Section 31 fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the SEC is remitted semiannually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. Since the amount recorded in revenues is equal to the amount recorded in cost of revenues, there is no impact on Nasdaq gross margin or net income. Finally, The Nasdaq Market Center generates revenue by providing market participants with a front-end workstation and by offering several different alternatives to access The Nasdaq Market Center. The type of connectivity is determined by the level of functionality a customer needs. During 2005, we completed the necessary steps to exit a low-margin business related to our legacy service products and associated proprietary network. See Operating Results-Nasdaq Market Center. 42 Table of Contents Nasdaq Market Services Subscriptions The primary source of revenues for Nasdaq Market Services Subscriptions is the collection and dissemination of price quotations and information regarding price and volume of executed trades. We collect information, distribute it and earn revenues in two capacities: as a member of the UTP Plan and as a distributor of our proprietary market data. We also operate as the exclusive Securities Information Processor as part of the UTP Plan for the collection and dissemination of the best bid and offer information and last transaction information from the exchanges and markets that quote and trade in Nasdaq-listed securities. In our role as the Securities Information Processor, we disseminate information to data vendors, which the data vendors then sell to the public. After deducting our expenses incurred as the Securities Information Processor, we distribute the tape fees to the respective UTP Plan participants, including ourselves, based on a combination of the participants respective annual trade volume and share volume. Since our sharing in the UTP Plan is based on our market share, our revenues from the sale of market information products and services are under competitive pressure from other securities exchanges that trade Nasdaq-listed securities. As a result, we implemented the General Revenue Sharing Program, which provided an incentive for quoting market participants to send orders and report trades to The Nasdaq Market Center to stabilize Nasdaq share of UTP Plan revenues. On July 1, 2006, we changed the terms of this program and renamed our revenue sharing program the Nasdaq Data Revenue Sharing Program. This new program continues to provide incentives to quoting participants by sharing revenue on internal trades reported to us. In the second quarter of 2006, upon consultation with the SEC, it was determined that the approval of Amendment 13 to the UTP Plan on February 7, 2006 resulted in the immediate removal of NQDS from the UTP Plan. As a result, we were no longer required to share revenues from NQDS, the best quote information from each market participant, effective as of February 7, 2006. We still are required to share UTP Plan revenues related to trade reports and the best priced quotations in our market, or Level 1. In addition to NQDS, we also sell other proprietary data products based on information from market participants that choose to display trading interest on The Nasdaq Market Center, most notably TotalView, our flagship market depth quote product. We operate several other proprietary services and data feed products, including the Mutual Fund Quotation Service, or MFQS; the Mutual Fund Dissemination Service; our financial websites, Nasdaq.com and NasdaqTrader.com; Nasdaq Index Dissemination Service and OpenView, which is similar to TotalView, but displays market depth for NYSE- and Amex-listed securities. Within the past year, we launched ModelView, a web-based historical data product intended to provide more comprehensive information regarding The Nasdaq Market Center liquidity and NasdaqMAX, a package of four new data products (including Velocity and Forces) that provide a new level of transparency to trading activity in Nasdaq-listed securities. See Item 1. Business Products and Services for a discussion of our proprietary data products. Issuer Services Corporate Client Group The Corporate Client Group provides customer support services and products to Nasdaq-listed companies and is responsible for obtaining new listings on The Nasdaq Stock Market. We charge issuers an initial listing fee, a fee for listing of additional shares and an annual fee. The initial listing fee for securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market includes a listing application fee and a total shares outstanding fee. The fee for listing of additional shares is based on the total shares outstanding, which we review quarterly. Annual fees for securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market are based on total shares outstanding. In the beginning of 2005, Nasdaq increased the amount of its annual fees for both The Nasdaq National Market and The Nasdaq Capital Market in a range of approximately 14.0% to 31.0%. Initial listing and listing of additional shares fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods, which are six and four years, respectively, based on our historical listing experience, pursuant to the requirements of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 13: Revenue 43 Table of Contents Recognition, or SAB Topic 13. In February 2007, the SEC approved a new pricing structure for our annual listing fees. This new schedule generally increases the annual and listing of additional shares fees listed companies pay to us, as well as the initial listing fee to list on The Nasdaq Capital Market. In the first quarter of 2006, we announced the creation of The Nasdaq Global Select Market, a new listing tier with the highest initial listing standards in the world. The Nasdaq Global Select Market became effective on July 3, 2006 and approximately 1,200 companies qualified for this new market tier. In conjunction with the creation of the new tier, we renamed The Nasdaq National Market, The Nasdaq Global Market. The Nasdaq Capital Market was not renamed. All three market tiers maintain rigorous listing and corporate governance standards and issuers listing on these markets have the opportunity to leverage an array of Nasdaq corporate services. On January 1, 2005, we purchased the remaining 50.0% interest in the Nasdaq Insurance Agency from AIG for nominal consideration. The agency provides insurance brokerage services and specializes in the director and officer liability insurance market. On October 1, 2005, we completed the acquisition of Carpenter Moore, an insurance brokerage firm specializing in management liability. The purchases of the Nasdaq Insurance Agency and Carpenter Moore provide current and future Nasdaq-listed companies and other customers with a full service corporate insurance broker offering customized risk management advice and insurance placement services. Carpenter Moore also added depth of brokerage expertise in directors and officers, errors and omissions and other management liability insurance products, and has significantly expanded regional coverage. On February 1, 2006, we completed the acquisition of Shareholder.com, a firm specializing in shareholder communications and investor relations intelligence services. Shareholder.com continues to offer its comprehensive suite of services to all publicly traded companies who wish to optimize investor relations capabilities. On September 1, 2006, we completed the acquisition of PrimeNewswire, a press release newswire services firm. PrimeNewswire further enhances Nasdaq investor relations and corporate communications suite. Our 2006 results include activity related to Shareholder.com from February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006 and PrimeNewswire from September 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. Results for Carpenter Moore are included beginning October 1, 2005. See Purchase Acquisitions and Combinations, of Note 3, Business Combinations, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Nasdaq Financial Products Nasdaq develops and licenses Nasdaq-branded indexes, associated derivatives and financial products as part of Nasdaq Financial Products. Nasdaq license fees for its trademark licenses vary by product based on assets or number or underlying dollar value of contracts issued. In addition to generating licensing revenues for Nasdaq, these products, particularly mutual funds and ETFs lead to increased investments in companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market, which enhances our ability to attract new listings. The recent outcome of two court cases has impacted Nasdaq ability to collect licensing revenues beginning in the third quarter of 2006, for options on ETFs that track our indexes (such as QQQ). In September 2005, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed actions brought by McGraw-Hill and Dow Jones against an options market that threatened to trade options on ETFs based on their proprietary indexes without a license. This dismissal was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in June 2006. The Second Circuit ruled that markets, in facilitating the trading of options on ETFs, are not misappropriating any intellectual property right of index providers. We are replacing this loss in revenues by continuing to develop, create, and license new indexes for financial instruments. In 2007, subject to SEC approval, we plan to launch our Portal Trading System, a system allowing for online trading of securities pursuant to Rule 144A. The Portal Market will then be a comprehensive offering including capital formation, trading, data and financial products. In 2006, we continued to facilitate the processing service for Rule 144A eligible securities through Portal with nearly 2,700 applications processed. 44 Table of Contents Nasdaq Operating Results Key Drivers The following table includes data showing average daily share volume in Nasdaq-listed securities and the percentage of share volume of Nasdaq- NYSE- and AMEX-listed securities reported to The Nasdaq Market Center.

(1) Includes Section 31 fees of $170.6 million in 2006, $29.3 million in 2005 and $1.7 million in 2004. The increase in 2006 is primarily due to a full year of INET operations compared with less than one month in 2005 and fees collected as a result of Nasdaq operation as a national securities exchange, beginning August 1, 2006 for Nasdaq-listed securities. The increase in 2005 compared with 2004 is due to a full year of Brut operations compared with less than four months in 2004. (2) See footnote 1 of Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data, for discussion of change in reporting liquidity rebates. (3) In the third quarter of 2006, Nasdaq began reporting Nasdaq Market Services Subscriptions revenues as proprietary and non-proprietary revenues. Prior to the third quarter of 2006, Nasdaq reported revenues from both proprietary and non-proprietary products as Nasdaq Market Services Subscriptions revenues. Revenues from non-proprietary products are eligible UTP Plan revenues which are shared among UTP Plan participants and include revenues from Level 1. Prior to the second quarter of 2006, non-proprietary revenues also included NQDS. However, effective February 7, 2006, Nasdaq is no longer required to share revenues from NQDS thereby reducing non-proprietary revenues and the amount of revenue shared with UTP Plan participants. Proprietary revenues now include NQDS revenues as well as revenues from TotalView, our flagship market depth quote product and other proprietary services and data feed products. Nasdaq Market Center Execution and trade reporting revenues increased in 2006 compared with 2005 and in 2005 compared with 2004. The increase in 2006 was primarily due to the inclusion of INET results as well as increases in market share for NYSE- and Amex-listed securities and increases in average daily share volume. In February 2006, we harmonized our pricing on Nasdaq-listed securities across all of our venues and introduced new pricing on 46 Table of Contents NYSE-listed securities, which further contributed to the increase in revenues. The Nasdaq-listed pricing increased the execution fees for Brut and Nasdaq legacy execution systems, but decreased the execution fees for INET. Also, as discussed above, effective August 1, 2006, as a result of Nasdaq operation as a national securities exchange additional Section 31 fees were recorded as execution and trade reporting revenues with a corresponding amount recorded as cost of revenues. Since the amount recorded in revenues is equal to the amount recorded in cost of revenues, there is no impact on Nasdaq gross margin or net income. Section 31 fees were $170.6 million in 2006, $29.3 million in 2005 and $1.7 million in 2004. The increase in 2006 is primarily due to a full year of INET operations compared with less than one month in 2005 and the fees collected as a result of Nasdaq operation as a national securities exchange. The increase in 2005 compared with 2004 is due to a full year of Brut operations compared with less than four months in 2004. The increase in 2005 of execution and trade reporting revenues was primarily due to increases in trade execution market share for Nasdaq-, NYSE- and Amex-listed securities, an increase in the percentage of share volume reported to Nasdaq systems (despite a decrease in average daily share volume) and additional trading activity due to the acquisitions of Brut and INET. In 2004, Brut results were included beginning September 7, 2004, compared with a full year of operations in 2005. Partially offsetting these increases were decreases in trade reporting and fee reductions for The Nasdaq Market Center introduced in 2004. Despite this increase in execution and trade reporting revenues, gross margin from The Nasdaq Market Center decreased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to increases in the amount that Nasdaq rebated as a result of the increases from Brut activity, additional INET activity and an increase in market share. Access services revenues decreased in 2006 compared with 2005 and in 2005 compared with 2004 primarily due to the retirement of our legacy access services products and associated proprietary network in the fourth quarter of 2005, when we completed the transition to the new Nasdaq Workstation. Beginning in 2005, we migrated users away from our legacy access services products towards our new QIX protocol, FIX connectivity and new Nasdaq Workstation, all of which operate over third-party networks. By doing so, we were able to reduce our technology and network costs and increase our systems scalability without affecting performance or reliability. The revenues for these discontinued products totaled $58.3 million in 2005 and $74.1 million in 2004. Expenses related to the discontinued products were $46.5 million in 2005 and $94.3 million in 2004. The industry standards and third-party products are more efficient and cost effective but produce lower revenues. However, these products contribute more to our operating results than our legacy access services products. Also contributing to the decrease in 2005 compared with 2004 were continued market participant consolidations. Partially offsetting the decrease in 2006, were access services revenues from INET and the new Nasdaq Workstation and increased revenues from FIX and QIX. We share tape fee revenues from NYSE- and Amex-listed securities through The Nasdaq Market Center tape fee revenue sharing. We earn tape fee revenues from NYSE- and Amex-listed securities based upon both the percentage of trades reported to The Nasdaq Market Center for securities listed on these exchanges and the size of NYSE and Amex revenue sharing pools. The increases in 2006 compared with 2005 and 2005 compared with 2004 were primarily due to an increase in trade execution market share in both NYSE- and Amex-listed securities. In 2006, the increase in trade execution market share was partially offset by amounts retained that pre-acquisition were shared with INET, and pricing changes in February 2006 which eliminated certain trades from being eligible for revenue sharing. The Nasdaq Market Center shared revenues under the Nasdaq General Revenue Sharing Program through the second quarter of 2006. This discretionary program required us to share operating revenue, which is interpreted to mean net revenue after expenses from all services that derive revenue, from member trading and trade reporting activity in Nasdaq-listed securities. The program was designed to provide an incentive for quoting market participants to send orders and report trades to The Nasdaq Market Center. Under a new program introduced in the third quarter of 2006, we have refocused the revenue sharing program to trades that are reported to the TRF. The total amount of revenue shared with market participants has decreased in 2006 and 2005. See Nasdaq Market Services Subscriptions below for further discussion of the revenue sharing programs. 47 Table of Contents The Nasdaq Market Center liquidity rebates, in which we credit a portion of the per share execution charge to the market participant that provides the liquidity, increased in 2006 compared with 2005 and in 2005 compared with 2004. The 2005 comparison includes $35.5 million and the 2004 comparison includes $130.1 million recorded net in total revenues which was before Nasdaq Limitation of Liability Rule. The increase in liquidity rebates in 2006 was primarily due to the inclusion of INET results for a full year of operations as well as an increases in average daily share volume and increases in trade execution market share for NYSE- and Amex-listed securities. In February 2006, we harmonized our pricing for all of our venues, which increased the per share liquidity rebates for INET, but decreased the per share liquidity rebates for Brut and Nasdaq legacy execution system. Also beginning February 2006, we began paying rebates on NYSE- and Amex-listed securities. The increase in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to a full year of Brut operations compared with four months in 2004, additional activity from INET operations and increases in market share. Brokerage, clearance and exchange fees are additional cost of revenues for the Brut and INET platforms and beginning August 1, 2006, for Nasdaq legacy execution system. The increase in brokerage, clearance and exchange fees for 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to the inclusion of INET results for a full year as well as increases in average daily share volume and increases in trade execution market share for NYSE- and Amex-listed securities and additional Section 31 fees due to Nasdaq operations as an exchange. As noted above, effective August 1, 2006, as a result of Nasdaq operations as an exchange, additional Section 31 fees were recorded as execution and trade reporting revenues as well as a corresponding cost of revenues. The increase in brokerage, clearance and exchange fees for 2005 compared with 2004 was due to a full year of Brut operations, additional activity from INET operations and increases in market share. Nasdaq Market Services Subscriptions Proprietary revenues increased in 2006 compared with 2005 and in 2005 compared with 2004. The increase in 2006 was primarily due to the classification change of NQDS revenues as non-proprietary to proprietary. As discussed above, effective February 7, 2006, Nasdaq is no longer required to share revenues from NQDS. Also contributing to the increase in 2006 was an increase in TotalView subscribers and related revenues and a price increase for MFQS due to functionality improvements. Partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in OTCBB revenues related to the transfer of the OTCBB back to NASD. The increase in proprietary revenues in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to an increase in TotalView subscribers and the launch of OpenView in January 2005. Non-proprietary revenues decreased in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily due to the classification change of NQDS revenues as discussed above. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in the number of Level 1 non-professional users and an audit of data usage by a major market distributor in the first quarter of 2006. Non-proprietary revenues were relatively flat in 2005 compared with 2004 as the number of Level 1 and NQDS subscriptions remained relatively flat year over year. We also share Market Services Subscriptions revenues under revenue sharing programs. Prior to the third quarter of 2006, we shared Nasdaq Market Services Subscriptions revenues under the Nasdaq General Revenue Sharing Program. Effective July 1, 2006, we changed the terms of this program and under the new Nasdaq Data Revenue Sharing Program, now share 50.0% of internal trades reported to us. The amount of Nasdaq Market Services Subscriptions revenues shared under Nasdaq revenue sharing programs increased in 2006 compared with 2005 and decreased in 2005 compared with 2004 primarily due to changes in the amount shared under the programs. Nasdaq also shares tape fee revenues for Nasdaq-listed securities through the UTP Plan. Under the revenue sharing provision of the UTP Plan, we are permitted to deduct costs associated with acting as the exclusive Securities Information Processor from the total amount of tape fees collected. After these costs are deducted from the tape fees, we distribute to the respective UTP Plan participants, including Nasdaq, their share of tape fees based on a combination of their respective trade volume and share volume. Our tape fee revenue sharing 48 Table of Contents allocated to UTP Plan participants decreased in 2006 compared with 2005 and in 2005 compared with 2004. The decrease in 2006 was primarily due to an increase in our UTP market share primarily due to the INET acquisition which resulted in INET trades being reported to us in 2006, decreasing the amount Nasdaq shared with UTP participants. Also, as discussed above Nasdaq is no longer required to share revenues from NQDS thereby reducing the amount of revenue shared with UTP Plan participants. The decrease in UTP Plan revenue sharing in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to a stronger market share resulting from including Brut trade reporting activity for a full year, decreasing the amount Nasdaq shared with UTP participants. Brut began to report its trades to The Nasdaq Market Center on September 1, 2004. Partially offsetting the stronger market share in 2005 was a reduction in the costs of operating the Securities Information Processor and administering the UTP Plan. Due to significant cost reduction efforts within Nasdaq, Nasdaq has been able to reduce the costs of those activities, to the benefit of all UTP Plan exchanges that trade Nasdaq-listed securities, which resulted in an increase in net shareable income. Other Market Services Other Market Services revenues increased in 2006 compared with 2005 and in 2005 compared with 2004. These increases were primarily due to a contract between NASD and Nasdaq for the operations of the OTCBB, which took effect on October 1, 2005. We transferred responsibility for the OTCBB back to NASD, but agreed to continue to operate the OTCBB on a contract basis for two years, subject to renewals. Also contributing to the increase in 2005 was the receipt of revenues from NASD for technology and development support services that we provide to NASD for a fixed income trade reporting platform beginning November 1, 2004. Nasdaq entered into a new contract with NASD in November 2004 for the technology and development support services. See Note 13, Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. ISSUER SERVICES The following table shows the revenues from our Issuer Services segment: Year Ended December 31, Percentage Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 (in millions) Issuer Services: Corporate Client Group $ 209.5 $ 187.6 $ 165.3 11.7 % 13.5 % Nasdaq Financial Products 39.5 38.5 40.5 2.6 % (4.9 )% Total Issuer Services revenues $ 249.0 $ 226.1 $ 205.8 10.1 % 9.9 % Corporate Client Group The following table shows our revenues from the Corporate Client Group as reported in accordance with GAAP ( as reported ) and as would be reported on a non-GAAP basis ( billed basis ). We believe that the presentation of billed basis revenues, as they relate to listing of additional shares and initial listing fees, is a good indicator of current Corporate Client Group activity as billed basis information excludes the effects of recognizing revenues related to initial listing fees and listing of additional shares fees over the six and four year periods, respectively. Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 As Reported Billed Basis As Reported Billed Basis As Reported Billed Basis (in millions) Annual renewal fees $ 107.9 $ 107.9 $ 107.8 $ 107.8 $ 91.4 $ 91.4 Listing of additional shares fees 36.9 36.0 37.6 37.4 36.8 45.9 Initial listing fees 23.2 24.5 29.2 24.5 31.1 27.1 Corporate Client services 41.5 41.5 13.0 13.0 6.0 6.0 Total Corporate Client Group revenues $ 209.5 $ 209.9 $ 187.6 $ 182.7 $ 165.3 $ 170.4 49 Table of Contents Percentage Change 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 As Reported Billed Basis As Reported Billed Basis Annual renewal fees 0.1 % 0.1 % 17.9 % 17.9 % Listing of additional shares fees (1.9 )% (3.7 )% 2.2 % (18.5 )% Initial listing fees (20.5 )% (6.1 )% (9.6 )% Corporate Client services # # # # Total Corporate Client Group revenues 11.7 % 14.9 % 13.5 % 7.2 % # Denotes a variance equal to or greater than 100.0%. Corporate Client Group revenues are primarily derived from fees for annual renewals, listing of additional shares and initial listings for companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market and from Corporate Client services. Fees are generally calculated based upon total shares outstanding for the issuing company. These fees are initially deferred and amortized over the estimated periods for which the services are provided. Revenues from annual renewal fees are amortized on a pro-rata basis over the calendar year and initial listing fees and listing of additional shares fees are amortized over six and four years, respectively. The difference between the as reported revenues and the billed basis revenues is due to the amortization of fees in accordance with GAAP. See Note 8, Deferred Revenue, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Corporate Client services revenues includes revenues from the Nasdaq Insurance Agency beginning January 1, 2005, Carpenter Moore beginning October 1, 2005, Shareholder.com beginning February 1, 2006, PrimeNewswire beginning September 1, 2006 and other sources for all periods presented. Annual renewal fees on both an as reported and billed basis were flat in 2006 compared with 2005 and increased in 2005 compared with 2004. The number of companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market on January 1, 2006 was 3,208 and 3,271 on January 1, 2005, the date on which listed companies are billed their annual fees. The decrease in the number of listed companies in 2005 was due to 332 delistings by Nasdaq during 2005, partially offset by 269 new listings in 2005. Primarily offsetting the decrease in the number of listed companies was an increase in the average total shares outstanding for The Nasdaq Global Select Market and The Nasdaq Global Market, which increased the annual renewal fees billed. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to an increase in the annual renewal fees in 2005 for both The Nasdaq National Market and The Nasdaq Capital Market in the range of approximately 14.0% to 31.0%. A decrease in the number of companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market partially offset the increase in fees in 2005. There were 3,333 companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market on January 1, 2004 compared with 3,271 on January 1, 2005. The decrease in the number of listed companies in 2004 was due to 322 issuers delisted by Nasdaq during 2004, partially offset by 260 new listings in 2004. The delistings in 2005 and 2004 were primarily a result of mergers and acquisitions, but were also because of companies failure to meet our listing standards. Listing of additional shares fees on both an as reported and billed basis decreased in 2006 compared with 2005. The billed basis decrease was primarily due to a decline in secondary offerings. There were 214 secondary offerings in 2006 as compared to 222 secondary offerings in 2005. Listing of additional shares fees, on an as reported basis increased and on a billed basis decreased in 2005 compared with 2004. The billed basis decrease in 2005 was primarily due to a decline in secondary offerings as well as the size of the respective offerings. There were 222 secondary offerings in 2005 as compared to 233 secondary offerings in 2004. Initial listing fees, on an as reported basis, decreased and on a billed basis, remained flat in 2006 compared with 2005. Initial listing fees, on both an as reported and billed basis decreased in 2005 compared with 2004. The billed basis decrease in 2005 was primarily due to a decline in the number of initial public offerings. Also, contributing to the decrease in 2005 was the elimination of entry fees in 2005 for companies that switched to The Nasdaq National Market or The Nasdaq Capital Market from other exchanges and a decline in the number of companies that switched between The Nasdaq National Market and The Nasdaq Capital Market. Listed-companies are charged an entry fee for switching between the two Nasdaq markets. There were 285 new listings, 50 Table of Contents including 137 new initial public offerings, during 2006 compared with 269 new listings, including 126 new initial public offerings, during 2005. There were 260 new listings, including 148 new initial public offerings, during 2004. Corporate Client services revenues on both an as reported and billed basis increased in 2006 compared with 2005 and in 2005 compared with 2004 primarily due to revenues generated from recent acquisitions of the remaining interest in the Nasdaq Insurance Agency, Carpenter Moore, Shareholder.com and PrimeNewswire. Nasdaq Financial Products The following table shows revenues from Nasdaq Financial Products: Year Ended December 31, Percentage Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 (in millions) Licensing revenues $ 34.2 $ 34.5 $ 36.7 (0.9 )% (6.0 )% Other revenues 5.3 4.0 3.8 32.5 % 5.3 % Total Nasdaq Financial Products revenues $ 39.5 $ 38.5 $ 40.5 2.6 % (4.9 )% Licensing revenues decreased in 2006 compared with 2005 and in 2005 compared with 2004. The decrease in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to a decline in licensing fees associated with options traded on ETFs based on Nasdaq indexes. Recent court decisions have impacted our ability to collect licensing revenues for options on ETFs that track our indexes (such as QQQ). See Sources of Revenues Issuer Services Nasdaq Financial Products, for further discussion. Partially offsetting the decrease in 2006 was higher volume activity for both derivative and third party products as well as increases in third party assets under management. The decrease in 2005 was primarily due to reduced licensing revenues related to the QQQ as a result of its listing moving from Amex to The Nasdaq Stock Market in the fourth quarter of 2004. Other revenues increased in 2006 compared with 2005 and in 2005 compared with 2004. Nasdaq Financial Products, through its Portal Market, facilitates the eligibility for clearing and settlement services at DTCC of Portal/Rule 144A securities. The increase in other revenues in 2006 was primarily due to an increase in the number of applications seeking Portal designation. Expenses Direct Expenses The following table shows our direct expenses: Year Ended December 31, Percentage Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 (in millions) Compensation and benefits $ 195.7 $ 152.1 $ 148.2 28.7 % 2.6 % Marketing and advertising 20.5 9.0 12.8 # (29.7 )% Depreciation and amortization 70.9 67.0 76.3 5.8 % (12.2 )% Professional and contract services 32.0 29.1 23.7 10.0 % 22.8 % Computer operations and data communications 41.5 62.4 98.9 (33.5 )% (36.9 )% Provision for bad debts 0.5 3.0 1.1 (83.3 )% # Occupancy 34.1 28.4 28.7 20.1 % (1.0 )% General, administrative and other 44.3 19.5 41.1 # (52.6 )% Total direct expenses $ 439.5 $ 370.5 $ 430.8 18.6 % (14.0 )% # Denotes a variance greater than 100.0%. 51 Table of Contents Compensation and benefits expense increased in 2006 compared with 2005 and in 2005 compared with 2004 primarily due to our acquisitions of the remaining 50.0% interest in the Nasdaq Insurance Agency, Carpenter Moore and INET in 2005 and Shareholder.com and PrimeNewswire in 2006. Headcount increased from 786 employees on December 31, 2004 to 865 employees at December 31, 2005 to 904 employees at December 31, 2006 primarily from our acquisitions, partially offset by reductions in force as a result of our cost reduction plan. Also contributing to the increase in 2006 compared with 2005 was share-based compensation expense of $9.9 million recognized under SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, or SFAS 123(R), for 2006 compared with share-based compensation expense of $1.4 million for 2005 and $0.5 million for 2004. See Share-Based Compensation, of Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 12, Share-Based Compensation, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. The increases in 2006 and 2005 were also due to increased incentive compensation reflecting stronger financial performance. Marketing and advertising expense increased in 2006 compared with 2005 and decreased in 2005 compared with 2004. The increase in 2006 was primarily due to our new advertising campaign which began in the third quarter of 2006 and costs related to our new listings and dual listing advertisements. In 2005, there was a decline in overall marketing and advertising expenditures as part of Nasdaq cost reduction plan. Depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2006 compared with 2005 and decreased in 2005 compared with 2004. The increase in 2006 was primarily due to intangible amortization expense on identifiable intangible assets purchased in connection with our recent acquisitions, primarily INET, as 2006 includes a full year of amortization expense compared with less than 1 month in 2005. Also contributing to the increase was additional depreciation and amortization expense due to a previous change in the estimated useful life of some of The Nasdaq Market Center assets due to the integration of Nasdaq legacy execution system and the Brut and INET execution systems onto a single platform. These increases were partially offset by decreased depreciation expense related to other technology assets. The decrease in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to declines in incremental depreciation and amortization expense on equipment associated with Nasdaq quoting platform and its trading and quoting network as we migrated to lower cost operating environments as part of our cost reduction plan. However, as a result of the acquisition of INET, we began to migrate Nasdaq legacy execution system to INET trading system beginning December 8, 2005 and recorded additional amortization expense due to a change in estimated useful life of some of The Nasdaq Market Center assets, partially offsetting the decrease noted above. Also partially offsetting the decrease in 2005 was intangible amortization expense on identifiable intangible assets acquired in the INET, Brut, Nasdaq Insurance Agency and Carpenter Moore acquisitions. Professional and contract services expense increased in 2006 compared with 2005 and in 2005 compared with 2004. The increase in 2006 was primarily due to operating costs incurred from recent acquisitions, partially offset by lower technology consulting costs. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to reduced cost reimbursements for support services from NASD related to a new contract entered into with NASD on November 1, 2004 for a fixed income trade reporting platform. See Note 13, Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Also contributing to the increase in 2005 was an increase in professional fees associated with Sarbanes-Oxley compliance due to our recent acquisitions. Computer operations and data communications expense decreased in 2006 compared with 2005 and decreased in 2005 compared with 2004. The decreases were primarily due to lower costs associated with providing communication lines to customers due to the retirement of legacy access services products, which we discontinued as of December 31, 2005. Also contributing to the decrease in 2005 was lower costs due to the favorable renegotiation of certain maintenance contracts and hardware leases due to the planned retirement of certain equipment and our renegotiated contract with MCI effective in the second quarter of 2004. For further discussion of the discontinuation of legacy access services products, See Operating Results-Nasdaq Market Center. Provision for bad debts decreased in 2006 compared with 2005 and increased in 2005 compared with 2004. The decrease in 2006 was primarily due to an increase in collections and the collection of previously reserved aged receivables. As a result of the INET acquisition, an additional bad debt reserve for INET was recorded in 52 Table of Contents 2005 in order for INET to be in compliance with Nasdaq collection history and reserve policy, which increased the provision for bad debts in 2005. An increase in collections and decreases in past due account balances partially offset the increase in 2005. Occupancy expense increased in 2006 compared with 2005 and decreased in 2005 compared with 2004. The increase in 2006 was primarily due to additional costs from our recent acquisitions partially offset by lower rental expense due to our continued real estate consolidation plans. The decrease in 2005 was primarily due to consolidation of leased office space as part of Nasdaq cost reduction plans. General, administrative and other expense increased in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily due to losses incurred on the early extinguishment of debt, the refinancing of our $750.0 million senior term loan facility, a $5.9 million charge recorded on the write-down of a held-for-sale building to fair market value and a net benefit of $9.8 million recognized in 2005 related to decisions affecting our real estate plans as described below. Additionally, in 2006 we recorded charges totaling $2.2 million associated with potential fines or penalties for Brut obligations regarding short sales, firm quotes and other reporting and disclosure requirements. In connection with the early extinguishment of the $750.0 million senior term loan facility issued in December 2005, which was refinanced in April 2006, we recorded a charge of $12.3 million for the amortization of debt issuance costs. Additional losses totaling $9.7 million for the amortization of debt issuance costs were recorded on the early extinguishment of portions of the $1.1 billion secured term loan facility of our April 2006 Credit Facility (see Note 9, Debt Obligations, to the consolidated financial statements) which was repaid in May 2006 as a result of our equity offering and in November 2006 with excess cash flow. In 2005, we also had a $7.4 million loss on the restructuring of the $240.0 million convertible notes. These increases were partially offset by a realized foreign currency gain related to our investment in the LSE of $8.2 million. General, administrative and other expense decreased in 2005 compared with 2004 which was primarily due to decisions affecting Nasdaq real estate. In 2004, Nasdaq recorded sublease losses totaling $17.1 million primarily for expansion space at Nasdaq headquarters located in New York which Nasdaq management did not intend to occupy. However, as a result of the acquisition of INET, Nasdaq now occupies the expansion space for INET operations and recorded a release of the sublease loss reserve of $12.1 million, net of rental payments, in the fourth quarter of 2005. Nasdaq released a sublease loss reserve of $1.9 million, net of rental payments, in the third quarter of 2004, on leased property in Rockville, Maryland. Nasdaq management re-evaluated its decision to vacate this space and decided instead to sell a building owned by Nasdaq. We recorded a charge of $7.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 for the write-down of this building to fair market value. Nasdaq began marketing the building for sale in the fourth quarter of 2004 and completed the sale of the building in June 2005. Further contributing to the decrease in general and administrative expense was a $2.6 million loss recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004 on a lease transaction for certain of Nasdaq technology equipment. Partially offsetting the decrease was a $1.8 million charge recorded in the third quarter of 2005 for the change in the fair market value on the amount of additional payment to NASD for Nasdaq Series C Cumulative preferred stock, a $7.4 million loss recorded on the restructuring of the $240.0 million convertible notes in April 2005 in connection with the financing of the INET acquisition and a $1.1 million loss recorded on the early extinguishment of Nasdaq $25.0 million senior notes also in connection with the financing of the INET acquisition. See Note 3, Business Combinations, Note 5, 2006, 2005 and 2004 Cost Reduction Program, INET Integration and Strategic Review, Note 9, Debt Obligations, and Note 13, Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Support Costs From Related Parties, net Support costs from related parties, net were $33.8 million in 2006 compared with $41.8 million in 2005, a decrease of 19.1%, and were $45.6 million in 2004, a decrease of 8.3% in 2005 compared with 2004. These decreases were primarily due to the transfer of ownership of the OTCBB to NASD which reduced the associated regulatory costs. Also contributing to the decreases was a reduction in surveillance and other regulatory charges from NASDR primarily due to NASD review and allocation of expenses among the markets and members it regulates. After December 20, 2006, NASD is no longer a related party. See Note 1, Organization and Nature of Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 53 Table of Contents Net Interest Expense Net interest expense was $66.5 million in 2006 compared with $7.6 million in 2005 and $5.6 million in 2004, an increase of 35.7% in 2005 compared with 2004. The increase in 2006 was primarily due to additional interest expense on the April 2006 Credit Facility and the Credit Facilities (see Note 9, Debt Obligations, to the consolidated financial statements) resulting from the purchase of issued share capital of the LSE. For 2006, the increase was also due to additional interest expense from our $205 million convertible notes issued in April 2005 and from our $750 million senior term loan facility issued in December 2005 to finance the INET acquisition, partially offset by a lower interest coupon rate on our $240 million convertible notes. For 2006, we recorded higher interest income due to higher cash balances and interest rates, which partially offset the increase in net interest expense. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to additional interest expense from our $205.0 million convertible notes issued in April 2005 and from our $750.0 million senior term loan facility issued in December 2005, in connection with the financing of the INET acquisition. We recorded interest expense on the $750.0 million senior term loan facility since the date of the INET acquisition, December 8, 2005, through December 31, 2005. The increase was partially offset by interest income earned on the proceeds from the issuance of the $205.0 million convertible notes, which was held in a restricted cash account from April 22, 2005 through December 8, 2005, and a lower interest coupon rate on the $240.0 million convertible notes. See Note 3, Business Combinations, and Note 9, Debt Obligations, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Dividend Income Dividend income was $16.2 million in 2006 and represents ordinary dividends from our investment in the LSE in the second and fourth quarters of 2006. In order to hedge our foreign currency exposure on our fourth quarter dividend receivable from the LSE, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract. See Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. We received the cash for the dividend declared in the fourth quarter of 2006 in January 2007. Gain on Foreign Currency Option Contracts The unrealized gain on foreign currency option contracts was $48.4 million in 2006 and represents the gain on the mark-to-market of pound sterling option contracts purchased in the fourth quarter of 2006 in order to hedge the foreign exchange exposure on our acquisition bid for the LSE. This position is marked-to-market at each reporting period resulting in gains and losses, which are included in net income. See Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, for further discussion. In conjunction with the lapse of our final offer for the LSE, we traded out of these foreign currency option contracts in February 2006. Due to the improving exchange rate of the dollar when compared to the pound sterling, we recorded a pre-tax loss of approximately $7.8 million on these foreign currency option contracts in the first quarter of 2007. The cumulative realized pre-tax gain on the foreign currency option contracts is approximately $40.6 million. Minority Interest Minority interest was $0.9 million in 2006 compared with $0.2 million in 2005. We began recording minority interest for Reuters minority investment in the Independent Research Network, a joint venture created to help public companies obtain independent analyst coverage, beginning in the third quarter of 2005. Income Taxes Nasdaq income tax provision was $85.2 million in 2006 compared with $44.6 million in 2005, an increase of 91.0%, and was $0.7 million in 2004. The overall effective tax rate was 40.0% in 2006, 41.9% in 2005 and 54 Table of Contents 29.3% in 2004. The higher effective tax rate in 2005 when compared to 2006 and 2004 was primarily due to a loss on the restructuring of the $240.0 million convertible notes, a portion of which is not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes due to the conversion feature. In addition, in 2004 the effective tax rate was reduced by the realization of research and development tax credits as well as a reduction of a valuation allowance related to a foreign net operating loss carryforward. The effective tax rate may vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of earnings and losses. These same and other factors, including history of pre-tax earnings and losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets. In June 2006, the FASB issued a new interpretation of accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. See Future Accounting Requirements below for further discussion. Discontinued Operations During the second quarter of 2003, we announced the results of a strategic review of our operations designed to position us for improved profitability and growth. This strategic review included the elimination of non-core product lines and initiatives and resulted in a reduction in our workforce. As a result of the strategic review, Nasdaq supported the closing of the market operated by Nasdaq Europe S.A./N.V. and reached an agreement to transfer all of Nasdaq shares in Nasdaq Europe to one of that company original investors. Following the transfer of Nasdaq interest in Nasdaq Europe, results from this subsidiary were reclassified as discontinued operations in Nasdaq Consolidated Statements of Income. As part of the transaction, Nasdaq Europe new owner committed to seek to restructure the company obligations and, in that context, to request from certain major creditors releases of any claims they might have against Nasdaq Europe former directors, officers and shareholders (if such claims are related to Nasdaq prior ownership interest in Nasdaq Europe). Nasdaq recorded liabilities of $15.1 million that management believed were sufficient to satisfy any potential claims against Nasdaq. In the fourth quarter of 2004, Nasdaq was provided evidence that these claims (related to Nasdaq prior ownership interest in Nasdaq Europe) of certain creditors were satisfied or settled without any liability for Nasdaq and released the $15.1 million reserve it maintained in connection with such claims and liabilities. The release of the reserve was recorded as income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income, net of taxes of $5.6 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources We require cash to pay our operating expenses, make capital expenditures and service our debt and other long-term liabilities. Our principal source of funds is cash from our operations. We also have a $75.0 million revolving credit facility under our Credit Facilities to borrow funds. In addition, we have obtained funds by selling our common stock in the capital markets. In the near term, we expect that our operations will provide sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures and interest payments on our debt. In the long-term, we may use both internally generated funds and external sources to satisfy our debt and other long-term liabilities. Principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally-generated funds include: deterioration of our revenues in either of our business segments, changes in our working capital requirements, and an increase in our expenses. Principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include: financial covenants contained in our Credit Facilities that limit our total borrowing capacity, 55 Table of Contents increases in interest rates applicable to our floating rate term debt, credit rating downgrades, which could limit our access to additional debt, a decrease in the market price of our common stock, and volatility in the public equity markets. The following sections discuss the effects of changes in our cash flows, capital requirements and other commitments on our liquidity and capital resources. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Investments and Changes in Cash Flows The following tables summarize our cash and cash equivalents and investments and changes in cash flows: December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 Percentage Change (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 322.0 $ 165.2 94.9 % Available-for-sale investments, at fair value (1) 1,628.2 179.4 # Total $ 1,950.2 $ 344.6 # # Denotes a variance greater than 100.0%. (1) Available-for-sale investments include our $1.6 billion investment in the LSE. Year Ended December 31, Percentage Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 (in millions) Cash provided by operating activities $ 201.1 $ 120.9 $ 117.0 66.3 % 3.3 % Cash used in investing activities (1,274.4 ) (953.4 ) (201.3 ) 33.7 % # Cash provided by (used in) financing activities 1,230.1 939.5 (6.5 ) 30.9 % # # Denotes a variance greater than 100.0%. Cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments. Cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments increased from 2005 primarily as a result of our investment in the LSE, the receipt of funds from Nasdaq equity offerings in the first quarter of 2006 and May 2006, the receipt of a capital return and ordinary dividends relating to our LSE investment, the receipt of net proceeds from the sale of real estate, the collection of Section 31 fees and positive cash flow. These increases were partially offset by cash used to purchase our stake in the LSE, redeem our Series C Cumulative preferred stock, pay debt obligations, purchase foreign currency option contracts to hedge our acquisition bid for the LSE and acquire Shareholder.com and PrimeNewswire. Changes in Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities. The following items impacted our cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006: Net income of $127.9 million. Non-cash charges of approximately $49.4 million, comprised primarily of depreciation and amortization of $70.9 million and loss on the early extinguishment and refinancing of debt obligations of $22.0 million, partially offset by a gain on foreign currency option contracts of $48.4 million. Increase in other operating liabilities of $36.7 million, mainly due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other accrued liabilities of $47.2 million due to the recording of 56 Table of Contents additional Section 31 fees in connection with Nasdaq operations as an exchange and the inclusion of payables to NASD as third party payables at December 31, 2006. Partially offsetting the increase in operating liabilities was a decrease in accrued personnel costs, payables to related parties and other liabilities totaling $10.5 million due to timing of payments. During 2005, the following items impacted our cash provided by operating activities: Net income of $61.7 million. Non-cash charges of approximately $63.2 million, comprised primarily of depreciation and amortization of $67.0 million. Increase in other operating liabilities of $20.0 million, mainly due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and payables to related parties of $35.6 million due to timing of payments, partially offset by a decrease in accrued personnel costs, other accrued and other liabilities totaling $15.6 million. Partially offsetting the increase in operating liabilities was a decrease in other assets of $21.8 million. We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, share-based compensation and the timing and amount of other payments that we make. Cash used in investing activities. The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2006 compared with 2005 is primarily attributable to purchases of available-for-sale investments, including our purchase of LSE shares, purchase of foreign currency option contracts to hedge our acquisition bid for the LSE, and our acquisitions of Shareholder.com and PrimeNewswire, partially offset by proceeds from redemptions and maturities of available-for-sale investments and from the sale of our building in Connecticut. The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to our acquisitions of INET and Carpenter Moore, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of our building in Maryland. In 2004, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributed to our acquisition of Brut. Cash provided by financing activities. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily because of the proceeds we received from debt obligations and the net proceeds from our equity offerings in the first quarter of 2006 and May 2006, partially offset by funds used for payments of debt obligations and the redemption of our Series C Cumulative preferred stock. The increase in cash used in financing activities in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to proceeds we received from debt obligations, which we used to finance the acquisition of INET and was partially offset by funds used for payments of the partial redemption of our Series C Cumulative preferred stock. Capital Resources and Working Capital Working capital (calculated as current assets less current liabilities) was $1.9 billion at December 31, 2006, compared with $271.6 million at December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.6 billion. This increase was primarily due to our investment in the LSE and an increase in cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments as discussed above. We have historically been able to generate sufficient funds from operations to meet working capital requirements. At December 31, 2006, except for the un-drawn $75.0 million revolving credit facility obtained in connection with the Credit Facilities, we did not have any lines of credit. See May 2006 Credit Facility, of Note 9, Debt Obligations, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. At December 31, 2006, none of our lenders were affiliated with Nasdaq, except to the extent, if any, that H&F and SLP would be deemed affiliates of Nasdaq due to their ownership of the $240 million convertible notes and $201.4 million of the $205 million convertible notes and associated warrants. 57 Table of Contents Broker Dealer Net Capital Requirements Our broker-dealer subsidiaries, Nasdaq Execution Services, LLC (formerly Brut, LLC) and NASDAQ Options Services, LLC (formerly Island Execution Services, LLC), are subject to regulatory requirements intended to ensure their general financial soundness and liquidity, which require that they comply with minimum capital requirements. At December 31, 2006, Nasdaq Execution Services was required to maintain minimum net capital of $0.3 million and had total net capital of approximately $38.4 million or $38.1 million in excess of the minimum amount required. At December 31, 2006, NASDAQ Options Services was also required to maintain minimum net capital of $0.3 million and had total net capital of approximately $1.7 million or $1.4 million in excess of the minimum amount required. Credit Facilities In the second quarter of 2006, we entered into credit facilities to finance the purchase of the LSE shares. At December 31, 2006, total debt obligations outstanding under the Credit Facilities were $1.1 billion including a $75.0 million revolving credit facility still available to drawdown under the Credit Facilities. See Note 9, Debt Obligations, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Our significant debt has resulted in the downgrading of our credit rating by Moody to Ba3 from Ba2 and by Standard & Poor to BB from BB+. In addition, Moody lowered its ratings outlook to negative from stable. The Credit Facilities covenants, among other things, restrict our ability to grant liens, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, sell assets, make restricted payments, conduct transactions with affiliates and merge or consolidate. In addition, our convertible notes contain a covenant restricting our ability to incur senior debt, and as a consequence of our current debt outstanding under our Credit Facilities, our convertible notes would not permit us to incur additional senior debt without consent. New Credit Facility In order to finance our acquisition bid of the LSE, we entered into a new credit facility which became effective on November 20, 2006, or the New Credit Facility. The New Credit Facility provides for credit of up to approximately $5.1 billion of debt financing to be used for payment in respect of the acquisition of the issued LSE ordinary shares (and shares issuable pursuant to options convertible into ordinary shares) and the issued LSE B shares, transaction costs, working capital, and repayment of Nasdaq borrowings under its existing credit facilities as well as existing bonds of LSE to the extent that the holders of such bonds require the bonds to be redeemed. The initial funding under the New Credit Facility is subject to conditions customary in the United Kingdom for transactions of this type and will not occur until the offers have been declared unconditional in all respects. Although the final offers have lapsed, the New Credit Facility does not expressly terminate. See Note 9, Debt Obligations, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Equity Offerings In the first quarter of 2006, we completed a public offering of 15,979,513 shares of common stock, of which we sold 8,042,142 shares issued from common stock in treasury and NASD and other selling stockholders sold 7,937,371 shares. Other selling stockholders initially received their shares through the exercise of warrants they purchased in our 2000 and 2001 private placements. We used a portion of the net proceeds obtained from this offering to fund the redemption of our Series C Cumulative preferred stock. In May 2006, we completed another public offering of 18,500,000 shares of our common stock, for net proceeds of $665.2 million before the deduction of offering expenses. These proceeds were used to prepay a portion of the amount outstanding under the April 2006 Credit Facility. 58 Table of Contents Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Investments We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. See Note 7, Investments, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses, including foreign currency fluctuations, reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax where applicable. Nasdaq and its subsidiaries adhere to an investment policy approved by The Nasdaq Board of Directors for internally and externally managed portfolios. The goal of the policy is to maintain adequate liquidity at all times and to fund current budgeted operating and capital requirements and to maximize returns. All securities must meet credit rating standards as established by the policy and must be denominated in subsidiary specific currencies. The investment portfolio duration must not exceed 18 months. The policy prohibits the purchasing of any investment in equity securities, except for any purchases required by the SEC or for regulatory purposes. The policy also prohibits any investment in debt interest in an entity that derives more than 25.0% of its gross revenue from the combined broker-dealer and/or investment advisory businesses of all of its subsidiaries and affiliates. Nasdaq investment policy is reviewed annually and was re-approved by the Board on January 30, 2007. Nasdaq also periodically reviews its investments and investment managers. Our purchase of the LSE equity securities is not part of the scope of our investment policy. Our Board of Directors separately approved our investment in the LSE. We regularly monitor and evaluate the realizable value of its investment security portfolio. When assessing securities for other-than-temporary declines in value, we consider such factors as, among other things, the duration for which the market value had been less than cost, any news that has been released specific to the investee, analyst coverage and the outlook for the overall industry in which the investee operates. For equity securities we also consider the performance of the investee stock price in relation to industry indexes and review the investee credit profile. There were no impairment charges recorded on our investments during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. As of December 31, 2006, there were no hedges on our investments. However we periodically re-evaluate our hedging policies and may choose to enter into future transactions. Nasdaq does not currently hedge any variable interest rates on these securities. Fixed Income Securities As of December 31, 2006, our fixed income securities have an average duration of 0.09 years. Our primary investment objective for fixed income securities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and their fair values may fluctuate with changes in interest rates. However, management does not believe that a 100 basis point fluctuation in market interest rates will have a material effect on the carrying value of our fixed income securities at December 31, 2006. Investment in the LSE As of December 31, 2006, we own approximately 28.8% of the issued share capital of the LSE. The cost of this investment is approximately GBP 736.5 million, or $1,386.8 million. This investment is accounted for under SFAS 115 and as indicated above any unrealized gains or losses, including foreign currency fluctuations, are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income until sold or redeemed. The fair market value of our investment in the LSE is subject to market price volatility. As of December 31, 2006 the gross unrealized gain on our investment in the LSE was approximately $241.6 million which includes a foreign currency gain. 59 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2006, we purchased foreign currency option contracts in order to hedge the foreign exchange exposure on our acquisition bid for the LSE. This position is marked-to-market at each reporting period resulting in gains and losses, which are included in net income. As of December 31, 2006, the unrealized gain recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income was $48.4 million. As of December 31, 2006, we also purchased foreign currency forward contracts in order to hedge our foreign currency exposure on our fourth quarter dividend receivable from the LSE. We received the cash for the dividend declared in the fourth quarter of 2006 in January 2007. See Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Debt Obligations At December 31, 2006, both our $205 million and $240 million convertible notes specify fixed interest rates until October 22, 2012. However, our Credit Facilities specify floating interest rates until maturity in April 2012 and are therefore subject to interest rate risk. Management does not believe that a 100 basis point fluctuation in market interest rates will have a material effect on the carrying value of our outstanding floating rate debt obligations at December 31, 2006. However, due to the stock appreciation on the convertible option feature from $14.50 at the time of issuance to $30.79 at December 31, 2006, the fair value of Nasdaq convertible notes exceeds its carrying value. As of December 31, 2006, Nasdaq does not currently hedge any variable interest rates on our debt obligations. However we periodically reevaluate our hedging policies and may choose to enter into future transactions. Credit Risk We are exposed to credit risk from third parties, including customers, counterparties and clearing agents. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. In particular, our subsidiary Nasdaq Execution Services may be exposed to credit risk, due to the default of trading counterparties, in connection with the clearing and routing services Nasdaq Execution Services provides for our trading customers. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Brut execution system, the INET execution system and the portion of The Nasdaq Market Center that traded Nasdaq-listed securities were merged into a single platform. Trades executed on this single platform are exposed to these types of credit risks. System trades in Nasdaq-listed securities, NYSE-listed securities and those routed to other market centers for broker-dealer clients are cleared by Nasdaq Execution Services, as a member of the National Securities Clearing Corporation, or NSCC. Pursuant to the rules of the NSCC and Nasdaq Execution Services clearing agreement, Nasdaq Execution Services is liable for any losses incurred due to counterparty or a clearing agent failure to satisfy its contractual obligations, either by making payment or delivering securities. Adverse movements in the prices of securities that are subject to these transactions can increase our credit risk. However, we believe that the risk of material loss is limited, as Nasdaq Execution Services customers are not permitted to trade on margin and NSCC rules limit counterparty risk on self-cleared transactions by establishing credit limit and capital deposit requirements for all brokers that clear with NSCC. Nasdaq Execution Services has never incurred a liability due to a customer failure to satisfy its contractual obligations as counterparty to a system trade. Credit difficulties or insolvency or the perceived possibility of credit difficulties or insolvency of one or more larger or visible market participants could also result in market-wide credit difficulties or other market disruptions. We also have credit risk related to transaction fees that are billed to customers on a monthly basis, in arrears. Our potential exposure to credit losses on these transactions is represented by the receivable balances in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our customers are financial institutions whose ability to satisfy their contractual obligations may be impacted by volatile securities markets. Credit losses such as those described above could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations. 60 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Contingent Commitments Nasdaq has contractual obligations to make future payments under debt obligations by contract maturity, minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases, net and other obligations. The following table shows these contractual obligations at December 31, 2006: Payments due by period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years (in millions) Debt obligations by contract maturity (Note 9, Debt Obligations ) $ 1,505.8 $ 10.7 $ 21.3 $ 21.4 $ 1,452.4 Minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases, net (Note 18, Leases ) 215.4 25.9 43.2 39.5 106.8 Other obligations (Note 19, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantee ) 25.8 15.8 10.0 Total $ 1,747.0 $ 52.4 $ 74.5 $ 60.9 $ 1,559.2 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In connection with our registration as a national securities exchange, we completed an internal reorganization in November 2006. As part of the reorganization, The NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC, or the Exchange, assumed Nasdaq obligations under the 3.75% convertible notes due October 22, 2012 and the related Indenture. Nasdaq will guarantee the obligations of the Exchange under the indenture. See Obligations under Guarantee, of Note 19, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantee, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Nasdaq did not have any other off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2006. Critical Accounting Policies The following provides information about our critical accounting policies. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. These policies relate to revenue recognition and cost of revenues, reserve for bad debts, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, software costs and related party transactions. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Revenue Recognition and Cost of Revenues. Market Services revenues (84.9% of total revenues and 63.7% of gross margin in 2006) are derived from Nasdaq Market Center and Nasdaq Market Services Subscriptions revenues. Nasdaq Market Center revenues are variable, based on service volumes, and recognized as transactions occur. Nasdaq Market Services Subscriptions revenues are based on the number of presentation devices in service and quotes delivered through those devices. Nasdaq Market Services Subscriptions revenues are recognized in the month that information is provided. These revenues are recorded net of amounts due under revenue sharing arrangements with market participants. Pursuant to EITF 99-19, we record execution revenues from transactions on a gross basis in revenues and record related expenses such as liquidity rebate payments and execution costs as cost of revenues. We have recorded execution revenues related to the Brut and INET platforms on a gross basis since the related acquisitions, as Brut and INET have historically had risk as principal on transactions executed through their respective platforms. On February 1, 2006, Brut and INET merged together into a single broker-dealer, Brut, LLC, which was later renamed, Nasdaq Execution Services. All routed transactions are executed through Nasdaq Execution Services. Nasdaq Execution Services is registered with the SEC as a broker-dealer. Nasdaq Execution Services, as a broker-dealer, acts as principal to the transactions executed through The Nasdaq Market Center, which exposes Nasdaq Execution Services to clearance and 61 Table of Contents settlement risk. Starting with the second quarter of 2005, we have reported execution revenues from transactions on our legacy Nasdaq platform on a gross basis in revenues and reported related expenses as cost of revenues, as we have certain risk associated with trade execution, subject to rule limitations and caps, as a result of our Limitation of Liability Rule. This change in presentation was implemented on a prospective basis beginning April 1, 2005 as required under GAAP, as a direct result of the rule change. Following our move to a single platform, we continue to have execution risk on non-routed transactions that are conducted on our platform. We do not record a liability for any potential claims that may be submitted under the rule unless they meet the provisions of SFAS No. 5 Accounting for Contingencies , or SFAS 5. As such, losses arising as a result of the rule are accrued and charged to expense only if the loss is probable and estimable. Prior to the second quarter of 2005, execution revenues and the related expenses were recorded on a net basis as we did not act on a principal basis on any trades executed through our systems. In addition, under NASD Rule 4705, we historically disclaimed any liability for losses arising from malfunctions of The Nasdaq Market Center. This rule eliminated liability or risk of loss to us for system failures. We are required to pay Section 31 fees to the SEC for supervision and regulation of securities markets, which are included in cost of revenues. We pass these costs along to our customers through our execution revenues. Issuer Services revenues (15.1% of total revenues and 36.3% of gross margin in 2006) include Corporate Client Group revenues and Nasdaq Financial Products revenues. Corporate Client Group revenues include annual fees, initial listing fees and listing of additional shares fees. Annual fees are recognized ratably over the following 12-month period. Initial listing and listing of additional shares fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods, which are six and four years, respectively, based on our historical listing experience. Corporate Client Group revenues also include Corporate Client services revenues, which includes our insurance business and shareholder and newswire services. For our insurance business, commission income is recognized when coverage becomes effective, the premium due under the policy is known or can be reasonably estimated, and substantially all required services related to placing the insurance have been provided. The effect on income of subsequent premium adjustments, including policy cancellations, is recorded when the adjustments are known. Fee income for services other than placement of insurance coverage is recognized as those services are provided. Broker commission adjustments and commissions on premiums billed directly by underwriters are recognized when such amounts can be reasonably estimated. Shareholder.com revenues are based on subscription agreements with customers. Revenues from subscription agreements are recognized ratably over the contract period, generally one year in length. As part of subscription services, customers are also charged usage fees based upon actual usage of the services provided. Revenues from usage fees and other services are recognized when earned. PrimeNewswire generates fees primarily from wire distribution services, and revenues are recognized as services are provided. For Nasdaq Financial Products revenues, we receive license fees for our trademark licenses that vary by product based on assets or number or underlying dollar value of contracts issued. Nasdaq primarily has two types of license agreements, transaction-based licenses and asset-based licenses. Transaction-based licenses are generally renewable long-term agreements. Customers are charged based on transaction volume or a minimum contract amount, or both. If a customer is charged based on transaction volume, Nasdaq recognizes revenue when the transaction occurs. If a customer is charged based on a minimum contract amount, Nasdaq recognizes revenue on a pro-rata basis over the licensing term. Asset-based licenses are also generally long-term agreements. Customers are charged based on a percentage of assets under management for licensed products, per the agreement, on a monthly or quarterly basis. These revenues are recorded on a monthly or quarterly basis over the term of the license agreement. Reserve for Bad Debts. The reserve for bad debts is maintained at a level that management believes to be sufficient to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio. The reserve is increased by the provision for bad debts which is charged against operating results and decreased by the amount of charge-offs, net of recoveries. The amount charged against operating results is based on several factors including, but not limited to, a continuous assessment of the collectibility of each account, the length of time a receivable is past due and our historical experience with the particular customer. In circumstances where a specific customer inability to meet its financial obligations is known (i.e., bankruptcy filings), we record a specific provision for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. Due to changing economic, business and market conditions, we review the reserve for bad debts monthly and 62 Table of Contents make changes to the reserve through the provision for bad debts as appropriate. If circumstances change (i.e., higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer ability to pay), our estimates of recoverability could be reduced by a material amount. Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Our business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future. As of December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled approximately $1.0 billion and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled approximately $199.6 million. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements. We assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our acquired businesses, market conditions and other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use are consistent with our internal planning. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill and intangible assets. Impairment exists if the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value. For intangible assets subject to amortization, impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset. Income Taxes. Estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, or SFAS 109, requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance, if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence including past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of tax regulations in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in such jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest may be due. While we believe that our tax liabilities reflect the probable outcome of identified tax uncertainties, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate resolution of any tax matter may be greater or less than the amount accrued. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result. Software Costs. We capitalize and amortize significant purchased application software and operational software that are an integral part of computer hardware on the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, generally two to five years. We expense other purchased software as incurred. Nasdaq uses Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, or SOP 98-1, for accounting for internally developed software. SOP 98-1 requires that certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining internal use software be capitalized. We capitalize internal and third party costs incurred in connection with the development of internal use software. Related Party Transactions. Related party receivables and payables are the result of various transactions between us and our affiliates. Prior to December 20, 2006 we were a subsidiary of NASD and transactions between Nasdaq and NASD were considered related party transactions. As discussed in Note 1, Organization and Nature of Operations, NASD achieved full divestiture of ownership of our common stock in 2006 and the one share of Series D preferred stock held by NASD was redeemed by Nasdaq on December 20, 2006. Therefore, as of December 20, 2006, NASD is no longer considered a related party. 63 Table of Contents Prior to December 20, 2006, payables to related parties were comprised primarily of the regulation charge from NASDR. NASDR charges us for costs incurred related to our market regulation and enforcement. See Note 13, Related Party Transactions, for further discussion. Future Accounting Requirements FIN 48 In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, or FIN 48. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes, by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for us on January 1, 2007. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 will be recorded in retained earnings and other accounts as applicable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The effect of adopting FIN 48 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. SFAS No. 157 In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, or SFAS 157. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for us on January 1, 2008. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting SFAS 157. SFAS No. 158 In September 2006, the FASB also issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans- an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R), or SFAS 158. We adopted the recognition and disclosure requirements under SFAS 158 as of December 31, 2006. See Note 11, Employee Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. SFAS 158 also requires plan assets and obligations to be measured as of the employer balance sheet date. While the new measurement date is effective for us on December 31, 2008, we are in compliance with the measurement date provision.
