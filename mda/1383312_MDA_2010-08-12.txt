With multi-currency capabilities, our Global Processing Solution supports real-time global trading of equity, option, mutual fund and fixed income securities in established and emerging markets. In addition, our operations outsourcing solutions allow broker-dealers to outsource certain administrative functions relating to clearing and settlement, from order entry to trade matching and settlement, while maintaining their ability to finance and capitalize their business. ACQUISITIONS Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations were recorded on the Company Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the respective acquisition dates based upon their estimated fair values at such 25 Table of Contents dates. The results of operations of businesses acquired by the Company were included in the Company Consolidated Statements of Earnings since their respective dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill. Acquisitions completed by the Company with an aggregate purchase price of greater than $15.0 million during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, were as follows: The Company acquired one business in the Securities Processing Solutions segment in fiscal year 2010 for $37.7 million. This acquisition resulted in $20.9 million of goodwill. Intangible assets acquired, which totaled $10.6 million, consist primarily of customer relationships and acquired software technology, which are being amortized over a ten-year life and five-year life, respectively. This acquisition was not material to the Company operations, financial position, or cash flows. The Company acquired one business in the Investor Communication Solutions segment in fiscal year 2009 for $45.2 million. This acquisition resulted in $31.4 million of goodwill. Intangible assets acquired, which totaled $13.0 million, consist primarily of acquired technology and customer relationships that are being amortized over a five-year life and seven-year life, respectively. This acquisition was not material to the Company operations, financial position, or cash flows. The Company also completed acquisitions with individual aggregate purchase prices of less than $15.0 million during fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which were not material to the Company consolidated Financial Statements. DIVESTITURES In November 2009, the Company and Ridge entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with PWI and PFSI, to sell substantially all contracts of the securities clearing clients of Ridge to PFSI. On June 25, 2010, the Company completed the sale of the contracts of substantially all of the securities clearing clients of Ridge to PFSI, for an aggregate purchase price of $35.2 million. The purchase price paid to Broadridge consists of (i) a five-year subordinated note from PWI in the principal amount of $20.6 million bearing interest at an annual rate equal to the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate ( LIBOR ) plus 550 basis points, and (ii) 2,455,627 shares of PWI common stock (representing 9.5% of PWI outstanding common stock as of May 31, 2010), at the June 25, 2010 closing price of PWI common stock of $5.95 per share. The purchase price is subject to certain adjustments post-closing including adjustments to reflect certain recently signed correspondent clearing contracts. The Company will discontinue its securities clearing services business but will continue to provide operations outsourcing solutions aligned with the Securities Processing Solutions business. See Note 7, Discontinued Operations for detailed information on discontinued operations. BORROWINGS On March 29, 2007, the Company entered into a $1,190.0 million senior unsecured credit facility, consisting of a $440.0 million five-year term loan facility, a $500.0 million five-year revolving credit facility and a $250.0 million one-year revolving credit facility. On March 29, 2007, the Company borrowed $440.0 million under the five-year term loan facility and $250.0 million under the one-year revolving credit facility. The proceeds received in connection with the $690.0 million of borrowings were paid to our former parent company Automatic Data Processing, Inc. ( ADP ) on March 30, 2007 as a dividend. These credit facilities are subject to covenants, including financial covenants consisting of a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. At June 30, 2010 and 2009, the Company was not aware of any instances of non-compliance with the financial covenants of these credit facilities. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company repaid zero, zero and $170.0 million, respectively, of the five-year term loan facility. The one-year revolving credit facility was cancelled upon repayment on May 29, 2007 with the net proceeds from the issuance of $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 6.125% Senior Notes due 2017 (the Senior Notes ) and cash. The terms of the Senior 26 Table of Contents Notes are governed by an indenture, dated as of May 29, 2007, by and between Broadridge and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee thereunder. The Senior Notes are unsecured obligations of Broadridge and rank equally in right of payment with other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Broadridge. Interest is payable semiannually on June 1 and December 1 each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 6.125%. During fiscal year 2009, the Company completed the purchase of $125.0 million principal amount of the Senior Notes (including $1.0 million unamortized bond discount) pursuant to the cash tender offer for such notes. The consideration paid for the Senior Notes accepted for payment was $116.3 million. The completed purchase resulted in a one-time non-cash gain from early extinguishment of debt of $8.4 million. Please refer to Note 11, Borrowings to our Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. These Financial Statements present the consolidated position of the Company. These Financial Statements include the entities in which the Company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest and various entities in which the Company has investments recorded under the cost and equity methods of accounting. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. In presenting the Financial Statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures. Estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment and available information. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. In management opinion, the Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported. The results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Financial Statements. The estimates are based on historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below. Goodwill . We review the carrying value of all our goodwill in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) No. 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other ( ASC No. 350 ) (formerly Financial Accounting Standards Board, ( FASB ) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ), by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values. We are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment. When determining fair value, we utilize a discounted future cash flow approach using various assumptions, including projections of revenues based on assumed long-term growth rates, estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business weighted-average cost of capital. The principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows, the weighted-average cost of capital and the terminal value growth rate assumptions. The weighted-average cost of capital takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and long-term debt). Our estimates of long-term growth and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of external sources, and are developed as part of our routine, long-range planning process. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. We had $509.5 million of goodwill as of June 30, 2010. Given the significance of our goodwill, an adverse change to the fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our earnings. A 10% change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows, discount rates, or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would have no impact on the reported value of our goodwill. 27 Table of Contents Income Taxes . We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC No. 740, Income Taxes (formerly SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes ), which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Financial Statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). In addition, although currently not under any U.S. or foreign income tax exam for the period March 31, 2007 through June 30, 2010, in the future we expect to be subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our Financial Statements. As of June 30, 2010, we had estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $24.0 million as of June 30, 2010 of which $8.7 million expires in 2011 through 2017 and $15.3 million which has an indefinite utilization period. In addition, the Company has estimated U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $42.8 million, which expire in 2020 through 2029. We have recorded valuation allowances of $15.9 million and $25.7 million at June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively, because the Company does not believe that it is more likely than not that it will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to net operating and capital loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings. Share-based Payments . ASC No. 718 Compensation Stock Compensation (formerly SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment ), requires the measurement of stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. We determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option-pricing model. The binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of our stock price and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk-free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. Determining these assumptions are subjective and complex, and therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options. A hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2010 stock option grants would result in approximately a $1.1 million change in total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2010 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. A hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2010 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.4 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2010 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. A hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2010 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.1 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2010 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. A hypothetical one-half percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2010 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.5 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2010 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussions of Analysis of Consolidated Continuing Operations and Analysis of Reportable Segments refers to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The Analysis of Consolidated Continuing Operations should be read in conjunction with the Analysis of Reportable Segments, which provides more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the Consolidated Results of Continuing Operations. 28 Table of Contents ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS Fiscal Year 2010 Compared to Fiscal Year 2009 The table below presents Consolidated Statement of Earnings from Continuing Operations data for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods: Years Ended June 30, 2010 2009 Change ($) (%) ($ in millions, except for per share amounts) Revenues $ 2,209.2 $ 2,073.0 $ 136.2 7 Cost of revenues 1,616.4 1,510.1 106.3 7 Selling, general and administrative expenses 241.6 212.9 28.7 13 Other expenses, net 9.1 4.0 5.1 NM * Total expenses 1,867.1 1,727.0 140.1 8 Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 342.1 346.0 (3.9 ) (1 ) Margin 15.5 % 16.7 % (1.2 ) pts Provision for income taxes 117.0 122.9 (5.9 ) (5 ) Effective tax rate 34.2 % 35.5 % (1.3 ) pts Net earnings from continuing operations $ 225.1 $ 223.1 $ 2.0 1 Basic earnings per share from continuing operations $ 1.66 $ 1.60 $ 0.06 4 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 1.62 $ 1.58 $ 0.04 3 * Not Meaningful Revenues . Revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $2,209.2 million, an increase of $136.2 million or 7%, compared to $2,073.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The increase reflects higher contributions from fee revenues of $112.4 million and higher distribution revenues of $23.8 million. Distribution revenues consist primarily of postage related fees. Higher fee revenues of $112.4 million were primarily driven by $77.0 million in event-driven mutual fund proxy revenues. Also contributing to the 7% increase, were higher recurring revenues driven by a positive contribution from sales less losses ( Net New Business ) including the recently signed contract with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC ( MSSB ), and gains from acquisitions, partially offset by negative internal growth. Revenues were also favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates of $19.7 million. Total Expenses . Total expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $1,867.1 million, an increase of $140.1 million, or 8%, compared to $1,727.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The increase reflects $106.3 million, or 7% increase in Cost of revenues, $28.7 million, or 13% increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses, and a $5.1 million increase in Other expenses, net. Cost of revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $1,616.4 million, an increase of $106.3 million, or 7%, compared to $1,510.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The increase reflects higher expense relating to higher fee revenues driven by event-driven mutual fund proxy, the net impact of higher distribution costs related to higher distribution revenues, the integration of the MSSB business, and acquisitions. Distribution cost of revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $685.7 million, an increase of $21.2 million, or 3%, compared to $664.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Distribution cost of revenues consist primarily of postage related expenses. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates also increased Cost of revenues by $9.3 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $241.6 million, an increase of $28.7 million, or 13%, compared to $212.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The 29 Table of Contents increase is primarily due to one-time non-recurring credits of $7.4 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, $7.2 million higher selling expenses on a 26% increase in sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, increased costs related to strategic initiatives and investments of $6.8 million and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $2.0 million, partially offset by $2.2 million lower stock-based compensation expense related to special stock option grants to corporate officers during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 which vested immediately, were expensed upon vest, and did not recur during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Other expenses, net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $9.1 million, an increase of $5.1 million, compared to $4.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The increase reflects the effect of the one-time gain of $8.4 million from the purchase of the 6.125% senior notes due 2017 (the Senior Notes ) during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, a lower foreign currency exchange gain of $0.9 million, partially offset by lower interest expense on our Long-term debt of $4.5 million due to the decline in the weighted-average interest rate on our five-year term loan facility. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes . Earnings from Continuing Operations before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $342.1 million, a decrease of $3.9 million, or 1%, compared to $346.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The decrease reflects a higher increase in Total expenses which more than offset the increase in Revenues during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, as discussed above. Overall margin decreased from 16.7% to 15.5% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes . Our Provision for income taxes and Effective tax rates for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $117.0 million and 34.2%, respectively, compared to $122.9 million and 35.5%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, respectively. The decrease in our Provision for income taxes and the Effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 was primarily attributable to the release of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset relating to tax loss carryforwards, and lower enacted tax rates in certain non-U.S. tax jurisdictions. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations . Net Earnings from Continuing Operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $225.1 million, an increase of $2.0 million, or 1%, compared to $223.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The increase in Net earnings from Continuing Operations reflects higher Revenues and a lower Effective tax rate, which more than offset the increase in Total expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, as discussed above. Basic and diluted earnings per share from Continuing Operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $1.66, an increase of $0.06, or 4%, and $1.62, an increase of $0.04, or 3%, respectively, compared to $1.60 and $1.58 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, respectively. 30 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2009 Compared to Fiscal Year 2008 The table below presents Consolidated Statement of Earnings from Continuing Operations data for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods: Years Ended June 30, 2009 2008 Change ($) (%) ($ in millions, except for per share amounts) Revenues $ 2,073.0 $ 2,130.8 $ (57.8 ) (3 ) Cost of revenues 1,510.1 1,547.8 (37.7 ) (2 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses 212.9 232.4 (19.5 ) (8 ) Other expenses, net 4.0 30.9 (26.9 ) (87 ) Total expenses 1,727.0 1,811.1 (84.1 ) (5 ) Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 346.0 319.7 26.3 8 Margin 16.7 % 15.0 % 1.7 pts Provision for income taxes 122.9 131.3 (8.4 ) (6 ) Effective tax rate 35.5 % 41.1 % (5.6 )pts Net earnings from continuing operations $ 223.1 $ 188.4 $ 34.7 18 Basic earnings per share from continuing operations $ 1.60 $ 1.35 $ 0.25 19 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 1.58 $ 1.34 $ 0.24 18 Revenues . Revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 were $2,073.0 million, a decrease of $57.8 million or 3%, compared to $2,130.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The decrease reflects lower contributions from distribution revenues of $51.0 million and fee revenues of $6.8 million. Distribution revenues consist primarily of postage related fees. Lower fee revenues of $6.8 million were primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $32.0 million and lower contribution from event-driven revenues of $20.3 million, mostly offset by Net New Business of $25.7 million and internal growth of $22.1 million. Total Expenses . Total expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 were $1,727.0 million, a decrease of $84.1 million, or 5%, compared to $1,811.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The decrease in Total expenses reflects a decrease of $37.7 million, or 2% in Cost of revenues, a decrease of $19.5 million, or 8% in Selling, general and administrative expenses, and a decrease of $26.9 million, or 87% in Other expenses, net. Cost of revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 were $1,510.1 million, a decrease of $37.7 million, or 2%, compared to $1,547.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The decrease reflects a decline in distribution costs in our Investor Communication Solutions segment reflecting lower distribution revenues, as discussed above. Distribution cost of revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 were $664.5 million, a decrease of $47.2 million, or 7%, compared to $711.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. Distribution cost of revenues consist primarily of postage related expenses. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates also decreased Cost of revenues by $15.7 million. These decreases were partially offset by increased Cost of revenues in our Securities Processing Solutions segment of $19.2 million, or 6% reflecting higher investment spend related to both new products and new business, increased amortization of conversion costs and lower capitalization of conversion related resources, and higher corporate investment spending of $8.5 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 were $212.9 million, a decrease of $19.5 million, or 8%, compared to $232.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The decrease reflects one-time non-recurring transition costs of $13.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. Also contributing to the decrease, were $10.2 million in lower stock-based compensation expense primarily 31 Table of Contents reflecting a $5.4 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense related to special stock option grants to corporate officers, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of $6.0 million. These decreases were partially offset by $9.8 million of higher incremental public company expenses and $3.9 million of higher selling expenses. Other expenses, net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 were $4.0 million, a decrease of $26.9 million, or 87%, compared to $30.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The decrease reflects a $2.8 million foreign currency exchange gain, $8.4 million gain from the purchase of $125.0 million principal amount of the Senior Notes, and a decrease in interest expense of $17.0 million reflecting lower interest expense on our Long-term debt related to a lower outstanding balance because of the purchase of the Senior Notes during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, and the decline in the weighted-average interest rate on the five-year term loan facility. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes . Earnings from Continuing Operations before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 were $346.0 million, an increase of $26.3 million, or 8%, compared to $319.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The increase reflects a decline in Revenues which was more than offset by the decline in Total expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, as discussed above. Overall margin increased from 15.0% to 16.7% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Excluding one-time non-recurring transition costs of $13.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, overall margin increased from 15.6% to 16.7%. Provision for Income Taxes . Our Provision for income taxes and Effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 were $122.9 million and 35.5%, respectively, compared to $131.3 million and 41.1%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, respectively. The decrease in our Provision for income taxes and Effective tax rate is primarily attributable to approved certification for a state tax credit program scheduled to expire in 2018 and lower enacted tax rates in certain U.S. state and international tax jurisdictions for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The state tax credit program is retroactive to fiscal year 2008. The year-to-date benefit of $8.0 million was comprised of $4.0 million for fiscal year 2008 and $4.0 million for fiscal year 2009. The effect of the retroactive adjustment attributable to the reporting period for the state tax credit program applicable to prior periods was a reduction in our Provision for income taxes and Effective tax rate of $4.0 million and 1.2 percentage points, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations . Net earnings from Continuing Operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 were $223.1 million, an increase of $34.7 million, or 18%, compared to $188.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The increase in Net earnings from Continuing Operations reflects a decline in Revenues, which was more than offset by a reduction in Total expenses and a lower Effective tax rate during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, as discussed above. Basic and diluted earnings per share from Continuing Operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 were $1.60 and $1.58, respectively, an increase of $0.25 and $0.24, respectively, or 19% and 18%, respectively, compared to $1.35 and $1.34, respectively, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. ANALYSIS OF REPORTABLE SEGMENTS As a result of Broadridge entering into the Asset Purchase Agreement to sell substantially all of the contracts of the securities clearing clients of Ridge to PFSI, Broadridge now has two reportable operating business segments: Investor Communication Solutions and Securities Processing Solutions. The securities clearing business is reflected in discontinued operations (see Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Note 7, Discontinued Operations for detailed information on discontinued operations), and the operations outsourcing solutions business retained by Broadridge is now reported as part of the Securities Processing Solutions business segment. This change is reflected in all prior periods presented in this report on Form 10-K. 32 Table of Contents The primary components of Other are the elimination of intersegment revenues and profits as well as certain unallocated expenses. Foreign exchange is a reconciling item between the actual foreign exchange rates and budgeted foreign exchange rates. Certain corporate expenses, as well as certain centrally managed expenses, are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner. Because the Company compensates the management of its various businesses on, among other factors, segment profit, the Company may elect to record certain segment-related expense items of an unusual or non-recurring nature in consolidation rather than reflect such items in segment profit.

Investor Communication Solutions segment Revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $1,669.6 million, an increase of $138.6 million, or 9%, compared to $1,531.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The 9% increase was primarily driven by higher event-driven fee revenues from mutual fund proxy. Also contributing to the Revenue increase were higher recurring revenues driven by Net New Business in transaction reporting primarily as a result of the recently signed contract with MSSB and revenue gains from acquisitions. Distribution revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $780.6 million, an increase of $23.8 million, or 3% compared to $756.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Position growth, a key measure in the number of pieces processed, was negative 1% for annual equity proxy and a positive 6% for mutual fund interim communications. The number of pieces processed increased 7% from 1,196.8 million pieces to 1,276.1 million pieces driven primarily by event-driven mutual fund proxy activity. 33 Table of Contents Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes . Earnings from Continuing Operations before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $272.8 million, an increase of $23.9 million, or 10%, compared to $248.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Margin was unchanged from 16.3% as contribution from higher fee revenues were offset by strategic initiatives including MSSB and increased investment spend on acquisitions. Fiscal Year 2009 Compared to Fiscal Year 2008 Revenues . Investor Communication Solutions segment Revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 were $1,531.0 million, a decrease of $44.2 million, or 3%, compared to $1,575.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The decrease reflects lower net distribution revenues driven by less event-driven activity and higher adoption rates for notice and access, partially offset by increased recurring revenues driven by Net New Business and internal growth. Net distribution revenues were $756.8 million, a decrease of $51.0 million, or 6%. Position growth, a key measure in the number of pieces processed, was negative 2% for annual equity proxies and a positive 4% for mutual fund interim communications. The total number of pieces processed decreased 1% from 1,210.5 million pieces to 1,196.8 million pieces. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes . Earnings from Continuing Operations before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 were $248.9 million, a decrease of $6.4 million, or 3%, compared to $255.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. Margin increased 0.1 percentage point compared to the prior year to 16.3%. Securities Processing Solutions Fiscal Year 2010 Compared to Fiscal Year 2009 Revenues . Securities Processing Solutions segment Revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $535.9 million, a decrease of $23.0 million, or 4%, compared to $558.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The 4% decrease in Revenues was driven by the fiscal year 2009 carryover impact of client losses and price concessions as well as lower trade volumes in our equity and fixed income businesses, partially offset by new business. Operations outsourcing revenues was essentially unchanged. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes . Earnings from Continuing Operations before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $99.3 million, a decrease of $34.5 million, or 26%, compared to $133.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Margin decreased by 5.4 percentage points to 18.5% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. The decrease is primarily due to the impact of revenue mix. Fiscal Year 2009 Compared to Fiscal Year 2008 Revenues . Securities Processing Solutions segment Revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 were $558.9 million, an increase of $25.4 million, or 5%, compared to $533.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The increase in Revenues was driven by internal growth reflecting higher non-transaction service revenue, higher Net New Business and revenue contribution from an acquisition. Operations outsourcing contributed $5.9 million of the revenue increase, driven primarily by Net New Business. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes . Earnings from Continuing Operations before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 were $133.8 million, an increase of $6.8 million, or 5%, compared to $127.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. Margin increased 0.1 percentage point compared to the prior year to 23.9%. Margin contribution from higher revenue was more than offset by higher investment spend related to new products, increased amortization of conversion costs, and lower capitalization of conversion related resources. 34 Table of Contents Other Fiscal Year 2010 Compared to Fiscal Year 2009 Revenues . Other segment Revenues were $2.4 million, an increase of $0.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, compared to $1.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, reflecting primarily one-time non-recurring termination fees during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Loss from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes . Loss from Continuing Operations before income taxes was $34.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, an increase of $1.6 million, compared to a $32.5 million loss from continuing operations before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The increased loss reflects the effect of the one-time gain from the purchase of the Senior Notes of $8.4 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 and a lower foreign currency exchange gain of $0.9 million. This loss was partially offset by lower interest expense on our Long-term debt of $4.5 million due to the decline in the weighted-average interest rate on our five-year term loan facility, a decrease of $2.2 million in stock-based compensation expense due to special stock option grants to corporate officers, and a reduction in corporate spending. The increase also reflects $0.9 million in one-time termination fees during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Fiscal Year 2009 Compared to Fiscal Year 2008 Revenues . Other Revenues were $1.5 million, a decrease of $7.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to $8.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, reflecting primarily one-time non-recurring termination fees during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. Loss from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes . The primary components of Other expenses are certain unallocated expenses and Other expenses, net. Loss from Continuing Operations before income taxes was $32.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, a decrease of $36.2 million, compared to a $68.7 million loss for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The improvement reflects an $8.4 million gain from the purchase of $125.0 million principal amount of the Senior Notes during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 and an increase in foreign currency exchange gain of $2.8 million. Interest expense on our Long-term debt declined by $17.0 million due to a lower outstanding balance and the decline in the weighted-average interest rate on our five-year term loan facility. One-time transition costs of $13.7 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 did not recur. Stock compensation expense decreased by $8.2 million primarily due to higher expense for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 related to the special stock option grants to corporate officers granted in that fiscal year. The gains and expense reductions were partially offset by increased investment expenses of $8.5 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 and $7.0 million in one-time non-recurring termination fees earned during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At June 30, 2010 and 2009, Cash and cash equivalents were $412.6 million and $173.4 million, respectively. Total stockholders equity was $807.1 million and $909.0 million at June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. At June 30, 2010, working capital was $506.0 million, compared to $621.9 million at June 30, 2009. On March 29, 2007, the Company entered into a $1,190.0 million senior unsecured credit facility, consisting of a $440.0 million five-year term loan, a $500.0 million five-year revolving credit facility and a $250.0 million one-year revolving credit facility. On March 29, 2007, the Company borrowed $440.0 million under the five-year term loan facility and $250.0 million under the one-year revolving credit facility. The proceeds received in connection with the $690.0 million of borrowings were paid to ADP on March 30, 2007 as a dividend. These credit facilities are subject to covenants, including financial covenants consisting of a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. At June 30, 2010 and 2009, the Company was not aware of any instances of non-compliance with the financial covenants of these credit facilities. 35 Table of Contents During the fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008, the Company repaid zero, zero and $170.0 million, respectively, of the five-year term loan facility. The one-year revolving credit facility was cancelled upon repayment on May 29, 2007 with the net proceeds from the issuance of $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes and cash. The terms of the Senior Notes are governed by an indenture, dated as of May 29, 2007, by and between Broadridge and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee thereunder. The Senior Notes are unsecured obligations of Broadridge and rank equally in right of payment with other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Broadridge. Interest is payable semiannually on June 1 and December 1 each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 6.125%. During fiscal year 2009, the Company completed the purchase of $125.0 million principal amount of the Senior Notes (including $1.0 million unamortized bond discount) pursuant to the cash tender offer for such notes. The consideration paid for the Senior Notes accepted for payment was $116.3 million. The completed purchase resulted in a one-time non-cash gain from early extinguishment of debt of $8.4 million. Please refer to Note 11, Borrowings to our Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion. Based upon current and anticipated levels of operation, we believe that our cash on hand and cash flow from operations, combined with borrowings available under the credit facility, will be sufficient to enable us to meet our current and anticipated cash operating requirements, capital expenditures, and working capital needs. Please refer to the discussion of cash flows used in financing activities in the following section for further discussion of our financing activities. Cash Flows Net cash flows provided by operating activities were $360.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, an increase of $82.9 million, compared to $277.2 million net cash flows provided during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The increase reflects higher accrued expenses of $28.0 million and higher accounts payable of $23.9 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 due to the timing of payables, and a decrease in the purchase of other current assets of $27.2 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Net cash flows used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $88.3 million, a decrease of $2.4 million, compared to $90.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The decrease reflects lower spending of $25.6 million on acquisitions during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, partially offset by increases in capital expenditures of $15.9 million and purchases of intangibles of $7.3 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Net cash flows used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $278.1 million which represents an increase of $97.7 million, compared to $180.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The increase in Net cash flows used in financing activities reflects $233.4 million in higher repurchases of the Company common stock intended to offset dilution from the Company equity compensation plans and an increase of $28.7 million in dividends paid, slightly offset by lower payments on Long-term debt of $114.4 million and $50.2 million in higher proceeds from exercise of stock options. Income Taxes Before the spin-off from our former parent company ADP, the Company taxable income was included in separate income tax returns filed with the appropriate taxing jurisdictions, except for U.S. federal and certain state and foreign jurisdictions in which the Company taxable income is included in the income tax returns ADP or an ADP affiliate. Subsequent to the spin-off, the Company files its own U.S. federal, state and foreign returns. The provision for income taxes is computed as if the Company filed on a combined stand-alone or separate tax return basis, as applicable. The provision for income taxes does not reflect the Company inclusion in the tax 36 Table of Contents returns of ADP or an ADP affiliate. Certain income taxes of the Company were paid by ADP or an ADP affiliate on behalf of the Company. The Company, headquartered in the U.S., is routinely examined by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS ) as part of the IRS U.S. federal income tax audit of ADP and is also routinely examined by the tax authorities in the U.S. states and foreign countries in which it conducts business. The tax years under audit examination vary by tax jurisdiction. With respect to U.S. federal income taxes, the Company was a member of the ADP U.S. federal income tax consolidated group through March 30, 2007. As a member of the ADP U.S. federal income tax consolidation, the Company is included in any IRS examination of ADP for periods up to and including March 30, 2007. ADP and the Company are currently under IRS audit for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998 through the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002 which was substantially completed in fiscal year 2009. In addition, the IRS is conducting an examination of fiscal years 2003 through 2007. As a member of the ADP U.S. federal income tax consolidated group and pursuant to a tax allocation agreement between the Company and ADP, the U.S. federal income tax payable of the Company for the period ended March 30, 2007, will be assumed by ADP. In addition, any items of income or expense successfully challenged by the IRS attributable to the business operations of the Company for tax periods ended March 30, 2007 or earlier, will be tax liabilities assumed by ADP. Correspondingly, any items of income or expense attributable to the business operations of the Company for tax periods ended March 30, 2007 or earlier, which are settled favorably with the IRS by ADP will remain with ADP. Accordingly, the Company has not established any tax reserves or tax assets with respect to U.S. federal income taxes for the tax period ended March 30, 2007. The tax allocation agreement between the Company and ADP also extends to the Company U.S. state income tax and most foreign income tax liabilities and tax assets. Thus, for any foreign or U.S. state income tax liabilities or tax assets relating to tax periods ended March 30, 2007 or earlier attributable to the Company business operations, depending on the tax jurisdiction, ADP will either make payments directly to the appropriate tax authorities or reimburse the Company for tax payments the Company made to the tax authorities that related to tax liabilities subject to the tax allocation agreement to the extent that such tax liabilities are in excess of amounts provided for in respect of such income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company including the Notes thereto, as of June 30, 2010. Similarly, to the extent that there are any tax refunds attributable to the Company business operations in a particular tax jurisdiction for the period ended March 30, 2007 or earlier, ADP will either receive such refund directly from the appropriate tax authorities or receive reimbursement from the Company for the refund received by the Company that is subject to the tax allocation agreement. The Company regularly considers the likelihood of assessments in each of the jurisdictions resulting from examinations. To the extent the Company determines it has potential tax assessment in particular tax jurisdictions and that such assessments are not covered by the tax allocation agreement, the Company has established tax reserves which it believes are adequate in relation to the potential assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted when there is more information available, when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position has expired. The resolution of tax matters should not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or on the Company Consolidated Statements of Earnings for a particular future period. Defined Benefit Pension Plan The Company sponsors a Supplemental Officer Retirement Plan (the Broadridge SORP ). The Broadridge SORP is a defined benefit plan pursuant to which the Company will pay supplemental pension benefits to certain key officers upon retirement based upon the officers years of service and compensation. The amount charged to expense for the Broadridge SORP was $1.2 million, $0.6 million, and $0.5 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Broadridge management believes the Broadridge SORP expense is not material to the Company Consolidated Financial Statements. 37 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations to third parties as of June 30, 2010 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years After 5 Years (in millions) Long-term debt(1) $ 324.1 $ $ 200.0 $ $ 124.1 Operating lease and software licenses(2) 172.6 44.6 68.9 35.4 23.7 Purchase obligations(3) 810.5 116.5 219.5 122.5 352.0 Total $ 1,307.2 $ 161.1 $ 488.4 $ 157.9 $ 499.8 (1) These amounts represent the principal repayments of Long-term debt and are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 30, 2010, we had $324.1 million of outstanding debt consisting of $200.0 million of a term loan facility and $124.1 million in Senior Notes. See Note 11, Borrowings to our Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our Borrowings and related matters. Excludes future cash payments related to interest expense as the term loan facility is variable rate and the interest payments will ultimately be determined by the rates in effect during each period. (2) Included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment leases and software license agreements. We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment, as well as the licensing of software. The majority of our lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Certain facility and equipment leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices. Our future operating lease obligations could change if we exit certain contracts and if we enter into additional operating lease agreements. (3) Purchase obligations primarily relate to payments to ADP related to a data center outsourcing services agreement that expires in fiscal year 2012, payments to IBM related to the IT Services Agreement entered into in March 2010 that expires October 2021, and purchase and maintenance agreements on our software, equipment and other assets. ADP provides the Company with data center services under a data center outsourcing services agreement which expires on June 30, 2012. Among the principal services provided by ADP are information technology services and service delivery network services. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded expenses related to this agreement of $104.8 million, $102.8 million and $107.0 million, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Other Commercial Commitments The Company has a five-year revolving credit facility that expires in March 2012 that has an available capacity of $500.0 million. As of June 30, 2010, no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility. In addition, immediately before the separation from ADP, certain of the Company foreign subsidiaries established unsecured, uncommitted lines of credit with banks. These lines of credit bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 250 basis points. There were no outstanding borrowings under these lines of credit at June 30, 2010. 38 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements It is not the Company business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. However, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The Company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company uses derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. The Company was not a party to any derivative financial instruments at June 30, 2010, 2009, and 2008. In the normal course of business, the Company also enters into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the Company products and services. The Company does not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties, or collateral arrangements.
