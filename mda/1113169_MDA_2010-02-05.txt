Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. GENERAL. Our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to individual and institutional investors in our sponsored mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios. Investment advisory clients outside the United States account for nearly 12% of our assets under management at December 31, 2009. We manage a broad range of U.S., international and global stock, bond, and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios, which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors. Investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management. Accordingly, fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management affect our revenues and results of operations. We remain debt-free with substantial liquidity and financial resources that afford us flexibility during periods of market turmoil and the stability to prudently manage the firm for the long-term. Our financial strength allows us to remain focused on our clients during periods of market stress and to take advantage of growth opportunities throughout market cycles. As a result, recent financial market turmoil has not led us to fundamentally change our business model or significantly modify our operations, as has been the case with many other financial services companies. BACKGROUND. The severe downturn in global financial markets, especially during the second half of 2008 and early 2009, added significant additional volatility to investor returns and our financial results, including significant changes in our assets under management and related advisory revenues, the value of our corporate mutual fund investments, our operating cash flows, and our net income. While we are always vigilant in controlling our operating expenses, we began a series of cost reduction and avoidance initiatives in late 2007 to get ahead of deteriorating market conditions. These efforts were heightened through the last two years, especially with the equity market steep decline in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009, and included a 5.5% reduction of our workforce in April 2009. In addition to other cost reductions, we realized a net savings in 2009 from the workforce reduction of $5.2 million as the related second quarter charge was more than offset by expense savings over the balance of the year, net of related administrative fee reductions that benefitted shareholders of the T. Rowe Price mutual funds. Through attrition, retirements and the workforce reduction, our number of associates at the end of 2009 is 4,802, down 10.8% from the 5,385 employed at the beginning of the year. - 14 - In the first quarter of 2009, major large-cap indexes plunged to 12-year lows as the economy contracted and unemployment surged. Governments around the world intervened aggressively to provide liquidity to the credit markets, stabilize the banking sector, and stimulate economic activity. From late March through the end of the year, investor sentiment improved and share prices rose as credit market conditions loosened, corporate earnings improved in many sectors, and the U.S. economy showed signs of emerging from recession. As we enter 2010, the question has become how strong global economic growth will be and whether it can be sustained. In this environment, the S&P 500 Index of large-cap companies in leading industries of the U.S. economy returned 26.5% in 2009 while the NASDAQ Composite Index, which is heavily weighted with technology companies, was up 43.9% (excluding dividends). Returns on stocks in many non-U.S. markets were stronger in 2009, as global economies were improving and weakness in the U.S. dollar enhanced dollar-denominated returns. Emerging markets produced stellar returns, with Brazil, Russia, India, and China among the top-performing equity markets. Developed Asian and European equity markets, in comparison, were less robust, with Japan trailing significantly. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index returned 79.0% versus 32.5% for the MSCI EAFE Index, which measures the performance of mostly large-cap equities in Europe, Australasia, and the Far East. The U.S. Federal Reserve target funds rate remained the lowest in history in the range of 0% to .25% throughout 2009 and the abundant liquidity at government auctions put downward pressure on the short side of the U.S. Treasury yield curve. The annual yield on one-month Treasury bills was only .04% at the end of 2009 and money market fund returns had plunged to near 0%. On the longer side, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries ended the year at 3.85%, up 160 basis points from the end of 2008. Credit spreads to riskier debt securities narrowed considerably over the year, moving back to levels that are more normal. Investors that had moved into high-quality government issues are now moving to higher yielding junk bonds and emerging market debt. As a result, the Credit Suisse High Yield Index gained 54.2% in 2009 and the JPMorgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Global (in U.S. dollar terms) returned 28.2%. The Barclays Capital Municipal Bond Index gained 12.9%, and the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Index gained 5.9%, adding to strong returns among debt securities. In this business environment, investors entrusted net inflows of $22.7 billion to our management in 2009, including $14.7 billion that originated during the second half of the year. Total assets under our management ended 2009 at $391.3 billion, a substantial recovery from $276.3 billion at the end of 2008 to a level approaching the historical period-end high of $400.0 billion at December 31, 2007. Our assets under management (in billions) have changed during the past three years as follows: 2007 2008 2009 Assets under management at beginning of year $ 334.7 $ 400.0 $ 276.3 Net cash inflows Sponsored mutual funds in the U.S. 20.2 3.9 12.5 Other portfolios 13.6 13.2 10.2 33.8 17.1 22.7 Net market gains (losses) and income 32.4 (140.3 ) 92.7 Mutual fund distributions not reinvested (.9 ) (.5 ) (.4 ) Increase (decrease) during year 65.3 (123.7 ) 115.0 Assets under management at end of year $ 400.0 $ 276.3 $ 391.3 Over the last three years, our net cash inflows have been sourced most significantly from third-party financial intermediaries and from institutional investors around the world. Our relative investment performance over much of this period and brand awareness contributed significantly to attracting net inflows across each of our four distribution channels. Assets under management at December 31, 2009, include $290.4 billion in equity and blended asset investment portfolios and $100.9 billion in fixed income investment portfolios. The investment portfolios that we manage consist of $232.7 billion in the T. Rowe Price mutual funds distributed in the United States and $158.6 billion in other investment portfolios, including separately managed accounts, subadvised funds, and other sponsored investment funds offered to investors outside the U.S. and through variable annuity life insurance plans. We incur significant expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients. These efforts may often involve costs that precede any future revenues that we may recognize from increases to our assets under management. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 2009 versus 2008 . Investment advisory revenues were down 12%, or $215 million, to more than $1.5 billion in 2009 as average assets under our management of $321.3 billion in 2009 were $36.9 billion lower than in 2008. The average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 48.1 basis points during 2009, down from the 49.2 basis points earned during 2008. Lower equity market valuations resulted in an increase in the percentage of our assets under management being attributable to lower fee fixed income portfolios, including money market funds for which we reduced advisory fees in order to maintain yields at or above 0% to fund investors. Net revenues decreased 12%, or $249 million, to nearly $1.9 billion. Operating expenses fell 8%, or $102 million, to almost $1.2 billion in 2009. Overall, net operating income in 2009 decreased $147 million, or 17%, to $702 million. Our operating margin declined to 37.6% in 2009 from 40.1% in 2008 as the impact of lower average market valuations over 2009, which decreased our assets under management and - 15 - corresponding advisory revenues, was offset only partially by the savings from our cost reduction efforts. Our non-operating investment loss decreased nearly $40 million due to the higher other than temporary impairment charges recognized in 2008 on our investments in sponsored mutual funds. Net income fell 12% or $57 million to nearly $434 million. Diluted earnings per share on our common stock also decreased to $1.65, down 9% or $.16 from $1.81 in 2008. The retrospective application in 2009 of new financial reporting guidance that recognizes our outstanding restricted stock and stock units, on which we pay non-forfeitable dividends, as if they were a separate class of stock reduced previously reported 2008 diluted earnings per share on our common stock of $1.82 by $.01 per share. The non-operating charges to recognize other than temporary impairments of our fund investments reduced diluted earnings per share by $.21 in 2008 and $.09 in 2009. Investment advisory revenues earned from the T. Rowe Price mutual funds distributed in the United States decreased more than $170 million, or 14%, from 2008 to almost $1.1 billion. Average mutual fund assets were $191.8 billion in 2009, down 11% from the average of $216.1 billion during 2008. Net inflows to the mutual funds in 2009 were $12.5 billion, including $6.4 billion that originated from our target-date Retirement Funds. Our bond funds added $10.0 billion of net inflows, including $6.3 billion from four funds New Income, Short Term Bond, International Bond and Emerging Markets Bond that each added more than $1 billion during the year. The stock and blended asset funds had net inflows of $4.8 billion after the transfer of $1.3 billion to other investment portfolios under our management. The Equity Index 500 and Mid-Cap Growth funds had total net inflows of $2.5 billion in 2009. Our money market funds had net outflows of $2.3 billion during the year. Higher market valuations and income increased mutual fund assets under management by $55.8 billion in 2009. Investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage decreased $44 million, or 8.5%, to $477.8 million in 2009. Average assets in these portfolios were $129.5 billion during 2009, down $12.6 billion or 9% from 2008. Other investment portfolio assets under management increased $46.7 billion during 2009, including $36.5 billion in market gains and income and $10.2 billion of net inflows, primarily from institutional investors. Net inflows include $1.3 billion transferred from the stock and blended asset mutual funds during 2009. Administrative fees decreased $35 million, or 10%, to $319 million in 2009. This change includes a $4 million decrease in 12b-1 distribution and service fees recognized on lower average assets under management in the Advisor and R classes of our sponsored mutual funds and a $31 million reduction in our mutual fund servicing revenue, which is primarily attributable to our cost reduction efforts in the mutual fund and retirement plan servicing functions. Changes in administrative fees are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors. Our largest expense, compensation and related costs, decreased $42 million, or 5%, from 2008 to $773 million in 2009. The largest part of this decrease is attributable to a $19 million reduction in our annual bonus program. Reductions in the use of outside contractors lowered 2009 costs $14 million with the remainder of the cost savings primarily attributable to the workforce reduction and lower employee benefits and other employment expenses. Average headcount in 2009 was down 5.4% from 2008 due to attrition, retirements and our workforce reduction. Advertising and promotion expenditures were down $31 million, or 30%, versus 2008 due to our decision to reduce spending in response to lower investor activity in the 2009 market environment. We currently estimate that our advertising and promotion expenditures for 2010 could increase up to 30% from 2009 and that first quarter 2010 spending will be about $26 million. We vary our level of spending based on market conditions and investor demand as well as our efforts to expand our investor base in the United States and abroad. Depreciation expense and other occupancy and facility costs together increased only $4 million, or 2.5% compared to 2008, as we moderated or delayed our capital spending and facility growth plans. Other operating expenses decreased $33 million, or 18% from 2008, including a decline of $4 million in distribution and service expenses recognized on lower average assets under management in our Advisor and R classes of mutual fund shares that are sourced from financial intermediaries. Our cost control efforts resulted in the remaining expense reductions, including lower professional fees and travel and related costs. Our non-operating investment activity resulted in net losses of $12.7 million in 2009 and $52.3 million in 2008. The improvement of nearly $40 million is primarily attributable to a reduction in the other than temporary impairments recognized on our investments in sponsored mutual funds in 2009 versus 2008. The following table details our related mutual fund investment gains and losses (in millions) during the past two years. 2008 2009 Change Other than temporary impairments recognized $ (91.3 ) $ (36.1 ) $ 55.2 Capital gain distributions received 5.6 2.0 (3.6 ) Net gain (loss) realized on fund dispositions (4.5 ) 7.4 11.9 Net loss recognized on fund holdings $ (90.2 ) $ (26.7 ) $ 63.5 Lower income of $16 million from our money market holdings due to the significantly lower interest rate environment offset the improvement experienced with our fund investments. There is no impairment of any of our mutual fund investments at December 31, 2009. The 2009 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is 37.1%, down from 38.4% in 2008 and .9% lower than our present estimate of 38.0% for the 2010 effective tax rate. Our 2009 provision includes reductions of prior years tax provisions and discrete nonrecurring benefits that lowered our 2009 effective tax rate by 1.0%. 2008 versus 2007 . Investment advisory revenues decreased 6.3%, or $118 million, to $1.76 billion in 2008 as average assets under our management decreased $16 billion to $358.2 billion. The average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 49.2 basis - 16 - points in 2008, down from the 50.2 basis points earned in 2007, as lower equity market valuations resulted in a greater percentage of our assets under management being attributable to lower fee fixed income portfolios. Continuing stress on the financial markets and resulting lower equity valuations as 2008 progressed resulted in lower average assets under our management, lower investment advisory fees and lower net income as compared to prior periods. Net revenues decreased 5%, or $112 million, to $2.12 billion. Operating expenses were $1.27 billion in 2008, up 2.9% or $36 million from 2007. Net operating income for 2008 decreased $147.9 million, or 14.8%, to $848.5 million. Higher operating expenses in 2008 and decreased market valuations during the latter half of 2008, which lowered our assets under management and advisory revenues, resulted in our 2008 operating margin declining to 40.1% from 44.7% in 2007. Non-operating investment losses in 2008 were $52.3 million as compared to investment income of $80.4 million in 2007. Investment losses in 2008 include non-cash charges of $91.3 million for the other than temporary impairment of certain of the firm investments in sponsored mutual funds. Net income in 2008 fell 27% or nearly $180 million from 2007. Diluted earnings per share, after the retrospective application of new accounting guidance effective in 2009, decreased to $1.81, down $.59 or 24.6% from $2.40 in 2007. A non-operating charge to recognize other than temporary impairments of our sponsored mutual fund investments reduced diluted earnings per share by $.21 in 2008. Investment advisory revenues earned from the T. Rowe Price mutual funds distributed in the United States decreased 8.5%, or $114.5 million, to $1.24 billion. Average mutual fund assets were $216.1 billion in 2008, down $16.7 billion from 2007. Mutual fund assets at December 31, 2008, were $164.4 billion, down $81.6 billion from the end of 2007. Net inflows to the mutual funds during 2008 were $3.9 billion, including $1.9 billion to the money funds, $1.1 billion to the bond funds, and $.9 billion to the stock funds. The Value, Equity Index 500, and Emerging Markets stock funds combined to add $4.1 billion, while the Mid-Cap Growth and Equity Income stock funds had net redemptions of $2.2 billion. Net fund inflows of $6.2 billion originated in our target-date Retirement Funds, which in turn invest in other T. Rowe Price funds. Fund net inflow amounts in 2008 are presented net of $1.3 billion that was transferred to target-date trusts from the Retirement Funds during the year. Decreases in market valuations and income not reinvested lowered our mutual fund assets under management by $85.5 billion during 2008. Investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage decreased $3.6 million to $522.2 million. Average assets in these portfolios were $142.1 billion during 2008, up slightly from $141.4 billion in 2007. These minor changes, each less than 1%, are attributable to the timing of declining equity market valuations and cash flows among our separate account and subadvised portfolios. Net inflows, primarily from institutional investors, were $13.2 billion during 2008, including the $1.3 billion transferred from the Retirement Funds to target-date trusts. Decreases in market valuations, net of income, lowered our assets under management in these portfolios by $55.3 billion during 2008. Administrative fees, which increased $5.8 million to $353.9 million, are generally offset by related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors. Our largest expense, compensation and related costs, increased $18.4 million or 2.3% from 2007. This increase includes $37.2 million in salaries resulting from an 8.4% increase in our average staff count and an increase of our associates base salaries at the beginning of the year. At December 31, 2008, we employed 5,385 associates, up 6.0% from the end of 2007, primarily to add capabilities and support increased volume-related activities and other growth over the past few years. Over the course of 2008, we slowed the growth of our associate base from earlier plans and the prior year. We also reduced our annual bonuses $27.6 million versus the 2007 year in response to unfavorable financial market conditions that negatively impacted our operating results. The balance of the increase is attributable to higher employee benefits and employment-related expenses, including an increase of $5.7 million in stock-based compensation. After higher spending during the first quarter of 2008 versus 2007, investor sentiment in the uncertain and volatile market environment caused us to reduce advertising and promotion spending, which for the year was down $3.8 million from 2007. Occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased $18 million, or 12% compared to 2007. We expanded and renovated our facilities in 2008 to accommodate the growth in our associates to meet business demands. Other operating expenses were up $3.3 million from 2007. We increased our spending $9.8 million, primarily for professional fees and information and other third-party services. Reductions in travel and charitable contributions partially offset these increases. Our non-operating investment activity resulted in a net loss of $52.3 million in 2008 as compared to a net gain of $80.4 million in 2007. This change of $132.7 million is primarily attributable to losses recognized in 2008 on our investments in sponsored mutual funds, which resulted from declines in financial market values during the year. 2007 2008 Change Capital gain distributions received $ 22.1 $ 5.6 $ (16.5 ) Other than temporary impairments recognized (.3 ) (91.3 ) (91.0 ) Net gains (losses) realized on fund dispositions 5.5 (4.5 ) (10.0 ) Net gain (loss) recognized on fund holdings $ 27.3 $ (90.2 ) $ (117.5 ) We recognized other than temporary impairments of our investments in sponsored mutual funds because of declines in fair value below cost for an extended period. The significant declines in fair value below cost that occurred in 2008 were generally attributable to adverse market conditions. - 17 - In addition, income from money market and bond fund holdings was $19.3 million lower than in 2007 due to the significantly lower interest rate environment of 2008. Lower interest rates also led to substantial capital appreciation on our $40 million holding of U.S. Treasury Notes that we sold in December 2008 at a $2.6 million gain. The 2008 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is 38.4%, up from 37.7% in 2007, primarily to reflect changes in state income tax rates and regulations and certain adjustments made prospectively based on our annual income tax return filings for 2007. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY. During 2009, stockholders equity increased from $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion. We repurchased nearly 2.3 million common shares for $67 million in 2009. Tangible book value is $2.2 billion at December 31, 2009, and our cash and cash equivalents and our mutual fund investment holdings total $1.4 billion. Given the availability of these financial resources, we do not maintain an available external source of liquidity. On January 20, 2010, we purchased a 26% equity interest in UTI Asset Management Company and an affiliate for $142.4 million. We funded the acquisition from our cash holdings. In addition to the pending UTI acquisition, we had outstanding commitments to fund other investments totaling $35.4 million at December 31, 2009. We presently anticipate funding 2010 property and equipment expenditures of about $150 million from our cash balances and operating cash inflows. 2009 versus 2008 . Operating activities during 2009 provided cash flows of nearly $536 million, down $206 million from 2008, including a $57 million decrease in net income and a $129 million change in the timing differences in the cash settlement of our accounts receivable and accrued revenues and payables and accrued liabilities. In addition, our addback of the non-cash charges for other than temporary impairments of our investments in sponsored mutual funds was $55 million more in 2008 than in 2009. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $167 million in 2009, up $42 million from 2008. We made net investments of nearly $18 million into our mutual fund portfolio in 2009, an increase of $15 million from 2008. During the past two years, we made several changes, totaling more than $56 million in 2009 and $95 million in 2008, to the composition of our portfolio of mutual fund holdings in light of market conditions experienced during the period. Because of the smaller 2009 increase in savings bank deposits, we increased our investment in debt securities held by the savings bank by only $9 million in 2009 versus $41 million in 2008. As noted below in our discussion of investing activities during 2008 versus 2007, our $70 million U.S. Treasury Notes portfolio was liquidated in 2008 thereby producing inflows of nearly $73 million that did not recur in 2009. Net cash used in financing activities was $245 million in 2009, down $538 million from 2008. Compared to 2008, we expended $543 million less to repurchase our common shares in 2009. The uncertain market environment led us to reduce our share repurchases and preserve our liquid capital during this past year. Our $.01 per share quarterly dividend increase in 2009 accounts for an additional payout of $10 million in dividends; however, our 2008 change in policy regarding the timing of dividend payments such that our quarterly dividends are declared and paid in the same quarter resulted in five quarterly dividend payments in 2008 versus only four in 2009. This additional payment resulted in our 2009 outflows for dividends decreasing $64 million from 2008. Excess tax benefits from share-based compensation plans decreased $37 million as fewer stock option exercises due to uncertainties and lower market valuations of our common stock reduced our common stock issuances about 25% from 2008. 2008 versus 2007 . Operating activities during 2008 provided cash flows of nearly $742 million, down $16 million from 2007. Reconciling items include lower net income of almost $180 million that was offset by timing differences of about $59 million in the cash settlement of our operating receivables and payables. Other than temporary impairments of our sponsored mutual fund investments totaling $91 million, greater depreciation expense on our increased property and equipment of $8 million, and nearly $6 million of additional stock-based compensation account for the remainder of the difference between 2007 and 2008. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $125 million in 2008, down $220 million from 2007. In 2007, we invested a net of $175.5 million in our sponsored mutual funds from our available cash resources. On a net basis, we added only $2.6 million to our fund holdings in 2008; however, we made $95 million of changes to the composition of our portfolio of mutual fund holdings in light of market conditions during the year. Because of an increase in savings bank deposits, we also increased our investment in debt securities held by the savings bank by $41 million in 2008. While we made other investments of $23 million in 2007, we made only $10 million of other investments in 2008. We also received proceeds of $42.6 million on the sales, and $30 million on the maturities, of our $70 million U.S. Treasury Notes portfolio. Net cash used in financing activities was $783 million in 2008, up $382 million from 2007. Our strong cash position allowed us to increase our common stock repurchases by $302 million in 2008 versus 2007. Our cash outflows for dividends paid increased $132 million. During the first quarter of 2008, we changed our policy regarding the timing of dividend payments such that our quarterly dividends are now declared and paid in the same quarter. Accordingly, our cash outflows for 2008 include the payout of dividends for the fourth quarter 2007 and all four quarters of 2008. Additionally, we increased the quarterly dividend payment from $.17 per share made in each of the four 2007 quarters to $.24 per share beginning with the payment made in January 2008. Lastly, deposits at our savings bank subsidiary increased nearly $44 million in 2008 as depositors sought the security of FDIC-backed accounts. - 18 - CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. The following table presents a summary of our future obligations (in millions) under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at December 31, 2009. Other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated, under certain conditions that may involve termination fees. Because these obligations are generally of a normal recurring nature, we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations. The information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2010 and future years. The information also excludes the $7 million of unrecognized tax benefits discussed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements because it is not possible to estimate the time period in which a payment might be made to the tax authorities. Total 2010 2011 12 2013 14 Later Noncancelable operating leases $ 198 $ 28 $ 52 $ 49 $ 69 Other purchase commitments 169 107 56 5 1 $ 367 $ 135 $ 108 $ 54 $ 70 We also have outstanding commitments to fund additional investments, including the acquisition of 26% of UTI, totaling $178 million at December 31, 2009. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. The preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives. Further, significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our balance sheet, the revenues and expenses in our statement of income, and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements. Making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time. Accordingly, actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements, significant accounting policies, and notes. We present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2009 Annual Report. In the following discussion, we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements. Other than temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities . We generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held for investment by our savings bank subsidiary as available-for-sale. At the end of each quarter, we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders equity. We next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary. A mutual fund holding with an impairment that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarter-ends is generally presumed to have an other than temporary impairment and a loss is recognized in our statement of income unless there is persuasive evidence, such as an increase in value subsequent to quarter end, to overcome that presumption. We may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a near-term recovery is possible. An impaired debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary is considered to have an other-than-temporary loss that we will recognize in our statement of income if the impairment is caused by a change in credit quality that affects our ability to recover our amortized cost or if we intend to sell the security or believe that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering cost. Minor impairments of 5% or less are generally considered temporary. Goodwill . We internally conduct, manage and report our operations as one investment advisory business. We do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business. Accordingly, we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit our investment advisory business. We evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach. Goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business. Our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business (our market capitalization) exceeds our carrying amount (our stockholders equity) and, therefore, that no impairment exists. Should we reach a different conclusion in the future, additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the non-cash impairment charge to be recognized. We must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred. The maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our balance sheet, $665.7 million. Stock options . We recognize stock option-based compensation expense in our consolidated statement of income using a fair value based method. Fair value methods use a valuation model for shorter-term, market-traded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration. The Black-Scholes option pricing model that we use includes - 19 - the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations, including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date, the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period, and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time. Our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted. Unlike most of our expenses, the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a non-cash charge that is never measured by, or adjusted based on, a cash outflow. Provision for income taxes . After compensation and related costs, our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense. We operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries, and must allocate our income, expenses, and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions. Accordingly, our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations. Annually, we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities. Each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations. From time to time, we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to, or in the process of, being audited by various tax authorities. Because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates, it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements. As a result, we recognize additions to, or reductions of, income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled. We recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined. NEWLY ISSUED BUT NOT YET ADOPTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. Each reporting period we consider all newly issued but not yet adopted accounting and reporting guidance that is applicable to our operations and the preparation of our consolidated statements. We do not believe that any issued guidance that we have not yet adopted will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION. From time to time, information or statements provided by or on behalf of T. Rowe Price, including those within this report, may contain certain forward-looking information, including information or anticipated information relating to: our revenues, net income and earnings per share on common stock; changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management; our expense levels and possible expense savings; our estimated effective income tax rate; and our expectations regarding financial markets, future transactions, investments, capital expenditures, and other conditions. Readers are cautioned that any forward-looking information provided by or on behalf of T. Rowe Price is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward-looking information because of various factors including, but not limited to, those discussed below and in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K Annual Report. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management. Such changes result from many factors including, among other things: cash inflows and outflows in the T. Rowe Price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios; fluctuations in global financial markets that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management; our introduction of new mutual funds and investment portfolios; and changes in retirement savings trends relative to participant-directed investments and defined contribution plans. The ability to attract and retain investors assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence; the relative investment performance of the Price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios as compared to competing offerings and market indexes; the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels; competitive conditions in the mutual fund, asset management, and broader financial services sectors; and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business. Our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the Price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the Price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements. Non-operating investment income (loss) will also fluctuate primarily due to the size of our investments and changes in their market valuations. Our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: changes in the level of our advertising expenses in response to market conditions, including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the United States and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the United States; variations in the level of total compensation expense due to, among other things, bonuses, stock option grants, other incentive awards, changes in our employee count and mix, and competitive factors; our success in implementing and realizing any future cost reduction and avoidance efforts; any goodwill impairment that may arise; fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations; expenses and capital costs, such as technology assets, depreciation, amortization, and research and development, incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients; and disruptions of services, including those provided by third parties, such as facilities, communications, power, and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems. Our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation, and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax, and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results, including but not limited to effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in mutual funds and investing in general, or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments. - 20 -
