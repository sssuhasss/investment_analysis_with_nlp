Engaging our audiences through television, motion pictures and digital platforms, we seek to reach our audiences however they consume content. Viacom leading brands include the multiplatform properties of MTV Networks, including MTV: Music Television , VH1 , CMT : Country Music Television , Logo , Nickelodeon , Nick at Nite , COMEDY CENTRAL , Spike TV , TV Land , and 135 networks around the world as well as digital assets such as MTV.com, comedycentral.com, VSPOT , TurboNick Neopets , Xfire and iFilm ; BET Networks ; Paramount Pictures ; DreamWorks ; and Famous Music . On December 31, 2005, we became a stand-alone public company in connection with our separation (the Separation ) from the former Viacom Inc. ( Former Viacom ). See The Separation from CBS Corporation for more information. We manage our operations through two reportable operating segments: (i) Media Networks, which includes MTV Networks ( MTVN ) and BET Networks ( BETN ); and (ii) Filmed Entertainment, which includes Paramount Pictures Corporation ( Paramount ) and Famous Music Publishing Companies ( Famous Music ). Previously we referred to these segments as Cable Networks and Entertainment. Media Networks Our leading global media networks brands are focused on connecting with key demographics attractive to advertisers across multiple distribution platforms. Our leading program services reach over 496 million households worldwide and our digital properties include 175 websites and broadband services globally. MTVN is also a major producer of mobile video content for major carriers and mobile virtual network operators in the United States and internationally. MTVN also has made some of its content readily available for download to own through deals with AOL, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft Xbox 360. We continue to invest organically and through select acquisitions in digital media and other assets that are attractive to the demographics we serve. For example in 2006, in addition to expanding its website and broadband services, MTVN increased its ability to serve young adult consumers through such acquisitions as AddictingGames.com, Shockwave.com, Harmonix Music Systems, Xfire, Y2M, AddictingClips.com, Atom Entertainment and Quizilla. In addition, we acquired 100% of BETN interactive arm BET.com, which is a leading online destination for African-Americans. Our Media Networks segment derives revenues principally from advertising, affiliate fees and ancillary sales of home entertainment products and licensing of consumer products. Our content is designed to target key audience demographics and the popularity of our programming creates a powerful reason for advertisers to purchase commercial time on our networks. Audience ratings are a key driver in generating advertising revenues and creates demand on the part of cable television operators, direct-to-home or DTH satellite operators and other content distributors to deliver our programming to their customers, which allows us to obtain multi-year affiliation deals that provide us with a reasonably stable source of affiliate fee revenues. We also derive revenues from our consumer products business that licenses characters such as SpongeBob SquarePants, South Park and Dora the Explorer to consumer product companies. Media Networks segment revenue growth depends on the continued increase of advertising revenues and affiliate fees which we expect will be driven by the popularity of our programming and, in part, by increased availability 32 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) of our content on new distribution platforms such as internet protocol television, mobile outlets, video on-demand, and cable television systems being built by incumbent telephone companies. Growth also depends on the continued demand for our properties to generate license fees, including for use by licensees in their commercial products sold at retail. We incur production costs in connection with creating original content for our networks. These costs are comprised of expenses associated with retaining creative talent including actors, writers and producers, as well as marketing and distribution costs that drive awareness and make our content available for distribution to consumers directly. We also incur costs to acquire content such as television series from production companies. MTVN and BETN increasingly compete for advertising revenue with traditional and non-traditional media outlets in an environment of changing viewer consumption habits. In addition, the unauthorized distribution of our content through various platforms may decrease revenue received from the exhibition of our programming. We also compete with other cable networks for affiliate fees derived from distribution agreements and with other content producers for actors, writers, producers and other creative talent and for new ideas and programs. Investments in content and programming coupled with the strategic use of capital in targeted acquisitions and ventures, particularly in the digital media space, are important factors as we confront market, competitive and technological challenges affecting our audiences and their connections with our content. As a pure play media content company, we believe media fragmentation provides us with a competitive advantage as compelling content attracts audiences to any distribution platform. We intend to continue investing in our brands, developing new original programming and acquiring third party content in order to keep our program offerings relevant and desirable to our targeted audiences regardless of where, when or how they choose to experience or interact with it. Filmed Entertainment The Filmed Entertainment segment includes Paramount, which produces, finances and distributes feature motion pictures, television programming and related home entertainment products under the Paramount, DreamWorks, Paramount Vantage, Paramount Classics, MTV Films and Nickelodeon Movies brands. Paramount library consists of approximately 3,500 motion pictures. Famous Music, which engages in the music publishing business, is also included in this segment. On January 31, 2006, we completed the acquisition of DreamWorks L.L.C. ( DreamWorks ) a leading producer of live-action motion pictures and television programming. In connection with the acquisition, we acquired certain exclusive distribution rights to and home video fulfillment services for the animated feature films produced by DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc. ( DreamWorks Animation ). We also acquired a live-action film library (the live-action library ) consisting of 59 films released through September 16, 2005. Title to the live-action library is held by DW Funding LLC ( DW Funding ) in which we sold a controlling interest in May 2006. In connection with the sale, we entered into an agreement for the exclusive worldwide distribution rights to the library for a five-year period. During 2006, Paramount released such critically acclaimed motion pictures as Babel , under the Paramount Vantage label; Dreamgirls under the Paramount and DreamWorks labels and Flags of our Fathers from DreamWorks; Nacho Libre , Barnyard and Charlotte Web in association with Nickelodeon Movies; jackass : number two in association with MTV Films and World Trade Center and Mission: Impossible III from Paramount. In domestic theatrical markets we perform our own marketing and distribution services; whereas in international theatrical markets during 2006 we utilized United International Pictures ( UIP ), a company that we and an 33 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) affiliate of Universal Studios, Inc. ( Universal ) own jointly. In January 2007, Paramount and Universal began theatrical self-distribution in 15 key countries that were separated from UIP distribution business, with each party taking over the UIP operating entity in designated countries. Paramount and Universal each have the option to continue a transitional agreement with the other party in the respective countries for up to two years. Famous Music catalog spans seven decades and ranges from classics to hits from contemporary artists. Famous Music licenses its copyrighted works for use in motion pictures and other television and online entertainment content, CDs, videogames and printed works and public performances. In addition, Extreme Music which was acquired in 2005, serves as Famous Music production unit. Substantially all revenues from our Filmed Entertainment segment are generated from feature film exhibition in theatrical release, home entertainment, and television (pay and basic cable television, broadcast and syndication). Our Filmed Entertainment segment results of operations substantially depend on the public response to our theatrical and home entertainment releases, our ability to obtain creative talent and story properties and the distribution and marketing success of our films. In addition, revenues from motion picture releases tend to be cyclical with increases during the summer months and around holidays. We incur advertising costs before and throughout the theatrical release of a film and, to a lesser extent, other exhibition windows. Such costs are incurred to generate public interest in our films and are expensed as incurred; therefore, we typically incur losses with respect to a particular film prior to and during the film theatrical exhibition, including the quarter prior to a film release. In addition, for films we distribute on behalf of DreamWorks Animation and home entertainment distribution for DW Funding, we expense print and advertising costs as incurred and recover such costs typically in quarters immediately following the release. Therefore, the results of the Filmed Entertainment segment can be volatile. Production costs are capitalized as incurred and amortized over the flow of ultimate revenues. We frequently enter into film financing arrangements under which third parties participate in the financing of the production costs of motion pictures in exchange for a partial copyright interest and share of net proceeds. We believe such arrangements may improve our investment returns on a film slate and reduce our economic risk on a particular film or slate. The Filmed Entertainment segment faces many similar market, technological, competitive and piracy challenges as our Media Networks segment. We intend to grow Filmed Entertainment segment revenues by continuing to capitalize on our Paramount, DreamWorks, and Paramount Vantage labels and on our various media networks brands. Developing synergies across our brands permits us to leverage the core MTVN and BETN audiences. We also plan to increase control over international distribution activities. The Separation from CBS Corporation On December 31, 2005, we became a stand-alone public company in connection with our Separation from Former Viacom. Prior to the Separation, our business comprised the Cable Networks and Entertainment segments of Former Viacom. In connection with the Separation, each share of Former Viacom Class A common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.5 of a share of Viacom Class A common stock and 0.5 of a share of CBS Corporation Class A common stock. Similarly, each share of Former Viacom Class B common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.5 of a share of Viacom Class B common stock and 0.5 of a share of CBS Corporation Class B common stock. Holders of Viacom Class A and Class B common stock received cash in lieu of fractional shares. 34 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) In connection with the Separation, we and CBS Corporation entered into the Separation Agreement as well as certain other agreements to govern the terms of the Separation and certain of the ongoing relationships between CBS Corporation and us after the Separation. These agreements include a Transition Services Agreement and a Tax Matters Agreement. These related party arrangements are more fully described below and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The Separation Agreement further provided that we were responsible for the first $195.0 million in costs directly related to the Separation with amounts incurred in excess of $195.0 million being split equally between us and CBS Corporation. Included as a component in selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Earnings is $163.5 million of transaction costs, for the year ended December 31, 2005. Such amounts principally included severance amounts, expenditures on information systems and investment banking and other professional fees. Special Dividend to Former Viacom In accordance with the terms of the Separation Agreement, in December 2005 we paid a preliminary special dividend to the Former Viacom of $5.40 billion which was subject to adjustments for, among other items, actual Former Viacom debt as of the date of the separation and actual CBS Corporation cash flow for the full year 2005, compared to estimates used to calculate the preliminary dividend paid in December 2005. In March 2006, we received from CBS Corporation an initial statement that the dividend should be increased. Based on an assessment of the amount and underlying components of the proposed additional dividend payments, we paid $170.2 million to CBS Corporation in May 2006 for undisputed amounts. During 2006, further claims were made by CBS Corporation of which we paid $35.9 million. In January 2007, we finalized a full settlement with CBS Corporation and paid $170.0 million. The settlement amount was accrued in our balance sheet as of December 2006, with a corresponding reduction of our additional paid-in capital. Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect our actual financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2005 and for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 are presented on a carve-out basis and reflect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the businesses of Former Viacom. The consolidated financial results for 2005 and 2004 may not necessarily reflect what our results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have been had we been a separate, stand-alone company during the periods presented. For example, the indebtedness of Former Viacom, other than capital lease obligations, was not assumed by us; therefore debt service cost is not reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings for periods ending December 31, 2005 and prior. The Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 include allocations of Former Viacom corporate expenses and Paramount corporate overhead including accounting, treasury, tax, legal, human resources, information systems and other services, as well as depreciation and amortization on allocated costs, to reflect the utilization of such shared services and assets by us. Total corporate costs allocated to us, excluding separation costs, were $162.0 million and $136.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and were primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Management believes the methodologies used to allocate charges for the services described above are reasonable. The assets and liabilities of Former Viacom assigned to us pursuant to the terms of the Separation Agreement are accounted for at the historical book values of such assets and liabilities. As noted previously, the indebtedness of 35 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Former Viacom, other than certain capital lease obligations, was not transferred to us. Prior to the Separation, Former Viacom centrally managed the cash flows generated from our various businesses. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations for 2006 principally include the release of tax reserves related to audit settlements reached in 2006. Famous Players, a Canadian based theater chain, and Blockbuster Inc. ( Blockbuster ) have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Famous Players was sold on July 22, 2005 and Blockbuster was split-off from Former Viacom in 2004. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our summary consolidated results of operations are presented below for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 are presented on a carve-out basis.

Media Networks segment revenues increased 7% to $7.24 billion. Worldwide advertising revenues at the Media Networks segment increased 6% to $4.29 billion and affiliate fees were up 11% to $2.03 billion. Acquisitions completed during the year by our Media Networks segment contributed $125.3 million to revenues principally in international markets. Filmed Entertainment segment revenues increased 46%, or $1.38 billion, for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $4.38 billion. The acquisition of DreamWorks and related distribution activities for DreamWorks Animation and the live-action library contributed $1.36 billion to 2006 revenues, accounting for the significant increase in revenues compared to 2005. 36 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $1.48 billion, or 18%, to $9.61 billion compared to 2004. Media Networks segment revenues increased 18% to $6.76 billion. Worldwide advertising revenues at the Media Networks segment increased 18% to $4.04 billion and affiliate fees were up 11% to $1.82 billion. Acquisitions completed by the Media Networks segment in 2005 included Neopets and iFilm. Filmed Entertainment segment revenues increased $481.6 million, or 19%, principally related to the release of War of the Worlds , The Longest Yard and Coach Carter . Famous Music acquisition of Extreme Music in 2005 contributed $14.0 million to the Filmed Entertainment segment revenues. The following tables present our revenues by component in both total dollar values and as a percentage of total revenues: Year Ended December 31, Better/(Worse) Revenues by Component (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2006 v. 2005 2005 v. 2004 Advertising $ 4,217.2 $ 3,963.4 $ 3,349.6 6 % 18 % Feature film 4,052.1 2,873.4 2,394.5 41 20 Affiliate fees 2,033.5 1,824.8 1,640.3 11 11 Ancillary 1,163.7 948.0 747.8 23 27 Total revenues $ 11,466.5 $ 9,609.6 $ 8,132.2 19 % 18 % Percentage of Revenues by Component Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Advertising 37 % 41 % 41 % Feature film 35 30 30 Affiliate fees 18 19 20 Ancillary 10 10 9 100 % 100 % 100 % We generated 24% of our total consolidated revenues from international markets in 2006 as compared to 22% and 21% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. During 2006, international acquisitions by the Media Networks segment contributed $77.4 million of revenue, principally in Europe. DreamWorks theatrical releases and distribution activities for DreamWorks Animation and the live-action library contributed $578.8 million in international revenues in 2006. Our principal international businesses are in Europe, of which the United Kingdom and Germany account for approximately 54%, 64%, and 47% of total European revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Revenues by Geographic Area (in millions) Year Ended December 31, Percent of Total 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 United States $ 8,700.0 $ 7,458.8 $ 6,418.0 76 % 78 % 79 % Europe 1,736.8 1,279.9 1,168.0 15 13 14 All other 1,029.7 870.9 546.2 9 9 7 Total revenues $ 11,466.5 $ 9,609.6 $ 8,132.2 100 % 100 % 100 % 37 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Expenses and Operating Income The following table provides the components of operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: Year Ended December 31, Better/(Worse) Operating expense by Component (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2006 v. 2005 2005 v. 2004 Operating expenses: Production and programming $ 3,896.8 $ 3,168.9 $ 2,426.0 (23 )% (31 )% Distribution 1,720.2 1,179.0 1,172.2 (46 ) (1 ) Merchandising & other 441.4 389.5 309.8 (13 ) (26 ) Total operating expenses $ 6,058.4 $ 4,737.4 $ 3,908.0 (28 )% (21 )% Production and programming expenditures increased 23%, or $727.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006, to $3.90 billion principally driven by increased film amortization in our Filmed Entertainment segment and an increase in total program amortization in our Media Networks segment. The increase in film amortization is due to the amount, timing and mix of film releases, which was driven in part by the acquisition of DreamWorks partially offset by the 2005 charge of $31.6 million for abandonment of certain projects in development. Production and programming expenses of $3.17 billion in 2005 increased $742.9 million, or 31%, from $2.43 billion in 2004. Media Networks expenses grew 19% in line with revenue growth. Filmed Entertainment expense grew 49%, or $421.9 million, driven primarily by War of the Worlds and The Longest Yard . Also contributing to the growth in Filmed Entertainment expenses were abandonments of certain projects in development totaling $31.6 million and higher overall development expenditures. Distribution expenses increased $541.2 million, or 46%, for the year ended December 31, 2006, to $1.72 billion, reflecting higher print and advertising expenditures in our Filmed Entertainment segment as a result of the number and timing of our theatrical releases and the commencement of distribution activities for DreamWorks Animation and live-action library productions. For films we distribute on behalf of DreamWorks Animation and DW Funding, we expense print and advertising costs as incurred and recover such costs typically in quarters immediately following the theatrical release. Distribution expenses of $1.18 billion in 2005 increased $6.8 million, or 1%, from $1.17 billion in 2004. Merchandising and other expenses increased $51.9 million, or 13%, principally driven by increased participations related to consumer product revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2005, merchandising and other expenditures were $389.5 million, an increase of $79.7 million, or 26%, due to higher costs associated with home entertainment sales and licensing activities, primarily in our Media Networks segment. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A ) were up 1%, or $24.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended December 31, 2005. This modest increase was due to incremental equity based compensation expense of $52.0 million, as a result of the adoption of a new accounting standard on equity compensation on a modified prospective basis and charges associated with executive management changes of $73.3 million, including $11.5 million of stock based compensation, related to the 38 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) resignation of the former President and Chief Executive Officer and former Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, partially offset by an amendment to the employment agreement with our Executive Chairman and Founder. Additionally, SG&A expenses increased in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to the consolidation of entities previously accounted for as equity investments. These increases were partially offset by nonrecurring 2005 separation related charges of $163.5 million and severance expenses of $70.5 million, incurred principally during the fourth quarter of 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2005, selling, general and administrative expenses of $2.25 billion reflect an increase of $557.0 million, or 33%. The increase was a result of separation related expenses of $163.5 million and severance charges of $70.5 million and an increase of $265.8 million, or 20% in Media Networks segment selling, general and administrative costs generally in line with 18% revenue growth. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense increased $106.5 million, or 41%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 principally as the result of increased intangible asset amortization expense resulting from 2006 acquisitions in both segments including DreamWorks intangible asset amortization of $43.5 million, current year digital media acquisitions of $16.3 million and higher full year amortization related to 2005 acquisitions. For 2005, depreciation and amortization increased $7.4 million, or 3%, from $251.6 million in 2004 principally driven by higher intangible asset amortization resulting from acquisitions. Each component of expense is discussed in greater detail within the section Segment Results of Operations. Operating Income Operating income increased 17%, or $405.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $2.77 billion compared with 2005. The Media Networks segment operating income increased 11% or $294.2 million, principally as a result of increased revenues and lower variable compensation and severance expenses. Filmed Entertainment segment operating income increased $67.0 million principally due to increased profitability of the current year film slate compared to the 2005 slate, additional third party distribution arrangements, lower development costs as well as $31.6 million in charges related to the abandonment of certain projects in development taken in 2005. Corporate expenses declined $38.6 million as increases related to executive management changes, as previously discussed, and general overhead increases were more then offset by the reduction in separation costs. For the year ended December 31, 2005, operating income increased $83.6 million, or 4%, as increases attributable to higher advertising and affiliate fees from the Media Networks segment were offset by higher separation costs and a decline in operating income of the Filmed Entertainment segment compared to 2004. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net for 2006 includes costs related to our senior notes and debentures, credit facilities, commercial paper, capital lease obligations and amounts associated with our derivative financial instruments. For the year ended December 31, 2006, interest expense, net increased $424.3 million as compared to 2005 principally due to higher average debt outstanding and higher interest rates in 2006. The higher average debt outstanding primarily is a result of the timing related to funding the special dividend payments to CBS Corporation made in connection with the Separation, the purchase of DreamWorks, the various acquisitions of our Media Networks segment and the purchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program. Interest expense, net decreased slightly for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to 2004 due principally to a decrease in interest related to capital lease obligations. 39 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Other Items, Net Other items, net reflected a loss of $13.6 million which was a $15.4 million, or 53%, improvement for the year ended December 31, 2006. This improvement was principally a result of increased transactional foreign exchange gains, including those related to long-term transponder leases, partially offset by increased asset securitization expense. For 2005, other items, net reflected a loss of $29.0 million attributable both to foreign exchange losses and securitization expense. Provision for Income Taxes For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded income tax expense of $737.8 million on pretax earnings of $2.31 billion resulting in an effective tax rate of 31.9%, inclusive of $141.8 million of nonrecurring tax benefits recognized principally related to audit settlements with tax authorities in 2006. We do not anticipate a similar level of discrete tax benefits in future periods. Our effective income tax rate was 44.0% in 2005 versus 36.0% in 2004. Our higher effective tax rate for 2005 principally reflects the effect of non-deductible separation related expenses included in the total separation costs of $163.5 million. Included in the 2004 effective tax rate was the recognition of $77.0 million in discrete tax benefits as a result of the resolution of certain income tax audits in 2004. Equity in Earnings (Loss) of Affiliated Companies, Net of Tax Equity in earnings (loss) of affiliated companies, net of tax declined $2.1 million as increased equity earnings generally attributable to our Media Network affiliates was offset principally by the impact of consolidating Nickelodeon UK which was previously accounted for on the equity basis of accounting prior to the acquisition of an incremental ownership interest in June 2006 which allows us to control the entity. For 2005, equity in earnings (loss) of affiliated companies, net of tax reflected earnings of $9.4 million for 2005 primarily attributable to media network affiliates including Nickelodeon UK. Minority Interest, Net of Tax Minority interest, net of tax, which primarily represents ownership held by third parties of certain international pay television companies, was a loss of $14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to losses of $3.8 million and $3.1 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. This was principally the result of the consolidation of previously unconsolidated investments, partially offset by normal operating fluctuations. Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations For the year ended December 31, 2006, net earnings from discontinued operations principally results from the release of tax reserves resulting from an audit settlement. For 2005 and 2004, net losses from discontinued operations reflect the operating results of Blockbuster and Famous Players through their respective dates of disposition. 40 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table presents segment revenues, expenses and operating income for the three years ended December 31, 2006. Transactions between segments are accounted for as third-party arrangements for the purposes of presenting segment results of operations. Typical intersegment transactions include the purchase of advertising by the Filmed Entertainment segment on Media Networks segment properties and the purchase of Filmed Entertainment segment feature films exhibition rights by the Media Networks segment. The elimination of such intercompany transactions on the consolidated results of operations is included within Eliminations.

In October 2006 we acquired Harmonix Music Systems, Inc. ( Harmonix ), the developer of Guitar Hero and other music gaming titles. In September 2006, we acquired Atom Entertainment, Inc., which owns a portfolio of four leading online destinations for casual games, short films and animation. In May 2006, we acquired Xfire, Inc., a leading gaming and social networking service. Additional acquisitions completed during the year include Quizilla, LLC; Y2M: Youth Media & Marketing and Caballero Television. We also acquired controlling interests in entities previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In December 2006, we completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in MTV Poland. In September 2006, we acquired the remaining 63.8% interest in MTV Japan. In August 2006, we acquired the remaining 58% interest of BET Interactive, the owner of BET.com. In June 2006, we acquired an additional 10% interest in Nick UK. Previously, Nick UK was a fifty-fifty joint venture with BSkyB. The results of these entities have been consolidated since the closing date of the transactions. Advertising Worldwide advertising revenues were up 6% to $4.29 billion in 2006, with domestic revenue up 6% and international revenue up 7% versus 2005. Domestic growth was driven by COMEDY CENTRAL, Spike TV, BET, Nickelodeon and digital media. The 6% year-over-year increase was a deceleration in the rate of domestic advertising revenue growth as compared to 2005 and substantially reflects a weaker audience rating performance across our domestic channels. Rating performance is a key driver in our ability to grow advertising revenues. International advertising revenues were up in Europe driven by the consolidation of Nick UK beginning in June, while acquisitions in total contributed $75.4 million to advertising revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006. Affiliate Fees Worldwide affiliate fees increased 11% to $2.03 billion in 2006, with domestic fees up 9% and international fees up 24% versus 2005. Rate increases principally at MTV and Nickelodeon as well as subscriber increases at various channels including MTV2, VH1 Pure Country, Logo and Tempo and several Nickelodeon channels 42 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) including Noggin, Nick Too, Nick Games & Sports drove the year over year growth. International revenue growth was driven by channel launches in France and by subscriber growth in Latin America among other markets. Acquisitions contributed $33.4 million to 2006 revenues, all of which were in Europe or Japan. Ancillary Worldwide ancillary revenues were up 2% in 2006 to $916.1 million. Increases in consumer products licensing fees, primarily for Dora the Explorer, were largely offset by lower home entertainment revenues impacted by the mix and number of home video releases, and unfavorable comparison to The Chappelle Show: Season 2 release in 2005. Syndication fees also declined slightly due to lower South Park syndication fees in 2006. Domestic revenues were up 3% to $608.5 million while international revenues declined slightly. Acquisitions, principally Harmonix and Atom Entertainment, contributed $16.5 million to total ancillary revenue. In 2005, total revenues increased 18% to $6.76 billion as all revenue components were up double digit percent. Advertising revenues increased 18% and represented 60% of total segment revenues, reflecting double digit percent gains across all domestic channels. International ancillary revenues were up 26%. Affiliates fees represented 27% of segment revenues and were up 11% reflecting subscriber and rate increases at our domestic networks and across international markets. Ancillary revenues increased 29% and represent 13% of segment revenues as increases in home video revenues led by The Chappelle Show: Season 2 and syndication fees at COMEDY CENTRAL drove growth versus 2004. Expenses and Operating Income Media Networks segment expenses consist of the amortization of costs incurred developing original programming and acquiring third party content; costs incurred to market our brands and content across distribution channels; and general and administrative costs.

In 2006, operating expenses increased $147.9 million as production costs including programming and distribution expenses increased in line with revenue growth. Program and production costs increased 8%, driven principally by original programming for several shows including The Colbert Report, The Daily Show and Making the Band. In addition, BET increased its investment in original programming in 2006, and we expect further increases in 2007. Amortization of acquired programming increased across most channels in line with revenue increases, particularly COMEDY CENTRAL, Nick Digital and Nick at Nite. Increases in consumer products related costs were in line with revenue increases and reflect higher participation costs. Operating expenses increased in international markets, reflecting the impact of entity consolidations and higher program and production costs. 43 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Increases in operating expenses of $393.8 million, or 21%, in 2005 compared to 2004 reflected $64.1 million of higher original programming costs, higher amortization expenses associated with newly acquired programming, such as CSI: Crime Scene Investigation for Spike, and an increase in music licensing fees and publishing rights. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel, marketing expenses, professional service fees and facility and occupancy costs for sales, marketing and administrative functions. In 2006, SG&A expenses increased $1.8 million. Compensation expenses in 2006 reflect incremental stock based compensation costs of $20.1 million resulting from the adoption of a new accounting standard. SG&A costs also increased in 2006 related to acquisitions including acquiring controlling interest in entities previously accounted for as equity investments. These increases were offset by lower severance and variable compensation expenses and $27.3 million from sales of certain distribution rights in two European markets in 2006. In 2005, SG&A expenses increased $265.8 million, principally due to higher domestic and international marketing expenses of $92.4 million, increased rent and maintenance costs, as well as severance expense of $47.9 million at MTVN. Total expenses for 2005 also included the full year impact of VIVA Media that was acquired in 2004 and the inclusion of iFilm and Neopets. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses reflect depreciation on fixed assets, including transponders financed under capital leases and amortization expense associated with intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization increased $39.2 million in 2006 as a result of acquisitions, as well as increased depreciation related to transponders utilized by MTVN Europe. In 2005, depreciation and amortization increased $7.6 million from 2004 primarily resulting from higher capital expenditures, new transponders and acquisitions. Operating Income Operating income increased 11%, or $294.2 million, to $2.90 billion in 2006, as a result of incremental revenues of $483.1 million partially offset by higher operating expenses and incremental depreciation and amortization. Acquisitions contributed $13.6 million to operating income, principally due to the consolidation of Nick UK. In 2005, operating income increased $345.1 million, or 15%, to $2.61 billion reflecting higher revenues, partially offset by 21% and 20% increases in operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively. 44 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Filmed Entertainment The results of operations of our Filmed Entertainment segment are subject to fluctuations due to various factors, including the public response to our theatrical films and DVD releases, timing and availability of releases and the amount and timing of print and advertising spending for films. In addition, the acquisition of DreamWorks and the commencement of distribution activities for DreamWorks Animation and live-action library films had a significant impact on the comparability of our 2006 results to prior years as further detailed below. Worldwide revenues increased $1.38 billion, or 46% in 2006 to $4.38 billion. The acquisition of DreamWorks and the DreamWorks Animation and live-action library distribution agreements contributed revenues of $1.36 billion, accounting for almost all of the segment revenue growth compared to 2005.

Domestic revenues increased $76.7 million, of which $142.2 million was attributable to DreamWorks and DreamWorks Animation films, offset by a decline in other theatrical revenues, principally due to the performance of Mission: Impossible III released in 2006 compared to War of the Worlds in 2005. In international markets, theatrical revenues increased $145.7 million, with $153.9 million due to our distribution of DreamWorks Animation films, including Over the Hedge and Flushed Away , as well as Munich which was released in 2005. In 2005 theatrical revenues increased $235.2 million compared to the prior year, principally driven by the 2005 releases of War of the Worlds, The Longest Yard, Coach Carter, Sahara and Four Brothers in comparison to revenues earned from our 2004 title releases, most notably Mean Girls, The Manchurian Candidate, The Stepford Wives, Collateral and Twisted. 45 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) The table below outlines our theatrical releases by title, by year, sorted by release date, for the years ended December 31, 2007 (tentative), 2006 and 2005.

Domestic home entertainment revenues increased $441.3 million, or 46%, with DreamWorks and related distribution agreements contributing $379.5 million. Our 2006 domestic releases which included Mission: Impossible III , Failure to Launch , jackass: number two , Barnyard , Nacho Libre and DreamWorks Animation Over the Hedge generated 46 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) higher revenues than our 2005 domestic releases, which included Lemony Snicket A Series of Unfortunate Events , The Longest Yard and SpongeBob SquarePants . International home entertainment revenues increased $119.1 million, with DreamWorks and related distribution agreements contributing $200.2 million partially offset by a decline in other titles resulting from the timing and mix of available titles. In 2005, worldwide home entertainment revenues increased 20% to $1.56 billion, primarily driven by The Longest Yard, War of the Worlds, Lemony Snicket A Series of Unfortunate Events, SpongeBob SquarePants and Sahara which more than doubled the performance of comparable 2004 titles including Mean Girls, The Manchurian Candidate, The Stepford Wives, Collateral and Twisted . Television License Fees Worldwide television license fees increased $470.6 million in 2006, with DreamWorks and the related distribution agreements contributing $469.1 million. Domestically, television license fees increased $231.0 million, with $244.4 million from DreamWorks and the related distribution agreements. International television license fees increased $239.6 million, of which $224.8 million was attributable to DreamWorks and related distribution agreements. In 2005, television revenues declined 3% to $650.8 million, due to mix and availability of titles in both international and domestic markets. Ancillary The increase in ancillary revenues of 90%, or $130.5 million, in 2006 was principally due to higher studio rental income and increased music royalties. We do not expect a similar level of studio rental income to be sustained in future years. The increase in ancillary revenues of 6% to $145.3 million in 2005 was driven by increased royalties and licensing and merchandising fees from consumer products related to 2005 feature films. Expenses and Operating Income Filmed Entertainment segment expenses principally consist of the amortization of film costs based on an ultimate revenue forecast model; costs incurred for print and advertising of our feature films; and general and administrative costs.

Year over year operating expense is impacted by the timing, number and mix of film releases during a particular year. In 2006, operating expenses increased $1.13 billion with DreamWorks and related distribution activities contributing $1.35 billion of the increase offset by a year-over-year decrease in exhibition costs. Incremental film amortization expense 47 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) contributed $570.1 million as compared to prior year, primarily due to DreamWorks and related distribution agreements, as well as mix and number of other titles released in 2006. Distribution costs increased $501.8 million as compared to prior year primarily as a result of increased print and advertising costs, driven by the number and timing of releases and DreamWorks and related distribution agreements. In 2005, operating expenses increased $513.5 million to $2.62 billion, primarily driven by an increase of $422.0 million in film and development amortization expense, including a $31.6 million charge related to the abandonment of development projects started by prior management. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and occupancy costs. SG&A costs increased $126.7 million in 2006 principally due to the integration of DreamWorks, partially offset by lower severance charges. SG&A costs increased $48.2 million in 2005 principally as a result of severance charges of $22.6 million incurred to adjust Paramount overhead structure upon the separation from CBS Corporation. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation on fixed assets and amortization of acquired intangibles, including acquired distribution rights. Depreciation and amortization increased $59.7 million of which $43.5 million was attributable to the acquisition of DreamWorks. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $4.0 million in 2005 due to depreciation of fixed asset additions. Operating Income Operating income increased $67.0 million in 2006 as result of improved film performance and the mix and timing of films in theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Operating income decreased 55% to $70.1 million in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to a $31.6 million charge related to the abandonment of development projects started by prior management, severance costs of $22.6 million incurred to adjust Paramount overhead structure as a result of the Separation from CBS Corporation and incremental development costs of $20.0 million. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Sources and Uses of Cash Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided through the operations of our businesses. In addition, we have sufficient access to debt and equity capital markets that, together with cash flow from operations, provide us adequate resources to fund ongoing operations including investment in programming and film productions, capital expenditures, share repurchases and investment in new projects, including digital media and similar acquisitions. Our principal uses of cash are for the creation of new content, acquisitions of third party content, ongoing investments in our businesses, cash acquisitions of businesses, and share repurchases. We also use cash for interest and tax payments. Spending on share repurchases and possible business acquisitions may require external financing. The use of appropriate amounts of debt lowers our overall cost of capital. The extent and timing of external financing will depend on our evaluation of current and projected market conditions. While share repurchases and acquisitions may utilize capital in excess of cash flow from operations, we manage such activities so that total debt levels remain within internal and rating agency guidelines and remain within our current credit ratings. Our access to capital markets can be affected by factors outside our control. In addition, our cost to borrow is impacted by market conditions and short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, 48 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) which are based on our performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. The table below summarizes our credit ratings as of December 31, 2006: Long- term Short- term Outlook Moody Investors Service Baa3 P-3 Stable Standard & Poors BBB A-2 Stable Fitch Ratings BBB F-2 Stable We believe that our investment grade credit rating will provide us with adequate access to capital markets given our expected cash needs. Our bank facilities are subject to one principal financial covenant, interest coverage, which we met on December 31, 2006. Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents increased by $344.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The change in cash and cash equivalents was as follows: Cash Flows Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Cash provided by operating activities $ 2,269.9 $ 1,635.9 $ 1,984.1 Cash used for investing activities (932.9 ) (165.1 ) (288.6 ) Cash used for financing activities (1,012.8 ) (1,251.2 ) (1,844.4 ) Effect of exchange rate on cash 20.5 (8.5 ) 5.8 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 344.7 $ 211.1 $ (143.1 ) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities of $2.27 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $634.0 million versus 2005. The increase was principally attributable to improved cash flow from operations for each business segment, including new and increased capacity under our securitization facilities of $500.0 million and reduction in cash taxes paid of $322.6 million, partially offset by higher interest payments of $413.4 million. The Media Networks segment consistently generates a significant percentage of our cash flow from operations. Advertising time is generally purchased by large media buying agencies and our affiliate fees are principally earned from cable television operators with significant capital resources. We have payment terms of generally ninety days or less and our current days sales outstanding for the Media Networks segment, calculated as accounts receivable divided by net revenues, multiplied by 360, was 59.6 days for 2006, an improvement of 5.2 days as compared to 2005. We continue our focus on lowering our days sales outstanding. The Filmed Entertainment segment operational results and ability to generate cash flow from operations substantially depend on the number of films in development and production, the level and timing of print and advertising costs and the public response to our theatrical and home entertainment film releases. In 2006, we entered into two film financing arrangements that, in most cases, sell a partial copyright interest in a slate of films, on a film-by-film basis, to third-party investors. Since the investors have acquired full risk for their proportionate ownership in title to each film, we record the amounts received for the sale of copyright interest as a reduction of the cost of the film. 49 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) For the year ended December 31, 2005, cash provided by operating activities of $1.64 billion decreased $348.2 million versus 2004. The decrease was principally due to a decrease in cash flows attributable to discontinued operations of $285.8 million, lower net earnings from continuing operations and higher cash taxes paid in 2005. Investing Activities Cash used for investing activities of $932.9 million in 2006 increased $767.8 million as compared to 2005. The significant increase is principally attributable to cash utilized for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $1.42 billion, including DreamWorks by our Filmed Entertainment segment and several acquisitions in digital media and similar properties including Harmonix, Atom Entertainment, and Xfire by our Media Networks segment. We also acquired the additional interest in Nick UK and the remaining interest not previously owned of MTV Japan. Capital expenditures also increased $16.7 million. Sources of cash from investing activities principally included the proceeds from the sale of the live-action library in May 2006 of $675.3 million. In general, our segments require relatively low levels of capital expenditures in relation to our net cash flow generated annually from operations which contributes to our ability to generate cash flow for future investment in our content and business operations, which we expect to be able to maintain over time. Cash used for 2005 investing activities of $165.1 million principally reflected acquisitions of $356.1 million, consisting primarily of the acquisition of Neopets, iFilm and Extreme Music, and capital expenditures of $193.0 million, partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of $404.2 million, primarily from the sale of Famous Players. Capital expenditures of $193.0 million increased $52.5 million, or 37%, principally reflecting increased investment in information systems in part related to the separation from the Former Viacom and leasehold improvements. Capital expenditures for Media Networks segment were $142.4 million and $86.9 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 64% incremental spending in 2005 is largely attributable to investments in technology and information systems. Filmed Entertainment capital expenditures were $46.7 million and $29.2 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 60% incremental spending in 2005 primarily relates to information systems and investments in studio assets. Financing Activities Cash used for 2006 financing activities was $1.01 billion as compared to $1.25 billion for 2005. In 2006, we received proceeds of $6.16 billion from the issuance of senior notes and debentures with various durations, discussed more fully below, $1.09 billion of commercial paper that was principally utilized to pay down revolving credit facilities entered into as a result of the special dividend of $5.40 billion paid to CBS Corporation in December 2005; acquisitions, principally of DreamWorks; and the purchase of 60.3 million shares at a cost of $2.35 billion under our share repurchase program. In 2006, we paid an additional $206.1 million to CBS Corporation related to the special dividend and accrued an additional $170.0 million which was paid in the first quarter of 2007. We also paid down $659.5 million of acquired notes and preferred interest, principally acquired as part of the DreamWorks acquisition. Cash used for financing activities in 2005 principally reflected the preliminary special dividend of $5.40 billion funded by borrowings under the term loan facility. In addition, cash flow from financing activities reflects the net contribution of $1.18 billion to Former Viacom related to operations prior to the Separation. Commitment and Contingencies In the normal course of our business, we provide and receive indemnities that are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, we may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification obligation. 50 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Guarantees Under the terms of the DW Funding sale agreement, the purchasers of DW Funding can require us to purchase their respective interest at the then current value of DW Funding, commencing nine months prior to the fifth anniversary of the sale. To the extent the current fair value at the option closing date is insufficient to repay the related subordinated indebtedness of DW Funding that we have guaranteed, we would be required to repay certain investors all accrued and unpaid interest and principal amounts outstanding of such related indebtedness. In connection with the separation, we agreed to indemnify CBS Corporation with respect to obligations as guarantor on certain Blockbuster store leases. Blockbuster has agreed to indemnify Former Viacom with respect to any amount paid under these guarantees. In the third quarter of 2005, Former Viacom sold Famous Players, an operator of movie theaters in Canada. In connection with the Separation, we agreed to indemnify CBS Corporation with respect to any liabilities under the Blockbuster guarantee and theatre leases. Additionally, we have indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. The outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated $37.4 million at December 31, 2006 and are not recorded on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2006. Business Combination Commitments In October 2006, we acquired Harmonix, the developer of Guitar Hero and other music gaming titles, for initial cash consideration of $175.0 million. In addition, to the extent financial results exceed specific contractual targets against a defined gross profit metrics; Harmonix shareholders may be eligible for incremental earn-out payments through 2008. Such incremental payments are not expected to be material to our financial condition and will be treated as additional consideration if paid. Capital Resources Capital Structure and Net Debt At December 31, 2006, net debt (which we define as total financing obligations less cash and cash equivalents) was $6.94 billion, an increase of $1.55 billion as compared to December 31, 2005. December 31, (in millions) 2006 2005 Senior notes and debentures: Senior notes due 2009, LIBOR + 0.350% $ 750.0 $ Senior notes due 2011, 5.750% 1,492.2 Senior notes due 2016, 6.250% 1,493.9 Senior debentures due 2036, 6.875% 1,733.0 Senior notes due 2055, 6.850% 750.0 Credit facilities: Term facility 5,405.0 $3.25 billion revolving facility Commercial paper 1,093.6 Obligations under capital leases 335.2 352.9 Total financing obligations 7,647.9 5,757.9 Less cash and cash equivalents (705.8 ) (361.1 ) Net debt $ 6,942.1 $ 5,396.8 51 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) We believe that net debt, along with total debt, is a useful component in the measurement of our capital structure. The following table reconciles the movement of net debt for the year ended December 31, 2006: (in millions) Net Debt Net debt, as of December 31, 2005 $ 5,396.8 Cash provided by operating activities (2,269.9 ) Business combinations, net of cash acquired 1,415.5 Business dispositions (700.6 ) Acquired notes and preferred interest 659.5 Stock repurchases 2,318.3 Other, net 122.5 Net debt, as of December 31, 2006 $ 6,942.1 Senior Notes and Debentures In April 2006, we completed a private placement of $4.75 billion in aggregate principal amounts of fixed rate, per annum, senior notes and debentures. The offering consisted of 5.75% Senior Notes due 2011, 6.25% Senior Notes due 2016 and 6.875% Senior Debentures due 2036. In addition, in June 2006, we completed a private placement of $750.0 million in floating rate senior notes, due in June 2009, that bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the three-month London Interbank Offer Rate ( LIBOR ) plus 0.35%, to be reset quarterly. In accordance with the terms of the private placements in April 2006 and June 2006 (collectively, the Private Placements ), we completed an offer to exchange the unregistered senior notes and debentures for senior notes and debentures that are registered with the SEC in October 2006. Furthermore, in December 2006, following the filing of our shelf registration statement, we completed a public debt offering of $750.0 of 6.85% senior notes due 2055. In accordance with the terms of the term credit facility, we utilized the net proceeds from the offerings described above to repay amounts outstanding under such facility and used the remainder to pay a portion of the amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. In connection with the April private placement, we entered into a $2.35 billion notional amount of variable to fixed interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of cash flows attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. In the second quarter of 2006, we terminated the swaps, resulting in cash proceeds to us of approximately $88.0 million that we principally recorded as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax. Such proceeds recorded in other comprehensive income will be recognized as a reduction of interest expense, net over the life of the senior notes and debentures. Credit Facilities As of December 31, 2006, our credit facility was comprised of a single $3.25 billion revolving facility due December 2010. The primary purpose of the facility is to fund short term liquidity needs and to support commercial paper borrowings. Borrowing rates under the revolving facility are determined at our option at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on the LIBOR plus a margin based on our senior unsecured credit rating. We also pay a facility fee based on the total amount of the commitments. In addition, at our option, we may borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the revolving facility. No amounts were outstanding under the facility as of December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2005, we had credit facilities totaling $9.25 billion, comprised of the $3.25 billion revolving facility discussed above and a $6.0 billion term facility with portions due in March 2007 and June 2007. As of 52 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) December 31, 2005, we had outstanding borrowings of $5.40 billion under the term facility which was utilized to pay the initial special dividend to Former Viacom. Commercial Paper At December 31, 2006, our outstanding commercial paper had a weighted average interest rate of 5.62% and average maturity of less than 80 days. We classify commercial paper as non-current financing obligations as we have the intent and ability, through utilization of the $3.25 billion revolving facility due December 2010, or our shelf registration statement, to refinance such obligations as long-term. The Company scheduled maturities of long-term debt at face value, excluding capital leases, outstanding at December 31, 2006 were as follows: (in millions) 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012- thereafter Long-term debt $ $ $ 750.0 $ 1,093.6 $ 1,500.0 $ 4,000.0 We anticipate that future debt maturities will be funded with cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operating activities and future access to capital markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to access capital markets on terms and conditions that will be acceptable to us. There are no provisions in any of our material financing agreements that would cause an acceleration of the obligation in the event of a downgrade in our debt ratings. Securitization Facilities We securitize certain receivables because the highly liquid and efficient market for securitization of certain assets provides us with a lower cost source of funding compared to our other borrowings and diversifies our obligations among different markets and investors. We are able to realize cost efficiencies under these arrangements since the assets securing the financing are generally held by a legally separate, wholly owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity ( SPE ) that provides investors with direct security in the assets. In general, we sell, on a revolving nonrecourse basis, a percentage ownership interest in certain of our accounts receivable (the Pooled Receivables ), which are short term in nature, through an SPE to third-party conduits sponsored by financial institutions. As consideration for Pooled Receivables sold through the securitization facilities, we receive cash and a retained interest. The retained interests are included in receivables on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. The retained interest may become uncollectible. In addition, we are the servicer of the receivables on behalf of the SPEs, for which we are paid a fee. Such servicing fee has not been material to any period presented. The terms of the revolving securitization arrangements require that the Pooled Receivables meet certain performance ratios. We are in compliance with the required ratios under the receivable securitization program for all periods presented. During 2006, we increased our total capacity under the facilities by $500.0 million and utilized the proceeds to pay down outstanding commercial paper. As of December 31, 2006, we had no unused capacity under the facilities. Stock Repurchase Program We have a $3.0 billion stock repurchase program under which repurchases were commenced on January 3, 2006. In addition, we have entered into an agreement with National Amusements, Inc. ( NAI ) and its wholly-owned subsidiary NAIRI, Inc. (the NAIRI Agreement ) pursuant to which we have agreed to buy, and NAI and NAIRI 53 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) have agreed to sell, a number of shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock each month such that the ownership percentage of Viacom Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock (considered as a single class) held by NAI and/or NAIRI would not increase as a result of Viacom purchase of shares under our stock repurchase program. As of February 21, 2007, we had acquired 62.5 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $2.44 billion. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements primarily consist of an accounts receivable securitization program, programming and talent commitments, operating lease arrangements and purchase obligations for goods and services. At December 31, 2006, our significant contractual obligations, including payments due by period, were as follows: (in millions) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012- thereafter Off-balance Sheet Arrangements Programming and talent commitments (1) $ 1,679.0 $ 353.8 $ 256.7 $ 201.6 $ 169.6 $ 183.0 $ 514.3 Operating leases (2) $ 873.8 $ 159.7 $ 142.8 $ 129.4 $ 86.7 $ 61.4 $ 293.8 Purchase obligations (3) $ 254.1 $ 169.9 $ 61.3 $ 21.8 $ 1.1 $ $ Balance Sheet Arrangements Capital lease obligations (4) $ 415.1 $ 82.2 $ 77.7 $ 72.9 $ 47.2 $ 31.2 $ 103.9 Long-term debt $ 7,343.6 $ $ $ 750.0 $ 1,093.6 $ 1,500.0 $ 4,000.0 Interest payments (5) $ 7,697.5 $ 455.7 $ 455.7 $ 434.4 $ 413.1 $ 308.6 $ 5,630.0 Other long-term obligations (6) $ 866.5 $ 362.0 $ 206.9 $ 155.5 $ 102.8 $ 29.3 $ 10.0 (1) Programming and talent commitments primarily include $1.37 billion relating to cable programming and feature film production and acquisitions and $306.4 million for talent contracts. (2) Includes long-term non-cancelable operating lease commitments for retail and office space and equipment, transponders, studio facilities and vehicles. (3) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders. (4) Includes capital leases for satellite transponders. (5) For each 1/8 percentage point change in the annual interest rates on the floating senior notes due 2009 and commercial paper due 2010 the effect on interest payments would be approximately $6.4 million. (6) Other long-term obligations primarily consist of participations due to producers and minimum guaranteed royalty obligations. MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We use or expect to use derivative financial instruments to modify exposure to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In accordance with our policy, we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure, and therefore we do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Foreign Exchange Risk We conduct business in various countries outside the United States, resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. dollar. In order to hedge anticipated cash flows and foreign currency balances in such currencies as the British Pound, the Australian 54 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Dollar, the Japanese Yen, the Canadian Dollar, the Singapore Dollar and the Euro, foreign currency forward and option contracts are used. Additionally, we designate forward contracts used to hedge future production costs as cash flow hedges, and designate certain forward contracts as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. The change in fair value of the non-designated contracts is included in current period earnings as part of other items, net. We manage the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally. At December 31, 2006, the notional value of all foreign exchange contracts was $253.0 million, of which $1.6 million related to the hedging of future production costs. The remaining $251.4 million represents hedges of underlying foreign currency balances and expected foreign currency net cash flows. At December 31, 2005, the notional value of all foreign exchange contracts was $109.1 million, of which $33.6 million related to the hedging of future production costs. The remaining $75.5 million represents hedges of underlying foreign currency balances and expected foreign currency net cash flows. Interest Rate Risk Our interest expense is exposed to movements in short-term rates. Swap agreements may be used to modify this exposure. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, there were no interest rate swaps outstanding. We have variable-rate debt that had an outstanding balance of $1.84 billion as of December 31, 2006. Based on our variable-rate obligations outstanding at December 31, 2006, a 1% increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would, respectively, increase or decrease our annual interest expense and related cash payments by approximately $18.4 million. Such potential increases or decreases are based on certain simplifying assumptions, including a constant level of variable-rate debt for all maturities and an immediate, across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period. Conversely, since most of our cash balance of approximately $705.8 million is invested in variable-rate interest earning assets, we would also earn more (less) interest income due to such an increase (decrease) in interest rates. Credit Risk We continually monitor our positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions which are counterparties to our financial instruments. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions. An appreciation of our critical accounting policies, those that are important to our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgment and estimates, is necessary to understand our financial results. Unless otherwise noted, we applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented, and have discussed such policies with our Audit Committee. Film Accounting Revenue Recognition Revenue we earn in connection with the exhibition of feature films by our Filmed Entertainment segment is recognized in accordance with Statement of Position No. 00-2 Accounting by Producers or Distributors of Films ( SOP 00-2 ). Our Filmed Entertainment segment principally earns revenue from the exhibition of feature film 55 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) content based upon theatrical exhibition, home entertainment and various television markets (e.g., network, pay, syndication, basic cable). We recognize revenue from theatrical distribution of motion pictures upon exhibition. We recognize revenue from home entertainment product sales, net of anticipated returns, upon later of delivery or the date that these products are made widely available for sale by retailers. We recognize revenue from the licensing of feature films and original programming for exhibition in television markets upon availability for airing by the licensee. We recognize revenue for video-on-demand and similar pay-per-view arrangements as the feature films are exhibited based on end-customer purchases as reported by the distributor. Original Production and Film Costs We capitalize feature film costs, on a title-specific basis, as noncurrent inventory in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We use an individual-forecast-computation method to amortize the costs over the applicable title life cycle based upon the ratio of current period and total gross revenues ( ultimate revenues ) for each title. We expense print and advertising costs as they are incurred and expense manufacturing costs, such as DVD manufacturing costs, on a unit-specific basis when we recognize the related revenue. In accordance with SOP 00-2, our estimate of ultimate revenues for feature films includes revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of a film initial domestic theatrical release. For acquired film libraries, our estimate of ultimate revenues is for a period within 20 years from the date of acquisition. Prior to the release of feature films and throughout its life, we estimate the ultimate revenues based on the historical performance of similar content, as well as incorporating factors of the content itself, including, but not limited to, the expected number of theaters and markets in which the original content will be released, the genre of the original content and the past box office performance of the lead actors and actresses. We believe the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues for feature films is domestic theatrical exhibition, as subsequent markets have historically exhibited a high correlation to domestic theatrical performance. The estimate of ultimate revenues impacts the timing of film cost amortization Upon a film initial domestic theatrical release and performance, we update our estimate of ultimate revenues based on actual results. If our original content is not received favorably, we may reduce our estimate of ultimate revenues, thereby accelerating the amortization of capitalized film costs. In addition, we use the individual-film-forecast computation method to determine whether or not film costs are impaired. If we believe that the release of our content has not been favorably received, then we would assess whether the fair value of such content is less than the unamortized portion of its capitalized costs and, if need be, recognize an impairment charge in the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the fair value. We had $1.77 billion and $1.23 billion of original production and film costs capitalized as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Acquired Programming Rights The accounting for acquired program rights is addressed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) in Statement No. 63, Financial Reporting by Broadcasters ( FAS 63 ). Under the provisions of FAS 63, a licensee reports an asset and liability for the rights acquired and obligations incurred at the commencement of the licensing period when the cost of the programming is known or reasonably determinable, the program material has been accepted by the licensee and the programming is available for airing. We record the transaction using the gross liability provision. The asset is amortized to operating expenses over the estimated periods revenues are generated, commencing upon the first airing. Determining factors used in estimating the useful life of programming includes the expected number of future airings, which may differ from the contracted number of airings, the length of the license period and expected future revenues to be generated from the programming. An 56 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) impairment charge may be necessary if our estimates of useful life of the programming are reduced or if programming is irrevocably taken off the air. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005 we had acquired programming rights of $1.30 billion and $1.07 billion, respectively. Revenue Recognition Gross versus Net Revenue Recognition We earn and recognize revenues where we act as distributor on behalf of third-parties. In such cases, determining whether revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis is based on management assessment of whether we act as the principal or agent in the transaction. To the extent we act as the principal in a transaction, we report revenues on a gross basis. In concluding on whether or not we act as principal, we follow the guidance set forth by the Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ) in EITF Issue No. 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent ( EITF 99-19 ). The determination of whether we act as a principal or an agent in a transaction involves judgment and is based on an evaluation of whether we have the substantial risks and rewards of ownership under the terms of an arrangement. Currently, our two most significant distribution arrangements are with DreamWorks Animation and DW Funding. Under the terms of the DreamWorks Animation and DW Funding distribution agreements, we are generally responsible for all out-of-pocket costs, primarily comprised of distribution and marketing costs. For the provision of distribution services, we are entitled to retain a fee expressed as a percentage of gross receipts, and recoup expended distribution and marketing costs on a film-by-film basis prior to any participation payments to DreamWorks Animation and DW Funding. As primary obligor, revenue and related distribution and marketing costs are presented on a gross basis in accordance with EITF 99-19. Sales Returns and Uncollectible Accounts Revenue allowances are recorded to adjust amounts originally invoiced to the estimated net realizable value in accordance with revenue recognition guidance set forth in FASB Statement No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists . Upon the sale of home entertainment product, we record a reduction of revenue for the impact of estimated customer future returns, rebates and other incentives ( estimated returns ). In determining estimated returns, we analyze historical return activity, current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products. Based on this information, we reserve a percentage of each dollar of product revenue when we provide a customer with the right of return. Our estimate of future returns affects reported revenue and operating income. If we underestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period, then we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amounts. If we overestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period, then we may record additional revenue in later periods when returns are less than estimated. An incremental change of 1% in our estimated sales returns as a percentage of home entertainment and consumer products revenue would have a $26.8 million impact on our total revenue. Our sales return allowance totaled $562.7 million and $403.8 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We also continually evaluate accounts receivable and establish judgments as to their ultimate collectibility. Judgment and estimates involved include an analysis of specific risks on a customer-by-customer basis for larger accounts and an analysis of actual historical write-off experience in conjunction with the length of time the receivables are past due. Using this information, management reserves an amount that is estimated to be uncollectible. An incremental change of 1% in our allowance for uncollectible accounts as a percentage of trade accounts receivables would have a $23.8 million impact on our operating results. Our allowance for uncollectible accounts totaled $142.9 million and $138.6 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 57 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Provision for Income Taxes As a global entertainment content company, we are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions where we have operations. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual provision for income taxes and evaluating our income tax positions. Our tax rates are affected by many factors, including our global mix of earnings, legislation, acquisitions, dispositions as well as the tax characteristics of our income. Our income tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issued raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. During 2006, we reached settlement of certain matters with the Internal Revenue Service, including certain positions relating to the 2000 through 2003 combined federal income tax returns of Former Viacom. As a result, our provision for income taxes includes $141.8 million of nonrecurring tax benefits principally related to these 2006 settlements. Fair Value Measurements The performance of fair value measurements is an integral part of the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Fair value is defined as the exchange price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell an asset or transfer a liability in the principal market for such asset or liability. Selection of the appropriate valuation technique as well as determination of assumptions and estimates for each technique requires significant judgment. Although we believe that the inputs used in our valuation techniques are reasonable, a change in one or more of the inputs could result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of certain assets and certain liabilities. Either instance would have an impact on both our Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Provided below are those instances where the determination of fair value could have the most significant impact on the financial condition or results of operations of our Company: Business Combinations . During 2006, we paid and assumed debt obligations of approximately $2.07 billion in total consideration, net of cash acquired, for the purchase of whole or controlling interest in several entities. The determination of fair value and associated lives for each asset and liability has a direct impact on our results of operations. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets . On an annual basis the test for goodwill impairment is performed using a two-step process. The first step is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments. The estimates of fair value of a reporting unit are determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions, including assumptions about future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on the budget and long-term business plans of each operating segment. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units. If necessary, the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. In addition, we currently have two trademarks that we consider to have an indefinite life. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. The estimates of fair value of trademarks are determined using a discounted cash flow valuation methodology commonly referred to as the relief from royalty methodology. Significant assumptions inherent in the relief from royalty methodology employed include estimates of appropriate marketplace royalty rates and discount rates. 58 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Our impairment analysis, which is performed annually during the fourth quarter, did not result in an impairment charge for goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets in the years presented. Finite-Lived Intangible Assets. In determining whether finite-lived intangible assets (e.g., customer lists, film libraries) are impaired, the accounting rules do not provide for an annual impairment test. Instead they require that a triggering event occur before testing an asset for impairment. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. If the intent is to hold the asset for continued use, first a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows against the carrying value of the asset is performed. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flow, the asset would be written down to the discounted fair value. If the intent is to hold the asset for sale, to the extent the carrying value is greater that the asset value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred and the determination of the cash flows for the assets involved and the discount rate to be applied in determining fair value. There was no impairment of finite-lived intangible assets in 2006. RECENT PRONOUNCEMENTS FIN No. 48 . In July 2006, FASB Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 ( FIN 48 ) was released. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes . FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement model for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return and provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. We continue to evaluate the impact of adoption of FIN 48. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN 48 will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. FIN 48 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2007. Statement No. 159 . In February 2007, FASB Statement No. 159 The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( FAS 159 ) was released. FAS 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. FAS 159 will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2008. We are currently assessing the potential effect of FAS 159 on our financial statements. Statement No. 157 . In September 2006, FASB Statement No. 157 Fair Value Measurements ( FAS 157 ) was released. FAS 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value, clarifies the definition of fair value, and expands disclosures about the use of fair value measurements. FAS 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and does not require any new fair value measurements. FAS 157 will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2008. We are currently assessing the potential effect of FAS 157 on our financial statements. Statement No. 156 . In March 2006, FASB Statement No. 156 Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 ( FAS 156 ) , was issued. FAS 156 requires that all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities in accordance with FAS 140 be initially measured at fair value, if practicable. FAS 156 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2007. The implementation of this standard is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 59 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Statement No. 155 . In February 2006, FASB Statement No. 155 Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments ( FAS 155 ), was released. FAS 155 establishes, among other items, the accounting for certain derivative instruments embedded within other types of financial instruments and eliminates a restriction on the passive derivative instruments that a qualifying special-purpose entity may hold. FAS 155 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2007. The implementation of this standard is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. OTHER MATTERS Legal Matters Former Viacom, NAI, Blockbuster and Viacom, and certain of our respective present and former officers and directors, are defendants in three putative class action lawsuits relating to the 2004 split-off of Blockbuster from Former Viacom pursuant to an exchange offer. The lawsuits now pending are a consolidated securities action and an ERISA action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas and a state law action in the Court of Chancery of Delaware. The lawsuits seek damages in unspecified amounts and other relief on behalf of various classes of Blockbuster and Former Viacom stockholders and, in the ERISA case, participants in the Blockbuster Investment Plan and the Plan itself. The lead plaintiffs in the consolidated securities action allege that the defendants in that case made untrue statements of material facts and concealed and failed to disclose material facts in the Prospectus-Offer to Exchange and elsewhere during the alleged period. The plaintiff in the ERISA action alleges that the defendants in that case breached fiduciary obligations to the Blockbuster Investment Plan by continuing to offer to plan participants Blockbuster stock from and after November 2003 and by offering to Plan participants the opportunity to exchange their shares of Former Viacom common stock for the shares of Blockbuster common stock. The plaintiff in the Delaware case alleges that the Former Viacom Board member defendants breached fiduciary duties to Former Viacom shareholders in connection with the split-off and that the Blockbuster Board member defendants breached fiduciary duties to Blockbuster shareholders by disproportionately favoring Former Viacom in the split-off transaction. In connection with the split-off, Blockbuster agreed to indemnify Former Viacom and its employees, officers and directors with respect to liabilities arising out of any material untrue statements and omissions in those portions of the 2004 Prospectus-Offer to Exchange relating to the split-off that were provided by Blockbuster. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, we will indemnify CBS Corporation for any losses arising from these lawsuits. We believe that the plaintiffs positions in these litigations are without merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves. On July 13, 2005, two identical shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed against Former Viacom relating to the compensation of Sumner Redstone, Tom Freston and Leslie Moonves, each of whom was an executive officer of Former Viacom. The plaintiffs claimed that the 2004 compensation of these officers was excessive and unwarranted and not entirely fair to Former Viacom and its shareholders, and sought disgorgement of compensation paid to the named officers in 2004, unspecified damages from members of Former Viacom Board of Directors for alleged breach of fiduciary duty, and other relief. In June 2006, the trial court denied Former Viacom motion to dismiss the case on procedural and substantive grounds. Former Viacom and the other defendants appealed this decision and following an oral argument of the appeal, the parties reached an agreement in principal to settle the matter. The settlement remains subject to final documentation and final approval of the Court. The sole cost to us of the settlement will be plantiffs attorneys fees, which will be set by the Court. Litigation is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on our understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, we believe that the above-described legal matters and other litigation to which we are a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 60 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Related Parties NAI, through NAIRI, Inc., was the controlling stockholder of Former Viacom, and as a result of the separation, is the controlling stockholder of both Viacom and CBS Corporation. Sumner M. Redstone, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and controlling shareholder of NAI, is the Executive Chairman of the Board and Founder of Viacom and CBS Corporation. In addition, Shari Redstone, who is Sumner Redstone daughter, is the Vice Chair of the Board of Viacom and CBS Corporation and is President and a director of NAI. Philippe Dauman, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and George Abrams also serve on the boards of both NAI and Viacom. Viacom and CBS Corporation Related Party Transactions In the normal course of business, we are involved in transactions with companies owned by or affiliated with CBS Corporation that results in the recognition of revenue by Viacom. Paramount licenses motion picture products to CBS Corporation. Paramount distributes certain television products for a fee on behalf of CBS Corporation television production group in the home entertainment market. Paramount also recognizes revenue related to the lease of studio space to CBS Corporation. Our media networks recognize advertising revenues for media spending placed by various subsidiaries of CBS Corporation. Through our media networks, we purchase television programming from CBS Corporation. The cost of these purchases is initially recorded as acquired program rights inventory and amortized over the estimated period that revenues will be generated. We place advertisements with various subsidiaries of CBS Corporation. Transactions with CBS Corporation, through the normal course of business, are settled in cash.

As previously discussed, in accordance with the terms of the Separation Agreement, in December 2005 the Company paid a preliminary special dividend to the Former Viacom of $5.40 billion. In May 2006, we paid $170.2 million for undisputed amounts. During 2006, further claims were made by CBS Corporation of which we paid $35.9 million. In January 2007, we finalized a full settlement with CBS Corporation and paid $170.0 million. The settlement amount was accrued in our balance sheet as of December 2006, with a corresponding reduction of our additional paid-in capital. The Separation Agreement further provided that we were responsible for the first $195.0 million in costs directly related to the Separation with amounts incurred in excess of $195.0 million being split equally between us and CBS Corporation. For the year ended December 31, 2005, included as a component in selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Earnings is $163.5 million of transaction costs. Such amounts principally included severance, information technology, investment banking and other professional fees. In addition, we entered into a Transition Services Agreement and a Tax Matters Agreement with CBS Corporation. Such arrangements are further described below and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Through the normal course of our business, we are involved in transactions with other affiliated companies that have not been material in any of the periods presented. Separation Agreement The Separation Agreement contains the key provisions required to effect the separation of Former Viacom into Viacom and CBS Corporation. The Separation Agreement identified assets transferred, liabilities assumed and contracts assigned to us by CBS Corporation and to CBS Corporation by us in the separation, and described when and how these transfers, assumptions and assignments were to occur. The Separation Agreement also sets forth certain agreements between us and CBS Corporation with respect to the period following the separation date. Former Viacom and Viacom executed the Separation Agreement in December 2005. Indemnification Obligations . Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, each company indemnified the other company and the other company officers, directors and employees for any losses arising out of its failure to perform or discharge any of the liabilities it assumed pursuant to the Separation Agreement, its businesses as conducted as of the date of the separation and its breaches of shared contracts. Legal Matters . In general, under the Separation Agreement, Viacom assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters related to its own business or assumed liabilities and will indemnify the other party for any liability arising out of or resulting from such assumed legal matters. Liability for, and control of, future litigation claims against Viacom for events that took place prior to, on or after the date of the separation generally will be assumed by the company operating the business to which the claim relates or, in the case of businesses which were sold or discontinued prior to the date of the separation, or for other matters agreed to be indemnified, the company which has assumed the liabilities. Viacom agreed to cooperate in defending any claims against both of Viacom and CBS Corporation for events that took place prior to, on, or after the date of the separation. Employee Matters. The Separation Agreement allocated liabilities and responsibilities relating to employee compensation and benefit plans and programs and other related matters in connection with the separation, including the treatment of certain outstanding annual and long-term incentive awards, existing 62 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) deferred compensation obligations and certain retirement and welfare benefit obligations. In general, the Separation Agreement provides that, following the separation, Viacom is responsible for all employment and benefit-related obligations and liabilities related to current employees who work for Viacom immediately following the separation, Former Viacom employees who most recently worked for other businesses and operations that became part of Viacom immediately following the separation, Former Viacom employees who most recently worked for certain other businesses and operations that were sold or discontinued prior to the separation, and certain other former employees of Former Viacom as set forth in the Separation Agreement (and, in each case, their dependents and beneficiaries). Liability for benefit-related obligations and liabilities of former employees of Former Viacom who most recently worked for the Former Viacom corporate office or the Paramount Pictures corporate office (other than those who accepted a post-separation position with CBS Corporation or Viacom) and certain Former Viacom corporate office employees who will remain employed by CBS Corporation and provide transition services following the separation is shared equally by Viacom and CBS Corporation. Effective as of the separation, employees of Viacom, other than overlapping employees, do not participate in Former Viacom employee benefit plans and Viacom established its own employee benefit plans that are substantially similar to the plans sponsored by Former Viacom prior to the separation. The Separation Agreement provided for the transfer of assets and liabilities, as applicable, relating to the pre-separation participation of Viacom employees and certain Former Viacom employees (as set forth in the Separation Agreement) in various Former Viacom retirement, welfare, incentive compensation and employee benefit plans from such plans to the applicable new plans established by Viacom. Limitations on Certain Acquisitions. Subject to limited exceptions, the Separation Agreement provides that none of Viacom, any subsidiary of Viacom or any person that is controlled by Viacom after the separation will own or acquire an interest in a radio or television broadcast station, television broadcast network or daily newspaper, if such ownership or acquisition would (i) cause CBS Corporation, any subsidiary of CBS Corporation or any entity controlled by CBS Corporation after the date of the separation to be in violation of U.S. federal laws limiting the ownership or control of radio broadcast stations, television broadcast stations, television broadcast networks or (ii) limit in any manner at any time under such laws CBS Corporation ability to acquire additional interests in a radio or television broadcast station and/or television broadcast network. These restrictions will terminate when none of Mr. Redstone, NAI, NAIRI or any of their successors, assigns or transferees are deemed to have interests in both CBS Corporation and Viacom that are attributable under applicable U.S. federal laws. The Separation Agreement also provides that neither Viacom, any subsidiary of Viacom or any person controlled by Viacom nor CBS Corporation, any subsidiary of CBS Corporation or any person controlled by CBS Corporation will acquire any asset, enter into any agreement or accept or agree to any condition that purports to bind, or subjects to a legal order, the other company, its subsidiaries or any person it controls without such other party written consent. In addition, neither Viacom, any subsidiary of Viacom or any person controlled by Viacom nor CBS Corporation, or subsidiary of CBS Corporation or any person controlled by CBS Corporation will own or acquire an interest in a cable television operator if such ownership would subject the other company to any U.S. federal laws regulating contractual relationships between video programming vendors and video programming distributors to which it is not then subject. These restrictions will terminate for each company on the earliest of (1) the fourth anniversary of the separation, (2) the date on which none of Mr. Redstone, NAI, NAIRI or any of their successors, assigns or transferees are deemed to have interests in both CBS Corporation and Viacom that are attributable under applicable U.S. federal laws and (3) the date on which the other company ceases to own the video programming vendors that it owns as of the separation. 63 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Tax Matters Agreement The following description of the principal provisions of the Tax Matters Agreement between Former Viacom and us is qualified by reference to the text of the Tax Matters Agreement, a form of which was filed as an exhibit to this annual report. The Tax Matters Agreement sets forth Viacom responsibilities with respect to, among other things, liabilities for federal, state, local and foreign income taxes for periods before and including the merger, the preparation and filing of income tax returns for such periods, disputes with taxing authorities regarding income taxes for such periods and indemnification for income taxes that would become due if the merger were taxable. Viacom will generally be responsible for federal, state and local, and foreign income taxes for periods before the merger relating to Viacom respective businesses. Income tax liabilities relating to discontinued operations and previously disposed businesses have been allocated in accordance with the principles applicable under the Separation Agreement for liabilities relating to those operations and businesses. Other income tax liabilities, including items that do not specifically relate to either business, will be shared equally. Viacom and CBS Corporation will generally be jointly responsible for managing any dispute relating to income taxes for which both parties may be responsible. The Tax Matters Agreement also provides that, depending on the event, Viacom may have to indemnify CBS Corporation, or CBS Corporation may have to indemnify Viacom, for some or all of the taxes resulting from the transactions related to the merger and the distribution of Viacom common stock if the merger and distribution do not qualify as tax-free under Sections 355 and 368 of the Code. Transactions Among Companies Owned by or Affiliated with NAI NAI licenses films in the ordinary course of business for its motion picture theaters from all major studios including Paramount. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, NAI made payments to Paramount in connection with these licenses in the aggregate amounts of approximately $13.4 million, $14.6 million, and $11.2 million, respectively. NAI and Mr. Redstone owned in the aggregate approximately 88% of the common stock of Midway Games Inc. ( Midway ) as of December 31, 2006. Midway places advertisements on several of Viacom cable networks from time to time. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, Midway made payments to MTVN of approximately $4.1 million, $5.9 million and $5.5 million, respectively. We believe that these transactions were no more or less favorable to the subsidiaries than they would have obtained from unrelated parties. We may continue to enter into these and other business transactions with Midway in the future. In December 2005, we entered into an agreement with NAI and NAIRI pursuant to which we agreed to buy, and NAI and NAIRI have agreed to sell, a number of shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock each month such that the ownership percentage of Viacom Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock (considered as a single class) held by NAI and/or NAIRI would not increase as a result of our purchase of shares under the stock repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2006, 53.4 million shares had been repurchased in the open market under the program for an aggregate purchase price of $2.08 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2006, 6.9 million shares have been repurchased under the NAIRI agreement for an aggregate price of $269.5 million. In September 2005, Cinemas International Corporation N.V., a joint venture between Former Viacom and Vivendi Universal, agreed to sell its Brazilian movie operations to NAI for approximately $27.5 million in a transaction that closed in October 2005. The sale was discussed with multiple potential purchasers and negotiated on terms we believe are no more or less favorable than those that might have been negotiated with an unaffiliated party. In the normal course of business, we are involved in other related party transactions that have not been material in any of the periods presented. 64 Table of Contents
