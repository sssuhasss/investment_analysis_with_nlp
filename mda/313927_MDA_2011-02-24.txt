ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Company consolidated financial statements. OVERVIEW The Company develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of consumer and specialty products. It recognizes revenues and profits from selling its products under a variety of brands to supermarkets, drug stores and mass merchandisers that sell the products to consumers. The Company also sells its products to industrial customers and distributors. The Company focuses its marketing efforts principally on its eight power brands. These well-recognized brand names include ARM & HAMMER, (used in multiple product categories such as baking soda, carpet deodorization and laundry detergent), TROJAN condoms, XTRA laundry detergent, OXICLEAN pre-wash laundry additive, NAIR depilatories, FIRST RESPONSE home pregnancy and ovulation test kits, ORAJEL oral analgesics and SPINBRUSH battery-operated toothbrushes. The Company business is divided into three primary segments, Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and Specialty Products. The Consumer Domestic segment includes the eight power brands and other household and personal care products such as SCRUB FREE, KABOOM, ORANGE GLO cleaning products, ANSWER home pregnancy and ovulation test kits, ARRID antiperspirant, and CLOSE-UP and AIM toothpastes. The Consumer International segment primarily sells a variety of personal care products, some of which use the same brand names as our domestic product lines, in international markets, including Canada, France, Australia, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Brazil and China. The Specialty Products segment is the largest U.S. producer of sodium bicarbonate, which it sells together with other specialty inorganic chemicals for a variety of industrial, institutional, medical and food applications. This segment also sells a range of animal nutrition and specialty cleaning products. In 2010, the Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and Specialty Products segments represented approximately 73%, 17% and 10%, respectively, of the Company net sales. Recent Developments On June 4, 2010, the Company acquired the SIMPLY SALINE brand of Nasal Saline Moisturizers from Blairex Laboratories ( Simply Saline Acquisition ) for cash consideration of $70.0 million. This brand will complement the Company existing STERIMAR brand nasal saline solution business in Europe and other parts of the world. The SIMPLY SALINE brand will be managed principally within the Consumer Domestic segment. On December 21, 2010, the Company acquired the FELINE PINE cat litter brand from Nature Earth Products, Inc. ( Feline Pine Acquisition ) for a cash consideration of $46.0 million. This brand will complement the existing ARM & HAMMER cat litter business and position the Company as the leading supplier of natural cat litter. The FELINE PINE brand will be managed within the Consumer Domestic segment. In the first quarter of 2010, the Company sold the BRILLO and certain LAMBERT KAY product lines, along with associated productive assets, that were classified as net assets held for sale at December 31, 2009. The aggregate carrying value of these assets at December 31, 2009 was approximately $8.8 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2009, the Company received net proceeds from the sale of these assets of $8.2 million, along with a note receivable of $1.8 million, and, in the first quarter of 2010, recognized a gain of approximately $1.0 million that was recorded as an offset to selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consumer Domestic segment. On January 27, 2010, the Company Board of Directors approved the termination, effective April 15, 2010, of The Church & Dwight Co., Inc. Retirement Plan for Hourly Employees (the U.S. Pension Plan ), under which approximately 766 participants, including 46 active employees, have accrued benefits. On December 1, 2010, the Company as plan sponsor of U.S. Pension Plan, purchased a non participating group annuity contract 24 Table of Contents from the Principal Life Insurance Company for the benefit of certain former and current employees with vested benefits in, and retired participants currently receiving benefits from the U.S. Pension Plan. In addition, effective December 1, 2010, an existing participating annuity contract with Aetna Insurance Company was changed to a non-participating annuity contract. The purchase price of the contracts was approximately $63 million, which was funded from the assets of the U.S. Pension Plan on December 1, 2010 (considered the measurement date for accounting purposes) and a one-time payment by the Company of approximately $14 million ($9 million after taxes). The transactions resulted in the transfer and settlement of the U.S. pension benefit obligation, thus relieving the Company of any responsibility for the U.S. Pension Plan obligations. As a result of the transfer of the pension plan obligations and assets described above, the Company recorded a charge to earnings in the fourth quarter of 2010 of approximately $24 million pre-tax or $0.21 per share. This charge is included in selling, general and administrative costs ( SG&A ). Following a raw material price decline in 2009, prices for commodities generally increased in 2010. As a result, the cost of surfactants, diesel fuel, corrugated paper and oil-based raw and packaging materials used in the household and specialty products businesses were all higher at the end of 2010 than the 2009 average. Moreover, the price of palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD), which generally fluctuates with the price of global vegetable oil, and latex were at record levels by the end of 2010. Additional increases in the prices of certain raw materials could materially impact the Company costs and financial results if the Company is unable to pass such costs along in the form of price increases to its customers. The Company has recorded liabilities in connection with uncertain income tax positions that, although supportable, may be challenged by the tax authorities. Substantially all material federal, state, and international income tax matters have been effectively concluded for years through 2007. In 2010, the Company recognized a benefit from the reversal of approximately $4.0 million in income tax expense and $3.0 million in pretax interest expense associated with certain tax liabilities as a result of the settlement of an IRS audit and the lapse of applicable statutes of limitation of several state taxing authorities. In addition, as a result of the settlement of the IRS audit and the lapse of applicable statutes of limitation of several state taxing authorities, the Company liabilities for uncertain income tax positions have decreased by $15.0 million, from $39.6 million at December 31, 2009 to $24.6 million at December 31, 2010. In 2000, the Company acquired majority ownership in its Brazilian subsidiary, Quimica Geral Do Nordeste S.A. ( QGN ). The acquired operations included an inorganic salt manufacturing plant which began site operations in the late 1970 s. Located on the site were two closed landfills, two active landfills and a pond for the management of the process waste streams. In 2009, QGN was advised by environmental authorities in the State of Bahia, the Institute of the Environment ( IMA ), that the plant was discharging contaminants into an adjacent creek. After learning of the discharge, QGN took immediate action to cease the discharge and retained two nationally recognized environmental firms to prepare a site investigation / remedial action plan ( SI/RA ). The SI/RA report was submitted by QGN to IMA in April 2010. The report concluded that the likely sources of the discharge were the failure of the pond and closed landfills. In November 2010, IMA responded to QGN recommendation for an additional study by issuing a notification requiring a broad range of remediation measures (the Remediation Notification ). In addition, notwithstanding repeated discussions with IMA at QGN request to consider QGN proposed remediation alternatives, in December 2010, IMA imposed a fine of five million reals (approximately $3 million) for the discharge of contaminants above allowable limits. QGN filed with IMA an administrative defense to the fine. IMA has not yet responded to QGN administrative defense. With respect to the Remediation Notification, QGN engaged in discussions with IMA during which QGN asserted that a number of the remediation measures and the timeframes for implementation were not appropriate 25 Table of Contents and requested that the Remediation Notification be withdrawn. In response, IMA stayed the Remediation Notification pending its further review. QGN intends to continue discussions with IMA to seek agreement on a rational and appropriate remediation plan. As a result of the foregoing events, the Company accrued approximately $3 million in 2009 and an additional $4.8 million in 2010 for remediation, fines and related costs. However, the Company cannot assure that additional costs will not be incurred in connection with this matter. Economic Conditions Uncertainty about current global economic conditions has affected demand for many products. Factors that can affect demand include rates of unemployment, consumer confidence, health care costs, fuel and other energy costs and other economic factors that affect consumer spending behavior. While the Company products generally are consumer staples that should be less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products, the Company products may become subject to increasing price competition as recessionary conditions continue. Moreover, some of our products, such as laundry additives and battery-operated toothbrushes, are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending. Some of our customers, including mass merchandisers, supermarkets, drugstores, convenience stores, wholesale clubs, pet specialty stores and dollar stores have experienced declining financial performance, which could affect their ability to pay amounts due to us on a timely basis or at all. In response, we regularly conduct a review of the financial strength of our key customers. As appropriate, we modify customer credit limits, which may have an adverse impact on future sales. We also regularly conduct a similar review of our suppliers to assess both their financial viability and the importance of their products to our operations. Where appropriate, we will seek to identify alternate sources of materials and services. To date, we have not experienced a material adverse impact from economic conditions affecting our customers or suppliers. However, a continued economic decline that adversely affects our suppliers and customers could adversely affect our operations and sales. In addition, many of our trade customers sell products under their own private label brands that compete with products that we sell. As consumers look for opportunities to decrease discretionary spending during current difficult economic times, our trade customers may discontinue or reduce distribution of our products to encourage those consumers to purchase our trade customers less expensive private label products. To offset any adverse effect on our business that results when trade customers discontinue distribution of our products or take actions to increase shelf space for their private label products, we focus our efforts on improving distribution with other customers. Our results could be adversely affected if these efforts are not effective. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Company Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. By their nature, these judgments are subject to uncertainty. They are based on the Company historical experience, its observation of trends in industry, information provided by its customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. The Company significant accounting policies and estimates are described below. 26 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition and Promotional and Sales Return Reserves Virtually all of the Company revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when delivered or picked up by our customers. The reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date. Promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives, such as coupons to consumers, and sales incentives provided to customers (such as slotting, cooperative advertising, incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements made directly with customers). All such costs are netted against sales. Slotting costs are recorded when the product is delivered to the customer. Cooperative advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for the Company products. Discounts relating to price reduction arrangements are recorded when the related sale takes place. Costs associated with end-aisle or other in-store displays are recorded when product that is subject to the promotion is sold. The Company relies on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves. For example, the Company uses historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements. Based on the total face value of Consumer Domestic coupons redeemed over the past several years, if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by 0.1% from the rate for which reserves are accrued in the financial statements, an approximately $2.4 million difference in the reserve required for coupons would result. With regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns, the Company uses experience-based estimates, customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required. If the Company estimates for promotional activities and sales returns were to change by 10% the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately $5.4 million. While management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made, estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company reduced promotion liabilities by approximately $6.8 million, $7.8 million and $4.0 million, respectively, based on a change in estimate as a result of actual experience and updated information. Impairment of goodwill, trademarks and other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment Carrying values of goodwill, trademarks and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment . The Company impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to unit volume, revenue and expense growth rates, and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions. With respect to goodwill, impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit. For trademarks and other intangible assets, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows, which represents the estimated fair value of the asset. The Company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations. Indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological change, distribution losses, or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired. The Company recognized tradename impairment charges within selling, general and administrative expenses for the three year period ended December 31, 2010 as follows: (In thousands) 2010 2009 2008 Segments: Consumer Domestic $ 0 $ 0 $ 1,910 Consumer International 0 0 3,764 Total $ 0 $ 0 $ 5,674 The tradename impairment charges recorded in 2008 were a result of management decision to exit a business, a potential change of a brand name, lost distribution at key customer accounts and reduced profitability. The amount of the impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the 27 Table of Contents asset to its carrying amount. Fair value was estimated based on a relief from royalty discounted cash flow method. Under this method, the owner of an intangible asset must determine the arm length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license that asset from a third party. Estimates under the relief from royalty method involve numerous variables that are subject to change as business conditions change, and therefore could affect fair values in the future. The Company determined that the remaining carrying value of all tradenames was recoverable based upon the forecasted cash flows and profitability of the brands. Property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment . The Company impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the long-lived assets are largely independent of other groups of Company assets and liabilities. The analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology, the continued success of product lines, and future volume, revenue and expense growth rates. The Company conducts annual reviews to identify idle and underutilized equipment, and reviews business plans for possible impairment implications. Impairment occurs when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows. When an impairment is indicated, the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows. The Company recognized charges related to plant impairment and equipment obsolescence, which occurs in the ordinary course of business during the three year period ended December 31, 2010 as follows: For the Year Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2010 2009 2008 Segments: Consumer Domestic $ 628 $ 3,231 $ 3,345 Consumer International 37 0 98 Specialty Products 3,090 6,916 142 Total $ 3,755 $ 10,147 $ 3,585 In 2010, the Company recorded a plant asset impairment charge of approximately $3.1 million, representing the carrying value of certain assets associated with one of its international subsidiaries. The charge is a result of a reduction in forecasted sales volume which has negatively impacted projected profitability. The charge is included in cost of sales in the Specialty Products Division segment income statement. In 2009, the Company recorded a plant asset impairment charge of approximately $6.9 million, representing the carrying value of certain assets, associated with one of its international subsidiaries. The Company measured the impairment charges using the discounted cash flow method. This subsidiary manufactures some products that compete with imports priced in U.S. dollars. As the dollar has weakened, it has been necessary to lower prices in the local currency to stay competitive, leading to negative cash flows, which is the key input under the discounted cash flow method. The charge is included in cost of sales in the Specialty Products Division segment. The other charges in 2010 are due to the idling of certain equipment. The $3.2 million charge recorded in the Consumer Domestic Segment in 2009 is primarily a result of a lack of acceptance for certain products by our key customers that resulted in a decline of forecasted future cash flows and reduced profitability. The charges in 2008 are due to the idling of certain equipment. The estimates and assumptions used in connection with impairment analyses are consistent with the business plans and estimates that the Company uses to manage its business operations. Nevertheless, future outcomes may differ materially from management estimates. If the Company products fail to achieve estimated volume and pricing targets, market conditions unfavorably change or other significant estimates are not realized, then the Company revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved, and the Company may be required to recognize additional impairment charges. Inventory valuation When appropriate, the Company writes down the carrying value of its inventory to the lower of cost or market (net realizable value, which reflects any costs to sell or dispose). The Company identifies any slow moving, obsolete or excess inventory to determine whether an adjustment is needed. The determination of 28 Table of Contents whether inventory items are slow moving, obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates and assumptions about the future demand for the Company products, technological changes, and new product introductions. In addition, the Company allowance for obsolescence may be impacted by the reduction of the number of stock keeping units ( SKUs ). The Company evaluates its inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis and records adjustments as required. Adjustments to inventory to reflect a reduction in net realizable value were $6.1 million at December 31, 2010, and $8.8 million at December 31, 2009. Valuation of pension and postretirement benefit costs As noted above under Overview Recent Developments, the Company entered into transactions with insurance companies in 2010 that have resulted in the transfer and settlement of all of the Company U.S. pension benefit obligation. The Company continues to have U.S. obligations with respect to non-pension postretirement benefits. The Company remaining pension costs relate solely to its international operations. Both pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in benefit cost valuations are key assumptions provided by the Company to its actuaries, including the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Material changes in the Company international pension and domestic/international postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets. The discount rate is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bond indices. Based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for the Company pension plans and postretirement plans, the Company refers to an applicable index and expected term of benefit payments to select a discount rate at which it believes the pension benefits could be effectively settled. The Company weighted average discount rate for its remaining international pension plans as of December 31, 2010 is 5.32% as compared to 5.76% used at December 31, 2009. Based on the published rate as of December 31, 2010 that matched estimated cash flows for the plans, the Company used a discount rate of 5.20% for its domestic postretirement plan as compared to 5.75% used at December 31, 2009. The expected long-term rate of return on international pension plan assets is selected by taking into account a historical trend, the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for the plans, the asset mix of the plans, and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation. Based on these factors, the Company weighted average expected long-term rate of return for assets of its remaining pension plans for 2010 was 5.76%, compared to 6.72% used in 2009. A 50 basis point change in the expected long-term rate of return would result in approximately $0.3 million change in pension expense for 2011. As noted above, changes in assumptions used by management may result in material changes in the Company pension and postretirement benefit costs. In 2010, other comprehensive income reflected a $3.4 million increase in its remaining pension plan obligations and a $1.3 million increase for postretirement benefit plans. The changes are primarily related to the change in discount rates for all plans. The Company made cash contributions of approximately $19.1 million to its pension plans in 2010 which includes approximately $14.0 million to settle the U.S. pension plan. The Company estimates it will be required to make cash contributions to its international pension plans of approximately $3.5 million in 2011 to offset 2011 benefit payments and administrative costs in excess of investment returns. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Management 29 Table of Contents provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for amounts which are not considered more likely than not to be realized. The liabilities relate to tax return positions that, although supportable by the Company, may be challenged by the tax authorities and do not meet the minimum recognition threshold required under applicable accounting guidance for the related tax benefit to be recognized in the income statement. The Company adjusts this liability as a result of changes in tax legislation, interpretations of laws by courts, rulings by tax authorities, changes in estimates and the expiration of the statute of limitations. Many of the judgments involved in adjusting the liability involve assumptions and estimates that are highly uncertain and subject to change. In this regard, settlement of any issue, or an adverse determination in litigation, with a taxing authority could require the use of cash and result in an increase in our annual tax rate. Conversely, favorable resolution of an issue with a taxing authority would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate of Income before Income Taxes. New Accounting Pronouncements There are no accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted by the Company which are expected to have a material impact on the Company financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Accounting pronouncements adopted during the periods presented resulted in changes to disclosures but did not have a material impact on the Company financial position, results of operations or cash flows. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008 The discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level presented below is followed by a more detailed discussion of results of operations by segment. The discussion of the Company consolidated results of operations and segment operating results is presented on a historical basis for the years ending December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008. The segment discussion also addresses certain product line information. The Company operating units are consistent with its reportable segments. Consolidated results 2010 compared to 2009 Net Sales Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $2,589.2 million, $68.3 million or approximately 2.7% above 2009 net sales. The components of the net sales increase are the following: Net Sales Consolidated December 31, 2010 Product volumes sold 5.5 % Pricing and sales mix (2.5 %) Foreign exchange rate fluctuations 1.1 % Change in customer delivery arrangements and allowances (0.9 %) Acquired product lines (1) 0.5 % Divested product lines (2) (1.0 %) Net Sales increase 2.7 % (1) On June 4, 2010, the Company acquired the SIMPLY SALINE product line, and in late December 2010, acquired the FELINE PINE product line. Net sales of the acquired product lines subsequent to the acquisition are included in the Company results. (See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information.) (2) Product lines divested include the BRILLO and certain LAMBERT KAY product lines, which were divested in the first quarter of 2010, and ancillary products divested in the third quarter of 2009 that initially were acquired in connection with the Company acquisition of the ORAJEL brand of products from Del Laboratories, Inc., a subsidiary of Coty, Inc., in October 2008 (the Orajel Acquisition ). 30 Table of Contents The reductions resulting from pricing and sales mix primarily reflect higher trade promotion and slotting costs in support of new product launches. At the beginning of the second quarter of 2010, the Company changed delivery arrangements with certain customers, which resulted in a reduction in net sales due to a transportation allowance for a customer pick-up program. Previously, the cost to ship product was included in cost of sales. Operating Costs The Company gross profit was $1,157.8 million in 2010, a $56.8 million increase as compared to 2009. The gross profit increase was attributable to higher sales volumes and lower manufacturing conversion costs, partially as a result of cost efficiencies derived from the Company new manufacturing facility in York, Pennsylvania, a reduction in costs associated with the shutdown of the Company manufacturing and warehouse facility in North Brunswick, New Jersey in 2009; a contribution from the SIMPLY SALINE business, which was acquired late in the second quarter of 2010; and favorable foreign exchange rates. Partially offsetting the gross profit improvement were higher trade promotion and slotting costs, higher commodity costs, the net effect of the divested and acquired product lines, and the change in customer delivery arrangements. The 2010 gross profit includes charges for environmental remediation, asset impairment and plant shutdown of $7.6 million at a Company international subsidiary. The gross profit in 2009 reflected an asset impairment charge and an environmental remediation charge of approximately $6.0 million also at the Company international subsidiary. Gross margin increased 100 basis points to 44.7% as compared to 43.7% in 2009. This increase is principally due to the reduction in costs related to the North Brunswick plant shutdown, manufacturing efficiencies in the new plant in York, Pennsylvania, and the change in customer delivery arrangements, partially offset by higher trade spending and commodity costs. Marketing expenses for 2010 were $338.0 million, a decrease of $15.7 million or 4.4% as compared to 2009. Marketing spending primarily was in support of the Company eight power brands. Funds from the reduction in marketing expenses were primarily used to increase trade promotion expenses (reflected in net sales) due to competitive pricing activity. Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A ) were $374.8 million in 2010, an increase of $20.3 million as compared to 2009. The increase in SG&A in 2010 includes the approximate $24.0 million expense related to the transfer and settlement of the U.S. Pension Plan obligations. The increase also is attributable to the effect of foreign exchange rates, higher selling costs in support of higher sales, costs associated with a global information system upgrade project and higher legal expenses partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs and the $1.0 million gain on the sale of certain LAMBERT KAY product lines during the first quarter of 2010. The consolidated statement of income for 2009 reflects the $20.0 million pre-tax gain, net of legal expenses, recognized by the Company in connection with the settlement of its litigation against Abbott Laboratories, Inc. (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information). Other Income and Expenses In 2010, equity in earnings of affiliates was $5.0 million as compared to $12.1 million in 2009. The decrease is due to lower equity income from the Company Armand Products Company joint venture due to lower pricing resulting from increased competitive activity and higher raw material costs. Other expense was approximately $4.6 million in 2010 as compared to other income of $1.5 million in 2009, which is primarily attributable to the write-off of approximately $4.5 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the Company prepayment of variable and subordinated debt. (See the liquidity section in Management Discussion and Analysis for further information.) Interest expense for 2010 decreased $7.8 million compared to 2009. The decline was due to the reversal of interest accruals of approximately $3.0 million associated with certain tax reserves following the settlement of an 31 Table of Contents IRS audit and the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations, lower interest rates compared to the prior year, and lower average debt outstanding, partially offset by a charge of $4.6 million relating to the termination of the Company interest rate collar and interest rate swap agreements. This termination was due to the Company repayment of its variable rate debt in the fourth quarter of 2010. (See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information.) Investment earnings of $0.6 million were lower due to a significant decline in interest rates. Taxation The 2010 tax rate was 35.3% as compared to 37.9% in 2009. The effective tax rate for 2010 included a benefit from an increase in the U.S. manufacturing tax deduction and the reversal of approximately $4.1 million associated with certain tax liabilities following the settlement of an IRS audit and the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations. Consolidated results 2009 compared to 2008 Net Sales Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $2,520.9 million, $98.5 million or approximately 4% above 2008 net sales. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations reduced sales in 2009 by 2%. Of the increase, approximately 2% is due to sales in the first half of 2009 of products acquired in connection with the July 2008 Orajel Acquisition. The balance of the increase in net sales is due primarily to higher prices and improved sales mix of approximately 3% and higher volumes of approximately 2%. These factors were offset in part by the reduction in sales resulting from the divestiture in the first quarter of 2008 of Brotherton Speciality Products Ltd. ( Brotherton ), a former United Kingdom subsidiary that was included in the Company Specialty Products Division, the third quarter 2009 divestiture of certain non-core product lines acquired in the Orajel Acquisition and the third quarter 2008 divestiture of the Company consumer products subsidiary in Spain. Operating Costs The Company gross profit was $1,101.0 million in 2009, a $129.3 million increase as compared to 2008. Gross margin increased 360 basis points to 43.7% as compared to 40.1% in 2008. The increase in gross margin reflects lower commodity costs, the impact of price increases instituted in 2008, the benefits of cost reduction programs and the higher margins associated with sales of products related to the Orajel Acquisition. The gross profit increase was partially offset by increased costs related to the planned closing of the Company North Brunswick, New Jersey manufacturing and warehousing facility, a fixed asset impairment charge of $6.9 million at an international subsidiary in 2009, and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Marketing expenses for 2009 were $353.6 million, an increase of $59.5 million or 20% as compared to 2008. The increased marketing spending included expenditures in support of ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, OXICLEAN powder and liquid laundry additives, TROJAN condoms and vibrating products, SPINBRUSH battery-operated toothbrushes, ARM & HAMMER baking soda and ARM & HAMMER DENTAL CARE, and expenditures for products acquired in the Orajel Acquisition, partially offset by the effect of foreign exchange rates. Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A ) were $354.5 million in 2009, an increase of $17.3 million as compared to 2008. The increase in SG&A in 2009 reflects increases in compensation and information systems costs, as well as higher amortization and operating costs related to the Orajel Acquisition, partially offset by lower international costs due in part to favorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, 2008 SG&A reflected charges related to the divestiture of the Spain subsidiary and the associated asset impairment charges of $5.7 million, offset by the $3.0 million gain on the divestiture of Brotherton. 32 Table of Contents The consolidated statement of income for 2009 reflects the $20.0 million pre-tax gain, net of legal expenses, recognized by the Company in connection with the settlement of its litigation against Abbott Laboratories, Inc. (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information). Other Income and Expenses In 2009, equity in earnings of affiliates was $12.1 million as compared to $11.3 million in 2008. The changes primarily reflect improved profitability of Armand Products Company. Other income was approximately $1.5 million in 2009 as compared to other expense of $3.2 million in 2008. The changes in both years principally reflect foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Interest expense for 2009 decreased $11.4 million compared to 2008. The decline was due to lower interest rates compared to the prior year. Investment earnings of $1.3 million were lower due to a significant decline in interest rates. Taxation The 2009 tax rate was 37.9% as compared to 36.7% in 2008. The 2009 tax rate reflects higher U.S. taxable income, which carries a higher effective tax rate than our foreign entities. The 2008 tax rate reflects a tax benefit of $4.0 million related to the divestiture of the subsidiary in Spain, partially offset by non-deductible losses in Company owned life insurance. Segment results for 2010, 2009 and 2008 The Company operates three reportable segments: Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and Specialty Products Division ( SPD ). These segments are determined based on differences in the nature of products and organizational and ownership structures. The Company also has a Corporate segment. Segment Products Consumer Domestic Household and personal care products Consumer International Primarily personal care products SPD Specialty chemical products The Corporate segment income consists of equity in earnings of affiliates. The Company had 50% ownership interests in Armand Products Company ( Armand ) and The ArmaKleen Company ( ArmaKleen ) as of December 31, 2010. The Company 50% ownership interest in Esseco U.K. LLP ( Esseco ) was divested in the first quarter of 2008 as part of the sale of Brotherton. The Company equity in earnings of Armand and ArmaKleen for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, and Esseco for the two months ended February 29, 2008 (prior to the sale of Brotherton), is included in the Corporate segment. Some of the subsidiaries that are included in the Consumer International segment manufacture and sell personal care products to the Consumer Domestic segment. These sales are eliminated from the Consumer International segment results set forth below. 33 Table of Contents Segment sales and income before taxes and minority interest for each of the three years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were as follows: (In thousands) Consumer Domestic Consumer International SPD Corporate Total Net Sales (1) 2010 $ 1,886,082 $ 444,033 $ 259,105 $ 0 $ 2,589,220 2009 1,881,748 393,696 245,478 0 2,520,922 2008 1,716,801 420,192 285,405 0 2,422,398 Income Before Income Taxes (2) 2010 $ 341,858 $ 52,577 $ 18,784 $ 5,037 $ 418,256 2009 325,633 38,562 15,991 12,050 392,236 2008 236,956 34,635 25,335 11,334 308,260 (1) Intersegment sales from Consumer International to Consumer Domestic, which are not reflected in the table, were $3.6 million, $3.0 million and $5.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. (2) In determining Income before Income Taxes, interest expense, investment earnings, and other income (expense) were allocated among the segments based upon each segment relative operating profit. Product line revenues for external customers for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were as follows: (In thousands) 2010 2009 2008 Household Products $ 1,207,390 $ 1,196,474 $ 1,081,440 Personal Care Products 678,692 685,274 635,361 Total Consumer Domestic 1,886,082 1,881,748 1,716,801 Total Consumer International 444,033 393,696 420,192 Total SPD 259,105 245,478 285,405 Total Consolidated Net Sales $ 2,589,220 $ 2,520,922 $ 2,422,398 Consumer Domestic 2010 compared to 2009 Consumer Domestic net sales in 2010 were $1,886.1 million, an increase of $4.3 million or 0.2% compared to net sales of $1,881.7 million in 2009. The components of the net sales change are the following: Net Sales Consumer Domestic December 31, 2010 Product volumes sold 5.6 % Pricing and sales mix (3.5 %) Change in customer delivery arrangements and allowances (1.2 %) Acquired product lines (1) 0.6 % Divested product lines (2) (1.3 %) Net Sales increase 0.2 % (1) On June 4, 2010, the Company acquired the SIMPLY SALINE product line, and in late December 2010, acquired the FELINE PINE product line. Net sales of acquired product lines subsequent to the acquisition are included in the Company segment results. (See Note 6 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information.) (2) Product lines divested included the BRILLO and certain LAMBERT KAY product lines, which were divested in the first quarter of 2010, and ancillary products divested in the third quarter of 2009 that initially were acquired in connection with the Orajel Acquisition. 34 Table of Contents Higher sales of ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, ARM & HAMMER SUPER SCOOP cat litter, TROJAN condoms and KABOOM bathroom cleaner were offset by lower sales of XTRA liquid laundry detergent, OXICLEAN laundry additive, SPINBRUSH toothbrushes, ARM & HAMMER powder detergent, ARRID antiperspirant and other oral care products. Consumer Domestic Income before Income Taxes for 2010 was $341.9 million, a $16.2 million increase as compared to 2009. The 2010 increase is due to the impact of higher product volumes sold, cost efficiencies derived from the Company new manufacturing facility in York, Pennsylvania, lower costs associated with the North Brunswick, New Jersey plant and warehouse shutdown in 2009, lower manufacturing costs, lower marketing costs, lower SG&A costs and lower allocated interest expense, partially offset by higher trade promotion and slotting expenses and higher SG&A costs primarily related to the settlement of the U.S. Pension Plan obligations. 2009 compared to 2008 Consumer Domestic net sales in 2009 were $1,881.7 million, an increase of $164.9 million or 9.6% compared to net sales of $1,716.8 million in 2008. Of the increase, approximately 2% reflects first half of 2009 sales of products acquired in connection with the July 2008 Orajel Acquisition. The increase also is attributable to higher volumes and higher prices and improved sales mix. At a product line level, sales of XTRA liquid laundry detergent, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, OXICLEAN laundry additive, ARM & HAMMER SUPER SCOOP cat litter and ARM & HAMMER powder laundry detergent were all higher than in 2008. The higher prices are principally a result of the May 2008 price increase on ARM & HAMMER powder laundry detergent and the October 2008 price increase on liquid laundry detergents, toothpaste and battery-operated toothbrushes. Consumer Domestic Income before Income Taxes for 2009 was $325.6 million, an $88.6 million increase as compared to 2008. The 2009 increase is due to higher profits relating to higher net sales, lower commodity costs, the $20.0 million gain, net of legal expenses, recognized by the Company in connection with the settlement of its litigation against Abbott Laboratories, Inc. (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report), and lower allocated interest expense, partially offset by accelerated depreciation and other expenses associated with the Company 2009 shutdown of its North Brunswick, New Jersey facility (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report), and increased marketing and SG&A costs. In addition, the results for 2009 also reflect the incremental effect of the Orajel Acquisition, which occurred in July 2008. Consumer International 2010 compared to 2009 Consumer International net sales in 2010 were $444.0 million, an increase of $50.3 million or 12.8% as compared to 2009. The components of the net sales change are the following: Net Sales Consumer International December 31, 2010 Product volumes sold 8.3 % Pricing and sales mix (1.2 %) Foreign exchange rate fluctuations 5.9 % Acquired product lines (1) 0.1 % Divested products (2) (0.3 %) Net Sales increase 12.8 % (1) On June 4, 2010, the Company acquired the SIMPLY SALINE product line. Net sales of this product line subsequent to the acquisition are included in the Company segment results. (See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information.) (2) Product lines divested included the BRILLO and certain LAMBERT KAY product lines, which were divested in the first quarter of 2010, and ancillary products divested in the third quarter of 2009 that initially were acquired in connection with the Orajel Acquisition. 35 Table of Contents Higher unit volumes were generated principally in Canada, Australia, France, the United Kingdom and Brazil. Consumer International income before income taxes was $52.6 million in 2010, an increase of $14.0 million compared to 2009. Higher profits are attributable to the higher sales volume and favorable exchange rates on U.S. dollar purchases of inventory and the translation of foreign financial statements to U.S. dollars, partially offset by higher SG&A and marketing costs. 2009 compared to 2008 Consumer International net sales in 2009 were $393.7 million, a decrease of $26.5 million or 6.3% as compared to 2008. This decrease reflects the approximately 10% impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and approximately 2% due to the divestiture of the Company subsidiary in Spain. This decline was partially offset by higher volumes, higher prices and improved sales mix in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Mexico and Brazil, and increased U.S. exports. Consumer International income before income taxes was $38.6 million in 2009, an increase of $3.9 million compared to 2008. This increase is due to higher income associated with higher unit volume and favorable sales mix partially offset by higher marketing and SG&A expenses and the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, 2008 income before income taxes reflected charges related to the sale of the subsidiary in Spain. Specialty Products 2010 compared to 2009 Specialty Products net sales were $259.1 million for 2010, an increase of $13.6 million, or 5.6% as compared to 2009. The components of the net sales change are the following: Net Sales Specialty Products Division December 31, 2010 Product volumes sold 0.3 % Pricing and sales mix 3.4 % Foreign exchange rate fluctuations 2.2 % Divested product lines (1) (0.3 %) Net Sales increase 5.6 % (1) Product lines divested include the BRILLO product line, which was divested in the first quarter of 2010. The pricing and sales mix increase in 2010 reflects higher sales prices in response to raw material increases primarily in the animal nutrition business. Product volume increases were realized in the animal nutrition business. Specialty Products Income before Income Taxes for 2010 was $18.8 million, an increase of $2.8 million as compared to 2009. The increase in income in 2010 reflects the profits on higher net sales and a favorable foreign exchange rate associated with the Brazilian Real. Income before taxes in 2010 also includes expenses of $9.7 million associated with an increase in environmental reserves of $4.9 million and an impairment and plant shutdown charge of $4.8 million at the Company international subsidiary. Cost of sales includes $7.6 million of these charges and SG&A includes $2.1 million. In 2009 these items totaled approximately $9.9 million. 2009 compared to 2008 Specialty Products net sales were $245.5 million for 2009, a decrease of $39.9 million, or 14.0% as compared to 2008. Volumes declined in the animal nutrition business primarily due to the continued lower U.S. milk prices which has depressed the dairy market, thus reducing the cash flow of dairy farmers. The decrease in 36 Table of Contents net sales also reflects the approximately 2% impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the impact of the sale of Brotherton during the first quarter of 2008. These factors were partially offset by higher prices and favorable sales mix of approximately 7% primarily of certain specialty chemical products. Specialty Products Income before Income Taxes for 2009 was $16.0 million, a decrease of $9.3 million as compared to 2008. The decline in income in 2009 reflects the asset impairment charge and environmental remediation charge at one of the Company international subsidiaries totaling approximately $9.9 million, and lower income due to lower volumes. The results for 2008 included a $3.0 million gain associated with the sale of Brotherton. Liquidity and capital resources As of December 31, 2010, the Company had $189.2 million in cash, $25.0 million available through its $115.0 million accounts receivable securitization facility, approximately $500 million available under its new revolving credit facility and a commitment increase feature that enables the Company to borrow up to an additional $500.0 million, subject to lending commitments and certain conditions as described in the Credit Agreement. To enhance the safety of its cash resources, the Company invests its cash primarily in government agency money market funds. On November 18, 2010, the Company entered into a new credit agreement ( Credit Agreement ) to replace its existing credit facility. The Credit Agreement provides for a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The Company also has the ability to increase its revolving credit facility by up to an additional $500 million, subject to lender commitments and other conditions as described in the Credit Agreement. Unless extended, the Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts outstanding thereunder will be due and payable on November 18, 2015. As a result of the new credit agreement, the Company paid off the remaining outstanding balance of its bank term loans of $408 million. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information. On December 15, 2010, the Company closed on an underwritten public offering of $250 million aggregate principal amount of 3.35% senior notes due 2015 (the Notes ). The Notes were issued under an indenture dated December 15, 2010, and a first supplemental indenture dated December 15, 2010, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee relating to the Notes. The proceeds were used to retire the outstanding $250 million principal amount of the Company 6% senior subordinated notes due December 15, 2012. Interest on the Notes is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning June 15, 2011. The Notes will mature on December 15, 2015, unless earlier retired or redeemed as described below. In addition, the Company terminated its interest rate collar and swap cash flow hedge agreements. As a result of the refinancing, the Company recorded in interest expense total hedge losses of $4.6 million, of which $4.3 million was a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income, and recorded, as other expense, the unamortized deferred financing costs of $4.5 million associated with the previous debt arrangements. If the Company borrows under the revolving credit facility, it would consider entering into hedge agreements to mitigate the interest rate risk. The Company renewed its accounts receivable securitization facility in February 2011. This facility has been renewed annually in the past, and the Company anticipates that this facility will be renewed in February 2012. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had borrowed $90.0 million under this facility. The current economic environment presents risks that could have adverse consequences for the Company liquidity. (See Economic conditions could adversely affect our business under Risk Factors in Item 1A.) However, the Company does not currently anticipate that the potential adverse developments addressed in those 37 Table of Contents risk factors will occur. In addition, the Company does not anticipate that current economic conditions will adversely affect its ability to comply with the financial covenants in its principal credit facilities because the Company currently is, and anticipates that it will continue to be, in compliance with the minimum interest coverage ratio requirement and the maximum leverage ratio requirement under its new credit facility described above. These financial ratios are discussed in more detail in this section under Certain Financial Covenants. On February 7, 2011, the Board of Directors increased the Company regular quarterly dividend from $0.17 per share to $0.34 per share, equivalent to an annual dividend rate of $1.36 per share, commencing with the dividend payable on March 1, 2011. The higher dividend raises the annualized dividend payout from approximately $49 million to approximately $97 million. The Company last increased its dividend in August 2010. The Company anticipates that its cash from operations, together with its current borrowing capacity, will be sufficient to meet its capital expenditure program costs, which are expected to be approximately $80 to $90 million in 2011 and pay dividends at the latest approved rate. As a result of the 2010 refinancing activities, the Company does not have any mandatory debt payments in 2011. Cash may be used for acquisitions that would complement the Company existing product lines or geographic markets. Net Debt The Company had outstanding total debt of $339.7 million and cash of $189.2 million (of which approximately $62.4 million resides in foreign subsidiaries) at December 31, 2010. Total debt less cash ( net debt ) was $150.5 million at December 31, 2010. This compares to total debt of $816.3 million and cash of $447.1 million, resulting in net debt of $369.2 million at December 31, 2009. Cash Flow Analysis Year Ending December 31, (In thousands) 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 428,482 $ 400,949 $ 336,167 Net cash (used in) investing activities $ (180,448 ) $ (104,140 ) $ (466,161 ) Net cash (used in) financing activities $ (503,724 ) $ (58,315 ) $ 87,222 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities The Company net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 increased $27.6 million to $428.5 million as compared to 2009. The increase was primarily due to higher net income, higher deferred income taxes primarily due to tax amortization of intangibles and depreciation and a decrease in working capital (exclusive of cash). For the year ended December 31, 2010, the components of working capital that significantly affected operating cash flow are as follows: Accounts receivable increased $12.7 million due to the timing of increased net sales. Inventories decreased $24.1 million primarily due to inventory management improvement efforts. Accounts payable and other accrued expenses increased $22.7 million primarily because of timing of invoice payments, offset by higher incentive and profit sharing compensation paid out in early 2010, and severance related payments associated with the closure of the Company North Brunswick, New Jersey facility in 2009. Income taxes payable decreased $7.6 million due to the timing of payments. 38 Table of Contents Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities during 2010 was $180.4 million, reflecting the $70.0 million acquisition of the SIMPLY SALINE brand, the $46.0 million acquisition of FELINE PINE cat litter, a $10 million acquisition of oral care technology and $63.8 million of property, plant and equipment expenditures partially offset by $8.2 million of proceeds received for assets sold, $1.8 million in payments received on outstanding notes receivable, and state government grants of $1.7 million received in connection with the York, Pennsylvania facility. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities during 2010 was $503.7 million, principally reflecting a net decrease in debt of $781.4 million resulting from the $531.4 million retirement of the Company term loan facility, the $250.0 million retirement of the Company 6% senior subordinated notes due 2012, and repayment of short term bank debt of $4.9 million at one of the Company international subsidiaries. The net decrease in debt was offset by $249.7 million in net proceeds obtained through the Company issuance of $250 million principal amount of its 3.35% senior notes due 2015 and $60.0 million obtained through the Company increased borrowing under its accounts receivable securitization facility. Other net cash used in financing activities included $44.0 million to pay cash dividends. In addition to new borrowings, cash used in financing activities also was partly offset by proceeds of and tax benefits from stock option exercises, aggregating $7.3 million. See Market Risk below for management discussion of interest rate risk. Certain Financial Covenants Consolidated EBITDA (referred to below as Adjusted EBITDA ) is a component of the financial covenants contained in, and is defined in, the new Credit Agreement. Financial covenants include a leverage ratio (total debt to Adjusted EBITDA) and an interest coverage ratio (Adjusted EBITDA to total interest expense), which if not met, could result in an event of default and trigger the early termination of the Credit Agreement. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, which is determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The leverage ratio during the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was 0.64, which is below the maximum of 3.25 permitted under the Credit Agreement, and the interest coverage ratio for the twelve months ending December 31, 2010 was 18.70, which is above the minimum of 3.00 permitted under the Credit Agreement. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for disclosures relating to the Credit Agreement. The reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) to Adjusted EBITDA for 2010 is as follows: (In thousands) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 428,482 Noncontrolling Interest 23 Interest paid 29,325 Current Income Tax Provision 108,709 Excess Tax Benefit on Stock Options Exercised 7,261 Change in Working Capital and Other Liabilities (31,582 ) Adjustments for Significant Acquisitions / Dispositions net 6,737 Adjusted EBITDA (per Credit Agreement) $ 548,955 39 Table of Contents Commitments as of December 31, 2010 The table below summarizes the Company material contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2010.

(2) Letters of credit with several banks guarantee payment for items such as insurance claims in the event of the Company insolvency and one year of rent on a warehouse. Performance Bonds are principally for required municipal property improvements. (3) Pension contributions are based on actuarial assessments of government regulated employer funding requirements. These requirements are not projected beyond one year since they fluctuate with the change in plan assets, assumptions and demographics. (4) The Company has outstanding purchase obligations with suppliers at the end of 2010 for raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are enforceable and legally binding, and do not represent total anticipated purchases. The Company has excluded from the table above uncertain tax liabilities due to the uncertainty of the amount per period of payment. As of December 31, 2010, the Company has gross uncertain tax liabilities, including interest, of $27.2 million (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report). Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities. OTHER ITEMS Market risk Concentration of Risk In each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, net sales to the Company largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates were 23%, 22% and 22% respectively, of the Company total consolidated net sales. Interest Rate Risk The Company has significantly reduced its interest rate risk as a result of its refinancing activities in 2010. While the Company had outstanding total debt at December 31, 2010 of $339.7 million, $250.0 million or 74% carries a fixed rate of interest at 3.35%. The remaining debt balance primarily is comprised of $90.0 million 40 Table of Contents outstanding under the accounts receivables securitization agreement, which had an interest rate of 1.30% at December 31, 2010. The Company previously entered into interest rate collar and swap agreements to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations on its recently terminated bank term loans. The Company settled these agreements in connection with the termination of the bank loans. Should the Company need to use its revolving credit facility, it would consider entering into hedge agreements to mitigate the interest rate risk, if conditions warrant. Diesel Fuel Hedge The Company uses independent freight carriers to deliver its products. These carriers charge the Company a basic rate per mile that is subject to a mileage surcharge for diesel fuel price increases. During the second quarter of 2010, the Company entered into hedge agreements with a financial counterparty. Under the hedge agreements, the Company agreed to pay a fixed price per gallon of diesel fuel determined at the time the agreements were executed and to receive a floating rate payment reflecting the variable common carriers mileage surcharge. The last of the agreements, which cover approximately 23% of the Company 2011 diesel fuel requirements, expire on September 30, 2011. The floating rate payment is determined on a monthly basis based on the average of the Department of Energy Diesel Fuel Index price during the applicable month. The floating rate payment is designed to offset any increase or decrease in fuel surcharge payments that the Company pays to its carriers. The Company uses the hedge agreements to mitigate the volatility of diesel fuel prices and related fuel surcharges, and not to speculate in the future price of diesel fuel. The hedge agreements are designed to add stability to the Company product costs, enabling the Company to make pricing decisions and lessen the economic impact of abrupt changes in diesel fuel prices over the term of the contract. These agreements qualify for hedge accounting . Therefore, changes in the fair value of diesel fuel hedge agreements are recorded in Other Comprehensive Income on the balance sheet. Foreign Currency The Company is subject to exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily U.S. Dollar/Euro, U.S. Dollar/British Pound, U.S. Dollar/Canadian Dollar, U.S. Dollar/Mexican Peso, U.S. Dollar/Australian Dollar, U.S. Dollar/Brazilian Real and U.S. Dollar/Chinese Yuan. The Company, from time to time, enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to anticipated but not yet committed intercompany sales or purchases denominated in the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, British pound and Euro. The Company Canadian and Brazilian subsidiaries entered into forward exchange contracts to protect the Company from the risk that, due to changes in currency exchange rates, it would be adversely affected by net cash outflows. The face value of the unexpired contracts as of December 31, 2010 totaled U.S. $34.3 million. The amount recorded, before taxes, as a result of changes in fair value of the forward exchange contracts, was an approximately $0.3 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2010. Equity Derivatives The Company has entered into equity derivative contracts covering its own stock in order to minimize its liability, resulting from changes in quoted fair values of Company stock, to participants under its Executive Deferred Compensation Plan who have investments under that plan in a notional Company stock fund. Since the equity derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, the Company is required to mark the agreements to market throughout the life of the agreements and record changes in fair value in the consolidated statement of income. See Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding the reported changes in fair values of the Company derivative instruments.
