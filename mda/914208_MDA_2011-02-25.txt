Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview The following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented. This overview and the remainder of this management discussion and analysis supplements, and should be read in conjunction with, the Consolidated Financial Statements of Invesco Ltd. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the company or Invesco ) and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Invesco is a leading independent global investment manager with offices in more than 20 countries. As of December 31, 2010, we managed $616.5 billion in assets for retail, institutional and high-net-worth investors around the world. By delivering the combined power of our distinctive worldwide investment management capabilities, Invesco provides a comprehensive array of enduring solutions for our clients. We have a significant presence in the institutional and retail segments of the investment management industry in North America, UK, Europe and Asia-Pacific, serving clients in more than 150 countries. Despite a number of challenges during the year, including the U.S. equity market flash crash in May, the heightened risk of European sovereign default, and continued uncertainty about the strength of the economic recovery, most global equity markets achieved positive returns in 2010 marking the second year of recovery from the financial crisis as illustrated in the chart below: The response to these challenges by governments and central banks around the world of providing additional fiscal and monetary stimulus led to an investor environment that favored riskier assets as yields on less risky government bonds reached record lows. As a result, most global equity markets achieved positive returns in 2010 with the S&P 500 climbing almost 13%, the FTSE 100 rising 9%, and the MSCI EAFE index gaining nearly 5%. The exception was the equity market in Japan which declined 3% as the strength in the Japanese Yen, up almost 15% against the U.S. Dollar in 2010, negatively impacted the profits of Japanese exporters and multinational corporations. The table below summarizes the year ended December 31 returns of several major market indices for 2010, 2009, and 2008: Year ended December 31, Index 2010 2009 2008 S&P 500 12.8 % 23.5 % (37.0 %) FTSE 100 9.0 % 22.1 % (28.0 %) Nikkei 225 (3.0 %) 19.0 % (41.1 %) MSCI EAFE 4.9 % 27.8 % (45.1 %) 23 Table of Contents Both Treasury markets and corporate credit markets achieved positive returns in 2010 as well. Treasury securities benefited from the combination of the flight to quality trade in the first half of the year, coinciding with the U.S. equity market flash crash and increased risk of default by some European governments, as well as the Federal Reserve beginning the second round of quantitative easing, a process whereby the Federal Reserve creates new money to purchase Treasury securities. For the year, 10-year Treasury notes gained 8% while shorter dated 3- and 5-year notes gained 5% and 7% respectively. Corporate credit markets benefited from improved fundamentals as earnings improved and corporations stockpiled cash. Further, the stimulus efforts from central bankers around the globe provided support as yields on government securities reached record lows, and fixed income investors moved out the credit risk curve in search of higher yields. For the year, investment grade credit gained 9.0% while high-yield bonds returned 14.6%. Invesco continued to make progress in a number of areas that better positioned our company as the markets continue their measured return to pre-financial crisis levels. Throughout the course of 2010, the company financial performance strengthened. In addition, during this period, Invesco continued to strengthen its competitive position with respect to investment performance, maintained its focus on its clients, and enhanced its profile in the industry. A critical factor in Invesco ability to weather the economic storms of the past three years was our integrated approach to risk management. Our risk management framework provides the basis for consistent and meaningful risk dialogue up, down and across the company. Our Global Performance Measurement and Risk group provides senior management and the Board with insight into core investment risks, while our Corporate Risk Management Committee facilitates a focus on strategic, operational and all other business risks. Further, business component, functional, and geographic risk management committees maintain an ongoing risk assessment process that provides a bottom-up perspective on the specific risk areas existing in various domains of our business. Through this regular and consistent risk communication, the Board has reasonable assurance that all material risks of the company are being addressed and that the company is propagating a risk-aware culture in which effective risk management is built into the fabric of the business. In addition, we benefited from having a diversified asset base. One of Invesco core strengths, and a key differentiator for the company within the industry, is our broad diversification across client domiciles, asset classes and distribution channels. Our geographical diversification recognizes growth opportunities in different parts of the world. Invesco is also diversified by asset class, with approximately 48% of our assets under management in equities and the remaining 52% invested in fixed income and other investments. This broad diversification enables Invesco to withstand different market cycles and take advantage of growth opportunities in various markets and channels. On June 1, 2010, the company acquired Morgan Stanley retail asset management business, including Van Kampen Investments (the acquired business or the acquisition ) in exchange for a combination of $770.0 million in cash paid and 30.9 million common shares and common share equivalents, which were subsequently sold, as converted, to unrelated third parties. The acquisition added assets under management across equity, fixed income and alternative asset classes (including mutual funds, variable insurance funds, separate accounts and UITs). More specifically, this acquisition: Expanded the depth and breadth of the company investment strategies, enabling the company to offer an even more comprehensive range of investment capabilities and vehicles to its clients around the world; Enhanced the company ability to serve U.S. clients by positioning Invesco among the leading U.S. investment managers by assets under management (AUM), diversity of investment teams and client profiles; Deepened Invesco relationships with clients and strengthen its overall distribution capabilities; and Further strengthened its position in the Japanese investment management market. Presentation of Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The company provides investment management services to, and has transactions with, various private equity, real estate, fund-of-funds, collateralized loan obligation products (CLOs), and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. The company serves as the investment manager, making day-to-day investment decisions concerning the assets of the products. Certain of these entities are consolidated under variable interest or voting interest entity consolidation guidance. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1, Accounting Policies and Note 20, Consolidated Investment Products, for additional details. 24 Table of Contents Effective January 1, 2010, the company adopted guidance now encompassed in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810, Consolidation. The adoption of this new guidance had a significant impact on the presentation of the company financial statements in 2010, as its provisions required the company to consolidate certain CLOs that were not previously consolidated. In accordance with the standard, prior periods have not been restated to reflect the consolidation of these CLOs. The majority of the company consolidated investment products balances were CLO-related as of December 31, 2010. The collateral assets of the CLOs are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs. The company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the CLOs, beyond the company minimal direct investments in, and management fees generated from, the CLOs. If the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. Additionally, the investors in the CLOs have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the CLOs. The company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability. The impact of consolidation of investment products is so significant to the presentation of company financial statements (but not to the underlying financial condition or results of operations of the company) that, combined with the presentation of newly-incurred transaction and integration costs and additional intangible asset amortization resulting from the acquired business, the company expanded its use of non-GAAP measures beginning with the presentation of the company results for the three months ended March 31, 2010. The discussion that follows therefore combines results presented under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with the company non-GAAP presentation. There are four distinct sections within this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations after the Assets Under Management discussion: Results of Operations (for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared with the year ended December 31, 2009, and for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared with the year ended December 31, 2008); Schedule of Non-GAAP Information; Balance Sheet Discussion; and Liquidity and Capital Resources. Each of the financial statement summary sections (Results of Operations, Balance Sheet Discussion, and Liquidity and Capital Resources) begins with a table illustrating the impact of the consolidation of investment products. The narrative that follows each of these sections separately provides discussion of the underlying financial statement activity for the company, before consolidation of investment products, as well as of the financial statement activity of consolidated investment products. Additionally, wherever a non-GAAP measure is referenced, a disclosure will follow in the narrative or in the note referring the reader to the Schedule of Non-GAAP Information, where additional details regarding the use of the non-GAAP measure by the company are disclosed, along with reconciliations of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures to the non-GAAP measures. To further enhance the readability of the Results of Operations section, separate tables for each of the revenue, expense, and non-operating income/expense sections of the income statement introduce the narrative that follows, providing a section-by-section review of the company income statements for the periods presented. 25 Table of Contents Summary Operating Information Summary operating information for 2010, 2009 and 2008 is presented in the table below. Year ended December 31, U.S. GAAP Financial Measures Summary 2010 2009 2008 Operating revenues $ 3,487.7 m $ 2,627.3 m $ 3,307.6 m Operating margin 16.9 % 18.4 % 22.6 % Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 465.7 m $ 322.5 m $ 481.7 m Diluted EPS $ 1.01 $ 0.76 $ 1.21 Average assets under management (in billions) $ 532.3 $ 415.8 $ 468.9 Year ended December 31, Non-GAAP Financial Measures Summary 2010 2009 2008 Net revenues (1) $ 2,602.2 m $ 1,984.6 m $ 2,490.2 m Adjusted operating margin (2) 34.5 % 28.5 % 33.2 % Adjusted net income (3) $ 639.7 m $ 378.1 m $ 527.1 m Adjusted EPS (3) $ 1.38 $ 0.89 $ 1.32 Average assets under management (in billions) $ 532.3 $ 415.8 $ 468.9 (1) Net revenues are operating revenues less third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, plus our proportional share of the net revenues of our joint venture investments, plus management fees earned from, less other revenue recorded by, consolidated investment products. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for the reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues. (2) Adjusted operating margin is adjusted operating income divided by net revenues. Adjusted operating income includes operating income plus our proportional share of the operating income of our joint venture investments, transaction and integration charges, amortization of acquisition-related prepaid compensation and other intangibles, compensation expense related to market valuation changes in deferred compensation plans, the operating income impact of the consolidation of investment products, and other reconciling items. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for the reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income. (3) Adjusted net income is net income attributable to common shareholders adjusted to add back transaction and integration charges, amortization of acquisition-related prepaid compensation and other intangibles, and the tax cash flow benefits resulting from tax amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Adjusted net income excludes the net income of consolidated investment products, and the net income impact of deferred compensation plans and other reconciling items. By calculation, adjusted EPS is adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (for diluted EPS). See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for the reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income. A significant portion of our business and AUM is based outside of the U.S. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, primarily the Pound Sterling and the Canadian dollar, will impact our reported revenues and expenses from period to period. Additionally, our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our AUM. Therefore, movements in global capital market levels, net new business inflows (or outflows) and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period. The returns from most global capital markets increased in the year ended December 31, 2010, which also contributed to net increases in AUM of $35.7 billion (excluding acquisitions) during the year. AUM at January 31, 2011, was $624.3 billion. 26 Table of Contents Investment Capabilities Performance Overview Invesco first strategic priority is to achieve strong investment performance over the long-term for our clients. Long-term performance in our equities capabilities, as measured by the percentage of AUM ahead of benchmark and ahead of peer median, is generally strong with some pockets of outstanding performance. Within our equity asset class, Asian, Continental European, and U.S. Core have had strong relative performance versus competitors and versus benchmark over three- and five-year periods. Our U.S. Value and Global Ex-U.S. and Emerging Markets have exceptional long-term performance with over 92% of assets ahead of benchmarks and peer group medians. Within our fixed income asset class, Global fixed income products have achieved strong long-term performance with at least 80% of AUM ahead of benchmarks and 77% of AUM ahead of peers on a 3-year and 5-year basis.

Peer group rankings are sourced from a widely-used third party ranking agency in each fund market (Lipper, Morningstar, Russell, Mercer, eVestment Alliance, SITCA) and asset-weighted in USD. Rankings are as of prior quarter-end for most institutional products and prior month-end for Australian retail funds due to their late release by third parties. Rankings for the most representative fund in each GIPS composite are applied to all products within each GIPS composite. Excludes Invesco PowerShares, W.L. Ross & Co., Invesco Private Capital, non-discretionary direct real estate products and CLOs. Certain other funds and products were excluded from the analysis because of limited benchmark or peer group data. Had these been available, results may have been different. These results are preliminary and subject to revision. Performance assumes the reinvestment of dividends. Past performance is not indicative of future results and may not reflect an investor experience. 27 Table of Contents Assets Under Management The company rolling presentation of AUM from period to period (on the following pages) illustrates long-term inflows and outflows separately from the net flows into institutional money market funds. Long-term inflows and the underlying reasons for the movements in this line item include investments from new clients, existing clients adding new accounts/funds or contributions/subscriptions into existing accounts/funds, and new funding commitments into private equity funds. We present net flows into institutional money market funds separately, because shareholders of those funds typically utilize them as short-term funding vehicles and because their flows are particularly sensitive to short-term interest rate movements. There are numerous drivers of AUM inflows and outflows, including individual investor decisions to change their investment preferences, fiduciaries making broad asset allocation decisions on behalf of advised clients and reallocation of investments within portfolios. We are not a party to these asset allocation decisions, as the company does not generally have access to the underlying investor decision-making process, including their risk appetite or liquidity needs. Therefore, the company is not in a position to provide meaningful information regarding the drivers of inflows and outflows. To align our external reporting of AUM with how Invesco is portrayed in the industry and to reflect more fully the company revenue drivers, in the three months ended June 30, 2010, the company changed its definition of AUM to include assets with which the company is also associated: the PowerShares QQQQ ETF, PowerShares DB ETFs, and other passive assets. These products previously were not included in the company reported AUM because the company does not receive investment management fees from these assets. These assets are marketed as Invesco products, and to include them as part of our AUM more accurately reflects the full size and capabilities of Invesco. Additionally, the company may receive meaningful performance service, distribution, or transaction revenues from these assets. The inclusion of these assets as AUM changed the following data points from those previously disclosed: Previously Post-Reporting $ in billions Disclosed Alignment Ending AUM: December 31, 2006 462.6 482.0 December 31, 2007 500.1 529.3 December 31, 2008 357.2 377.1 December 31, 2009 423.1 459.5 Average AUM: Year ended December 31, 2006 424.2 430.7 Year ended December 31, 2007 489.1 511.7 Year ended December 31, 2008 440.6 468.9 Year ended December 31, 2009 388.7 415.8 Net revenue yield on AUM*: Year ended December 31, 2006 56.9 bps 55.9 bps Year ended December 31, 2007 59.1 bps 56.5 bps Year ended December 31, 2008 56.5 bps 53.1 bps Year ended December 31, 2009 50.9 bps 47.7 bps Net revenue yield on AUM before performance fees*: Year ended December 31, 2006 55.0 bps 54.0 bps Year ended December 31, 2007 57.7 bps 55.2 bps Year ended December 31, 2008 54.8 bps 51.5 bps Year ended December 31, 2009 50.1 bps 47.0 bps Gross revenue yield on AUM*: Year ended December 31, 2006 N/A 75.6 bps Year ended December 31, 2007 80.0 bps 76.5 bps Year ended December 31, 2008 75.8 bps 71.2 bps Year ended December 31, 2009 68.2 bps 63.8 bps Gross revenue yield on AUM before performance fees*: Year ended December 31, 2006 N/A 73.6 bps Year ended December 31, 2007 78.5 bps 75.1 bps Year ended December 31, 2008 74.1 bps 69.6 bps Year ended December 31, 2009 67.5 bps 63.0 bps * Net and gross revenue yield are defined in the paragraphs that follow this table. 28 Table of Contents Additionally, as a result of the acquisition, the company now manages unit investment trust (UIT) products, which are categorized in this passive asset group, and for which we earn revenues related to transactional sales charges from the sale of these products and trading income arising from securities temporarily held to form new UIT products. AUM at December 31, 2010 were $616.5 billion (December 31, 2009: $459.5 billion; December 31, 2008: $377.1 billion). The acquisition added $114.6 billion in AUM at June 1, 2010. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2010, other acquisitions added $6.9 billion of AUM, net of dispositions. During the year ended December 31, 2010, net inflows increased AUM by $5.5 billion, while positive market movements increased AUM by $43.9 billion. We experienced net outflows in institutional money market funds of $15.5 billion and increases in AUM of $1.6 billion due to changes in foreign exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2009, net inflows increased AUM by $16.6 billion and positive market movements increased AUM by $54.7 billion. We experienced net outflows in institutional money market funds of $0.1 billion and increases in AUM of $11.2 billion due to changes in foreign exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2008, net outflows decreased AUM by $20.3 billion and negative market movements decreased AUM by $113.0 billion. We experienced net inflows in institutional money market funds of $8.4 billion and decreases in AUM of $27.3 billion due to changes in foreign exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2008. Average AUM during the year ended December 31, 2010 included the impact of the acquired business and were $532.3 billion, compared to $415.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 and $468.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. Net inflows during the year ended December 31, 2010 included net long-term inflows of ETF, UIT and passive AUM of $4.3 billion and other net long-term inflows of $1.2 billion. Net flows were driven by net inflows into our institutional and high net worth distribution channels of $5.6 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, primarily in the fixed income asset class, while our Retail distribution channel experienced net outflows of $1.2 billion. Market gains and losses/reinvestment of AUM includes the net change in AUM resulting from changes in market values of the underlying investments from period to period and reinvestment of client dividends. Of the total increase in AUM resulting from market gains during the year ended December 31, 2010, $33.4 billion of this increase was due to the change in value of our equity asset class across all of our business components. Our balanced and alternatives asset classes were also positively impacted by the change in market valuations during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2010, our equity AUM increased in line with equity markets globally. As discussed in the Executive Overview section of this Management Discussion and Analysis, the S&P 500 and the FTSE 100 indices increased 12.8% and 9.0%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2010. Of the $54.7 billion increase in AUM resulting from market increases during the year ended December 31, 2009, $42.1 billion of this increase was due to the change in value of our equity asset class, in line with increases in the S&P 500 and the FTSE 100 indices of 23.5% and 22.1%, respectively, during that period. Of the $113.0 billion decrease in AUM resulting from market declines during the year ended December 31, 2008, $94.7 billion of this decrease was due to the change in value of our equity asset class, in line with decreases in the S&P 500 and the FTSE 100 indices of 37.0% and 28.0%, respectively, during that period. Foreign exchange rate movements in our AUM result from the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates from period to period as non-U.S. Dollar denominated AUM is translated into U.S. Dollars, the reporting currency of the company. The impact of the change in foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2010 was driven primarily by the weakening of the Pound Sterling relative to the U.S. Dollar, which was reflected in the translation of our Pound Sterling-based AUM into U.S. Dollars, the strengthening of the Canadian Dollar relative to the U.S. Dollar, which was reflected in the translation of our Canadian Dollar-based AUM into U.S. Dollars, and to the weakening of the Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar, which was reflected in the translation of our Euro-based AUM into U.S. Dollars. The impact of the change in foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2009 was driven by the strengthening of the Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar and Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar. The impact of the change in foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2008 was driven by the weakening of the Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar and Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar. The table below illustrates the spot foreign exchange rates for translation into the U.S. Dollar, the reporting currency of the company, at December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008: December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 Pound Sterling ($ per ) 1.56 1.61 1.45 Canadian Dollar (CAD per $) 0.99 1.05 1.23 Euro ($ per Euro) 1.34 1.43 1.39 29 Table of Contents Net revenue yield increased slightly to 48.9 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2010 from the year ended December 31, 2009 level of 47.7 basis points. The acquired business added $114.6 billion in AUM at June 1, 2010 with an approximate effective fee rate of 47 basis points. Market driven changes in our asset mix significantly impact our net revenue yield calculation. Our equity AUM generally earn a higher net revenue rate than money market AUM. At December 31, 2010, equity AUM were $294.1 billion, representing 48% of our total AUM at that date; whereas at December 31, 2009, equity AUM were $192.7 billion, representing 42% of our total AUM at that date. In addition, ETF, UIT and Passive AUM generally earn a lower effective fee rate than AUM excluding ETF, UIT and Passive asset classes. At December 31, 2010, ETF, UIT and Passive AUM were $80.8 billion, representing 13.1% of total AUM at that date; whereas at December 31, 2009, ETF, UIT and Passive AUM were $53.0 billion, representing 11.5% of our total AUM at that date. Gross revenue yield on AUM increased 2.2 basis points to 66.0 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2010 from the year ended December 31, 2009 level of 63.8 basis points. Management does not consider gross revenue yield, the most comparable U.S. GAAP-based measure to net revenue yield, to be a meaningful effective fee rate measure. The numerator of the gross revenue yield measure, operating revenues, excludes the management fees earned from consolidated investment products; however the denominator of the measure includes the AUM of these investment products.

Our share of the average AUM in 2010 for our JVs in China was $3.6 billion (2009: $3.7 billion, 2008: $4.5 billion). It is appropriate to exclude the average AUM of our JVs for purposes of computing gross revenue yield on AUM, because the revenues resulting from these AUM are not presented in our operating revenues. Under U.S. GAAP, our share of the pre-tax earnings of the JVs is recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on our Consolidated Statements of Income. (2) Net revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized net revenues divided by average AUM.

Retail AUM arose from client investments into funds available to the public with shares or units. Institutional AUM originated from individual corporate clients, endowments, foundations, government authorities, universities, or charities. Private Wealth Management AUM arose from high net worth client investments. (2) The beginning balances were adjusted to reflect certain asset reclassifications, including the previously discussed AUM reporting alignment to include ETF, UIT and passive AUM. (3) Asset classes are descriptive groupings of AUM by common type of underlying investments. (4) See Part I, Item 1, Business Objectives by Asset Class for a description of the investment objectives included within the Alternatives asset class. (5) Ending Money Market AUM includes $64.2 billion in institutional money market AUM and $4.1 billion in retail money market AUM. (6) Client domicile disclosure groups AUM by the domicile of the underlying clients. (7) Net flows in Asia in 2010 were driven by an inflow of $15.8 billion in the three months ended June 30, 2010 and an outflow of $18.6 billion in the three months ended December 31, 2010 related to a passive mandate in Japan which was a post-close direct consequence of the acquired business. 36 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2010, compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2009 Adoption of Guidance now encompassed in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 810, Consolidation The company provides investment management services to, and has transactions with, various private equity, real estate, fund-of-funds, collateralized loan obligation products (CLOs), and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. The company serves as the investment manager, making day-to-day investment decisions concerning the assets of the products. Certain of these entities are consolidated under variable interest or voting interest entity consolidation guidance. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1, Accounting Policies and Note 20, Consolidated Investment Products, for additional details. The guidance now encompassed in ASC Topic 810, which was effective January 1, 2010, had a significant impact on the presentation of the company financial statements in 2010, as its provisions required the company to consolidate certain CLOs that were not previously consolidated. In accordance with the standard, prior periods have not been restated to reflect the consolidation of these CLOs. The majority of the company consolidated investment products balances were CLO-related as of December 31, 2010. The collateral assets of the CLOs are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs. The company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the CLOs, beyond the company minimal direct investments in, and management fees generated from, the CLOs. If the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. Additionally, the investors in the CLOs have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the CLOs. The company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability. The discussion that follows will separate consolidated investment product results of operations from the company investment management operations through the use of non-GAAP financial measures. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional details and reconciliations of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures to the non-GAAP measures. 37 Table of Contents Condensed Consolidating Statements of Income Consolidated Before Investment $ in millions Consolidation (1) Products (2) Adjustments (1)(3) Total Year ended December 31, 2010 Total operating revenues 3,532.7 0.3 (45.3 ) 3,487.7 Total operating expenses 2,887.8 55.3 (45.3 ) 2,897.8 Operating income 644.9 (55.0 ) 589.9 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 40.8 (0.6 ) 40.2 Interest and dividend income 10.4 246.0 (5.1 ) 251.3 Other investment income/(losses) 15.6 107.6 6.4 129.6 Interest expense (58.6 ) (123.7 ) 5.1 (177.2 ) Income before income taxes, including gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests 653.1 174.9 5.8 833.8 Income tax provision (197.0 ) (197.0 ) Net income, including gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests 456.1 174.9 5.8 636.8 (Gains)/losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, net (0.2 ) (170.8 ) (0.1 ) (171.1 ) Net income attributable to common shareholders 455.9 4.1 5.7 465.7 Consolidated Before Investment $ in millions Consolidation (1) Products (2) Adjustments (3) Total Year ended December 31, 2009 Total operating revenues 2,633.3 1.9 (7.9 ) 2,627.3 Total operating expenses (2,139.5 ) (11.4 ) 7.9 (2,143.0 ) Operating income 493.8 (9.5 ) 484.3 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 24.5 2.5 27.0 Interest and dividend income 9.8 9.8 Other investment income/(losses) 7.8 (106.9 ) (99.1 ) Interest expense (64.5 ) (64.5 ) Income before income taxes, including gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests 471.4 (116.4 ) 2.5 357.5 Income tax provision (148.2 ) (148.2 ) Net income, including gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests 323.2 (116.4 ) 2.5 209.3 (Gains)/losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, net (0.7 ) 113.9 113.2 Net income attributable to common shareholders 322.5 (2.5 ) 2.5 322.5 (1) The Before Consolidation column includes Invesco equity interests in the investment products accounted for as equity method (private equity and real estate partnership funds) and available-for-sale investments (CLOs). Upon consolidation of the CLOs, the company and the CLOs accounting policies were effectively aligned, resulting in the reclassification of the company gain for the year ended December 31, 2010 of $6.4 million (representing the increase in the market value of the company holding in the consolidated CLOs) from other comprehensive income into other gains/losses. The company gain on its investment in the CLOs (before consolidation) eliminates with the company share of the offsetting loss on the CLOs debt. The net income arising from consolidation of CLOs is therefore completely attributed to other investors in these CLOs, as the company share has been eliminated through consolidation. The Before Consolidation column does not include any other adjustments related to non-GAAP financial measure presentation. (2) The company adopted guidance now encompassed in ASC Topic 810 on January 1, 2010 resulting in the consolidation of certain CLOs. In accordance with the standard, prior periods have not been restated to reflect the consolidation of these CLOs. Prior to January 1, 2010, the company was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of these CLOs. (3) Adjustments include the elimination of intercompany transactions between the company and its consolidated investment products, primarily the elimination of management fees expensed by the funds and recorded as operating revenues (before consolidation) by the company. 38 Table of Contents Operating Revenues and Net Revenues The main categories of revenues, and the dollar and percentage change between the periods, are as follows: $ in millions 2010 2009 $ Change % Change Investment management fees 2,720.9 2,120.2 600.7 28.3 % Service and distribution fees 645.5 412.6 232.9 56.4 % Performance fees 26.1 30.0 (3.9 ) (13.0 )% Other 95.2 64.5 30.7 47.6 % Total operating revenues 3,487.7 2,627.3 860.4 32.7 % Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses (972.7 ) (693.4 ) 279.3 40.3 % Proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments 42.2 44.7 (2.5 ) (5.6 )% Management fees earned from consolidated investment products 45.3 8.0 37.3 N/A Other revenues recorded by consolidated investment products (0.3 ) (2.0 ) 1.7 85.0 % Net revenues 2,602.2 1,984.6 617.6 31.1 % Operating revenues increased by 32.7% in 2010 to $3,487.7 million (year ended December 31, 2009: $2,627.3 million). Net revenues increased by 31.1% in 2010 to $2,602.2 million (year ended December 31, 2009: $1,984.6 million). Net revenues are operating revenues less third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, plus our proportional share of net revenues from joint venture arrangements. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. A significant portion of our business and managed AUM are based outside of the U.S. The income statements of foreign currency subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars, the reporting currency of the company, using average foreign exchange rates. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements accounted for $18.0 million (2.1%) of the increase in operating revenues, and was 0.5% of total operating revenues, during the year ended December 31, 2010 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. Additionally, our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our AUM as more fully discussed below. Movements in global capital market levels, net new business inflows (or outflows) and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period. As discussed in the company Form 10-Q filings for the June 30, 2010 and September 30, 2010 periods, the company acquired Morgan Stanley retail asset management business, including Van Kampen Investments (the acquired business or the acquisition ) on June 1, 2010. The acquisition had a significant impact on our results for the 2010 period. The operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 include the operating results of the acquired business from the purchase date of June 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010. The integration of the acquired business is largely complete; as such, accurate segregated expense information for the acquired business is not available. Prior to any significant product mergers, revenues associated with the acquired business can be separately identified, and as a result, the impact can be estimated. Operating revenues of the acquired business for the year ended December 31, 2010 were approximately $468 million, which represents the incremental impact of the acquired business and does not represent the stand-alone results of the acquired business. Investment Management Fees Investment management fees are derived from providing professional services to manage client accounts and include fees earned from retail mutual funds, unit trusts, investment companies with variable capital (ICVCs), exchange-traded funds, investment trusts and institutional and private wealth management advisory contracts. Investment management fees for products offered in the retail distribution channel are generally calculated as a percentage of the daily average asset balances and therefore vary as the levels of AUM change resulting from inflows, outflows and market movements. Investment management fees for products offered in the institutional and private wealth management distribution channels are calculated in accordance with the underlying investment management contracts and also vary over contractually determined periods in relation to the level of client assets managed. Investment management fees increased by $600.7 million (28.3%) in the year ended December 31, 2010, to $2,720.9 million (year ended December 31, 2009: $2,120.2 million) due to the acquisition, increases in average AUM, primarily retail AUM, changes in the mix of AUM between asset classes and foreign exchange rate movement. The acquisition contributed to the increase in investment management fees with an estimated $257 million in these fees during the year ended December 31, 2010. Average long-term AUM, which generally earn higher fee rates than money market AUM, increased 41.0% to $463.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $328.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009, while average institutional money market AUM decreased 20.9% to $68.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $87.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in average 39 Table of Contents long-term AUM includes the impact of the acquired business. See the company disclosures regarding the changes in AUM during the year ended December 31, 2010 in the Assets Under Management section above for additional information regarding the movements in AUM. Foreign exchange rate movements led to an increase in investment management fees of $17.0 million (2.8%) during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. Additionally, the change in investment management fee revenues reflects the adoption of guidance now encompassed in ASC Topic 810 on January 1, 2010. As part of the consolidation, management fees earned from consolidated CLOs and other products of $45.3 million were eliminated from the company operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010. In accordance with the standard, prior periods have not been restated to reflect the consolidation of these CLOs. The company uses a non-GAAP financial measure, net revenues, to add back these eliminated management fees as part of net revenues, as the company has earned them for providing investment management services to the consolidated investment products. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for the reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues. Service and Distribution Fees Service fees are generated through fees charged to cover several types of expenses, including fund accounting fees and other maintenance costs for mutual funds, unit trusts and ICVCs, and administrative fees earned from closed-ended funds. Service fees also include transfer agent fees, which are fees charged to cover the expense of processing client share purchases and redemptions, call center support and client reporting. U.S. distribution fees include 12b-1 fees earned from certain mutual funds to cover allowable sales and marketing expenses for those funds and also include asset-based sales charges paid by certain mutual funds for a period of time after the sale of those funds. Distribution fees typically vary in relation to the amount of client assets managed. Generally, retail products offered outside of the U.S. do not generate a separate distribution fee, as the quoted management fee rate is inclusive of these services. In 2010, service and distribution fees increased by $232.9 million (56.4%) to $645.5 million (year ended December 31, 2009: $412.6 million). The acquisition contributed an estimated $172 million of the increase in service and distribution fees in the year ended December 31, 2010. The remaining increase is largely attributable to the increase in average AUM during the year. Performance Fees Performance fee revenues are generated on certain management contracts when performance hurdles are achieved. Such fee revenues are recorded in operating revenues as of the performance measurement date, when the contractual performance criteria have been met and when the outcome of the transaction can be measured reliably in accordance with Method 1 of ASC Topic 605-20-S99, Revenue Recognition Services SEC Materials. Cash receipt of earned performance fees occurs after the measurement date. The performance measurement date is defined in each contract in which incentive and performance fee revenue agreements are in effect. We have performance fee arrangements that include monthly, quarterly and annual measurement dates. Given the uniqueness of each transaction, performance fee contracts are evaluated on an individual basis to determine if revenues can and should be recognized. Performance fees are not recorded if there are any future performance contingencies. If performance arrangements require repayment of the performance fee for failure to perform during the contractual period, then performance fee revenues are recognized no earlier than the expiration date of these terms. Performance fees will fluctuate from period to period and may not correlate with general market changes, since most of the fees are driven by relative performance to the respective benchmark rather than by absolute performance. Of our $616.5 billion in AUM at December 31, 2010, only approximately $36.8 billion, or 5.9%, could potentially earn performance fees. Of the $114.6 billion AUM acquired on June 1, 2010 through the acquisition, $2.7 billion, or 2.4%, are eligible to earn performance fees. In the year ended December 31, 2010, performance fees decreased by $3.9 million (13.0%) to $26.1 million (year ended December 31, 2009: $30.0 million). The performance fees generated in 2010 arose primarily due to products managed by the European Real Estate group ($4.3 million), Invesco Perpetual ($3.4 million), and Atlantic Trust ($11.8 million). The performance fees generated in 2009 arose primarily due to products managed by the Invesco Global Strategies group ($2.4 million), Invesco Perpetual ($13.4 million), and Atlantic Trust ($5.7 million). Other Revenues Other revenues include fees derived from our UIT operations, transaction commissions earned upon the sale of new investments into certain of our funds, and fees earned upon the completion of transactions in our direct real estate and private equity asset groups. Real estate transaction fees are derived from commissions earned through the buying and selling of properties. Private equity 40 Table of Contents transaction fees include commissions associated with the restructuring of, and fees from providing advice to, portfolio companies held by the funds. These transaction fees are recorded in our financial statements on the date when the transactions are legally closed. Other revenues also include the revenues of consolidated investment products. Following the acquisition, the company is the sponsor of UITs. In its capacity as sponsor of UITs, the company earns other revenues related to transactional sales charges resulting from the sale of UIT products and from the difference between the purchase or bid and offer price of securities temporarily held to form new UIT products. These revenues are recorded as other revenues net of concessions to dealers who distribute UITs to investors. In the year ended December 31, 2010, other revenues increased by $30.7 million (47.6%) to $95.2 million (year ended December 31, 2009: $64.5 million). Increases in other revenues included $38.9 million in UIT revenues during the year, a result of the acquired business, and higher real estate acquisition and disposition fees of $2.4 million which were offset by a $5.2 million decline in transaction commissions. Third-Party Distribution, Service and Advisory Expenses Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses include periodic renewal commissions paid to brokers and independent financial advisors for their continuing oversight of their clients assets, over the time they are invested, and are payments for the servicing of client accounts. Renewal commissions are calculated based upon a percentage of the AUM value. Third-party distribution expenses also include the amortization of upfront commissions paid to broker-dealers for sales of fund shares with a contingent deferred sales charge (a charge levied to the investor for client redemption of AUM within a certain contracted period of time). The distribution commissions are amortized over the redemption period. Also included in third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses are sub-transfer agency fees that are paid to third parties for processing client share purchases and redemptions, call center support and client reporting. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses may increase or decrease at a rate different from the rate of change in service and distribution fee revenues due to the inclusion of distribution, service and advisory expenses for the U.K. and Canada, where the related revenues are recorded as investment management fee revenues, as noted above. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses increased by $279.3 million (40.3%) in the year ended December 31, 2010 to $972.7 million (year ended December 31, 2009: $693.4 million), which is consistent with the increase in investment management and service and distribution fee revenues. Foreign exchange rate movements increased third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses by $5.3 million (1.9%) during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. Proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments Management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture arrangements should be added to operating revenues to arrive at net revenues, as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that our joint venture arrangements are making. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. The company most significant joint venture arrangement is our 49.0% investment in Invesco Great Wall Fund Management Company Limited (the Invesco Great Wall joint venture). The 5.6% decrease in our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, to $42.2 million in 2010 (year ended December 31, 2009: $44.7 million), is driven by the decline in average AUM of the Invesco Great Wall joint venture. Our share of the Invesco Great Wall joint venture average AUM for the year ended December 31, 2010, was $3.6 billion, a 2.7% decline in average AUM from $3.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. Management fees earned from consolidated investment products Management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a reader analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. Accordingly, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues for the impact of consolidated investment products in calculating net revenues. As management and performance fees earned by Invesco from the consolidated products are eliminated upon consolidation of the investment products, management believes that it is appropriate to add these operating revenues back in the calculation of net revenues. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. 41 Table of Contents Management fees earned from consolidated investment products increased by $37.3 million to $45.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 (year ended December 31, 2009: $8.0 million). The increase reflects the adoption of guidance now encompassed in ASC Topic 810 on January 1, 2010. CLO management fees of $35.4 million were eliminated from the company operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010. In accordance with the standard, prior periods have not been restated to reflect the consolidation of these CLOs. Other revenues recorded by consolidated investment products Operating revenues of consolidated investment products are included in U.S. GAAP operating revenues resulting from the consolidation of investment products into the company results of operations. Management believes that this consolidation could impact a reader analysis of our underlying results of operations. Therefore, management believes that it is appropriate to deduct operating revenues of consolidated investment products in calculating net revenues. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. Operating Expenses The main categories of operating expenses are as follows: $ in millions 2010 2009 $ Change % Change Employee compensation 1,114.9 950.8 164.1 17.3 % Third-party distribution, service and advisory 972.7 693.4 279.3 40.3 % Marketing 159.6 108.9 50.7 46.6 % Property, office and technology 238.4 212.3 26.1 12.3 % General and administrative 262.2 166.8 95.4 57.2 % Transaction and integration 150.0 10.8 139.2 N/A Total operating expenses 2,897.8 2,143.0 754.8 35.2 % The table below sets forth these expense categories as a percentage of total operating expenses and operating revenues, which we believe provides useful information as to the relative significance of each type of expense. % of Total % of % of Total % of Operating Operating Operating Operating $ in millions 2010 Expenses Revenues 2009 Expenses Revenues Employee compensation 1,114.9 38.5 % 32.0 % 950.8 44.4 % 36.2 % Third-party distribution, service and advisory 972.7 33.6 % 27.9 % 693.4 32.3 % 26.4 % Marketing 159.6 5.5 % 4.6 % 108.9 5.1 % 4.1 % Property, office and technology 238.4 8.2 % 6.8 % 212.3 9.9 % 8.1 % General and administrative 262.2 9.0 % 7.5 % 166.8 7.8 % 6.3 % Transaction and integration 150.0 5.2 % 4.3 % 10.8 0.5 % 0.4 % Total operating expenses 2,897.8 100.0 % 83.1 % 2,143.0 100.0 % 81.5 % During 2010, operating expenses increased by $754.8 million (35.2%) to $2,897.8 million (year ended December 31, 2009: $2,143.0 million), reflecting increases in all cost categories from 2009 expense levels. As discussed above, the Morgan Stanley acquisition took place on June 1, 2010, which increased expenses across all categories. As the integration of the acquired business is largely complete, segregated expense data is not available. In addition to the acquired business, foreign exchange differences have a large impact on our expenses. A significant portion of our business and managed AUM are based outside of the U.S. The income statements of foreign currency subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars, the reporting currency of the company, using average foreign exchange rates. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements accounted for $13.2 million (1.7%) of the increase in operating expenses, and was 0.5% of total operating expenses, during the year ended December 31, 2010. Employee Compensation Employee compensation includes salary, cash bonuses and share-based payment plans designed to attract and retain the highest caliber employees. Employee staff benefit plan costs and payroll taxes are also included in employee compensation. 42 Table of Contents Employee compensation increased $164.1 million (17.3%) to $1,114.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 (year ended December 31, 2009: $950.8 million). Base salaries and variable compensation increased $114.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 from the year ended December 31, 2009 due to incremental costs associated with the acquisition, the impact of annual merit increases, and the increase in variable compensation accruals to reflect the overall earnings growth of the company, including improving operating results and sales. Included in compensation expenses during the year ended December 31, 2010 are share-based costs of $114.1 million compared to $90.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, also due to the incremental impact of the acquisition and to the additional amortization of share awards granted February 28, 2010 as part of the company annual share award cycle. Foreign exchange rate movement led to an increase in employee compensation expenses of $6.3 million (3.9%) in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. Additionally, employee compensation costs for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 included $20.0 million of prepaid compensation amortization expenses related to the 2006 acquisition of W.L. Ross & Co. This acquisition-related asset will be fully amortized by the third quarter of 2011. Headcount at December 31, 2010 was 5,617 (year ended December 31, 2009: 4,890). The acquisition added 580 employees at June 1, 2010. Formal hiring of staff in our Hyderabad, India, facility commenced with 83 individuals becoming our employees in late 2010. An additional 474 individuals became our employees by the date of this Report. Third-Party Distribution, Service and Advisory Expenses Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses are discussed above in the operating and net revenues section. Marketing Marketing expenses include marketing support payments, which are payments made to distributors of certain of our retail products over and above the 12b-1 distribution payments. These fees are calculated based on a percentage of assets and/or sales, will generally vary based on movements in the markets or actual sales, and are contracted separately with each distributor. Marketing expenses also include the cost of direct advertising of our products through trade publications, television and other media, and public relations costs, such as the marketing of the company products through conferences or other sponsorships, and the cost of marketing-related employee travel. Marketing expenses increased by $50.7 million (46.6%) in 2010 to $159.6 million (year ended December 31, 2009: $108.9 million) due primarily to the increase in marketing support payments of $37.4 million as compared to year ended December 31, 2009. Additionally, travel/client events and sales literature/research expenses increased $11.3 million and $4.3 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2010 from the year ended December 31, 2009, offset by a decrease in advertising expenses of $3.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. Property, Office and Technology Property, office and technology expenses include rent and utilities for our various leased facilities, depreciation of company-owned property and capitalized computer equipment costs, minor non-capitalized computer equipment and software purchases and related maintenance payments, and costs related to externally provided operations, technology, and other back office management services. Property, office and technology costs increased by $26.1 million (12.3%) to $238.4 million in 2010 from $212.3 million in 2009. Increases in property, office and technology costs include increases in outsourced administration expense and depreciation expense of $14.7 million and $7.1 million, respectively, along with other additional costs resulting from the acquisition. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses include professional services costs, such as information service subscriptions, consulting fees, professional insurance costs, audit, tax and legal fees, non-marketing related employee travel expenditures, recruitment and training costs, and the amortization of certain intangible assets. 43 Table of Contents General and administrative expenses increased by $95.4 million (57.2%) to $262.2 million in 2010 from $166.8 million in 2009, due to several factors, including an increase in amortization of certain intangible assets related to the acquisition of $18.0 million, a charge recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2010, relating to a levy from the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme of $15.3 million to cover claims resulting from failures of non-affiliated investment firms, a charge representing reimbursement costs from the correction of historical foreign exchange allocations in the fund accounting process that impacted the reporting of fund performance of certain funds of $8.9 million, an increase in non-marketing travel and entertainment costs of $10.4 million and an increase in market information services of $10.1 million for increased services across the business. Additionally, general and administrative expenses increased in 2010 from 2009 due to an insurance recovery received in 2009 related to legal costs associated with the market-timing regulatory settlement which offset 2009 expenses by $9.5 million. Transaction and integration Transaction and integration expenses include acquisition-related charges incurred during the period to effect a business combination, including legal, regulatory, advisory, valuation, integration-related employee incentive awards and other professional or consulting fees, general and administrative costs, including travel costs related to the transaction and the costs of temporary staff involved in executing the transaction, and post-closing costs of integrating the acquired business into the company existing operations. Additionally, transaction and integration expenses include legal costs related to the defense of auction rate preferred securities complaints raised in the pre-acquisition period with respect to various closed-end funds included in the acquisition. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings for additional information. Transaction and integration charges were $150.0 million in 2010, as compared to $10.8 million in 2009 ($26.7 million of these costs were recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2010) and relate primarily to the acquisition of Morgan Stanley retail asset management business, including Van Kampen Investments. The acquisition was announced in October 2009 and closed on June 1, 2010. Transaction and integration charges incurred during the year ended December 31, 2010 include $39.1 million of staff costs, $53.4 million of technology contractor and related costs, and $57.5 million of professional services, principally legal, proxy solicitation, consultancy and insurance. Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income, Operating Margin and Adjusted Operating Margin Operating income increased 21.8% to $589.9 million in 2010 from $484.3 million in 2009, driven by the increase in operating revenues from increased AUM. Operating margin (operating income divided by operating revenues) was 16.9% in 2010, down from 18.4% in 2009. Adjusted operating margin increased to 34.5% in 2010 from 28.5% in 2009. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues, a reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income and additional important disclosures regarding net revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin. Other Income and Expenses The main categories of other income and expenses, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods are as follows: Year ended December 31, $ in millions 2010 2009 $ Change % Change Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 40.2 27.0 13.2 48.9 % Interest and dividend income 10.4 9.8 0.6 6.1 % Interest income of consolidated investment products 240.9 240.9 N/A Gains/(losses) of consolidated investment products, net 114.0 (106.9 ) 220.9 N/A Interest expense (58.6 ) (64.5 ) 5.9 9.1 % Interest expense of consolidated investment products (118.6 ) (118.6 ) N/A Other gains and losses, net 15.6 7.8 7.8 100.0 % Total other income and expenses 243.9 (126.8 ) 370.7 N/A 44 Table of Contents Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased by $13.2 million (48.9%) to $40.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 (year ended December 31, 2009: $27.0 million). Included in equity in earnings from affiliates is our share of the income from our joint ventures in China, which declined by $5.5 million to $23.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 from $29.4 million earned during the year ended December 31, 2009. Declines in equity in earnings from our joint ventures are due to declines in average AUM in those entities during the year. Earnings from our affiliate in Poland also decreased by $1.1 million to $1.1 million in year ended December 31, 2010 from $2.2 million earned in the year ended December 31, 2009. These declines were more than offset by our share of the market-driven valuation changes in the underlying holdings of certain partnership investments which increased by $19.6 million to $15.1 million earned in the year ended December 31, 2010 from $4.5 million of losses during the year ended December 31, 2009. Interest and dividend income and interest expense Interest and dividend income increased by $0.6 million (6.1%) to $10.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 (year ended December 31, 2009: $9.8 million). The year ended December 31, 2010 includes dividend income of $2.7 million on investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans. This dividend income is passed through to employee participants in the deferred compensation plans. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional details. Higher yields during the year ended December 31, 2010 offset lower average cash and cash equivalent balances. Interest expense decreased by $5.9 million (9.1%) to $58.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 (year ended December 31, 2009: $64.5 million). Higher average debt balances were more than offset by lower average cost of debt during the year ended December 31, 2010 following the restructuring of our debt versus the comparative period. Interest income and interest expense of consolidated investment products Interest income of consolidated investment products results from interest generated by the collateral assets held by consolidated CLOs, which is used to satisfy the interest expenses of the notes issued by the consolidated CLOs and other CLO operating expense requirements, including the payment of the management and performance fees to the company as investment manager. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 20, Consolidated Investment Products, for additional details. In the year ended December 31, 2010, interest income and interest expense of consolidated investment products were $240.9 million and $118.6 million, respectively. The balances reflect the adoption of guidance now encompassed in ASC Topic 810 on January 1, 2010. In accordance with the standard, prior periods have not been restated to reflect the consolidation. Gains and losses of consolidated investment products, net income impact of consolidated investment products, and noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities Included in other income and expenses are gains and losses of consolidated investment products, net, which are driven by realized and unrealized gains and losses of underlying investments held by consolidated investment products. In the year ended December 31, 2010 other gains and losses of consolidated investment products were a net gain of $114.0 million, as compared to a net loss of $106.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2009. The net gain in the period is primarily due to changes in market values of investments held by consolidated private equity funds. As illustrated in the Condensed Consolidating Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 at the beginning of this Results of Operations section, the consolidation of investment products during the year ended December 31, 2010 resulted in an increase to net income of $180.7 million before attribution to noncontrolling interests. Invesco invests in only a portion of these products, and as a result this net gain is offset by noncontrolling interests of $170.9 million, resulting in a net increase in net income of the company of $9.8 million. Consolidated investment products had no material net income impact to the company for the year ended December 31, 2009. Noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities represent the profit or loss amounts attributed to third party investors in consolidated investment products. Movements in amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the company Consolidated Statements of Income generally offset the gains and losses, interest income and interest expense of consolidated investment products. 45 Table of Contents Other gains and losses, net Other gains and losses, net were a net gain of $15.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to a net gain of $7.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2009. Included in other gains and losses is a net gain of $14.2 million as a result of the appreciation of assets held for our deferred compensation plans (year ended December 31, 2009: none), together with $9.2 million of net realized gains from seed investments (year ended December 31, 2009: $3.7 million net realized gains). The 2010 other gains and losses also included $6.6 million in other-than-temporary impairment charges related to other seed money in affiliated funds (year ended December 31, 2009: $3.0 million) and $0.4 million in other-than-temporary impairment charges related to the valuations of investments in certain of our CLO products (year ended December 31, 2009: $5.2 million). In the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred $0.2 million in net foreign exchange losses (year ended December 31, 2009: $8.4 million in net foreign exchange gains) on the revaluation of intercompany foreign currency denominated loans into the various functional currencies of our subsidiaries. In addition, included in the 2009 net gain is a gross gain generated upon a debt tender offer of $4.3 million ($3.3 million net of related expenses). Income Tax Expense Our subsidiaries operate in several taxing jurisdictions around the world, each with its own statutory income tax rate. As a result, our effective tax rate will vary from year to year depending on the mix of the profits and losses of our subsidiaries. The majority of our profits are earned in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. The current U.K. statutory tax rate is 28%, the Canadian statutory tax rate is 31% and the U.S. Federal statutory tax rate is 35%. On December 14, 2007, legislation was enacted to reduce the Canadian income tax rate over five years, which changed the rate to 33.5% in 2008 and 33.0% in 2009. The legislation was revised in December 2009, further reducing the rate to 31.0% in 2010, 28.25% in 2011, 26.25% in 2012, 25.5% in 2013, and 25% thereafter. On July 27, 2010, legislation was introduced to reduce the UK income tax rate to 27% on April 1, 2011. Further reductions to the rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per year to 24% by April 1, 2014. These reductions are expected to be introduced in future Finance Bills for each annual reduction. Our effective tax rate, excluding noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, for 2010 was 29.7%, down from 31.5% for 2009. The rate decrease was primarily due to the mix of pre-tax income and favorable adjustments to reconcile our tax provisions to reflect actual tax returns filed. The rate decrease was partially offset by non-deductible transaction and integration costs related to the acquired business and a smaller benefit from the release of provisions for uncertain tax positions in 2010 versus 2009. The inclusion of income from noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities decreased our effective tax rate to 23.6% in 2010 and increased it to 41.5% in 2009. The 2009 rate was higher than 2008 due to a larger impact from losses in non-controlling interests. 46 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2009, compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Condensed Consolidating Statements of Income Consolidated Before Investment $ in millions Consolidation (1) Products (2) Adjustments (3) Total Year ended December 31, 2009 Total operating revenues 2,633.3 1.9 (7.9 ) 2,627.3 Total operating expenses (2,139.5 ) (11.4 ) 7.9 (2,143.0 ) Operating income 493.8 (9.5 ) 484.3 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 24.5 2.5 27.0 Interest and dividend income 9.8 9.8 Other investment income/(losses) 7.8 (106.9 ) (99.1 ) Interest expense (64.5 ) (64.5 ) Income before income taxes, including gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests 471.4 (116.4 ) 2.5 357.5 Income tax provision (148.2 ) (148.2 ) Net income, including gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests 323.2 (116.4 ) 2.5 209.3 (Gains)/losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, net (0.7 ) 113.9 113.2 Net income attributable to common shareholders 322.5 (2.5 ) 2.5 322.5 Consolidated Before Investment $ in millions Consolidation (1) Products (2) Adjustments (3) Total Year ended December 31, 2008 Total operating revenues 3,308.4 5.5 (6.3 ) 3,307.6 Total operating expenses (2,555.3 ) (10.8 ) 6.3 (2,559.8 ) Operating income 753.1 (5.3 ) 747.8 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 45.9 0.9 46.8 Interest and dividend income 37.2 37.2 Other investment income/(losses) (39.9 ) (58.0 ) (97.9 ) Interest expense (76.9 ) 0 (76.9 ) Income/(loss) before income taxes, including gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests 719.4 (63.3 ) 0.9 675.0 Income tax provision (236.0 ) (236.0 ) Net income/(loss), including gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests 483.4 (63.3 ) 0.9 421.0 (Gains)/losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, net (1.7 ) 62.4 60.7 Net income attributable to common shareholders 481.7 (0.9 ) 0.9 481.7 (1) The Before Consolidation column includes Invesco equity interest in the investment products, accounted for as equity method and available-for-sale investments and does not include any other adjustments related to non-GAAP financial measure presentation. (2) The company adopted guidance now encompassed in ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, on January 1, 2010, resulting in the consolidation of certain CLOs. In accordance with the standard, prior periods have not been restated to reflect the consolidation of these CLOs. Prior to January 1, 2010, the company was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of these CLOs. (3) Adjustments include the elimination of intercompany transactions between the company and its consolidated investment products, primarily the elimination of management fees expensed by the funds and recorded as operating revenues (before consolidation) by the company. 47 Table of Contents Operating Revenues and Net Revenues The main categories of revenues, and the dollar and percentage change between the periods, were as follows: Year ended December 31, $ in millions 2009 2008 $ Change % Change Investment management fees 2,120.2 2,617.8 (497.6 ) (19.0 )% Service and distribution fees 412.6 512.5 (99.9 ) (19.5 )% Performance fees 30.0 75.1 (45.1 ) (60.1 )% Other 64.5 102.2 (37.7 ) (36.9 )% Total operating revenues 2,627.3 3,307.6 (680.3 ) (20.6 )% Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses (693.4 ) (875.5 ) 182.1 (20.8 )% Proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments 44.7 57.3 (12.6 ) (22.0 )% Management fees earned from consolidated investment products 8.0 6.2 1.8 29.0 % Other revenues recorded by consolidated investment products (2.0 ) (5.4 ) 3.4 (63.0 )% Net revenues 1,984.6 2,490.2 (505.6 ) (20.3 )% Operating revenues decreased by 20.6% in 2009 to $2,627.3 million (2008: $3,307.6 million). Net revenues decreased by 20.3% in 2009 to $1,984.6 million (2008: $2,490.6 million). Net revenues are operating revenues less third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, plus our proportional share of net revenues from joint venture arrangements, plus management fees earned from, less other revenue recorded by, consolidated investment products. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. A significant portion of our business and managed AUM are based outside of the U.S. The income statements of foreign currency subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars, the reporting currency of the company, using average foreign exchange rates. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements accounted for $152.0 million (22.3%) of the decline in operating revenues during the year ended December 31, 2009. Additionally, our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our AUM as more fully discussed in Assets Under Management. Movements in global capital market levels, net new business inflows (or outflows) and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period. Investment Management Fees Investment management fees decreased by $497.6 million (19.0%) in the year ended December 31, 2009, to $2,120.2 million (year ended December 31, 2008: $2,617.8 million) due a decrease in average AUM, changes in the mix of AUM between asset classes, and the impact of foreign exchange rate movement. Average AUM for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $415.8 billion, down $53.1 billion (11.3%) from $468.9 billion for 2008. Average long-term AUM, which generally earn higher fee rates than money market AUM, for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased 25.4% to $328.8 billion from $440.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008, while average institutional money market AUM decreased 3.1% to $87.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009, from $79.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. See the company disclosures regarding the changes in AUM during the year ended December 31, 2009 in the Assets Under Management section above for additional information regarding the movements in AUM. Foreign exchange rate movements led to a decrease in investment management fees of $124.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Service and Distribution Fees In 2009, service and distribution fees decreased 19.5% to $412.6 million (2008: $512.5 million) primarily due to decreases in average AUM during the year. Included in the decline in service and distribution fees in the three months ended December 31, 2009, was a reduction of $5.4 million reflecting the full-year impact of a reduction in transfer agency and administrative revenues in Canada, as certain fund expense recovery limits were reached. Performance Fees Of our $459.5 billion in AUM at December 31, 2009, only approximately $30.0 billion, or 6.5%, could potentially earn performance fees. In 2009, performance fees decreased 60.1% to $30.0 million (2008: $75.1 million). The performance fees generated in 2009 arose primarily due to products managed by the Invesco Global Strategies group ($2.4 million), Invesco Perpetual ($13.4 million), and Atlantic Trust ($5.7 million). The performance fees generated in 2008 arose primarily due to products managed by the Invesco Global Strategies ($22.3 million) and Real Estate ($14.5 million) groups, as well as by Invesco Perpetual ($21.1 million). 48 Table of Contents Other Revenues In 2009, other revenues decreased 36.9% to $64.5 million (2008: $102.2 million), driven by decreases in transaction commissions of $17.7 million, due to the tightening of the credit markets and fewer real estate transactions, and foreign exchange rate movements $0.5 million. Third-Party Distribution, Service and Advisory Expenses Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses decreased 20.8% in 2009 to $693.4 million (2008: $875.5 million), consistent with the declines in investment management and service and distribution fee revenues. Proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments The 21.8% decrease in our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, to $44.8 million in 2009 (2008: $57.3 million), is driven by the declines in average AUM of the Invesco Great Wall joint venture. Our share of the Invesco Great Wall joint venture average AUM at December 31, 2009, was $3.7 billion, a 17.8% decline in average AUM from $4.5 billion at December 31, 2008. Operating Expenses The main categories of operating expenses are as follows: $ in millions 2009 2008 $ Change % Change Employee compensation 950.8 1,055.8 (105.0 ) (9.9 )% Third-party distribution, service and advisory 693.4 875.5 (182.1 ) (20.8 )% Marketing 108.9 148.2 (39.3 ) (26.5 )% Property, office and technology 212.3 214.3 (2.0 ) (0.9 )% General and administrative 166.8 266.0 (99.2 ) (37.3 )% Transaction and integration 10.8 10.8 N/A Total operating expenses 2,143.0 2,559.8 (416.8 ) (16.3 )% The table below sets forth these expense categories as a percentage of total operating expenses and operating revenues, which we believe provides useful information as to the relative significance of each type of expense. % of Total % of % of Total % of Operating Operating Operating Operating $ in millions 2009 Expenses Revenues 2008 Expenses Revenues Employee compensation 950.8 44.4 % 36.2 % 1,055.8 41.2 % 31.9 % Third-party distribution, service and advisory 693.4 32.3 % 26.4 % 875.5 34.2 % 26.5 % Marketing 108.9 5.1 % 4.1 % 148.2 5.8 % 4.5 % Property, office and technology 212.3 9.9 % 8.1 % 214.3 8.4 % 6.5 % General and administrative 166.8 7.8 % 6.3 % 266.0 10.4 % 8.0 % Transaction and integration 10.8 0.5 % 0.4 % Total operating expenses 2,143.0 100.0 % 81.5 % 2,559.8 100.0 % 77.4 % During 2009, operating expenses decreased 16.3% to $2,143.0 million (2008: $2,559.8 million), reflecting declines in all cost categories from 2008 expense levels. As discussed above, a significant portion of our business and managed AUM are based outside of the U.S. The income statements of foreign currency subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars, the reporting currency of the company, using average foreign exchange rates. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements accounted for $108.0 million (25.9%) of the decline in operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2009. Additionally, operating expenses were lower in 2009 as compared to 2008 reflecting the impact of general cost containment measures and costs that move in line with revenues. 49 Table of Contents Employee Compensation Employee compensation decreased $105.0 million, or 9.9%, in 2009 from 2008 due predominantly to overall decreases in base salaries and variable compensation of $86.3 million, including decreases in discretionary and investment performance-based staff bonuses, decreases in base salary costs resulting from decreases in headcount, and foreign exchange rate movements of $36.4 million. Headcount declined 8.2% to 4,890 at December 31, 2009 from 5,325 at December 31, 2008. Included in compensation expenses during the year ended December 31, 2009 are share-based payment costs of $90.8 million, compared to $97.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. Additionally, employee compensation costs for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 included $20.0 million of prepaid compensation amortization expenses related to the 2006 acquisition of W.L. Ross & Co. Compensation expenses in the three months ended December 31, 2009, included a $4.1 million increase in pension costs related to the plans actuarial annual valuation updates and a $4.3 million increase in payroll taxes associated with the vesting of share-based payment awards. Third-Party Distribution, Service and Advisory Expenses Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses are discussed above in the operating and net revenues section. Marketing Marketing expenses decreased 26.5% in 2009 to $108.9 million (2008: $148.2 million) due to a decrease in marketing support payments of $12.2 million related to the decline in average AUM in the U.S., a lower level of advertising of $7.7 million, and a reduction in travel/client events and sales literature/research expenses of $8.8 million and $2.8 million, respectively. Additionally, foreign exchange rate movement decreased marketing expenses by $4.5 million (11.5%) for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008. Property, Office and Technology Property, office and technology costs decreased 0.9% to $212.3 million in 2009 from $214.3 million in 2008. Decreases in technology costs resulting from general disciplined expense management measures and foreign exchange rate movement were offset by increases in property and office costs during the year. Property and office expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009, included $12.0 million in charges relating to vacating leased property, including our Denver, Colorado, operations facility. Property and office expenses during 2008 included a $5.1 million rent charge related to vacating leased property, offset by downward adjustments in rent costs for sublet office property of $8.2 million. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses decreased by $99.2 million (37.3%) to $166.8 million in 2009 from $266.0 million in 2008, due to a focus on expense reduction and management during 2009. During 2009, the most significant decrease in this area was a decrease of $50.2 million in professional services expenses, which included an insurance recovery of $9.5 million related to legal costs associated with the market-timing regulatory settlement. General disciplined expense management measures also led to a reduction in travel and entertainment expenses of $14.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. Foreign exchange rate movement decreased general and administrative expenses by $6.9 million during 2009 as compared to 2008. Transaction and Integration Transaction and integration charges were $10.8 million in 2009 ($9.8 million of these costs were recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2009) and relate to the acquisition of Morgan Stanley retail asset management business, including Van Kampen Investments. The acquisition was announced in October 2009 and closed on June 1, 2010. There were no transaction and integration changes for the year ended December 31, 2008. Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income, Operating Margin and Adjusted Operating Margin Operating income decreased 35.2% to $484.3 million in 2009 from $747.8 million in 2008, driven by the declines in operating revenues from reduced AUM. As a result of the decline in our operating revenues, adjusted operating income, operating margin and adjusted operating margin also declined. Operating margin was 18.4% in 2009, down from 22.6% in 2008. Adjusted operating income 50 Table of Contents decreased 31.5% to $565.6 million in 2009 from $826.1 million in 2008. Adjusted operating margin was 28.5% in 2009, down from 33.2% in 2008. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues, a reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income, and additional important disclosures regarding net revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin. Other Income and Expenses The main categories of other income and expenses, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods are as follows: Year ended December 31, $ in millions 2009 2008 $ Change % Change Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 27.0 46.8 (19.8 ) (42.3 )% Interest and dividend income 9.8 37.2 (27.4 ) (73.7 )% Gains/(losses) of consolidated investment products, net (106.9 ) (58.0 ) (48.9 ) 84.3 % Interest expense (64.5 ) (76.9 ) 12.4 (16.1 )% Other gains and losses, net 7.8 (39.9 ) 47.7 N/A Total other income and expenses (126.8 ) (90.8 ) (36.0 ) 39.6 % Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased by $19.8 million (42.3%) to $27.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 (December 31, 2008: $46.8 million), due primarily from declines in our share of the pre-tax earnings of our joint venture investments in China of $11.9 million, as well as, net losses in certain of our partnership investments of $7.8 million. Interest and dividend income and interest expense Interest and dividend income decreased by $27.4 million to $9.8 million in 2009 (2008: $37.2 million), as a result of the combination of lower interest rates and lower average cash and cash equivalents balances in 2009. The decrease in yields was consistent with market movement from 2008 to 2009. Interest expense decreased 16.1% to $64.5 million in 2009 from $76.9 million in 2008 due to decreases in the average debt balance in 2009. Gains and losses of consolidated investment products Included in other income and expenses are net realized and unrealized gains of consolidated investment products. In 2009, the net losses of consolidated investment products were $106.9 million, compared to net losses of $58.0 million in 2008, reflecting the changes in market values of the investments held by consolidated investment products. Invesco invests in only a small equity portion of these products, and as a result these losses are offset by noncontrolling interests of $113.2 million. Other gains and losses, net Other gains and losses, net were a net gain of $7.8 million in 2009, compared to a net loss of $39.9 million in 2008. Included in the 2009 net gain is a gross gain generated upon a debt tender offer of $4.3 million ($3.3 million net of related expenses) and net gains of $4.3 million realized upon the disposal of other investments (2008: $7.4 million gain on maturity of a CLO investment, offset by a loss of $4.1 million realized upon the disposal of a private equity investment). The 2009 net gain also included $5.2 million in other-than-temporary impairment charges related to the valuations of investments in certain of our CLO products (2008: $22.7 million) and $3.0 million in other-than-temporary impairment charges related to other seed money in affiliated funds (2008: $8.5 million). The CLO impairments arose principally from adverse changes in the timing of estimated cash flows used in the valuation models. In the year ended December 31, 2009, we also benefited from $8.4 million in net foreign exchange gains whereas in 2008, we incurred $13.0 million in net foreign exchange losses. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 15, Other Gains and Losses, Net, for additional details related to other gains and losses. 51 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense Our subsidiaries operate in several taxing jurisdictions around the world, each with its own statutory income tax rate. As a result, our effective tax rate will vary from year to year depending on the mix of the profits and losses of our subsidiaries. The majority of our profits are earned in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. The 2009 U.K. statutory tax rate was 28%, the Canadian statutory tax rate was 33% and the U.S. Federal statutory tax rate was 35%. On December 14, 2007, legislation was enacted to reduce the Canadian income tax rate over five years, which changed the rate to 33.5% in 2008, 33.0% in 2009, 31% in 2010, 28.25% in 2011, 26.25% in 2012, 25.5% in 2013, and 25% thereafter. Our effective tax rate, excluding noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, for 2009 was 31.5%, down from 32.9% for 2008. The rate decrease was primarily due to the mix of pre-tax income and a larger benefit from the release of provisions for uncertain tax positions in 2009 versus 2008. The rate decrease was partially offset by an increase in the net valuation allowance for subsidiary operating losses and additional state taxes. The inclusion of income from noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities increased our effective tax rate to 41.5% in 2009 and to 35.9% in 2008. The 2009 rate was higher than 2008 due to a larger impact from losses in non-controlling interests. Schedule of Non-GAAP Information Beginning with the presentation of the company results for the three months ended March 31, 2010, the company has expanded its use of non-GAAP measures to include reconciling items primarily relating to guidance now encompassed in the Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810 (discussed in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1, Accounting Policies ) and the acquisition of Morgan Stanley retail asset management business, including Van Kampen Investments (the acquired business or the acquisition ). We are presenting the following non-GAAP measures: net revenue (and by calculation, net revenue yield on AUM), adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin), adjusted net income (and by calculation, adjusted earnings per share (EPS)). Prior to June 30, 2010, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, and adjusted earnings per share were described as adjusted cash operating income, adjusted cash operating margin, adjusted cash net income, and adjusted cash earnings per share, respectively. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency into our business and allow more appropriate comparisons with industry peers. Management uses these performance measures to evaluate the business, and they are consistent with internal management reporting. Effective June 30, 2010, the company removed cash from the names of these measures to emphasize that these measures are performance measures and not liquidity measures. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are operating revenues (and by calculation, gross revenue yield on AUM), operating income (and by calculation, operating margin), net income (and by calculation, diluted EPS). Each of these measures is discussed more fully below. Also beginning with the presentation of the company results for the three months ended March 31, 2010, the net revenue measure has been redefined from that previously used to adjust for the impact of consolidating certain investment products. The presentation of net revenue in this Report for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 have been restated to conform the calculation to the current period methodology. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Additional reconciling items may be added in the future to these non-GAAP measures if deemed appropriate. 52 Table of Contents The following are reconciliations of operating revenues, operating income (and by calculation, operating margin), and net income (and by calculation, diluted EPS) on a U.S. GAAP basis to net revenues, adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin), and adjusted net income (and by calculation, adjusted EPS): $ in millions, except per share data 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 Operating revenues, U.S. GAAP basis 3,487.7 2,627.3 3,307.6 3,878.9 3,246.7 Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses (1) (972.7 ) (693.4 ) (875.5 ) (1,051.1 ) (826.8 ) Proportional share of net revenues from joint venture arrangements (2) 42.2 44.7 57.3 60.6 8.1 Management fees earned from consolidated investment products eliminated upon consolidation (3) 45.3 8.0 6.2 8.7 11.3 Other revenues recorded by consolidated investment products (3) (0.3 ) (2.0 ) (5.4 ) (15.2 ) (26.5 ) Net revenues 2,602.2 1,984.6 2,490.2 2,881.9 2,412.8 Operating income, U.S. GAAP basis 589.9 484.3 747.8 994.3 759.2 Proportional share of operating income from joint venture investments (2) 22.9 28.4 39.7 45.5 2.9 Transaction and integration charges (4) 150.0 10.8 Amortization of acquisition-related prepaid compensation (4) 20.0 20.0 20.0 25.0 Amortization of other intangibles (4) 30.3 12.6 13.3 12.0 10.0 Change in contingent consideration estimates (3.8 ) Compensation expense related to market valuation changes in deferred compensation plans (5) 9.3 Consolidation of investment products (3) 54.9 9.5 5.3 1.8 (5.9 ) Other reconciling items (6) 24.2 Adjusted operating income 897.7 565.6 826.1 1,078.6 766.2 Operating margin* 16.9 % 18.4 % 22.6 % 25.6 % 23.4 % Adjusted operating margin** 34.5 % 28.5 % 33.2 % 37.4 % 31.8 % Net income attributable to common shareholders, U.S. GAAP basis 465.7 322.5 481.7 673.6 482.7 Transaction and integration charges, net of tax (4) 103.1 8.9 Amortization of acquisition-related prepaid compensation (4) 20.0 20.0 20.0 25.0 Amortization of other intangibles, net of tax (4) 27.4 12.3 13.0 11.7 9.8 Change in contingent consideration estimates, net of tax (2.5 ) Deferred compensation plan market valuation changes and dividend income less compensation expense, net of tax (5) (5.3 ) Deferred income taxes on intangible assets (4) 21.1 14.4 12.4 7.9 7.2 Consolidation of investment products (3) (6.8 ) Other reconciling items, net of tax (6) 17.0 Adjusted net income 639.7 378.1 527.1 718.2 499.7 Average shares outstanding diluted 463.2 423.6 399.1 411.9 406.1 Diluted EPS $ 1.01 $ 0.76 $ 1.21 $ 1.64 $ 1.19 Adjusted EPS*** $ 1.38 $ 0.89 $ 1.32 $ 1.74 $ 1.23 * Operating margin is equal to operating income divided by operating revenues. ** Adjusted operating margin is equal to adjusted operating income divided by net revenues. *** Adjusted EPS is equal to adjusted net income divided by the weighted average shares outstanding amount used in the calculation of diluted EPS. 53 Table of Contents (1) Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses include renewal commissions, management fee rebates and distribution costs paid to brokers and independent financial advisors. While the terms used for these types of expense vary by geography, they are all expense items that are closely linked to the value of AUM and the revenue earned by Invesco from AUM. Renewal commissions are paid to independent financial advisors for as long as the clients assets remain invested and are payments for the servicing of client accounts. These commissions, similar to our management fee revenues, are based upon a percentage of the AUM value and apply to much of our non-U.S. retail business. They can also take the form of management fee rebates, particularly outside of the U.S. The revenues of our U.S. business include distribution fees earned from mutual funds, principally 12b-1 fees, which are passed through to brokers who sell our funds. Distribution costs are expenses paid to third-party brokers of our U.S. business. These include the amortization over the redemption period of upfront commissions paid to brokers for sales of fund shares with a contingent deferred sales charge (a charge levied on investors for redemptions within a certain contracted period of time). Both the revenues and the costs are dependent on the underlying AUM of the brokers clients. Also included in third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses are sub-transfer agency fees that are paid to third parties for processing client share purchases and redemptions, call center support and client reporting. These costs are reimbursed by the related funds. Since the company has been deemed to be the principal in the third-party arrangements, the company must reflect these expenses gross of operating revenues under U.S. GAAP. Management believes that the deduction of third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses from operating revenues in the computation of net revenues (and by calculation, net revenue yield on AUM) and the related computation of adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin), is useful information for investors and other users of the company financial statements because such presentation appropriately reflects the nature of these expenses as revenue-sharing activities, as these costs are passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of the company managed funds. Further, these expenses vary extensively by geography due to the differences in distribution channels. The net presentation assists in identifying the revenue contribution generated by the business, removing distortions caused by the differing distribution channel fees and allowing for a fair comparison with U.S. peer investment managers and within the company. Additionally, management evaluates net revenue yield on AUM, which is equal to net revenues divided by average AUM during the reporting period. This financial measure is an indicator of the basis point net revenues we receive for each dollar of AUM we manage and is useful when evaluating the company performance relative to industry competitors and within the company for capital allocation purposes. (2) Proportional share of net revenues and operating income from joint venture investments The company has two joint venture investments in China. The Invesco Great Wall joint venture is one of the largest Sino-foreign managers of equity products in China, with AUM of approximately $7.2 billion as of December 31, 2010. The company has a 49.0% interest in Invesco Great Wall. The company also has a 50% joint venture with Huaneng Capital Services to assess private equity investment opportunities in power generation in China through Huaneng Invesco WLR Investment Consulting Company Ltd. Enhancing our operations in China is one effort that we believe could improve our competitive position over time. Accordingly, we believe that it is appropriate to evaluate the contribution of our joint venture investments to the operations of the business. Management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues, net of distribution expenses, from joint venture investments in the computation of net revenues and the addition of our proportional share of operating income in the related computations of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin also provide useful information to investors and other users of the company financial statements, as management considers it appropriate to evaluate the contribution of its joint ventures to the operations of the business. It is also consistent with the presentation of AUM and net flows (where our proportional share of the ending balances and related activity are reflected) and therefore provides a more meaningful calculation of net revenue yield on AUM. (3) Consolidated investment products In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance now encompassed in ASC Topic 810 which was effective January 1, 2010. It has had a significant impact on the presentation of the company financial statements. The company Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2010 reflects the elimination of management and performance fees earned from these CLOs and other consolidated investment products. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 20, 54 Table of Contents Consolidated Investment Products for a detailed analysis of the impact to the company Consolidated Financial Statements from the consolidation of investment products. Management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a reader analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. Accordingly, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues, operating income and operating margin for the impact of consolidated investment products in calculating the respective net revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin. The reconciling items add back the management and performance fees earned by Invesco from the consolidated products and remove the revenues and expenses recorded by the consolidated products that have been included in the U.S. GAAP Consolidated Statements of Income. (4) Acquisition-related reconciling items Acquisition-related adjustments include transaction and integration expenses and intangible asset amortization related to acquired assets, amortization of prepaid compensation related to the 2006 acquisition of W.L. Ross & Co., and tax cash flow benefits resulting from tax amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. These charges reflect the legal, regulatory, advisory, valuation, integration-related employee incentive awards and other professional or consulting fees, general and administrative costs, including travel costs related to the transaction and the costs of temporary staff involved in executing the transaction, and the post closing costs of integrating the acquired business into the company existing operations including incremental costs associated with achieving synergy savings. Additionally, transaction and integration expenses include legal costs related to the defense of auction rate preferred securities complaints raised in the pre-acquisition period with respect to various closed-end funds included in the acquisition. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings for additional information. The acquisition will result in additional future amortization expenses of approximately $23 million per year for the first 2 years following June 1, 2010. The expense then reduces in future years as the acquired finite-lived intangible assets become fully expensed. The U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciling items also include acquisition-related amortization charges related to previous business combinations. The tax benefit is recorded on a portion of the intangible amortization expense that does not generate a cash tax benefit. The W.L. Ross & Co. prepaid compensation expense will continue through 2010, and the acquisition-related asset will be fully amortized by the third quarter of 2011. Management believes it is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements to adjust for the transaction and integration charges and the amortization expenses in arriving at adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS, as this will aid comparability of our results period to period, and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar acquisition-related charges. While finite-lived intangible assets are amortized under U.S. GAAP, there is no amortization charge on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. In certain qualifying situations, these can be amortized for tax purposes, generally over a 15-year period, as is the case in the U.S. These cash flows (in the form of reduced taxes payable) represent tax benefits that are not included in the Consolidated Statements of Income absent an impairment charge or the disposal of the related business. We believe it is useful to include these tax cash flow benefits in arriving at the adjusted EPS measure. The company receives these cash flow benefits but does not anticipate a sale or impairment of these assets in the foreseeable future, and therefore the deferred tax liability recognized under U.S. GAAP is not expected to be used either through a credit in the Consolidated Statements of Income or through settlement of tax obligations. (5) Market movement on deferred compensation plan liabilities In 2009, Invesco introduced an incentive plan whereby certain of our investment team members can receive deferred cash compensation linked in value to the investment products being managed by the team. This is in lieu of share-based awards which were largely the only prior form of deferred compensation used by Invesco. These awards involve a return to the employee linked to the appreciation (depreciation) of specified investments, typically the funds managed by the employee. Invesco hedges economically the exposure to market movements by holding these investments on its balance sheet. U.S. GAAP requires the appreciation (depreciation) in the compensation liability to be expensed over the award vesting period in proportion to the vested amount of the award as part of compensation expense. The full value of the investment appreciation (depreciation) is immediately recorded below operating income in other gains and losses. This creates a timing difference between the recognition of the compensation expense and the investment gain or loss impacting net income attributable to common shareholders and diluted EPS which will reverse over the life of the award and net to zero at the end of the multi-year vesting period. During periods of high market volatility these timing differences impact compensation expense, operating income and operating margin in a manner which, over the life of the award, will ultimately be offset by gains and losses recorded below operating income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. 55 Table of Contents Since these plans are hedged economically, management believes it is useful to reflect the offset ultimately achieved from hedging the investment market exposure in the calculation of adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin) and adjusted net income (and by calculation, adjusted EPS), to produce results that will be more comparable period to period. The related fund shares will have been purchased on or around the date of grant, eliminating any ultimate cash impact from market movements that occur over the vesting period. The non-GAAP measures therefore exclude the mismatch created by differing U.S. GAAP treatments of the market movement on the liability and the investments. Additionally, dividend income from investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans is recorded as dividend income and as compensation expense on the company Consolidated Statements of Income on the record dates. This dividend income is passed through to the employee participants in the plan and is not retained by the company. The non-GAAP measures exclude this dividend income and related compensation expense. No adjustments are being made for the prior period comparative non-GAAP measures presented above due to the relative insignificance of the amounts in those periods. (6) Other reconciling items Included within general and administrative expenses is a charge of $8.9 million ($6.0 million net of tax) for the year ended December 31, 2010, representing reimbursement costs from the correction of historical foreign exchange allocations in the fund accounting process that impacted the reporting of fund performance in certain funds. Also included within general and administrative expenses is a charge of $15.3 million ($11.0 million net of tax) recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2010, relating to a levy from the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Assessments were levied upon all Financial Services Authority (FSA)-registered investment management companies in proposition to their eligible income (as defined by the FSA) to cover claims resulting from failures of non-affiliated investment firms. Management does not include these costs in internal reporting and these costs do not form part of the overall evaluation of the business. Management therefore believes that the exclusion of these costs, due to their unique character and magnitude, from total operating expenses provides useful information to investors, as this view is consistent with how management evaluates the performance of the business. Exclusion of these costs will aid in comparability of our results from period to period and the comparability of our results with those of peer investment managers. 56 Table of Contents Balance Sheet Discussion Condensed Consolidating Balance Sheets are presented below and reflect the consolidation of investment products, including the adoption of guidance now encompassed in ASC Topic 810 on January 1, 2010. The majority of the company consolidated investment products were CLOs as of December 31, 2010. The collateral assets of the CLOs are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs. The company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the CLOs, beyond the company minimal direct investments in, and management fees generated from, CLOs. If the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. Additionally, the investors in the CLOs have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the CLOs. The company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability.

(2) The company adopted guidance now encompassed in ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, on January 1, 2010, resulting in the consolidation of certain CLOs. In accordance with the standard, prior periods have not been restated to reflect the consolidation of these CLOs. Prior to January 1, 2010, the company was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of these CLOs. (3) Adjustments include the elimination of intercompany transactions between the company and its consolidated investment products, primarily the elimination of the company equity at risk recorded as investments by the company (before consolidation) against either equity (private equity and real estate partnership funds) or subordinated debt (CLOs) of the funds. 57 Table of Contents The following table presents a comparative analysis of significant detailed balance sheet line items: $ in millions 2010 2009 $ Change % Change Cash and cash equivalents 740.5 762.0 (21.5 ) (2.8 )% Unsettled fund receivables 513.4 383.1 130.3 34.0 % Current investments 308.8 182.4 126.4 69.3 % Assets held for policyholders 1,295.4 1,283.0 12.4 1.0 % Non-current investments 164.4 157.4 7.0 4.4 % Investments of consolidated investment products 7,206.0 685.0 6,521.0 N/A Goodwill 6,980.2 6,467.6 512.6 7.9 % Policyholder payables 1,295.4 1,283.0 12.4 1.0 % Long-term debt 1,315.7 745.7 570.0 76.4 % Long-term debt of consolidated investment products 5,865.4 5,865.4 N/A Retained earnings appropriated for investors in consolidated investment products 495.5 495.5 N/A Equity attributable to common shareholders 8,264.6 6,912.9 1,351.7 19.6 % Equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 1,096.3 707.9 388.4 54.9 % Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $21.5 million from $762.0 million at December 31, 2009 to $740.5 million at December 31, 2010. Significant cash activity in 2010 included the utilization of cash balances to partly fund business acquisitions, to purchase treasury shares and to pay quarterly dividends. During the year, the company paid $775.9 million net cash on business acquisitions, and treasury share purchases during the year utilized $192.2 million of cash. Dividend payments totaled $197.9 million during 2010. The company initially borrowed $650.0 million from the credit facility in June 2010 to partly fund acquisition payments, this credit facility balance reducing to $570.0 million by the end of 2010. The balance of cash outflows has been funded from improved cash flows generated from operating activities. See Cash Flows in the following section within this Management Discussion and Analysis for addition discussion regarding the movements in cash flows during the periods. Invesco has local capital requirements in several jurisdictions, as well as regional requirements for entities that are part of the European sub-group. These requirements mandate the retention of liquid resources in those jurisdictions, which we meet in part by holding cash and cash equivalents. This retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the European sub-group or in the countries where it is located. Due to the capital restrictions, the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited. In addition, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that may substantially limit such activity. At December 31, 2010, the European sub-group had cash and cash equivalent balances of $456.2 million, much of which is used to satisfy these regulatory requirements. We are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. In addition, the company is required to hold cash deposits with clearing organizations or to otherwise segregate cash to maintain compliance with federal and other regulations in connection with its UIT broker dealer entity, which was part of the acquired business. At December 31, 2010 these cash deposits totaled $14.9 million. Unsettled fund receivables Unsettled fund receivables increased by $130.3 million from $383.1 million at December 31, 2009 to $513.4 million at December 31, 2010, due to $60.3 million of unsettled balances associated with the UIT products that formed part of the acquired business together with higher transaction activity between funds and investors in late December 2010 when compared to late December 2009 in our offshore funds. In the company capacity as sponsor of UITs, the company records receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations for unsettled sell trades of securities and UITs in addition to receivables from customers for unsettled trades of securities. In our U.K. and offshore activities, unsettled fund receivables are created by the normal settlement periods on transactions initiated by certain clients. The presentation of the unsettled fund receivables and substantially offsetting payables ($504.8 million at December 31, 2010) at trade date reflects the legal relationship between the underlying investor and the company. 58 Table of Contents Investments (current and non-current) As of December 31, 2010 we had $473.2 million in investments, of which $308.8 million were current investments and $164.4 million were non-current investments. Included in current investments are $99.5 million of seed money investments in affiliated funds used to seed funds as we launch new products, and $165.5 million of investments related to assets held for deferred compensation plans, which are also held primarily in affiliated funds. Seed investments increased by $24.7 million during the year, primarily due to the $53.9 million of seed investments included in the acquired business at the closing on June 1. Subsequently we have liquidated over half of these acquired business seed investments as the related funds achieved the necessary third-party funding levels. Investments held to hedge deferred compensation awards increased by $80.8 million during the year as we purchased additional investments in affiliated funds to hedge economically new employee plan awards. Included in non-current investments are $156.9 million in equity method investments in our Chinese joint ventures and in certain of the company private equity, real estate and other investments (December 31, 2009: $134.7 million). The increase of $22.2 million in equity method investments includes an increase of $21.6 million in partnership investments due to capital calls, valuation improvements exceeding distributions, capital returns and partnerships acquired through acquisitions during the period. The value of the joint venture investments and other non-controlling equity method investments increased by $0.6 million during the year as a result of current year earnings of $19.4 million, foreign exchange rate movements which added $1.8 million to the value, offset by annual dividends paid of $20.6 million to the company. Assets held for policyholders and policyholder payables One of our subsidiaries, Invesco Perpetual Life Limited, is an insurance company that was established to facilitate retirement savings plans in the U.K. The entity holds assets that are managed for its clients on its balance sheet with an equal and offsetting liability. The increasing balance in these accounts from $1,283.0 million at December 31, 2009, to $1,295.4 million at December 31, 2010, was the result of increases in the market values of these assets and net flows into the funds partially offset by foreign exchange movements. Investments of consolidated investment products Effective January 1, 2010, upon the adoption of guidance now encompassed in ASC Topic 810, the company determined that it was the primary beneficiary of certain CLO variable interest entities. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 20, Consolidated Investment Products, for additional details. As of December 31, 2010, investments of consolidated investment products totaled $7,206.0 million (December 31, 2009: $685.0 million). These investments are offset primarily in long-term debt of consolidated investment products, noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, and retained earnings appropriated for investors in consolidated investment products on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, as the company equity investment in these structures is not significant. The increase from December 31, 2009, primarily reflects adoption of the guidance on January 1, 2010. In accordance with the guidance, prior periods have not been restated. As a result of various acquisitions, the company consolidated additional CLOs with investments of $762.3 million at June 1, 2010 and an additional $289.9 million in investments at December 31, 2010. Goodwill Goodwill increased from $6,467.6 million at December 31, 2009, to $6,980.2 million at December 31, 2010, primarily due to the acquisition, which added $372.8 million to the company goodwill balance on June 1. The increase in goodwill was also due to foreign currency translation for certain subsidiaries whose functional currency differs from that of the parent. The foreign exchange rates at the end of 2010 used to translate the balance sheets of foreign currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars, the reporting currency of the company, reflect a weaker U.S. dollar at the end of 2010, mainly against the Canadian dollar offset by a stronger U.S. dollar mainly against and Pound Sterling, which resulted in a $71.0 million net increase in goodwill, upon consolidation. Additional goodwill was recorded in 2010 related to other acquisition activity ($26.8 million) and the earn-out on the W.L. Ross & Co. acquisition ($40.4 million). The company annual goodwill impairment review is performed as of October 1 of each year. As a result of that analysis, the company determined that no impairment existed at that date. See Critical Accounting Policies Goodwill for additional details of the company goodwill impairment analysis process. Long-term debt The non-current portion of our total debt, excluding long-term debt of consolidated investment products, increased from $745.7 million at December 31, 2009, to $1,315.7 million at December 31, 2010, as the company utilized its credit facility to cover a portion 59 Table of Contents of the cash consideration paid to Morgan Stanley in connection with the acquisition. As of December 31, 2010 there was $570.0 million outstanding on the credit facility. Long-term debt of consolidated investment products Long-term debt of consolidated investment products relates to notes issued by consolidated CLOs. Collateral assets of the CLOs, which are included in investments of consolidated investment products, are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs. The investors in the CLO have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the CLOs. Long-term debt of consolidated investment products was $5,865.4 million at December 31, 2010, primarily reflecting the adoption of guidance now encompassed in ASC Topic 810 on January 1, 2010. In accordance with the standard, prior periods have not been restated to reflect the consolidation. As a result of the acquisition, the company consolidated additional CLOs with notes issued of $630.2 million at June 1, 2010. Retained earnings appropriated for investors in consolidated investment products The retained earnings appropriated for investors in consolidated investment products relates primarily to the difference in value between the collateral assets held (which are included in investments of consolidated investment products), and the debt issued, by consolidated CLOs. The collateral assets held, and notes issued, by consolidated CLOs are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Retained earnings appropriated for investors in consolidated investment products was $495.5 million at December 31, 2010, reflecting the adoption gudiance now encompassed in ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, on January 1, 2010, which resulted in the consolidation of certain CLOs with $6.9 billion of assets held and $5.9 billion in debt issued at December 31, 2010. In accordance with the standard, prior periods have not been restated to reflect the consolidation. A beginning balance adjustment of $274.3 million was made as of the beginning of the year to reflect existing equity balances in newly consolidated CLOs. During 2010, increases in the balance resulted from the acquisition ($149.4 million) and from net income earned over the period ($77.1 million). Equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities Equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities increased by $388.4 million from $707.9 million at December 31, 2009, to $1,096.3 million at December 31, 2010. The majority of the increase relates to acquisitions, which added $363.6 million during the year. The remainder of the variance relates to net gains attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities of $94.0 million, which were offset by $69.2 million of net changes in the partners capital of these entities during the period. The noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities are generally offset by the net assets of certain consolidated investment products, as the company equity investment in the investment products is not significant. Equity attributable to common shareholders Equity attributable to common shareholders increased from $6,912.9 million at December 31, 2009, to $8,264.6 million at December 31, 2010, an increase of $1,351.7 million. $274.3 million of this increase relates to the beginning balance adjustment to retained earnings appropriated for investors in consolidated investment products, as discussed above. Additional increases to equity included $718.6 million as a result of business combinations, net income attributable to common shareholders of $465.7 million, share issuances upon employee option exercises of $19.6 million, a share-based payment credit to capital of $117.8 million representing the accrual of share-based payment expense during the year, and $77.3 million of changes in foreign currency rates. The increase also includes $77.1 million of net income appropriated for investors in consolidated investment products, as discussed above. The increases to equity were partially offset by $197.9 million in dividend payments and $240.1 million in treasury shares acquired through market purchases ($192.2 million) and from staff to meet withholding tax obligations on share award vesting ($47.9 million). Liquidity and Capital Resources The adoption guidance now encompassed in ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, on January 1, 2010, which resulted in the consolidation of $6.9 billion and $5.9 billion of total assets and long-term debt of certain CLO products as of December 31, 2010, respectively, did not impact the company liquidity and capital resources. The collateral assets of the CLOs are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs. The company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral 60 Table of Contents assets held by the CLOs, beyond the company minimal direct investments in, and management fees generated from, these products, which are eliminated upon consolidation. If the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. Additionally, the investors in the CLOs debt tranches have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the CLOs. The company therefore does not consider this debt to be an obligation of the company. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 20, Consolidated Investment Products, for additional details. On July 28, 2010 S&P announced an upgrade of our credit rating from BBB+/Positive to A-/Stable. In October 2010, Invesco became one of only four public investment managers with a Strong risk management rating from S&P. Standard & Poor rates companies enterprise risk management capabilities on a scale of Fair, Adequate, Strong, and Excellent. We believe that our capital structure, together with available cash balances, cash flows generated from operations, existing capacity under our credit facility, proceeds from the public offering of our shares and further capital market activities, if necessary, should provide us with sufficient resources to meet present and future cash needs, including operating, debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements. On June 1, 2010, we used a combination of existing cash balances and $650.0 million credit facility borrowing to satisfy the $770.0 million cash consideration related to acquisition. We issued 30.9 million shares of new equity, in the form of common and non-voting common equivalent preferred shares (with economic rights identical to common stock, other than no right to vote such shares) to Morgan Stanley, without holding restrictions, in conjunction with the close. (The preferred shares were subsequently sold, as converted, to unrelated third parties.) The ultimate purchase price for the business was lower than the $1.5 billion previously announced purchase price, due to depreciation of Invesco common share price from the announcement date to the June 1, 2010 closing date. During the last two quarters we repurchased 9.4 million common shares in open market transactions utilizing $192.2 million in cash. We believe that the cash flow generated from operations of the combined firm, the remaining $680.0 million in credit facility capacity, and our ability to access the capital markets, will provide sufficient liquidity to meet future capital resource needs. The following summary of our recent capital transactions confirms our ability to access capital markets in a timely manner: The May 26, 2009 issuance of 32.9 million common shares in a public offering that produced gross proceeds of $460.5 million ($441.8 million net of related expenses); The June 9, 2009 replacement of our $900.0 million credit facility, which was never fully utilized, with a $500.0 million credit facility (with an option to increase it to $750.0 million, subject to certain conditions), the amount of which was based upon our past and projected working capital needs; The June 30, 2009 completion of a $100.0 million tender offer to purchase publicly traded debt with a principal value of $104.3 million; The December 15, 2009 repayment of $294.2 million 4.5% senior notes that matured on that date through the utilization of existing cash balances, having repurchased $3.0 million of these notes earlier in the year; The May 24, 2010 termination of the $500.0 million credit facility and entrance into a new three-year $1,250.0 million credit facility. Our ability to continue to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors including our credit rating, the condition of the global economy, investors willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. If we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner, our business could be adversely impacted. Certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital. These and other similar provisions of applicable law may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital, repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities. A sub-group of Invesco subsidiaries, including all of our regulated EU subsidiaries, is subject to consolidated capital requirements under applicable European Union (EU) directives, and capital is maintained within this sub-group to satisfy these regulations. These requirements mandate the retention of liquid resources in those jurisdictions, which we meet in part by holding cash and cash equivalents. This retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the European sub-group or in the countries where it is located. Due to the capital restrictions, the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited. In addition, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that may substantially limit such activity. At December 31, 2010, the European sub-group had cash and cash equivalent balances of $456.2 million, much of which is used to satisfy these regulatory requirements. We are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 61 Table of Contents In addition, the company is required to hold cash deposits with clearing organizations or to otherwise segregate cash to maintain compliance with federal and other regulations in connection with its UIT broker dealer entity, which was included in the acquired business. At December 31, 2010 these cash deposits totaled $14.9 million. Cash Flows Discussion The ability to consistently generate cash from operations in excess of capital expenditures and dividend payments is one of our company fundamental financial strengths. Operations continue to be financed from current earnings and borrowings. Our principal uses of cash, other than for operating expenses, include dividend payments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, purchase of our shares in the open market and investments in certain new investment products. Cash flows of consolidated investment products (discussed in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 20, Consolidated Investment Products ) are reflected in Invesco cash used in operating activities, provided by investing activities and provided by financing activities. Cash held by consolidated investment products is not available for general use by Invesco, nor is Invesco cash available for general use by its consolidated investment products. Accordingly, the table below presents the cash flows of the company separately and before consolidation of investment products, as the cash flows of consolidated investment products do not form part of the company cash flow management processes, nor do they form part of the company significant liquidity evaluations and decisions for the reasons noted. The discussion that follows the table will focus on the company cash flows as presented in the Before Consolidation column of the table. Condensed Consolidating Statements of Cash Flows Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are summarized as follows: Consolidated Before Investment $ in millions Consolidation Products (1) Adjustments (2) Total For the year ended December 31, 2010 Net income 456.1 181.4 (0.7 ) 636.8 Net purchases of trading investments (60.4 ) (60.4 ) Other adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities 232.6 (114.0 ) 0.7 119.3 Changes in cash held by consolidated investment products (336.2 ) (336.2 ) Other changes in operating assets and liabilities (27.1 ) 46.8 19.7 Net cash provided by operating activities 601.2 (222.0 ) 379.2 Net proceeds of investments by consolidated investment products 498.6 498.6 Purchases of available for sale and other investments (109.1 ) 5.8 (103.3 ) Proceeds from sales and returns of capital of available for sale and other investments 134.6 (2.2 ) 132.4 Other investing activities (865.5 ) (865.5 ) Net cash (used in)/provided by investing activities (840.0 ) 498.6 3.6 (337.8 ) Net capital distributed by consolidated investment products (276.6 ) (3.6 ) (280.2 ) Other financing activities 214.3 214.3 Net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities 214.3 (276.6 ) (3.6 ) (65.9 ) Decrease in cash and cash equivalents (24.5 ) (24.5 ) Foreign exchange movement on cash and cash equivalents 3.0 3.0 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 762.0 762.0 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period 740.5 740.5 (1) The company adopted guidance now encompassed in ASC Topic 810 on January 1, 2010, resulting in the consolidation of certain CLOs. In accordance with the standard, prior periods have not been restated to reflect the consolidation of these CLOs. Prior to January 1, 2010, the company was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of these CLOs. (2) Adjustments include reclassifications to align the presentation of the cash flows of the consolidated investment funds with those of the company. 62 Table of Contents Consolidated Before Investment $ in millions Consolidation Products Total For the year ended December 31, 2009 Net income 323.2 (113.9 ) 209.3 Net purchases of trading investments (28.8 ) (28.8 ) Other adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities 193.6 106.9 300.5 Changes in cash held by consolidated investment products 45.0 45.0 Other changes in operating assets and liabilities (162.2 ) (1.1 ) (163.3 ) Net cash (used in)/provided by operating activities 325.8 36.9 362.7 Net proceeds of investments by consolidated investment products 8.0 8.0 Other investing activities (110.4 ) (110.4 ) Net cash (used in)/provided by investing activities (110.4 ) 8.0 (102.4 ) Net capital distributed by consolidated investment products (44.9 ) (44.9 ) Other financing activities (55.8 ) (55.8 ) Net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities (55.8 ) (44.9 ) (100.7 ) Decrease in cash and cash equivalents 159.6 159.6 Foreign exchange movement on cash and cash equivalents 17.2 17.2 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 585.2 585.2 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period 762.0 762.0 Consolidated Before Investment $ in millions Consolidation Products Total For the year ended December 31, 2008 Net income 483.4 (62.4 ) 421.0 Net purchases of trading investments 0.3 0.3 Other adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities 224.3 58.0 282.3 Changes in cash held by consolidated investment products (37.1 ) (37.1 ) Other changes in operating assets and liabilities (132.2 ) (8.8 ) (141.0 ) Net cash (used in)/provided by operating activities 575.8 (50.3 ) 525.5 Net proceeds of investments by consolidated investment products 175.6 175.6 Other investing activities (274.0 ) (274.0 ) Net cash (used in)/provided by investing activities (274.0 ) 175.6 (98.4 ) Net capital distributed by consolidated investment products (125.3 ) (125.3 ) Other financing activities (541.1 ) (541.1 ) Net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities (541.1 ) (125.3 ) (666.4 ) Decrease in cash and cash equivalents (239.3 ) (239.3 ) Foreign exchange movement on cash and cash equivalents (91.3 ) (91.3 ) Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 915.8 915.8 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period 585.2 585.2 Operating Activities Operating cash flows are generated by the receipt of investment management and other fees generated from AUM, offset by operating expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Although some receipts and payments are seasonal, particularly bonus payments, in general, after allowing for the change in cash held by consolidated investment products, our operating cash flows move in the same direction as our operating income. 63 Table of Contents In 2010, cash generated by operating activities increased $16.5 million to $379.2 million from $362.7 million in 2009. As shown in the tables above, consolidated investment products used $222.0 million of cash in operating activities in 2010 compared to contributing $36.9 million in 2009. The sum of the operating, investing and financing cash flows of consolidated investment products offsets to a zero impact to the company change in cash and cash equivalent balances from period to period. Excluding the impact of consolidated investment products, cash generated by operations was $601.2 million in 2010 compared to $325.8 million in 2009. The generation of $601.2 million of cash from operations in 2010 included: net purchases of trading investments of $60.4 million. Trading investments are held to provide an economic hedge against staff deferred compensation plan awards together with investments held for a short period, often only a few days, for the purpose of creating a UIT. net cash generated from the other operating activities of $661.6 million, representing net income as adjusted for non-cash items and the changes in operating assets and liabilities. Annual staff bonus accruals at the end of 2010 exceeded the cash bonus payments made in 2010 by $66.7 million, the payments made in 2010 reflecting staff expenses accrued in 2009. This expense and cash paid timing difference results in operating cash flows in a calendar year differing from operating income reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income. This has contributed to the operating cash generated in 2010 exceeding operating income for the year. Related payroll taxes and annual pension contributions have similar, albeit less significant timing impacts. The $325.8 million of cash generated from operations in 2009 included: net purchases of trading investments of $28.8 million principally for staff deferred compensation plan awards. cash generated from the other operating activities of $354.6 million, representing net income as adjusted for non-cash items and the changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash payments made in 2009 related to staff bonuses exceeded the bonus expense accrual for 2009 by $71.4 million and contributed to operating cash flow being below operating income for the year. After excluding the net purchase of trading investments, cash generated from other operating activities in 2010 improved by $307.0 million from $354.6 million in 2009 to $661.6 million in 2010. This reflects the improved operating income together with the timing differences on staff bonus and other staff compensation related payments. The 35.2% reduction in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009, when compared to 2008 is a significant factor in the year-on-year reduced operating cash flows. After excluding the impact of consolidated investment products, cash provided by operating activities in 2009 was $325.8 million, a decrease of $250.0 million or 43.4% over 2008. The timing of the funding of annual bonuses combined with the lower levels of accrued bonus awards at the end of 2009 contributed to operating cash falling by a greater percentage than operating income. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $337.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 (2009: net cash used of $102.4 million). As shown in the table above, consolidated investment products, including investment purchases, sales and returns of capital, contributed $498.6 million (2009: $8.0 million contributed). After allowing for these consolidated investment product cash flows, net cash used in investing activities was $840.0 million (2009: net cash used of $110.4 million). The closing of the acquisition on June 1, 2010 resulted in the payment of cash consideration of $770.0 million while the acquired business had cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet of $57.8 million on that date, giving a net cash outflow of $712.2 million. In 2010, additional net acquisition payments were $37.4 million together with acquisition earn-out payments of $26.3 million (2009: $34.2 million). In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2010 the company purchased available-for-sale investments and other investments of $109.1 million (2009: $104.1 million) and had capital expenditures of $89.6 million (2009: $39.5 million). These cash outflows were partly offset from collected proceeds of $134.6 million from sales and returns of capital of investments in 2010 (2009: $60.6 million). 64 Table of Contents The increase in capital expenditure cash outflows in 2010 when compared to 2009 was primarily related to technology and computer hardware needed for the acquired business. Our capital expenditures related principally in each year to technology initiatives, including new platforms from which we maintain our portfolio management systems and fund accounting systems, improvements in computer hardware and software desktop products for employees, new telecommunications products to enhance our internal information flow, and back-up disaster recovery systems. Also, in each year, a portion of total capital expenditures were related to leasehold improvements made to the various buildings and workspaces used in our offices. These projects have been funded with proceeds from our operating cash flows. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, our capital divestitures were not significant relative to our total fixed assets. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $102.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $98.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. As shown in the table above, consolidated investment products, including investment purchases, sales and returns of capital, contributed $8.0 million (2008: $175.6 million contributed). After allowing for these consolidated investment product cash flows, net cash used in investing activities was $110.4 million in 2009 compared to net cash used of $274.0 million in 2008. The increased use of investing activity cash in 2008 reflected higher levels of acquisition earn-out payments and capital expenditure. Acquisition earn-out cash payments were $34.2 million in 2009 compared to $174.3 million in 2008, the payments relating to the 2006 acquisitions of PowerShares and WL Ross & Co. Capital expenditure in 2009 was $39.5 million compared to $84.1 million in 2008, the 2008 amount including leasehold improvements related to new headquarters space in Atlanta. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $65.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 (2009: $100.7 million). As shown in the table above, the financing activities of the consolidated investment products used cash of $276.6 million during the year (2009: $44.9 million). Excluding the impact of the consolidated investment products, financing activities provided cash of $214.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 (2009: cash utilized $55.8 million). To provide the cash funding needed to complete the business acquisition in late May 2010, $650.0 million was borrowed from the company $1,250.0 million credit facility. The balance on the facility at December 31, 2010 was $570.0 million as $80.0 million of cash generated from operating activities was utilized to partially repay the initial amount borrowed. Financing cash activities in 2009 included an equity issuance generating cash proceeds of $441.8 million and the redemption of senior notes of $397.2 million. Other financing cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2010 included $197.9 million of dividend payments for the dividends declared in January, April, July and October 2010 (2009: dividends paid of $168.9 million), the purchase of treasury shares through market transactions totaling $192.2 million (2009: none), cash inflows from the exercise of options of $19.6 million (2009: $80.0 million), and excess tax benefits cash inflows from share-based compensation of $14.8 million (2009: $9.4 million). Net cash used by financing activities in 2009 of $100.7 million decreased from $666.4 million utilized in 2008. As shown in the table above, the financing activities of the consolidated investment products used cash of $44.9 million during 2009 (2008: $125.3 million). Excluding the impact of the consolidated investment products, financing activities used cash of $55.8 million in 2009 compared to $541.1 million in 2008. During 2008 the company used $313.4 million of cash for treasury share purchases through market transactions, there being no equivalent purchases in 2009. Dividends paid in 2009 totaled $168.9 million compared to $207.1 million in 2008, the 2008 payments including the annual dividend for 2007 (the company converting to a quarterly dividend payment pattern from 2008). Repayments of $397.2 million and $12.0 million were made to senior notes and the credit facility respectively in 2009 compared to $2.8 million and $114.4 million respectively in 2008. There was no equity issuance in 2008. Dividends Invesco declares and pays dividends on a quarterly basis in arrears. The 2010 quarterly dividend was $0.11 per Invesco Ltd. common share. On October 25, 2010, the company declared a third quarter cash dividend, which was paid on December 8, 2010, to shareholders of record as of November 19, 2010. On January 27, 2011, the company declared a fourth quarter cash dividend, which will be paid on March 9, 2011, to shareholders of record as of February 23, 2011. The total dividend attributable to the 2010 fiscal year of $0.44 per share represented a 7.3% increase over the total dividend attributable to the 2009 fiscal year of $0.41 per share. The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be declared by our board of directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our earnings, financial condition and capital requirements at the time such declaration and payment are considered. The board has a policy of managing dividends in a prudent fashion, with due consideration given to profit levels, overall debt levels, and historical dividend payouts. 65 Table of Contents Share Repurchase Plan On April 23, 2008, the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $1.5 billion with no stated expiration date. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the company repurchased 9.4 million common shares utilizing $192.2 million (December 31, 2009: no purchases), leaving approximately $1.2 billion authorized at the end of the year. Separately, an aggregate of 1.9 million shares were withheld on vesting events during the year ended December 31, 2010, to meet employees tax obligations (December 31, 2009: 1.6 million). The carrying value of these shares withheld was $47.9 million (December 31, 2009: $22.9 million). Debt Our total indebtedness at December 31, 2010 was $1,315.7 million (December 31, 2009 is $745.7 million) and was comprised of the following: December 31, December 31, $ in millions 2010 2009 Unsecured Senior Notes: 5.625% due April 17, 2012 215.1 215.1 5.375% due February 27, 2013 333.5 333.5 5.375% due December 15, 2014 197.1 197.1 Floating rate credit facility expiring May 23, 2013 570.0 Total debt 1,315.7 745.7 Less: current maturities of total debt Long-term debt 1,315.7 745.7 For the three months and year ended December 31, 2010, the company weighted average cost of debt was 3.68% and 4.30%, respectively (three months and year ended December 31, 2009: 5.27% and 5.14%, respectively). Total debt increased from $745.7 million at December 31, 2009, to $1,315.7 million at December 31, 2010, due primarily to borrowings under our credit facility. On June 2, 2009, the company commenced a tender offer for the maximum aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 5.625% senior notes due 2012, the 5.375% senior notes due 2013, and the 5.375% senior notes due 2014 (collectively, the Notes ) that it could purchase for $100.0 million at a purchase price per $1,000 principal amount determined in accordance with the procedures of a modified Dutch Auction (tender offer). The tender offer expired at midnight on June 29, 2009, and on June 30, 2009, $104.3 million of the Notes had been retired, generating a gross gain of $4.3 million upon the retirement of debt at a discount. On June 9, 2009, the company completed a three-year $500.0 million revolving bank credit facility. The new facility replaced the $900.0 million credit facility that was scheduled to expire on March 31, 2010, but was terminated concurrent with the entry into the new credit facility. Financial covenants under the credit facility included: (i) the quarterly maintenance of a debt/EBITDA ratio, as defined in the credit agreement, of not greater than 3.25:1.00 through December 31, 2010, and not greater than 3.00:1.00 thereafter, (ii) a coverage ratio (EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement/interest payable for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended before the date of determination) of not less than 4.00:1.00, and (iii) maintenance on a monthly basis of consolidated long term assets under management (as defined in the credit agreement) of not less than $194.8 billion, which amount is subject to a one-time reset by the company under certain conditions. On May 24, 2010, the company terminated the $500.0 million credit facility and entered into a new $1,250 million credit facility. Amounts borrowed under the credit facility are repayable at maturity on May 23, 2013. Financial covenants under the credit agreement include: (i) the quarterly maintenance of a debt/EBITDA ratio, as defined in the credit agreement, of not greater than 3.25:1.00 through December 31, 2011, and not greater than 3.00:1.00 thereafter, (ii) a coverage ratio (EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement/interest payable for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended before the date of determination) of not less than 4.00:1.00. As of December 31, 2010 we were in compliance with our financial covenants. At December 31, 2010 our leverage ratio was 1.34:1.00 (December 31, 2009: 1.11:1.00), and our interest coverage ratio was 17.27:1.00 (December 31, 2009: 11.01:1.00). 66 Table of Contents The coverage ratios, as defined in our credit facility, were as follows during 2010, 2009 and 2008: 2010 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Leverage Ratio 0.99 1.60 1.52 1.34 Interest Coverage Ratio 13.06 13.03 16.43 17.26 Long-term AUM 350.6 N/A * N/A * N/A * 2009 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Leverage Ratio 1.48 1.63 1.77 1.11 Interest Coverage Ratio 11.31 9.64 9.12 11.01 Long-term AUM N/A * 299.0 329.7 343.6 2008 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Leverage Ratio 1.25 1.11 1.17 1.28 Interest Coverage Ratio 16.99 16.53 15.19 12.20 * Long-term AUM became a debt covenant measure as part of the June 9, 2009 credit facility agreement and was discontinued as a financial covenant measure as part of the May 24, 2010 credit facility agreement. Long-term AUM was not required to be restated as part of the agreement and therefore amounts have not been adjusted from what was previously reported.

The calculation of EBTIDA above (a reconciliation from net income attributable to common shareholders) is defined by our credit agreement, and therefore net income attributable to common shareholders is the most appropriate GAAP measure from which to reconcile to EBITDA. The calculation of adjusted debt is defined in our credit facility and equals total long-term debt of $1,315.7 million plus $35.5 million in letters of credit. 67 Table of Contents We have received credit ratings of A3/Stable and A-/Stable from Moody and Standard & Poor credit rating agencies, respectively, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. According to Moody s, obligations rated A are considered upper medium grade and are subject to low credit risk. Invesco rating of A3 is at the low end of the A range (A1, A2, A3), but three notches above the lowest investment grade rating of Baa3. Standard and Poor rating of A- is at the lower end of the A rating, with BBB- representing Standard and Poor lowest investment grade rating. According to Standard and Poor s, A obligations exhibit a strong capacity to meet financial commitments, but are somewhat susceptible to adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances. We believe that rating agency concerns include but are not limited to: our revenues are somewhat exposed to equity market volatility, negative tangible equity, potential impact from regulatory changes to the industry, and integration risk related to the acquisition of Morgan Stanley retail asset management business. Additionally, the rating agencies could decide to downgrade the entire investment management industry, based on their perspective of future growth and solvency. Material deterioration of these factors, and others defined by each rating agency, could result in downgrades to our credit ratings, thereby limiting our ability to generate additional financing. Our credit facility borrowing rates are tied to our credit ratings. However, management believes that solid investment grade ratings are an important factor in winning and maintaining institutional business and strives to manage the company to maintain such ratings. Disclosure of these ratings is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our debt. These credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at anytime by Moody or Standard & Poor s. Each rating should be evaluated independently. The discussion that follows identifies risks associated with the company liquidity and capital resources. The Executive Overview of this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains a broader discussion of the company overall approach to risk management. Credit and Liquidity Risk Capital management involves the management of the company liquidity and cash flows. The company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit, liquidity and market risks, such as interest rate and foreign currency risks (as discussed in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ), through measurement and analysis. The company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits, which are held by external firms. The company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products, as well as with external high credit-quality financial institutions; however, we have chosen to limit the number of firms with which we invest. These arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation. The company is subject to credit risk in the following areas of its business: All cash and cash equivalent balances are subject to credit risk, as they represent deposits made by the company with external banks and other institutions. As of December 31, 2010, our maximum exposure to credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalent balances is $740.5 million. Of this amount, cash and cash equivalents invested in affiliated money market funds (related parties) totaled $289.6 million at December 31, 2010. Certain trust subsidiaries of the company accept deposits and place deposits with other institutions on behalf of our customers. As of December 31, 2010, our exposure to credit risk related to these transactions is $2.4 million. The company does not utilize credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk. The company does not expect any counterparties to its financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities. The company is exposed to liquidity risk through its $1,315.7 million in total debt. The company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods, reviewing them regularly with senior management, maintaining a committed credit facility, scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialog. 68 Table of Contents Effects of Inflation Inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways. First, inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure, especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted. To the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment, our profitability could be negatively impacted. Secondly, the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment. Declines in the values of these AUM could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of AUM. Off Balance Sheet Commitments The company has transactions with various private equity, real estate and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. Many of the company investment products are structured as limited partnerships. The company investment may take the form of the general partner or a limited partner, and the entities are structured such that each partner makes capital commitments that are to be drawn down over the life of the partnership as investment opportunities are identified. At December 31, 2010, the company undrawn capital commitments were $136.4 million (December 31, 2009: $77.6 million). The volatility and valuation dislocations that have occurred from 2007 to the date of this Report in certain sectors of the fixed income market have generated pricing issues in many areas of the market. As a result of these valuation dislocations, during the fourth quarter of 2007, Invesco elected to enter into contingent support agreements for two of its investment trusts to enable them to sustain a stable pricing structure. These two trusts are unregistered trusts that invest in fixed income securities and are available only to strictly limited types of investors. In December 2010, the agreements were amended to extend the term through June 30, 2011; further extensions are likely. As of December 31, 2010, the total committed support under these agreements was $36.0 million with an internal approval mechanism to increase the maximum possible support to $66.0 million at the option of the company. The estimated value of these agreements at December 31, 2010 was $2.0 million (December 31, 2009: $2.5 million), which was recorded in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The estimated value of these agreements is lower than the maximum support amount, reflecting management estimation that the likelihood of funding under the support agreements is low. Significant investor redemptions out of the trusts before the scheduled maturity of the underlying securities or significant credit default issues of the securities held within the trusts portfolios could change the company estimation of likelihood of funding. No payment has been made under either agreement nor has Invesco realized any loss from the support agreements through the date of this Report. These trusts were not consolidated because the company was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary. 69 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations We have various financial obligations that require future cash payments. The following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our commitments as of December 31, 2010: Within 1-3 3-5 More Than $ in millions Total (4)(5) 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Total debt 1,315.7 1,118.6 197.1 Estimated interest payments on total debt (1) 116.0 48.4 57.0 10.6 Operating leases (2) 671.6 67.7 128.9 125.5 349.5 Defined benefit pension and postretirement medical obligations (3) 388.5 9.0 20.0 23.0 336.5 Total 2,604.7 135.0 1,344.4 375.6 749.7 (1) Total debt includes $745.7 million of fixed rate debt. Fixed interest payments are therefore reflected in the table above in the periods they are due. The credit facility, $570.0 million at December 31, 2010, provides for borrowings of various maturities. Interest is payable based upon LIBOR, Prime, Federal Funds or other bank-provided rates in existence at the time of each borrowing. (2) Operating leases reflect obligations for leased building space and sponsorship and naming rights agreements. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 14, Operating Leases for sublease information. (3) The defined benefit obligation of $388.5 million is comprised of $336.1 million related to pension plans and $52.4 million related to a postretirement medical plan. The fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2010, was $286.0 million for the retirement plan and $8.1 million for the medical plan. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 13, Retirement Benefit Plans for detailed benefit pension and postretirement plan information. (4) Other contingent payments at December 31, 2010, include up to $500.0 million related to the PowerShares acquisition and $40.9 million related to the WL Ross & Co. acquisition, which are excluded until such time as they are probable and reasonably estimable. Additionally, the company has capital commitments into co-invested funds that are to be drawn down over the life of the partnership as investment opportunities are identified. At December 31, 2010, the company undrawn capital commitments were $136.4 million. See Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies for additional details. Contingent commitments also include an acquired liability for deferred structuring fees of $20.8 million. See Note 2, Business Combination and Integration for additional details. (5) Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2010, the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $27.1 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 16 Taxation for a discussion on income taxes. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1, Accounting Policies to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made. These accounting policies and estimates are discussed below. Different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these financial statements, and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from period-to-period in the future. Taxation. We operate in several countries and several states through our various subsidiaries, and must allocate our income, expenses, and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions. Accordingly, our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations. Annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions within each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities. Each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations. Because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates, it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements. As a result, it is likely that additions to, or reductions of, income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled. 70 Table of Contents Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements, using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. As a multinational corporation, the company operates in various locations around the world and we generate substantially all of our earnings from our subsidiaries. Under ASC 740-30, deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of the company subsidiaries, consolidated investment products, and joint ventures, except where it is our intention to and we continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings. Our Canadian and U.S. subsidiaries continue to be directly owned by Invesco Holding Company Limited (formerly INVESCO PLC, our predecessor company), which is directly owned by Invesco Ltd. Our Canadian unremitted earnings, for which we are indefinitely reinvested, are estimated to be $1,131 million at December 31, 2010, compared with $1,016 million at December 31, 2009. If distributed as a dividend, Canadian withholding tax of 5.0% would be due. Dividends from our investment in the U.S. should not give rise to additional tax as we are not subject to withholding tax between the U.S. and U.K. Deferred tax liabilities in the amount of $3.1 million (2009: $2.3 million) for additional tax have been recognized for unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries that have regularly remitted earnings and are expected to continue to remit earnings in the foreseeable future. There is no additional tax on dividends from the U.K. to Bermuda. Net deferred tax assets have been recognized in the U.S., U.K., and Canada based on management belief that taxable income of the appropriate character, more likely than not, will be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time. In the event that actual results differ from our expectations, or if our historical trends of positive operating income in any of these locations changes, we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The company utilizes a specific recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The prescribed two-step process for evaluating a tax position involves first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities. If it is, the second step then requires a company to measure this tax position benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The company recognizes any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Income as components of income tax expense. Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and is recorded in the functional currency of the acquired entity. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the single reporting unit level on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value (the first step of the goodwill impairment test), then the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The company annual goodwill impairment review is performed as of October 1 of each year. As a result of that analysis, the company determined that no impairment existed at that date. Our goodwill impairment testing conducted during 2010 and 2009 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, indicating that step two of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary. We have determined that we have one operating and reportable segment. The company evaluated the components of its business, which are business units one level below the operating segment level, and has determined that it has one reporting unit for purposes of goodwill impairment testing. The company components include Invesco Institutional, Invesco North American Retail, Invesco Perpetual, Invesco Continental Europe and Invesco Asia Pacific. The company operating segment represents one reporting unit because all of the components are similar due to the common nature of products and services offered, type of clients, methods of distribution, manner in which each component is operated, extent to which they share assets and resources, and the extent to which they support and benefit from common product development efforts. Traditional profit and loss measures are not produced, and therefore not reviewed by component management, for any of the components. Furthermore, the financial information that is available by component is not sufficient for purposes of performing a discounted cash flow analysis at the component level in order to test goodwill for impairment at that level. As none of our components are reporting units, we have determined that our single operating segment, investment management, is also our single reporting unit. 71 Table of Contents The principal method of determining fair value of the reporting unit is an income approach where future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount. The discount rate used is derived based on the time value of money and the risk profile of the stream of future cash flows. Recent results and projections based on expectation regarding revenues, expenses, capital expenditures and acquisition earn out payments produce a present value for the reporting unit. While the company believes all assumptions utilized in our assessment are reasonable and appropriate, changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different goodwill impairment assessments. The most sensitive of these assumptions are the estimated cash flows and the use of a weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate to determine present value. The present value produced for the reporting unit is the fair value of the reporting unit. This amount is reconciled to the company market capitalization to determine an implied control premium, which is compared to an analysis of historical control premiums experienced by peer companies over a long period of time to assess the reasonableness of the fair value of the reporting unit. The company also utilizes a market approach to provide a secondary and corroborative fair value of the reporting unit by using comparable company and transaction multiples to estimate values for our single reporting unit. Discretion and judgment is required in determining whether the transaction data available represents information for companies of comparable nature, scope and size. The results of the secondary market approach to provide a fair value estimate are not combined or weighted with the results of the income approach described above but are used to provide an additional basis to determine the reasonableness of the income approach fair value estimate. The company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled $6,980.2 million and $6,467.6 million at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. Such events include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on the company assets under management, or any other material negative change in assets under management and related management fees. Due to deteriorating market conditions, interim impairment tests were performed at October 31, 2008, and March 31, 2009, using the most recently available operating information. These interim tests also concluded that no impairment had occurred. Following the March 31, 2009, interim test, the general market conditions improved and the company did not identify the need for further interim tests during 2009 as no indicators of impairment existed. The March 31, 2009, interim impairment test adopted an income approach consistent with the annual 2008 impairment tests, but utilized the company updated forecasts for changes in AUM due to market gains and long-term net flows and the corresponding changes in revenues and expenses. The primary assumption changes from the October 31, 2008, valuation test were increases in the anticipated rise in equity markets in the near-term and in net AUM sales. The increase in equity markets was based on an analysis of the Dow Jones Industrial Average for 10 recession events between 1945 and 2001. The October 31, 2008, valuation had assumed an equity market rise in-line with more normal non-recessionary experience. The higher AUM net sales reflects new flows into the equity markets as values stabilize and confidence returns, and also took into account the company improved relative investment performance. A discount rate of 13.7% was used for the March 31, 2009, test, similar to the October 31, 2008, rate of 13.6% (October 1, 2008: 11.6%). The discount rates used are estimates of the weighted average cost of capital for the investment management sector reflecting the overall industry risks associated with future cash flows and have been calculated consistently across the various tests dates. The October 1, 2009, annual goodwill impairment test was performed using a consistent methodology to that used for the March 31, 2009, interim impairment test, with the exception that adjustments were made to remove the near-term equity market rise assumption, since much of the market rebound had been experienced in the period between March 31, 2009, and October 1, 2009. A discount rate of 12.9% was used for the October 1, 2009, analysis. A 40% decline in the fair value of our reporting unit, or a 500 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption used during our October 1, 2009, goodwill impairment analysis, would have caused the carrying value of our reporting unit to be in excess of its fair value, which would require the second step of the goodwill impairment test to be performed, which would have required a comparison of the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. The second step could have resulted in an impairment loss for goodwill. The October 1, 2010 annual goodwill impairment test was performed using a consistent methodology to that used for the 2009 annual impairment test, with assumptions updated for current market conditions. The most significant change in assumptions from 2009 related to an increase in the market risk premium, which resulted in a discount rate of 14.9% for the October 1, 2010 analysis. A 43% decline in market value or a 700 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption used during our October 1, 2010 goodwill impairment analysis would be required to cause the carrying value of the reporting unit to be in excess of the market value, thus triggering step two of the goodwill impairment test. The second step could have resulted in an impairment loss for goodwill. 72 Table of Contents Intangible Assets. Intangible assets identified on the acquisition of a business are capitalized separately from goodwill if the fair value can be measured reliably on initial recognition (transaction date) and, if they are determined to be finite-lived, are amortized and recorded as operating expenses on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, from two to 12 years, which reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits are realized. The company considers its own assumptions, which require management judgment, about renewal or extension of the term of the arrangement, consistent with its expected use of the asset. A change in the useful life of an intangible asset could have a significant impact on the company amortization expense. Where evidence exists that the underlying management contracts have a high likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost to the company, the intangible asset is assigned an indefinite life and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. The company reevaluates the useful life determination for intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining useful life or an indication of impairment. The indicators in ASC Topic 350-30 paragraphs 35-23 and 24 were considered in making the determination that the indefinite-lived intangibles that arose from the June 1, 2010, acquisition of Morgan Stanley retail asset management business comprise one unit of account for impairment testing purposes. None of the indicators were considered presumptive or determinative; however, due to the fact that the retail fund management contracts are managed under Invesco single retail branding strategy and are used by various business components within the organization, the single unit of account was deemed appropriate. Definite-lived intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable (i.e. carrying amount exceeds the sum of the fair value of the intangible). Intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually as of October 1 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Fair value is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount. The income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment, including discount rates, revenue multiples and AUM growth rates. Changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different impairment conclusions. Investments. Most of our investments are carried at fair value on our balance sheet with the periodic mark-to-market recorded either in accumulated other comprehensive income in the case of available-for-sale investments or directly to earnings in the case of trading assets. Fair value is generally determined by reference to an active trading market, using quoted close or bid prices as of each reporting period end. When a readily ascertainable market value does not exist for an investment, the fair value is calculated based on the expected cash flows of its underlying net asset base, taking into account applicable discount rates and other factors. Since assumptions are made in determining the fair values of investments for which active markets do not exist, the actual value that may be realized upon the sale or other disposition of these investments could differ from the current carrying values. Fair value calculations are also required in association with our quarterly impairment testing of investments. The accuracy of our other-than-temporary impairment assessments is dependent upon the extent to which we are able to accurately determine fair values. Of our $473.2 million total investments at December 31, 2010, those most susceptible to impairment include $99.5 million seed money investments in our affiliated funds. Seed money investments are investments held in Invesco managed funds with the purpose of providing capital to the funds during their development periods. These investments are recorded at fair value using quoted market prices in active markets; there is no modeling or additional information needed to arrive at the fair values of these investments. The value of investments may decline for various reasons. The market price may be affected by general market conditions which reflect prospects for the economy as a whole or by specific information pertaining to an industry or individual company. Such declines require further investigation by management, which considers all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of the investment, including, but not limited to, the following factors: The probability that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a debt security not impaired at acquisition; The length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost; The financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer; The intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value; 73 Table of Contents The decline in the security value due to an increase in market interest rates or a change in foreign exchange rates since acquisition; Determination that the security is not realizable; or An adverse change in estimated cash flows of a beneficial interest. Our other-than-temporary impairment analysis of seed money holdings includes a review of the market returns required for each fund portfolio to enable us to recover our original investment. As part of the review, we analyze several scenarios to project the anticipated recovery period of our original investments based on one-, three-, and five-year historical index returns and historical trends in the equity markets. We also analyze the absolute amount of any loss to date, the trend of the losses, and percent declines in values of the seed money investments. Along with intent and ability to hold, all of these scenarios are considered as part of our other-than-temporary impairment analysis of seed money holdings. Consolidated Investment Products. The primary beneficiary of variable interest entities (VIEs) consolidate the VIEs. A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support, or an entity for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests. The company provides investment management services to, and has transactions with, various private equity funds, real estate funds, fund-of-funds, CLOs, and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. The company serves as the investment manager, making day-to-day investment decisions concerning the assets of the products. Certain of these entities are considered to be VIEs. For all investment funds with the exception of CLOs, if the company is deemed to have a variable interest in these entities, the company is deemed to be the fund primary beneficiary if the company has the majority of rewards/risks of ownership. For CLOs, if the company is deemed to have a variable interest in these entities, the company is deemed to be the fund primary beneficiary if it has the power to direct the activities of the CLO that most significantly impact the CLO economic performance, and the obligation to absorb losses/right to receive benefits from the CLO that could potentially be significant to the CLO. Assessing if an entity is a VIE or voting interest entity (VOE) involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. Factors included in this assessment include the legal organization of the entity, the company contractual involvement with the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the company involvement with the entity. Generally, limited partnership entities where the general partner does not have substantive equity investment at risk and where the other limited partners do not have substantive (greater than 50%) rights to remove the general partner or to dissolve the limited partnership are VIEs. Additionally, certain investment products are VOEs and are structured as limited partnerships of which the company is the general partner and is deemed to have control with the lack of substantive kick-out, liquidation or participation rights of the other limited partners. These investment products are also consolidated into the company financial statements. Determining if the company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE also requires significant judgment, as the calculation of expected losses and residual returns (for investment products other than CLOs) involves estimation and probability assumptions. For CLOs, there is judgment involved to assess if the company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly effect the CLOs economic results and to assess if the company interests could be deemed significant. If current financial statements are not available for consolidated VIEs or VOEs, estimation of investment valuation is required, which includes assessing available quantitative and qualitative data. Significant changes in these estimates could impact the reported value of the investments held by consolidated investment products and the related offsetting equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the other gains and losses of consolidated investment products, net, and related offsetting gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, net, amounts on the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2010 the company consolidated VIEs that held investments of $6,264.2 million (December 31, 2009: $67.9 million) and VOE fund investments of $941.3 million (December 31, 2009: $617.1 million). As circumstances supporting estimates and factors change, the determination of VIE and primary beneficiary status may change, as could the determination of the necessity of consolidation of VOEs. Contingencies. Contingencies arise when we have a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event that is both probable and reasonably estimable. We must from time to time make material estimates with respect to legal and other contingencies. The nature of our business requires compliance with various state and federal statutes, as well as various contractual obligations, and exposes us to a variety of legal proceedings and matters in the ordinary course of business. While the outcomes of matters such as these are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict, we maintain reserves reflected in other current and other non-current liabilities, 74 Table of Contents as appropriate, for identified losses that are, in our judgment, probable and reasonably estimable. Management judgment is based on the advice of legal counsel, ruling on various motions by the applicable court, review of the outcome of similar matters, if applicable, and review of guidance from state or federal agencies, if applicable. Contingent consideration payable in relation to a business acquisition is recorded as of the acquisition date as part of the fair value transferred in exchange for the acquired business.
