ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) The following discussion provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Newmont Mining Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, Newmont, the Company, our and we ). We use certain non-GAAP financial performance measures in our MD&A. For a detailed description of each of the non-GAAP measures used in this MD&A, please see the discussion under Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures beginning on page 87. References to A$ refer to Australian currency, C$ to Canadian currency and NZ$ to New Zealand currency. This item should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report. Overview Newmont is one of the world largest gold producers and is the only gold company included in the S&P 500 Index and the Fortune 500, and has been included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for seven consecutive years. We are also engaged in the exploration for and acquisition of gold and gold/copper properties. We have significant operations and/or assets in the United States, Australia, Peru, Indonesia, Ghana, New Zealand and Mexico. Our vision is to be the most valued and respected mining company through industry leading performance. 2013 highlights are included below and discussed further in Results of Consolidated Operations . 2013 Operating highlights. Sales of $8,322; Average realized gold and copper prices of $1,393 per ounce and $2.96 per pound, respectively. Consolidated gold production of approximately 5.5 million ounces (5.1 million attributable ounces) at Costs applicable to sales of $761 per ounce; Consolidated copper production of approximately 227 million pounds (144 million attributable pounds) at Costs applicable to sales of $4.42 per pound; Gold operating margin (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 87) of $632 per ounce; Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders of $(4.94) per share, Adjusted net income (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 87) of $1.40 per share; and Gold and copper reserves of 88.4 million ounces and 8,130 million pounds, respectively at December 31, 2013. Advancing our project pipeline. We remain focused on the progression of our next generation of mining projects. Approximately 40% of our 2013 capital expenditures were allocated as development capital for the development of the Akyem project, the Phoenix Copper Leach project, the Turf Ventilation Shaft project and the Conga project. The remaining 60% of our 2013 capital expenditures was spent on sustaining capital. We manage our wider project portfolio to maintain flexibility to address the development risks associated with our projects including permitting, local community and government support, engineering and procurement availability, technical issues, escalating costs and other associated risks that could adversely impact the timing and costs of certain opportunities. 53 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION Our opportunities in the Execution phase of development comprise a significant part of the Company growth strategy and include Akyem in Ghana, Phoenix Copper Leach and Turf Ventilation Shaft in Nevada and Conga in Peru, as described further below. Akyem, Ghana . Construction activities were completed in September 2013 on time and on budget and commercial production was achieved in the fourth quarter of 2013. Akyem exceeded guidance by producing 129,000 ounces of gold in 2013 and gold production is expected to be 350,000 to 450,000 ounces per year for the first five years of the mine operating life of approximately 19 years. Total capital costs were $940. At December 31, 2013, we reported 7.2 million ounces of gold reserves at Akyem. Phoenix Copper Leach, Nevada . Construction activities were completed in September 2013 on time and on budget with the first copper cathode produced and commercial production achieved in the fourth quarter of 2013. Copper production is expected to be approximately 20 million pounds per year for the first five years of production at Costs applicable to sales of $1.75 to $2.00 per pound, which will be accounted for under the co-product method of accounting in the future. Total capital costs were $169. Conga, Peru . Due to local political and community protests, construction and development activities at the Conga project were largely suspended in November 2011. The results of the Peruvian Central Government initiated Environmental Impact Assessment ( EIA ) independent review were announced on April 20, 2012 and confirmed our initial EIA met Peruvian and International standards. The review made recommendations to provide additional water capacity and social funds, which we have largely accepted. We announced our decision to move the project forward on a water first approach on June 22, 2012. Spending on the project in 2013 was $186. We anticipate spending in 2014 to be approximately $80, focusing on building access roads and permitting work around the Perol water reservoir, and gaining further social acceptance for the project. Total property, plant and mine development was $1,616 at December 31, 2013. At December 31, 2013 we reported 6.4 million attributable ounces of gold reserves and 1,690 million attributable pounds of copper reserves at Conga. Construction of Conga and the implementation of the independent EIA review recommendations will continue provided it can be done in a safe manner with risk-adjusted returns that justify future investment. Should we be unable to continue with the current development plan at Conga, we may reprioritize and reallocate capital to other alternatives, which may result in a potential accounting impairment. See Item1A, Risk Factors, above for a description of political risks related to the project development. We continue to advance earlier stage development assets through our project pipeline in our four operating regions. The exploration, construction and operation of these earlier stage development assets may require significant funding if they go into execution. Three of these projects are described further below: Merian, Suriname . On February 19, 2014 we completed the acquisition of the remaining 20% minority interest in the Merian project. The Mineral and Partnership Agreements were signed by Newmont indirect subsidiary, Suriname Gold Company, LLC, and the Government of Suriname on November 22, 2013. The project feasibility study is now complete and subject to a final review process before being submitted to the Board of Directors for full funding in the second quarter of 2014. If approved, the project will allow Newmont to pursue a new district with upside potential and the opportunity to grow and extend the operating life of the South American region. Initial estimated gold production (on a 100% basis) of 350,000 to 450,000 ounces is expected per year, once Merian comes into production. At December 31, 2013, we reported 3.4 million attributable ounces of gold reserves at Merian. Long Canyon, Nevada . The project is in the selection and confirmation stage of development and we continue to develop our understanding of Long Canyon and the district. We have submitted the Plan-of-Operations to the Bureau of Land Management in support of our Environmental Impact 54 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION Statement ( EIS ) and continue to progress the exploration program. At December 31, 2013, we reported 1.0 million attributable ounces of gold reserves at Long Canyon. We anticipate Stage 3 details engineering and permitting to be completed by the end of 2014. Ahafo Mill Expansion, Ghana. We are continuing to evaluate alternatives for development of this project. Current engineering efforts are focused on reducing the scale of the project. The potential improved economics and feasibility of the project will be assessed by the end of 2014. Summary of Consolidated Financial and Operating Performance Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Sales $ 8,322 $ 9,868 $ 10,358 Income (loss) from continuing operations $ (2,777 ) $ 2,194 $ 1,108 Net income (loss) $ (2,716 ) $ 2,118 $ 972 Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders $ (2,462 ) $ 1,809 $ 366 Per common share, basic Income (loss) from continuing operations $ (5.06 ) $ 3.80 $ 1.02 Net income (loss) $ (4.94 ) $ 3.65 $ 0.74 Adjusted net income (1) $ 695 $ 1,850 $ 2,170 Adjusted net income per share (1) $ 1.40 $ 3.73 $ 4.39 Gold ounces produced (thousands) Consolidated 5,463 5,583 5,873 Attributable (2) 5,065 4,977 5,166 Copper pounds produced (millions) Consolidated 227 224 338 Attributable 144 143 197 Gold ounces sold (thousands) Consolidated 5,489 5,466 5,820 Attributable 4,968 4,787 5,025 Copper pounds sold (millions) Consolidated 229 229 356 Attributable 148 145 203 Average price realized, net Gold (per ounce) $ 1,393 $ 1,662 $ 1,562 Copper (per pound) $ 2.96 $ 3.43 $ 3.54 Costs applicable to sales (3) Gold (per ounce) $ 761 $ 677 $ 591 Copper (per pound) $ 4.42 $ 2.34 $ 1.26 Operating margin (1) Gold (per ounce) $ 632 $ 985 $ 971 Copper (per pound) $ (1.46 ) $ 1.09 $ 2.28 (1) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures beginning on page 87. (2) Includes 65, 53 and 64 thousand ounces in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, from our interest in La Zanja and 56, 31 and 17 thousand ounces in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, from our interest in Duketon. (3) Excludes Amortization and Reclamation and remediation . 55 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION Consolidated Financial Performance Sales decreased 16% in 2013 compared to 2012 due to lower average realized gold and copper price. The average realized gold price decreased 16% to $1,393 per ounce in 2013 from $1,662 per ounce in 2012. The average realized copper price, including $11 unfavorable mark to market adjustments on provisionally priced copper sales, decreased 14% to $2.96 per pound in 2013 compared to $3.43 per pound in 2012. Costs applicable to sales increased 22% in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to the stockpile and leach pad write-downs as a result of lower gold price assumptions as well as higher waste mining activities, higher milling costs and higher royalty costs. Liquidity Our financial position was as follows: At December 31, 2013 2012 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,555 $ 1,561 Debt $ 6,740 $ 6,298 Net Debt $ 5,185 $ 4,737 Investments $ 517 $ 1,532 Newmont stockholders equity $ 10,141 $ 13,773 During 2013, our debt and liquidity positions were affected by the following: Net cash provided from continuing operations of $1,561; Capital expenditures of $1,900; Included in net cash provided from continuing operations are income and mining taxes paid of $361; Proceeds from debt of $388, net of repayments; Proceeds from sale of marketable securities of $589 primarily due to the sale of Canadian Oil Sands securities; and Dividends paid to common shareholders of $611. Looking Forward We will continue to focus on operational excellence in 2014 to deliver on our plans, resulting in the following expectations for 2014: Consolidated gold production of approximately 5.0 to 5.4 million ounces (4.6 to 4.9 million attributable ounces) at Costs applicable to sales per ounce sold of approximately $740 to $790; Consolidated copper production of approximately 160 to 175 thousand tonnes (95 to 110 thousand attributable tonnes) at Costs applicable to sales per copper pound sold of approximately $2.00 to $2.25; Consolidated capital expenditures of approximately $1,300 to $1,400, with approximately 90% allocated to sustaining capital. Projects that create value, lower cost and extend mine life, such as the Turf Vent Shaft in Nevada, will be prioritized, in keeping with the strategy to strengthen the portfolio. All-In sustaining costs of approximately $1,075 to $1,175 per gold ounce. All-In sustaining costs of approximately $2.75 to $2.95 per copper pound. All-in sustaining cost is a non-GAAP metric 56 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION defined by the Company as the sum of costs applicable to sales, G&A, exploration expense, advanced projects and R&D, other expense, treatment and refining costs, and sustaining capital. All-in sustaining cost per ounce/pound is calculated by dividing All-in sustaining cost by the estimated consolidated ounces/pounds sold; Our investment priorities include completing the Turf/Leeville Vent shaft in Nevada, finishing the Phase 6 stripping campaign at Batu Hijau, and identifying the best path forward for Conga in Peru. We expect capital expenditures to decrease from 2013 to 2014 by approximately 30%, due to the completion of Akyem and Phoenix Copper Leach construction and declining capital commitments for Conga, partially offset by the Turf/Leeville Vent Shaft development in Nevada. Certain key factors will affect our future financial and operating results. These include, but are not limited to, the following: Our 2014 expectations, particularly with respect to production volumes, Costs applicable to sales per ounce or pound and All-in sustaining costs per ounce may differ significantly from actual quarter and full year results due to variations in mine planning and sequencing, ore grades and hardness, metal recoveries, waste removal, commodity input prices and foreign currency exchange rates; and Future investments in various development projects will require significant funding. Our operating cash flow may become insufficient to meet the funding requirements of these investments, fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends. Our ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices and our operational performance, among other factors. In the event of lower gold and copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or new funding limitations, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends could be significantly constrained. For a discussion of other risks that may impact future financial and operating results, see Item 1A, Risk Factors. Accounting Developments For a discussion of Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies Listed below are the accounting policies that we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported. Amortization Expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to amortize such costs over the estimated future lives of such facilities or equipment and their components. These lives do not exceed the estimated mine life based on proven and probable reserves as the useful lives of these assets are considered to be limited to the life of the relevant mine. Costs incurred to develop new properties are capitalized as incurred where it has been determined that the property can be economically developed based on the existence of proven and probable reserves. At our surface mines, these costs include costs to further delineate the ore body and remove overburden to initially expose the ore body. At our underground mines, these costs include the cost of 57 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION building access ways, shaft sinking and access, lateral development, drift development, ramps and infrastructure development. All such costs are amortized using the units-of-production ( UOP ) method over the estimated life of the ore body based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves. Mine development costs incurred after the commencement of production are amortized using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves. To the extent that such costs benefit the entire ore body, they are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of the entire ore body. Costs incurred to access specific ore blocks or areas that only provide benefit over the life of that block or area are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of that specific ore block or area. The calculation of the UOP rate of amortization, and therefore the annual amortization charge to operations, could be materially impacted to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on proven and probable reserves. This would generally occur to the extent that there were significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in determining reserves. These changes could include: (i) an expansion of proven and probable reserves through exploration activities; (ii) differences between estimated and actual costs of production, due to differences in grade, metal recovery rates and foreign currency exchange rates; and (iii) differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of reserves. If reserves decreased significantly, amortization charged to operations would increase; conversely, if reserves increased significantly, amortization charged to operations would decrease. Such changes in reserves could similarly impact the useful lives of assets depreciated on a straight-line basis, where those lives are limited to the life of the mine, which in turn is limited to the life of the proven and probable reserves. The expected useful lives used in amortization calculations are determined based on applicable facts and circumstances, as described above. Significant judgment is involved in the determination of useful lives, and no assurance can be given that actual useful lives will not differ significantly from the useful lives assumed for the purpose of amortization calculations. Carrying Value of Stockpiles Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing. Mine sequencing may result in mining material at a faster rate than can be processed. We generally process the highest ore grade material first to maximize metal production; however, a blend of stockpiled material may be processed to balance hardness and/or metallurgy in order to maximize throughput and recovery. Processing of lower grade stockpiled ore may continue after mining operations are completed. Sulfide ore stockpiles are subject to oxidation over time which can reduce expected future recoveries. Stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile, the number of contained ounces or pounds (based on assay data), and the estimated metallurgical recovery rates (based on the expected processing method). Stockpile ore tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. Costs are added to stockpiles based on current mining costs, including applicable overhead and amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are removed at each stockpile average cost per recoverable ounce of gold or pound of copper as material is processed. 58 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION The following is a summary of our ore stockpiles: At December 31, At December 31, 2013 2012 2013 2012 ($ in millions) ($ per ounce) Gold Nevada $ 675 $ 568 $ 231 $ 184 Yanacocha 311 120 524 219 Boddington 247 373 322 493 Other Australia/New Zealand 128 173 120 172 Batu Hijau 232 258 415 457 Ahafo 292 235 299 340 Akyem 35 3 105 49 Total $ 1,920 $ 1,730 $ 266 $ 259 At December 31, At December 31, 2013 2012 2013 2012 ($ in millions) ($ per pound) Copper Boddington $ 57 $ 101 $ 0.68 $ 1.15 Batu Hijau 1,058 1,285 0.98 1.07 Total $ 1,115 $ 1,386 $ 0.96 $ 1.07 We record stockpiles at the lower of average cost or net realizable value ( NRV ), and carrying values are evaluated at least quarterly. NRV represents the estimated future sales price based on short-term and long-term metals prices, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. The primary factors that influence the need to record write-downs of stockpiles include short-term and long-term metals prices and costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy, materials and supplies, as well as realized ore grades and recovery rates. The Company recorded write-downs to reduce the carrying value of stockpiles to net realizable value of $956, $24 and $1 in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, as components of Cost applicable to sales and Amortization . The significant assumptions in determining the stockpile NRV for each mine site reporting unit at December 31, 2013 included production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, a long-term gold price of $1,300 per ounce, a long-term copper price of $3.00 per pound and a U.S. to Australian dollar long-term exchange rate of $0.92 per A$1.00. If short-term and long-term metals prices decrease and/or the value of the stockpiles decrease, it may be necessary to record a write-down of stockpiles to NRV. The NRV measurement involves the use of estimates and assumptions unique to each mining operation regarding current and future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors. A high degree of judgment is involved in determining such assumptions and estimates and no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. 59 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION The following is a summary of the historical stockpile cost and estimated future processing costs by region: At December 31, 2013 ($ per ounce) Historical Costs Estimated Future Processing Costs Total Estimated Production Costs Gold Nevada $ 231 $ 639 $ 870 Yanacocha 524 354 878 Boddington 322 968 1,290 Other Australia/New Zealand 120 1,154 1,274 Batu Hijau 415 752 1,167 Ahafo 299 732 1,031 Akyem 105 390 495 Weighted Average $ 266 $ 737 $ 1,003 At December 31, 2013 ($ per pound) Historical Costs Estimated Future Processing Costs Total Estimated Production Costs Copper Boddington $ 0.68 $ 2.04 $ 2.72 Batu Hijau 0.98 1.78 2.76 Weighted Average $ 0.96 $ 1.80 $ 2.76 Carrying Value of Ore on Leach Pads Ore on leach pads represent ore that has been mined and placed on leach pads where a weak cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold. Costs are added to ore on leach pads based on current mining costs, including applicable amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are removed from ore on leach pads as ounces are recovered based on the average cost per estimated recoverable ounce of gold on the leach pad. Estimates of recoverable gold on the leach pads are calculated from the quantities of ore placed on the leach pads (measured tons added to the leach pads), the grade of ore placed on the leach pads (based on assay data) and a recovery percentage (based on ore type). In general, leach pads recover between 50% and 95% of the recoverable ounces in the first year of leaching, declining each year thereafter until the leaching process is complete. Although the quantities of recoverable gold placed on the leach pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on pads to the quantities of gold actually recovered (metallurgical balancing), the nature of the leaching process inherently limits the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. As a result, the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and estimates are refined based on actual results over time. Historically, our operating results have not been materially impacted by variations between the estimated and actual recoverable quantities of gold on our leach pads. Variations between actual and estimated quantities resulting from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in write-downs to NRV are accounted for on a prospective basis. The Company recorded write-downs to reduce the carrying value of leach pads to net realizable value of $238, $4 and $0 in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, as components of Cost applicable to sales and 60 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION Amortization . The significant assumptions in determining the NRV for each mine site reporting unit at December 31, 2013 apart from production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation included a long-term gold price of $1,300 per ounce. If short-term and long-term gold prices decrease, and/or the value of the ore on leach pads decrease, it may be necessary to record a write-down of ore on leach pads to NRV. The following is a summary of our ore on leach pads: At December 31, At December 31, 2013 2012 2013 2012 ($ in millions) ($ per ounce) Gold Nevada $ 200 $ 131 $ 426 $ 368 La Herradura 57 57 1,095 846 Yanacocha 214 378 809 973 Total $ 471 $ 566 $ 598 $ 697 The following is a summary of our ore on leach pad historical cost and estimated future processing costs by region: At December 31, 2013 ($ per ounce) Historical Costs Estimated Future Processing Costs Total Estimated Production Costs Gold Nevada $ 426 $ 581 $ 1,007 La Herradura 1,095 190 1,285 Yanacocha 809 394 1,203 Weighted Average $ 598 $ 492 $ 1,090 Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets We review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Asset impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated pre-tax future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset, including goodwill, if any. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows. Future cash flows are estimated based on estimated quantities of recoverable minerals, expected gold and other commodity prices (considering current and historical prices, trends and related factors), production levels, operating costs, capital requirements and reclamation costs, all based on life-of-mine plans. The significant assumptions in determining the future cash flows for each mine site reporting unit at December 31, 2013 apart from production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, included a long-term gold price of $1,300 per ounce, a long-term copper price of $3.00 per pound and U.S. to Australian dollar long-term exchange rate of $0.92 per A$1.00. During 2013, 2012 and 2011, we recorded impairments of $4,352, $52, and $2,084, respectively, to reduce the carrying value of property, plant and mine development as part of Write-down of property, plant and mine development. Existing proven and probable reserves and value beyond proven and probable reserves, including mineralization other than proven and probable reserves are included when determining the fair value of mine site reporting units at acquisition and, subsequently, in determining whether the assets are impaired. The term recoverable minerals refers to the estimated amount of gold or other commodities 61 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION that will be obtained after taking into account losses during ore processing and treatment. Estimates of recoverable minerals from such exploration stage mineral interests are risk adjusted based on management relative confidence in such materials. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups. As discussed above under Amortization, various factors could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted production schedules from proven and probable reserves. Additionally, production, capital and reclamation costs could differ from the assumptions used in the cash flow models used to assess impairment. The ability to achieve the estimated quantities of recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests involves further risks in addition to those factors applicable to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have been identified, due to the lower level of confidence that the identified mineralized material could ultimately be mined economically. Assets classified as exploration potential have the highest level of risk that the carrying value of the asset can be ultimately realized, due to the still lower level of geological confidence and economic modeling. Derivative Instruments With the exception of the Call Spread Transactions (as described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), all financial instruments that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in the statements of consolidated income, except for the effective portion of the change in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges. Management applies judgment in estimating the fair value of instruments that are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding commodity prices, market volatilities, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Variations in these factors could materially affect amounts credited or charged to earnings to reflect the changes in fair value of derivatives. Certain derivative contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, whereby the effective portion of changes in fair value of these instruments are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income and will be recognized in the statements of consolidated income when the underlying transaction designated as the hedged item impacts earnings. The derivative contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges are designated against foreign currency expenditures, diesel purchases, or future debt interest payments where management believes the forecasted transaction is probable of occurring. To the extent that management determines that the forecasted transactions are no longer probable of occurring, gains and losses deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income would be reclassified to the statements of consolidated income immediately. Reclamation and Remediation Obligations Reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation and remediation costs. Reclamation obligations are based on when the spending for an existing environmental disturbance will occur. We review, on at least an annual basis, the reclamation obligation at each mine. Reclamation obligations for inactive mines are accrued based on management best estimate of the costs expected to be incurred at a site. Such cost estimates include, where applicable, ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs. Changes in estimates at inactive mines are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and 62 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required. Any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to earnings for reclamation and remediation. Income and Mining Taxes We recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. Refer above to Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets for a discussion of the factors that could cause future cash flows to differ from estimates. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to realize deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate could limit our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets recorded at the reporting date. Our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If an estimate of tax liabilities proves to be greater than the ultimate assessment, a tax benefit would result. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in Income and mining tax expense . Consolidated Financial Results Gold Sales decreased $1,438 in 2013 compared to 2012 due to a $269 per ounce decrease in the average net realized price, partially offset by 23,000 more ounces sold. Gold Sales decreased $13 in 2012 compared to 2011 due to 354,000 fewer ounces sold, partially offset by a $100 per ounce increase in the average net realized price.

The increase in 2012 compared to 2011 was due to higher mining, milling, and royalty costs, partially offset by lower sales volumes and an increase to stockpiles. Costs applicable to sales for copper increased in 2013 from 2012 due to the stockpile write-downs as a result of the lower copper price assumptions. The increase in 2012 from 2011 was due to continued waste mining at Batu Hijau and higher milling costs at Boddington, coupled with the higher allocation of costs to copper. For a complete discussion regarding variations in operations, see Results of Consolidated Operations below. Amortization expense increased in 2013 from 2012 due to the portion of the aforementioned stockpile and leach pad write-downs that is associate with amortization, higher mine development costs, and higher asset retirement costs. Amortization expense decreased in 2012 from 2011 due to lower production, partially offset by additional investments in mine development and equipment and higher asset retirement costs. Amortization expense fluctuates as capital expenditures increase or decrease and as production levels increase or decrease due to the use of the units-of-production amortization method for mineral interests and mine development. For a complete discussion, see Results of Consolidated Operations , below. We expect Amortization expense to be approximately $1,050 to $1,125 in 2014. 66 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION The following is a summary of Costs applicable to sales and Amortization by operation: Costs Applicable to Sales Amortization Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011 Gold North America: Nevada $ 1,164 $ 1,098 $ 1,039 $ 265 $ 230 $ 277 La Herradura 177 132 110 34 21 20 1,341 1,230 1,149 299 251 297 South America: Yanacocha 663 669 711 333 254 234 Other South America 1 663 669 711 334 254 234 Australia / New Zealand: Boddington 805 623 470 165 159 122 Other Australia/New Zealand 921 796 681 229 146 138 1,726 1,419 1,151 394 305 260 Indonesia: Batu Hijau 107 71 164 22 12 35 Africa: Ahafo 307 314 265 78 75 76 Akyem 32 13 339 314 265 91 75 76 4,176 3,703 3,440 1,140 897 902 Copper Boddington 195 150 118 37 34 28 Batu Hijau 815 385 332 163 76 71 1,010 535 450 200 110 99 Other Corporate and other 22 25 35 $ 5,186 $ 4,238 $ 3,890 $ 1,362 $ 1,032 $ 1,036 Exploration expense decreased to $247 in 2013 from $356 in 2012 due to decreases in both brownfields and greenfields expenditures in all our regions. Exploration activities in a number of countries including Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea and Cote d Ivoire have been discontinued. Exploration expense increased in 2012 from $350 in 2011 due to additional near mine expenditures in South America and Africa, mostly offset by the elimination of exploration at Hope Bay. We expect Exploration expense to be focused primarily on Carlin underground and Long Canyon in Nevada, Yanacocha in Peru, Ahafo and Subika in Ghana, and Tanami in Australia. During 2013, we removed 4.6 million ounces from proven and probable reserves, along with 6.2 million ounces of depletion. Reserve reductions were primarily due to updated models, revised designs, and a decrease in gold price assumptions which resulted in net decreases (before depletion) in Australia/New Zealand (2.9 million ounces), North America (1.7 million ounces), Africa (0.9 million ounces), and Indonesia (0.1 million ounces). South America reserves increased due to conversion of 67 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION mineralized material at the Merian project in Suriname and at Yanacocha (1.0 million ounces). The estimated impact of the change in gold price assumption on these reserve reductions was a decrease of (2.5) million ounces. During 2012, we added 5.5 million ounces to proven and probable reserves, with 6.2 million ounces of depletion Reserve additions were primarily due to conversion of mineralized material at the Merian project in Suriname (1.8 million ounces), Carlin underground, (1.7 million ounces) and La Herradura (0.6 million ounces) with the remaining additions coming from open pit and underground sources in all regions (1.4 million ounces). The estimated impact of the change in gold price assumption on these reserve additions was an increase of 1.5 million ounces. During 2011, we added 11.6 million ounces to proven and probable reserves, with 6.3 million ounces of depletion. Reserve additions were primarily due to conversion of mineralized material at Ahafo (2.7 million ounces), Carlin open pit, (2.3 million ounces), Phoenix (1.5 million ounces), Carlin underground (1.2 million ounces), Kalgoorlie (1.0 million ounces) and Tanami (0.7 million ounces) with the remaining additions coming from open pit and underground sources in all regions (2.2 million ounces). The estimated impact of the change in gold price assumption on these reserve additions was an increase of 3.3 million ounces. Advanced projects, research and development expense includes development project management costs, feasibility studies and certain drilling costs. Advanced projects, research and development expense decreased 36% in 2013 compared to 2012 due to spending decreases in Nevada as well as fewer projects undertaken in other regions than originally anticipated. We expect combined Advanced projects, research and development and Exploration expense to be approximately $400 to $450 in 2014. We expect Advanced projects, research and development expense to be focused primarily on Conga and Verde Bio Leach in South America, La Herradura and North Exodus in North America, Subika and Euronimba in Africa, and Merian in Suriname. The following is a summary of Advanced projects, research and development expense by segment: Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 North America Nevada $ 28 $ 43 $ 24 La Herradura 10 9 2 Hope Bay 1 155 Other North America 1 South America Yanacocha 19 20 19 Conga 24 57 20 Other South America 6 38 13 Australia/New Zealand Boddington 6 6 5 Other Australia/New Zealand 18 15 5 Indonesia Batu Hijau 17 6 Africa Ahafo 23 13 10 Akyem 7 12 5 Other Africa 5 3 Corporate and Other Technical and project services 55 96 89 Corporate 20 18 20 $ 222 $ 348 $ 373 68 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION General and administrative expense decreased to $203 in 2013, compared to $212 in 2012, due to lower labor costs. General and administrative expense increased in 2012 compared to $198 in 2011 due to higher benefit and compensation costs. General and administrative expense as a percentage of Sales was 2.4% in 2013, compared to 2.1% and 1.9% in 2012 and 2011, respectively. We expect General and administrative expense to be approximately $175 to $200 in 2014. Write-downs totaled $4,352, $52 and $2,084 for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The 2013 write-down at Boddington in Australia was primarily due to a decrease in the Company long-term gold and copper price assumptions combined with rising operating costs. The 2013 write-down at Nevada Long Canyon project was primarily due to a decrease in the Company long-term gold price assumption and improved understanding of the ore body. These factors represented significant changes in the business, requiring the Company to evaluate long-lived assets for impairment. For purposes of this evaluation, estimates of future cash flows of the individual reporting units were used to determine fair value. The estimated cash flows were derived from life-of-mine plans, developed using long-term pricing reflective of the current price environment and management projections for operating costs. Refer to Note 16 for additional information related to long-term gold and copper price assumptions and to the fair value determination of the impairment. Due to the above conditions, Goodwill was included in the Company impairment analysis. After-tax discounted future cash flows of reporting units with Goodwill were analyzed. Goodwill at Other Australia / New Zealand had a carrying value of $188 at December 31, 2012. As a result of this evaluation, the Company recorded an impairment of $56, resulting in a carrying value of $132 at December 31, 2013. The 2012 write-down was primarily due to an impairment of the FALC JV diamond project as well as write-downs of non-essential surface equipment at Conga. The 2011 write-down related to the Hope Bay project. The project was evaluated against other projects and development opportunities within the Company wider project pipeline. The amount of the Hope Bay write-down was recorded at fair value based on the estimated recoverable value, net of transportation and selling costs utilizing the liquidation model. Other expense, net was $300, $449 and $265 for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The decrease in 2013 over 2012 is due to lower Hope Bay care and maintenance costs and regional administration and community development expenses, partially offset by higher transaction costs related to TMAC. The increase in 2012 over 2011 is due to Hope Bay care and maintenance costs, restructuring charges and higher expenses for regional administration and community development, partially offset by the Indonesian value added tax settlement and Fronteer acquisition costs in 2011. Other income, net was $349, $278 and $12 for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in 2013 over 2012 is due to a gain on the sale of the Canadian Oil Sands investment and higher foreign currency exchange gains, partially offset by higher other-than-temporary impairments of marketable equity securities and lower income from developing projects. The increase in 2012 over 2011 is due to lower other-than-temporary impairment charges for marketable equity securities, the sale of non-core assets, a reduction of an allowance for loan receivable, higher income from development projects, a gain on derivative ineffectiveness and higher Canadian Oil Sands dividends, partially offset by a lower gain on sale of investments. Interest expense, net was $303, $249 and $244 for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Capitalized interest totaled $88, $107 and $52 in each year, respectively. Interest expense, net increased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to decreased capitalized interest and higher drawdowns on the Corporate Credit Facility, as well as a full year worth of interest on the 2022 and 2042 Senior Notes that were issued in March of 2012. Capitalized interest decreased from capital projects being completed at Akyem and Phoenix copper leach and other projects being deferred. Interest expense, 69 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION net increased in 2012 from 2011 due to the issuance of the 2022 and 2042 Senior Notes, partially offset by the repayment of the 2012 Convertible Senior Notes in the first quarter of 2012. We expect Interest expense, net to be approximately $350 to $375 in 2014. Income and mining tax benefit was $813, resulting in an effective tax rate of 23%. This compares to income tax expense of $869 and $713, or effective tax rates of 28% and 39% for 2012 and 2011, respectively. The effective tax rate in 2013 differed from the prior two years primarily due to non-reoccurring tax benefits of prior year tax restructuring, impact of changes in our valuation allowances and significant decrease in the benefit of percentage depletion. During 2013, the Company recognized a $791 deferred tax benefit (at a blended federal and state statutory rate of 38%) due to the impairment of the Long Canyon and Northumberland assets. This benefit reflects a reduction of the deferred tax liability that was established upon Newmont purchase of Fronteer Gold Inc. in 2011. The factors that most significantly impacted our effective tax rates for the year are percentage depletion, changes in estimates of reserves for income tax uncertainties, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets, mining taxes and the impact of certain specific transactions. Many of these factors are sensitive to the average realized price of gold and other metals. For a complete discussion, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on the uncertainty and inherent unpredictability of the factors influencing our effective tax rate and the sensitivity of such factors to gold and other metals prices as discussed above, the effective tax rate is expected to be volatile in future periods. The effective tax rate is expected to be between 34% and 37% in 2014. Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased to a net loss of $254 in 2013 compared to net income of $309 in 2012 and net income of $606 in 2011 as a result of decreased earnings at Batu Hijau and Minera Yanacocha as well as the TMAC transaction in March 2013.

( Euronimba ), with the remaining interests held by BHP Billiton (43.50%) and Areva (13%). Euronimba owns 95% of the Nimba iron ore project located in the Republic of Guinea, which is in the early stages of development. We have a 32% interest in Novo Resources Corporation ( Novo ). Novo owns a majority of the Beaton Creek discovery with Millennium Minerals in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Income (loss) from discontinued operations include Holloway Mining Company, which owned the Holt-McDermott property ( Holt property ) that was sold to St. Andrew Goldfields Ltd. ( St. Andrew ) in 2006. In 2009, the Superior Court issued a decision finding Newmont Canada Corporation ( Newmont Canada ) liable for a sliding scale royalty on production from the Holt property, which Newmont Canada appealed. In 2011, the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the Superior Court ruling increasing the previously recorded liability by an additional $136 charge, net of tax benefits of $7. In 2012, we 70 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION recognized a $76 charge, net of tax benefits of $4. In 2013, we recognized a $61 benefit, net of tax expense of $28, reflecting the impact of lower gold prices on our estimated future royalty liability. Other comprehensive loss, net of tax was $671 in 2013 and included non-cash adjustments for a $577 net loss in value of marketable securities primarily related to Canadian Oil Sands Trust, Regis Resources Ltd., Paladin Energy, Ltd. and Gabriel Resources Ltd., a $31 net loss on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, a $152 net gain related to pension and other post-retirement benefit adjustments mainly as a result of changes in actuarial estimates, and a $215 net loss on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges due mainly to foreign currency hedge losses. Other comprehensive income, net of tax was $161 in 2012 and included non-cash adjustments for a $164 net loss in value of marketable securities primarily related to Canadian Oil Sands Trust and Gabriel Resources Ltd., partially offset by gains related to Regis Resources Ltd., a $14 net gain on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, a $51 net loss related to pension and other post-retirement benefit adjustments primarily as a result of utilizing a lower discount rate, and a $40 net gain on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges due mainly to foreign currency hedge gains. Other comprehensive income, net of tax was $456 in 2011 and included non-cash adjustments for a $195 net gain in value of marketable securities primarily related to Canadian Oil Sands Trust and Gabriel Resources Ltd., a $8 net gain on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, a $60 net loss related to pension and other post-retirement benefit adjustments primarily as a result of utilizing a lower discount rate and lower than expected return on plan assets, and a $209 net loss on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges due mainly to a loss on forward starting swap contracts partially offset by foreign currency hedge gains.

Consolidated copper pounds produced increased 1% due to higher recovery at Batu Hijau partially offset by lower grade milled. Attributable gold ounces produced increased 2% due to higher production from Africa, Tanami, Waihi, and Nevada partially offset by lower production from South America. Higher attributable copper pounds produced also resulted from higher production at Batu Hijau. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated gold ounce sold increased 12% due to stockpile and leach pad write-downs associated with lower gold prices. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated copper pound sold increased 89% due to stockpile write-downs at Batu Hijau and Boddington. 2012 compared to 2011 Consolidated gold ounces produced decreased 5% due to: lower production from Indonesia due to continued Phase 6 waste mining and processing lower grade stockpiles at Batu Hijau; and lower production from Australia / New Zealand due to lower ore availability at Tanami and mine sequencing at Waihi; and lower production from Africa due to lower mill throughput and grade; partially offset by higher production from South America due to higher mill grade and recovery partially offset by lower leach placement; and higher production from North America due to higher throughput at Mill 6, Juniper Mill, and Twin Creeks Autoclave and the startup of the Emigrant mine. Consolidated copper pounds produced decreased 34% due to scheduled Phase 6 waste mining at Batu Hijau, partially offset by higher throughput at Boddington. Attributable gold ounces produced decreased 4% due to lower production from Batu Hijau, Tanami, and Waihi, partially offset by higher production from South America. Lower attributable copper pounds produced also resulted from lower production at Batu Hijau. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated gold ounce sold increased 15% due to lower production from Batu Hijau, Tanami, and Waihi, higher royalty and waste mining costs, partially offset by lower co-product allocation of costs to gold. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated copper pound sold increased 86% due to lower production from Batu Hijau, higher waste mining at Batu Hijau, higher mill maintenance costs at Boddington, coupled with higher co-product allocation of costs to copper. 72 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION North America Operations Gold Ounces Produced Costs Applicable to Sales (1) Amortization All-In Sustaining Costs (3) 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011 (in thousands) ($ per ounce) ($ per ounce) ($ per ounce) Nevada 1,768 1,748 1,738 $ 663 $ 638 $ 603 $ 151 $ 134 $ 160 $ 895 $ 1,040 $ 958 La Herradura (2) 183 212 212 967 621 527 186 101 95 1,601 1,151 995 Total/Weighted-Average 1,951 1,960 1,950 $ 691 $ 636 $ 594 $ 154 $ 130 $ 153 $ 964 $ 1,053 $ 963 Attributable to Newmont 1,951 1,960 1,950 (1) Excludes Amortization and Reclamation and remediation . (2) Our proportionate 44% share. (3) All-In Sustaining Costs is a non-GAAP financial measure. See page 87 for a reconciliation. 2013 compared to 2012 Nevada, USA. Gold ounces produced increased slightly due to higher leach production from Emigrant and Carlin North Area Leach, higher throughput, grade, and recovery at Phoenix as well as higher mill throughput and grade at the Juniper mill. These positive variances were partially offset by lower leach production at Carlin South Area and Lone Tree as well as lower grade and recovery at Mill 5, lower recovery at Mill 6, and lower grade at the Sage mill, and lower mill grade and throughput at Midas. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 4% due to a stockpile and leach pad write-down as a result of lower gold prices, lower capitalization of mine development costs, and lower by-product credits partially offset by lower royalties and higher production. Amortization per ounce increased 13% due to the portion of the stockpile and leach pad write-downs associated with amortization. La Herradura, Mexico. Gold ounces produced decreased 14% due to the suspension of the explosives permit related to a land dispute. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 56% due to the suspension of the explosives permit which also caused a write-down of ore on the leach pads. Amortization per ounce increased 84% due to the portion of the leach pad write-downs associated with amortization. 2012 compared to 2011 Nevada, USA. Gold ounces produced increased slightly due to higher throughput at Mill 6, Juniper Mill, and the Twin Creeks Autoclave as well as new production from Emigrant, partially offset by lower grade at Phoenix and lower throughput and grade at Midas. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 6% due to higher commodity and contractor costs as well as higher royalties. Amortization per ounce decreased 16% due to higher production and longer reserve life. La Herradura, Mexico. Gold ounces produced were unchanged due to new production at Noche Buena, offset by timing of leach recoveries. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 18% due to higher waste tons mined, higher commodity prices and lower by-product credits. Amortization per ounce increased 6% due to additional equipment purchases and the start of Noche Buena production. Gold production for North America in 2014 is expected to decline to approximately 1.6 to 1.7 million ounces as the Carlin and Twin Creeks mines in Nevada enter a temporary period of lower grade due to planned stripping campaigns. Production forecasts also reflect the divestiture of the Midas mine. Costs applicable to sales per ounce are expected to be approximately $720 to $790.

Gold ounces produced increased 2% due to higher throughput and higher recovery. Costs applicable to sales per ounce decreased 9% due to higher production and higher ore tons mined partially offset by higher royalties. Amortization per ounce decreased 4% due to higher ounces sold. Akyem, Ghana. Gold ounces produced of 129,000, Costs applicable to sales per ounce of $248, and Amortization per ounce of $103 are due to the commencement of commercial production in the fourth quarter of 2013. 2012 compared to 2011 Ahafo, Ghana. Gold ounces produced decreased 1% due to lower throughput and lower grade, largely offset by a drawdown of in-circuit inventory. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 26% due to higher labor, commodity and royalty costs. Amortization per ounce increased 3% due to lower ounces sold. Gold production for the Africa operations is expected to increase in 2014 to approximately 785,000 to 850,000 ounces due to a full year of gold production at Akyem. Costs applicable to sales per ounce are expected to be approximately $575 to $625. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Foreign currency exchange rates can increase or decrease profit margins and Costs applicable to sales to the extent costs are paid in foreign currencies. Such fluctuations have not had a material impact on our revenue since gold and copper are sold throughout the world principally in U.S. dollars. Approximately 47%, 51% and 43% of our Costs applicable to sales were paid in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our Costs applicable to sales are most significantly impacted by variations in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate. Variations in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate historically have been strongly correlated to variations in the U.S. dollar gold price over the long-term. Changes in costs at Australian locations due to exchange 77 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION rate changes have therefore tended to be mitigated by changes in sales reported in U.S. dollars at Australian locations. No assurance, however, can be given that the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate will continue to be strongly correlated to the U.S. dollar gold price in the future. Variations in foreign currency exchange rates decreased Costs applicable to sales per ounce $5, net of hedging, in 2013 compared to 2012, and increased Costs applicable to sales per ounce $4, net of hedging, in 2012 from 2011, primarily due to movements in the Australian dollar. We hedge a portion of our forecasted Australian dollar denominated operating expenditures. At December 31, 2013, we have hedged 20%, 18%, 11%, 7% and 4% of our forecasted Australian denominated operating costs in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, at an average rate of 1.00, 0.98, 0.95, 0.93 and 0.92, respectively. Foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on our determination of proven and probable reserves. However, if a sustained weakening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Australian dollar, and/or to other foreign currencies that impact our cost structure, were not mitigated by offsetting increases in the U.S. dollar gold price or by other factors, the amount of proven and probable reserves in the applicable foreign country could be reduced as certain proven and probable reserves may no longer be economic. The extent of any such reduction would be dependent on a variety of factors including the length of time of any such weakening of the U.S. dollar, and management long-term view of the applicable exchange rate. Future reductions of proven and probable reserves would primarily result in reduced gold or copper sales and increased amortization and, depending on the level of reduction, could also result in impairments of property, plant and mine development, mineral interests and/or goodwill.

Facility fees vary based on the credit ratings of the Company senior, uncollateralized, long-term debt. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a market based rate plus a margin determined by the Company credit rating. At December 31, 2013, we had $0 in borrowings outstanding under the facility. There was $173 and $394 outstanding in letters of credit at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In May 2012, the Company Corporate Revolving Credit Facility was amended to increase the capacity to $3,000 and extend the facility one year to 2017. The available capacity under the Corporate Revolving Credit Facility prior to the amendment was $2,500. In September 2013, the Company entered into a Letter of Credit Facility Agreement ( LC Agreement ) with BNP Paribas, New York Branch. The LC Agreement establishes a $175 letter of credit facility for a three year period to support reclamation obligations. Under the LC Agreement, the Company transferred $153 of letters of credit from the Corporate Revolving Credit Facility to the LC Agreement. 82 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION Subsidiary Financings PTNNT Revolving Credit Facility Effective May 27, 2011, PTNNT entered into a $600 reducing revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks. This reducing revolving facility provides for borrowings in U.S. dollars. The facility matures in March 2017. The facility is non-recourse to Newmont and certain assets of PTNNT are pledged as collateral. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 4.00%. Commitment fees currently accrue on the daily average unused amount of the commitment of each lender at an annual rate of 2.00%. A one-time arrangement fee and other debt issuance costs, net of amortization, of $18 related to the facility were capitalized and will be amortized over the term of the debt. There were $555 in borrowings outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2013. Debt Covenants The Company senior notes and revolving credit facilities contain various covenants and default provisions including payment defaults, limitation on liens, leases, sales and leaseback agreements and merger restrictions. The Ahafo project facility contains a financial ratio covenant requiring the Company to maintain a net debt (total debt net of cash and cash equivalents) to EBITDA (earnings before interest expense, income and mining taxes, depreciation and amortization) ratio of less than or equal to 4.0 and a net debt to total capitalization ratio of less than or equal to 62.5%. The corporate revolving credit facility contains a financial ratio covenant requiring the Company to maintain a net debt (total debt net of cash and cash equivalents) to total capitalization ratio of less than or equal to 62.5% in addition to the covenants noted above. Furthermore, the corporate revolving credit facility contains covenants limiting the sale of all or substantially all of the Company assets, certain change of control provisions and a negative pledge on certain assets. The PTNNT revolving credit facility requires PTNNT to maintain certain financial ratios and to comply with certain terms and conditions with regards to its mine plan, contract of work, dividends, financing activities, leasing, investments and other matters. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. Shelf Registration Statement In September 2012, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ) a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 which enables the Company to issue an indeterminate number or amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, guarantees of debt securities and warrants from time to time at indeterminate prices. It also included the resale of an indeterminate amount of common stock, preferred stock and debt securities from time to time upon exercise of warrants or conversion of convertible securities. 83 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations at December 31, 2013 are summarized as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 4 - 5 Years More than 5 Years Debt (1) $ 11,636 $ 877 $ 1,938 $ 1,403 $ 7,418 Capital lease obligations (2) 12 1 4 3 4 Reclamation and remediation obligations (3) 2,336 94 265 209 1,768 Employee-related benefits (4) 659 80 135 106 338 Uncertain income tax liabilities and interest (5) 47 47 Operating leases 61 12 28 16 5 Minimum royalty payments 488 30 95 85 278 Purchase obligations (6) 731 285 143 74 229 Other (7) 850 287 335 83 145 $ 16,820 $ 1,666 $ 2,943 $ 1,979 $ 10,232 (1) Amounts represent principal of $6,863 and estimated interest payments of $4,773, assuming no early extinguishment. (2) Amounts represent principal of $10 and estimated interest payments of $2. (3) Mining operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Pursuant to environmental regulations, we are required to close our operations and reclaim and remediate the lands that operations have disturbed. The estimated undiscounted cash outflows of these reclamation and remediation obligations are reflected here. For more information regarding reclamation and remediation liabilities, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (4) Contractual obligations for Employee-related benefits include severance, workers participation, pension and other benefit plans. Pension plan benefit payments beyond 2018 cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions and actuarial assumptions and are not included. (5) We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of our uncertain income tax liabilities and interest payments beyond 2014 due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions. (6) Purchase obligations are not recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations represent contractual obligations for purchase of power, materials and supplies, consumables, inventories and capital projects. (7) Other includes accrued Boddington contingent consideration of $10, the accrued Holt royalty of $134 and other obligations which are not reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements including labor and service contracts. Payments related to derivative contracts cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have the following off-balance sheet arrangements: operating leases (as disclosed in the above table) and $1,807 of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees (see Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 84 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION We also have sales agreements to sell copper and gold concentrates at market prices as follows (in thousands of tons): 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Thereafter Batu Hijau 529 Boddington 187 154 165 165 165 Nevada 48 41 71 764 195 236 165 165 For information regarding these copper sales agreements, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Hedging, Provisional Copper and Gold Sales, below. Other Liquidity Matters At December 31, 2013, the Company had $1,555 in cash and cash equivalents, of which $1,108 was held in foreign subsidiaries and is primarily held in U.S. dollar denominated accounts with the remainder in foreign currencies readily convertible to U.S. dollars. At December 31, 2013, $411 of the consolidated cash and cash equivalents was attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily related to our Indonesian and Peruvian operations which is being held to fund those operations. At December 31, 2013, $284 in consolidated cash and cash equivalents ($159 attributable to Newmont) was held at certain foreign subsidiaries that, if repatriated may be subject to withholding taxes, which would generate foreign tax credits in the U.S. As a result, we expect that there would be minimal U.S. tax liability upon repatriation of these amounts after considering available foreign tax credits. All other amounts represent earnings that are taxed in the U.S. on a current basis due to being held in U.S. subsidiaries or non-U.S. subsidiaries that are flow-through entities for U.S. tax purposes. We believe that our liquidity and capital resources are adequate to fund our operations and corporate activities. Future Cash Flows We anticipate significant future capital expenditures, funding of exploration and advanced projects, debt repayments and dividends to both common shareholders and noncontrolling interests will impact Net cash used in investing activities and Net cash used in financing activities and may exceed Net cash provided by operations . Effective February 19, 2014, the Company received commitments for a new uncollateralized $575 amortizing term loan with a syndicate of commercial banks. This new credit facility will provide for borrowings in U.S. dollars and will mature five years from the date of funding. Facility fees will vary based on the credit ratings of the Company senior, uncollateralized, long-term debt. Borrowings under the facility will bear interest at a market based rate plus a margin determined by the Company credit rating. Proceeds from the term loan are expected to be used to re-finance the $575 of maturing convertible debt in July 2014. Our ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices as well as our operational performance, current cash flow and debt position, among other factors. We may determine that it is necessary or appropriate to issue additional equity or other securities, defer projects or sell assets. Additional financing may not be available when needed or, if available, the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and, if raised by offering equity securities, may involve substantial dilution to existing stockholders. In the event of lower gold and copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or new funding limitations, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business activities, retire or service all outstanding debt 85 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION and pay dividends could be significantly constrained. For information on our long-term debt, capital lease obligations and operating leases, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash flows are expected to be impacted by variations in the realized prices of gold and copper. For information on the sensitivity of our Net cash provided by operations to metal prices, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Metal Prices. Cash flows are also expected to be impacted by variations in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar, particularly with respect to the Australian dollar. Accordingly, we have entered into derivative instruments to reduce the volatility of Costs applicable to sales in Australia and New Zealand. For information concerning the sensitivity of our Costs applicable to sales to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, see Results of Consolidated Operations, Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, above. For information on the sensitivity of our Net cash provided from operations to foreign currency exchange rates, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Foreign Currency. Based on expected consolidated production of between 5.0 and 5.4 million ounces (4.6 and 4.9 million attributable ounces) of gold and between 160 and 175 thousand tonnes (95 and 110 thousand attributable tonnes) of copper in 2014, we do not anticipate reasonably expected variations in our production profile alone to influence our ability to pay or refinance our debt and other obligations in 2014. Environmental Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. We have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, $1,432 and $1,341, respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to currently, recently producing or developmental stage mineral properties, of which $66 is classified as a current liability. For more information on the Company reclamation and remediation liabilities, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we are involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former mining activities. Based upon our best estimate of our liability for these matters, $179 and $198 were accrued for such obligations at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We spent $36, $39 and $15 in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, for environmental obligations related to former, primarily historic, mining activities, and have classified $32 as a current liability. Expenditures for 2013 relate primarily to the Dawn mill site in Washington State, the Con mine in Canada which was acquired as part of the Miramar acquisition and Resurrection, a mine site in Leadville, Colorado. Expenditures for 2012 related primarily to the Con mine, the San Luis property in Colorado, the Mt. Leyshon property in Australia, which is a legacy Normandy site, and Resurrection. Expenditures for 2011 related primarily to the Con mine, the Mt. Leyshon property, and the Dawn mill site. For more information on the Company obligations associated with former mining activities, see Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Included in capital expenditures were $94, $207 and $172 in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, to comply with environmental regulations. Ongoing costs to comply with environmental regulations have not been a significant component of Costs applicable to sales . Forward-Looking Statements The foregoing discussion and analysis, as well as certain information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby. See the discussion in Forward-Looking Statements in Item 1, Business. 86 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION Non-GAAP Financial Measures Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted net income (loss) Management of the Company uses Adjusted net income (loss) to evaluate the Company operating performance, and for planning and forecasting future business operations. The Company believes the use of Adjusted net income (loss) allows investors and analysts to compare results of the continuing operations of the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries relating to the production and sale of minerals to similar operating results of other mining companies, by excluding exceptional or unusual items. Management determination of the components of Adjusted net income (loss) are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts. Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders is reconciled to Adjusted net income (loss) as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders $ (2,462 ) $ 1,809 $ 366 Loss (income) from discontinued operations (61 ) 76 136 Impairments 2,875 80 1,766 Tax valuation allowance 535 Asset Sales (246 ) (90 ) (52 ) TMAC transaction costs 30 Boddington contingent consideration (gain) loss (12 ) 8 1 Acquisition costs 18 Restructuring and other 36 26 Income tax benefit from internal restructuring (59 ) (65 ) Adjusted net income $ 695 $ 1,850 $ 2,170 Adjusted net income per share, basic $ 1.40 $ 3.73 $ 4.39 Adjusted net income per share, diluted $ 1.40 $ 3.71 $ 4.31 Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders for 2013, 2012, and 2011 were impacted by stockpile and leach pad write-downs of $547, $17 and $1, respectively, net of tax and minority interest, which are not adjusted in the table above. Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are calculated by dividing the costs applicable to sales of gold and copper by gold ounces or copper pounds sold, respectively. These measures are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented on both a consolidated and attributable to Newmont basis. Attributable costs applicable to sales are based on our economic interest in production from our mines. For operations where we hold less than a 100% economic share in the production, we exclude the share of gold or copper production attributable to the noncontrolling interest. We include attributable costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound to provide management, investors and analysts with information with which to compare our performance to other gold producers. Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound statistics are intended 87 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. Net attributable costs applicable to sales per ounce measures the benefit of copper produced in conjunction with gold, as a credit against the cost of producing gold. A number of other gold producers present their costs net of the contribution from copper and other non-gold sales. We believe that including a measure on this basis provides management, investors and analysts with information with which to compare our performance to other gold producers, and to better assess the overall performance of our business. In addition, this measure provides information to enable investors and analysts to understand the importance of non-gold revenues to our cost structure. The following tables reconcile these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound Gold (1) Copper (2) Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011 Costs applicable to sales: Consolidated per financial statements $ 4,176 $ 3,703 $ 3,440 $ 1,010 $ 535 $ 450 Noncontrolling interests (3) (377 ) (362 ) (442 ) (420 ) (198 ) (171 ) Attributable to Newmont $ 3,799 $ 3,341 $ 2,998 $ 590 $ 337 $ 279 Gold/Copper sold (thousand ounces/million pounds): Consolidated 5,489 5,466 5,820 229 229 356 Noncontrolling interests (3) (521 ) (679 ) (795 ) (81 ) (84 ) (153 ) Attributable to Newmont (4) 4,968 4,787 5,025 148 145 203 Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound: Consolidated $ 761 $ 677 $ 591 $ 4.42 $ 2.34 $ 1.26 Attributable to Newmont $ 765 $ 698 $ 597 $ 4.00 $ 2.33 $ 1.37 (1) Consolidated Costs applicable to sales per financial statements includes by-product credits of $198, $231 and $291 for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

All-In Sustaining Costs Newmont has worked to develop a metric that expands on GAAP measures such as cost of goods sold and non-GAAP measures to provide visibility into the economics of our gold mining operations related to expenditures, operating performance and the ability to generate cash flow from operations. Current GAAP-measures used in the gold industry, such as cost of goods sold, do not capture all of the expenditures incurred to discover, develop, and sustain gold production. Therefore, we believe that All-in sustaining costs and attributable All-in sustaining costs are non-GAAP measures that provide additional information to management, investors, and analysts that aid in the understanding of the economics of our operations and performance compared to other gold producers and in the investor visibility by better defining the total costs associated with producing gold. All-in sustaining cost ( AISC ) amounts are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently as a result of differences in the underlying accounting principles, policies applied and in accounting frameworks such as in International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ), or by reflecting the benefit from selling non-gold metals as a reduction to AISC. Differences may also arise related to definitional differences of sustaining versus development capital activities based upon each company internal policies. The following disclosure provides information regarding the adjustments made in determining the All-in sustaining costs measure: Cost Applicable to Sales Includes all direct and indirect costs related to current gold production incurred to execute the current mine plan. Costs Applicable to Sales ( CAS ) includes by-product credits from certain metals obtained during the process of extracting and processing the primary ore-body. CAS is accounted for on an accrual basis and excludes Amortization and Reclamation and remediation , which is consistent with our presentation of CAS on the Statement of Consolidated Income. In determining All-in sustaining costs, only the CAS associated with producing and selling an ounce of gold is included in the measure. Therefore, the amount of gold CAS included in AISC is 89 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION derived from the CAS presented in the Company Statement of Consolidated Income less the amount of CAS attributable to the production of copper at our Boddington and Batu Hijau mines. The copper CAS at those mine sites is disclosed in Note 3 Segments that accompanies the Consolidated Financial Statements. The allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Boddington and Batu Hijau mines is based upon the relative sales percentage of copper and gold sold during the period. Remediation Costs Includes accretion expense related to asset retirement obligations ( ARO ) and the amortization of the related Asset Retirement Cost ( ARC ) for the Company operating properties recorded as an ARC asset. Accretion related to ARO and the amortization of the ARC assets for reclamation and remediation do not reflect annual cash outflows but are calculated in accordance with GAAP. The accretion and amortization reflect the periodic costs of reclamation and remediation associated with current gold production and are therefore included in the measure. The allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Boddington and Batu Hijau mines. Advanced Projects and Exploration Includes incurred expenses related to projects that are designed to increase or enhance current gold production and gold exploration. We note that as current resources are depleted, exploration and advance projects are necessary for us to replace the depleting reserves or enhance the recovery and processing of the current reserves. As this relates to sustaining our gold production, and is considered a continuing cost of a mining company, these costs are included in the AISC measure. These costs are derived from the Advanced projects, research and development and Exploration amounts presented in the Company Statement of Consolidated Income less the amount attributable to the production of copper at our Boddington and Batu Hijau mines. The allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Boddington and Batu Hijau mines. General and Administrative Includes cost related to administrative tasks not directly related to current gold production, but rather related to support our corporate structure and fulfilling our obligations to operate as a public company. Including these expenses in the AISC metric provides visibility of the impact that general and administrative activities have on current operations and profitability on a per ounce basis. Other Expense, net Includes costs related to regional administration and community development to support current gold production. We exclude certain exceptional or unusual expenses from Other expense, net , such as restructuring, as these are not indicative to sustaining our current gold operations. Furthermore, this adjustment to Other expense, net is also consistent with the nature of the adjustments made to Net income (loss) as disclosed in the Company non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted net income (loss). The allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Boddington and Batu Hijau mines. Treatment and Refining Costs Includes costs paid to smelters for treatment and refining of our concentrates to produce the salable precious metal. These costs are presented net as a reduction of Sales. Sustaining Capital We determined sustaining capital as those capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain current gold production and execute the current mine plan. Capital expenditures to develop new operations, or related to projects at existing operations where these projects will enhance gold production or reserves, are considered development. We determined the breakout of sustaining and development capital costs based on a systematic review of our project portfolio in light of the nature of each project. Sustaining capital costs are relevant to the AISC metric as these are needed to maintain the Company current gold operations and provide improved transparency related to our ability to finance these expenditures from current operations. The allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Boddington and Batu Hijau mines. 90 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION Years Ended December 31, 2013 Costs Applicable to Sales (1)(2)(3) Remediation Costs (4) Advanced Projects and Exploration (5) General and Administrative Other Expense, Net (6) Treatment and Refining Costs Sustaining Capital (7)(8) All-In Sustaining Costs Ounces Sold (000) (9) All-In Sustaining Costs per ounce Nevada $ 1,164 $ 15 $ 94 $ $ 17 $ 23 $ 258 $ 1,571 1,756 $ 895 La Herradura 177 42 74 293 183 1,601 Other North America 4 1 1 6 North America 1,341 15 140 18 23 333 1,870 1,939 964 Yanacocha 663 90 41 63 148 1,005 1,022 983 Conga 24 3 27 Other South America 22 1 23 South America 663 90 87 67 148 1,055 1,022 1,032 Attributable to Newmont 553 525 1,053 Boddington 805 6 1 2 4 90 908 743 1,222 Other Australia/ New Zealand 921 26 39 41 166 1,193 1,044 1,143 Australia/ New Zealand 1,726 32 40 43 4 256 2,101 1,787 1,176 Batu Hijau 107 2 2 3 5 12 131 46 2,848 Other Indonesia (2 ) (2 ) Indonesia 107 2 2 1 5 12 129 46 2,804 Attributable to Newmont 62 22 2,818 Ahafo 307 3 51 24 109 494 566 873 Akyem 32 7 3 42 129 326 Other Africa 13 13 Africa 339 3 71 27 109 549 695 790 Corporate and Other 117 203 25 12 357 Consolidated $ 4,176 $ 142 $ 457 $ 203 $ 181 $ 32 $ 870 $ 6,061 5,489 $ 1,104 Attributable to Newmont $ 5,492 4,968 $ 1,105 (1) Excludes Amortization and Reclamation and remediation .

These measures are calculated by subtracting the costs applicable to sales per ounce of gold and per pound of copper from the average realized gold price per ounce and copper price per pound, respectively. These measures are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented on a consolidated basis. Operating margin per ounce/pound statistics are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. Operating margin per ounce/pound is calculated as follows: Gold Copper Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011 Average realized price per ounce/pound $ 1,393 $ 1,662 $ 1,562 $ 2.96 $ 3.43 $ 3.54 Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound (761 ) (677 ) (591 ) (4.42 ) (2.34 ) (1.26 ) $ 632 $ 985 $ 971 $ (1.46 ) $ 1.09 $ 2.28
