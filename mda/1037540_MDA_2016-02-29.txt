Item 7 Additional disclosure about market risk is incorporated herein by reference from Table of Contents 101 Our use of derivative instruments also involves certain additional risks such as counterparty credit risk, the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract. We believe that there is a low likelihood that these counterparties will fail to meet our obligations and we minimize our exposure by limiting counterparties to major banks who meet established credit and capital guidelines. There can be no assurance that we will adequately protect against the foregoing risks. In addition, our 767 Fifth Partners LLC consolidated entity (the entity in which we have a 60% interest and that owns 767 Fifth Avenue (the General Motors Building) in New York City) entered into forward-starting interest rate swap contracts, including two contracts entered into subsequent to December 31, 2015, which fix the 10-year swap rate at a weighted-average rate of approximately 2.619% per annum on notional amounts aggregating $450.0 million. These interest rate swap contracts were entered into in advance of a financing with a target commencement date in June 2017 and maturity in June 2027. Our 767 Fifth Partners LLC consolidated entity entered into the interest rate swap contracts designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges to reduce its exposure to the variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in the 10-year swap rate in contemplation of obtaining 10-year fixed-rate financing in June 2017 (See Notes 7 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). On February 19, 2015, BPLP commenced a planned interest rate hedging program. To date, BPLP has entered into forward-starting interest rate swap contracts which fix the 10-year swap rate at a weighted-average rate of approximately 2.423% per annum on notional amounts aggregating $550.0 million. The interest rate swap contracts were entered into in advance of a financing by BPLP with a target commencement date in September 2016 and maturity in September 2026. BPLP entered into the interest rate swap contracts designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges to reduce its exposure to the variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in the 10-year swap rate in contemplation of obtaining 10-year fixed-rate financing in September 2016.
