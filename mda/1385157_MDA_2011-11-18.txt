ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Information." Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in United States Dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). Organic net sales growth and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures which are discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, together with GAAP financial measures, provide useful information to investors because they reflect the financial measures that management uses in evaluating the underlying results of our operations. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for more information about these non-GAAP financial measures, including our reasons for including the measures and material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measures. The Separation Tyco Electronics Ltd. was incorporated in Bermuda in fiscal 2000 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of then Bermuda-based Tyco International. Effective June 29, 2007, we became the parent company of the former electronics businesses of Tyco International. On June 29, 2007, Tyco International distributed all of our shares, as well as its shares of its former healthcare businesses, to its common shareholders. 34 Table of Contents Change of Domicile Effective June 25, 2009, we discontinued our existence as a Bermuda company as provided in the Bermuda Companies Act, and, in accordance with article 161 of the Swiss Federal Code on International Private Law, continued our existence as a Swiss corporation under articles 620 et seq. of the Swiss Code of Obligations (the "Change of Domicile"). The rights of holders of our shares are governed by Swiss law, our Swiss articles of association, and our Swiss organizational regulations. Company Name Change In March 2011, our shareholders approved an amendment to our articles of association to change our name from "Tyco Electronics Ltd." to "TE Connectivity Ltd." The name change was effective March 10, 2011. Our ticker symbol "TEL" on the New York Stock Exchange remained unchanged. Overview We are a global company that designs and manufactures approximately 500,000 products that connect and protect the flow of power and data inside millions of products used by consumers and industries. We partner with customers in a broad array of industries from consumer electronics, energy, and healthcare to automotive, aerospace, and communication networks. We operate through three reporting segments: Transportation Solutions, Communications and Industrial Solutions, and Network Solutions. See Notes 1 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our segments. We service our customers primarily through our direct sales force that serves customers in over 150 countries. The sales force is supported by approximately 7,500 engineers as well as globally deployed manufacturing sites. Through our sales force and engineering resources, we are able to collaborate with our customers throughout the world to provide highly engineered products and solutions to meet their needs. Our strategic objective is to increase our net sales and profitability across our segments in the markets we serve. This strategy is dependent upon the following strategic priorities: Deliver extraordinary customer service; Strengthen our innovation leadership; Extend our leadership in emerging markets; Lead in smart connectivity; and Supplement organic growth with strategic partnerships and acquisitions. Outlook Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions. Our sales are dependent on certain industry end markets that are impacted by consumer as well as industrial and infrastructure spending, and our operating results can be affected by changes in demand in those markets. Overall, our net sales increased 18.6% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2010, our net sales increased 17.7% as compared to fiscal 2009. Our sales into consumer based markets, particularly in the automotive end market in the Transportation Solutions segment, have improved relative to fiscal 2010. Also, in industrial and infrastructure based markets, our sales in the telecom networks, energy, enterprise networks, aerospace, defense, and marine, industrial, touch solutions, and data communications end markets have improved over prior year levels due to increased capital spending by industry and governments. These improvements were partially offset by declines in the subsea communications and consumer devices end markets. Fiscal 2011 included an 35 Table of Contents additional week which contributed $277 million in net sales and $0.08 per share to diluted earnings per share. ADC, which was acquired on December 8, 2010, contributed net sales of $964 million, of which $26 million related to the additional week, during fiscal 2011. The earthquake and subsequent tsunami and aftershocks in Japan in March 2011 caused disruptions in our customers' operations and the supply chains that support their operations. We estimate that net sales and diluted earnings per share were negatively impacted by $99 million and $0.07 per share, respectively, in fiscal 2011. Our facilities in Japan were not materially damaged. We do not expect any further impact in fiscal 2012. Net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 are expected to be between $3.4 and $3.5 billion, reflecting growth in the Transportation Solutions segment, particularly in the automotive end market, and increased sales in the Network Solutions segment due to the acquisition of ADC. These increases are expected to be partially offset by weakness in the Communications and Industrial Solutions segment as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2011. In the first fiscal quarter of 2012, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.66 to $0.70 per share. For fiscal 2012, we expect net sales to be between $14.3 and $14.9 billion and diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.00 to $3.30 per share. This outlook assumes current foreign exchange and commodity rates. We are monitoring the current environment and its potential effects on our customers and on the end markets we serve. Additionally, we continue to closely manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions. We are also managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund our future capital needs. (See further discussion in "Liquidity and Capital Resources.") Acquisitions In July 2010, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") to acquire 100% of the outstanding stock of ADC, a provider of broadband communications network connectivity products and related solutions. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we commenced a tender offer through a subsidiary to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of ADC common stock at a purchase price of $12.75 per share in cash followed by a merger of the subsidiary with and into ADC, with ADC surviving as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary. On December 8, 2010, we acquired 86.8% of the outstanding common shares of ADC. On December 9, 2010, we exercised our option under the Merger Agreement to purchase additional shares from ADC that, when combined with the shares purchased in the tender offer, were sufficient to give us ownership of more than 90% of the outstanding ADC common shares. On December 9, 2010, upon effecting a short-form merger under Minnesota law, we owned 100% of the outstanding shares of ADC for a total purchase price of approximately $1,263 million in cash (excluding cash acquired of $546 million) and $22 million representing the fair value of ADC share-based awards exchanged for TE Connectivity share options and stock appreciation rights. The acquisition was made to accelerate our growth potential in the global broadband connectivity market. The combined organization offers a complete product portfolio across every major geographic market. It also added ADC's Distributed Antenna System products, which expanded our wireless connectivity portfolio to provide greater mobile coverage and capacity solutions to carrier and enterprise customers as demand for mobile data continues to expand. We have realized and expect additional cost savings and other synergies through operational efficiencies including the consolidation of manufacturing, marketing, and general and administrative functions. ADC's businesses are reported as part of the Network Solutions segment from the date of acquisition. During the period from December 9, 2010 to September 30, 2011, ADC contributed net sales of $964 million and an operating loss of $59 million to our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The operating loss included restructuring charges of $82 million, charges of $41 million associated with the 36 Table of Contents amortization of acquisition accounting-related fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and customer order backlog, integration costs of $10 million, and acquisition costs of $9 million. In January 2010, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Sensitive Object, an early-stage software company engaged in developing touch-enabling technology focused on computers, mobile devices, and consumer electronics, for a purchase price of approximately $61 million in cash (net of cash acquired of $6 million), including contingent consideration of $6 million paid in fiscal 2011. The Sensitive Object acquisition complements our existing Touch Solutions business, which is primarily focused on commercial and industrial markets. Sensitive Object is reported as part of the Communications and Industrial Solutions segment from the date of acquisition. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions. Acquisition Related Restructuring During fiscal 2011, we initiated a restructuring plan associated with the integration of ADC, which is expected to generate cost efficiencies in our consolidated operations. As discussed above, in fiscal 2011, we recorded charges of $82 million related to this plan. Cash spending related to this plan was $55 million in fiscal 2011. We expect total cash spending, which will be funded with cash from operations, to be approximately $27 million in fiscal 2012. Annualized cost savings related to these actions are expected to be approximately $100 million, of which approximately 40% was realized in fiscal 2011 with the remaining 60% to be realized in fiscal 2012. Cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses. Manufacturing Simplification and Cost Actions due to Current Economic Conditions We plan to continue to simplify our global manufacturing footprint by migrating facilities from higher-cost to lower-cost countries, consolidating within countries, and transferring product lines to lower-cost countries. These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for profitability growth in the years ahead. In connection with our manufacturing simplification plan and in response to economic conditions, we incurred restructuring charges of approximately $67 million during fiscal 2011 and expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $60 million during fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2011, cash spending related to restructuring was $67 million. We expect total spending, which will be funded with cash from operations, to be approximately $111 million in fiscal 2012. Divestitures During fiscal 2010, we sold our mechatronics business for net cash proceeds of $3 million. This business designed and manufactured customer-specific components, primarily for the automotive industry, and generated sales of approximately $100 million in fiscal 2010. In connection with the sale, we recorded a pre-tax loss on sale of $41 million in fiscal 2010. Also, in fiscal 2010, we completed the sale of the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line which was part of our energy business in the Network Solutions segment for net cash proceeds of $12 million. In connection with the divestiture, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge related to long-lived assets and a pre-tax loss on sale totaling $13 million in fiscal 2010. Also, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $12 million in fiscal 2009 to write the carrying value of the assets and liabilities down to fair value. The Dulmison connectors and fittings product line generated sales of approximately $50 million in fiscal 2009. 37 Table of Contents During fiscal 2009, we completed the sale of the Battery Systems business, which was part of the Communications and Industrial Solutions segment, for net cash proceeds of $14 million after working capital adjustments. The divestiture resulted in a pre-tax loss on sale of $7 million in fiscal 2009. The loss on divestitures and impairment charges are presented in restructuring and other charges, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We have presented the loss on divestitures, related long-lived asset impairments, and operations of the mechatronics business, Dulmison connectors and fittings product line, and Battery Systems business in continuing operations due to immateriality. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the divestitures. Discontinued Operations In fiscal 2010, we recorded income from discontinued operations of $44 million primarily in connection with the favorable resolution of certain litigation contingencies related to the Printed Circuit Group business which was sold in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2009, we completed the sale of the Wireless Systems business for $664 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a pre-tax gain of $59 million on the transaction. Also, in fiscal 2009, we received additional cash proceeds of $29 million and recognized an additional pre-tax gain on sale of $4 million in connection with the finalization of working capital adjustments related to the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses which were sold in fiscal 2008. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations. We have completed the divestiture of underperforming or non-strategic businesses and product lines that we began over four years ago; however, we continue to evaluate specific businesses and products which may result in additional divestitures. Results of Operations Consolidated Operations Key business factors that influenced our results of operations for the periods discussed in this report include: Raw material prices. We purchased approximately 169 million pounds of copper, 168,000 troy ounces of gold, and 3.5 million troy ounces of silver in fiscal 2011. Prices have increased in recent years and continue to fluctuate. The following table sets forth the average prices incurred related to copper, gold, and silver during fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009: Fiscal Measure 2011 2010 2009 Copper Lb. $ 3.99 $ 3.15 $ 2.75 Gold Troy oz. $ 1,382 $ 1,114 $ 878 Silver Troy oz. $ 30.27 $ 17.91 $ 12.81 In fiscal 2012, we expect to purchase approximately 177 million pounds of copper, 167,000 troy ounces of gold, and 3.5 million troy ounces of silver. Foreign exchange. Approximately 55% of our net sales are invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. Dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. Dollars at the end 38 Table of Contents of each fiscal period. The percentage of net sales in fiscal 2011 by major currencies invoiced was as follows: U.S. Dollar 45 % Euro 30 Japanese Yen 8 Chinese Renminbi 5 Korean Won 3 Brazilian Real 2 British Pound Sterling 2 All others 5 Total 100 % The following table sets forth certain items from our Consolidated Statements of Operations and the percentage of net sales that such items represent for the periods shown.

Net sales increased $2,242 million, or 18.6%, to $14,312 million in fiscal 2011 from $12,070 million in fiscal 2010. On an organic basis, net sales increased $749 million, or 6.2%, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of growth in the Transportation Solutions segment. Price erosion adversely affected organic sales by $192 million in fiscal 2011. Foreign currency 39 Table of Contents exchange rates positively impacted net sales by $394 million, or 3.3%, in fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2011 included an additional week which contributed $277 million in net sales. ADC, which was acquired on December 8, 2010, contributed net sales of $964 million, of which $26 million related to the additional week, during fiscal 2011. The divestitures of the mechatronics business and the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line in fiscal 2010 negatively impacted sales by $116 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Net sales increased $1,814 million, or 17.7%, to $12,070 million in fiscal 2010 from $10,256 million in fiscal 2009. On an organic basis, net sales increased $1,712 million, or 16.7%, in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The increase in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 resulted primarily from strong growth in the Transportation Solutions segment, and, to a lesser degree, the Communications and Industrial Solutions segment. Price erosion adversely affected organic sales by $169 million in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2010, foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted net sales by $188 million, or 1.8%. The divestitures of the Battery Systems business in fiscal 2009 and Dulmison connectors and fittings product line in fiscal 2010 negatively impacted sales by $86 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. See further discussion below under Results of Operations by Segment.

Included in Network Solutions is $26 million related to ADC. Gross Margin. In fiscal 2011, gross margin increased $645 million to $4,422 million from $3,777 million in fiscal 2010. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 30.9% in fiscal 2011 as compared to 31.3% in fiscal 2010. The increase in gross margin was due to the increase in net sales and, to a lesser degree, improved manufacturing productivity and cost reduction benefits from restructuring actions, partially offset by price erosion, increases in material costs, unfavorable product mix, and the impact of the earthquake in Japan. In addition, fiscal 2011 included charges of $41 million associated with the amortization of acquisition accounting-related fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and customer order backlog associated with ADC. In fiscal 2010, gross margin increased $1,241 million to $3,777 million from $2,536 million in fiscal 2009. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 31.3% in fiscal 2010 as compared to 24.7% in fiscal 2009. The increase in gross margin was due primarily to higher sales and improved manufacturing productivity, and to a lesser degree, favorable product mix and cost reductions achieved from restructuring actions implemented during fiscal 2009. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $242 million in fiscal 2011 to $1,780 million from $1,538 million in fiscal 2010. The increase was related primarily to increased selling expenses to support higher sales levels and the acquisition of ADC. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.4% and 12.7% in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $130 million in fiscal 2010 to $1,538 million from $1,408 million in fiscal 2009. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.7% and 13.7% in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Fiscal 2009 results included a net loss 41 Table of Contents of approximately $50 million primarily associated with economic hedges of certain anticipated future transactions and resulting primarily from the devaluation of certain eastern European currencies. Excluding this item, selling, general, and administrative expenses in fiscal 2010 further decreased as a percentage of net sales as compared to fiscal 2009 as a result of increased sales and cost reductions achieved from restructuring actions implemented during fiscal 2009. Acquisition and Integration Costs. In connection with the acquisition of ADC, we incurred acquisition and integration costs of $19 million and $8 million during fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Restructuring and Other Charges, Net. In fiscal 2011, net restructuring and other charges were $149 million as compared to $137 million in fiscal 2010 and $375 million in fiscal 2009. Total charges, including amounts reflected in cost of sales, were $149 million, $134 million, and $373 million in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Fiscal 2011 actions were primarily associated with the acquisition of ADC and related headcount reductions in the Network Solutions segment. Additionally, we increased reductions in force as a result of current economic conditions, primarily in the Communications and Industrial Solutions segment. Fiscal 2010 actions primarily related to headcount reductions in the Transportation Solutions segment. Fiscal 2010 charges included a pre-tax loss on sale of $41 million in the Transportation Solutions segment related to the sale of our mechatronics business, as well as a long-lived asset impairment charge and a loss on sale totaling $13 million related to the divestiture of the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line which was part of the energy business in the Network Solutions segment. Fiscal 2009 actions primarily related to headcount reductions and manufacturing site closures across all segments in response to economic conditions and implementation of our manufacturing simplification plan. Fiscal 2009 charges included a long-lived asset impairment of $14 million in the Network Solutions segment primarily related to the divestiture of the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line and a loss on sale of $7 million related to the sale of the Battery Systems business which was part of the Communications and Industrial Solutions segment. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other charges. Pre-separation Litigation Charges (Income), Net. During fiscal 2010, Tyco International settled the remaining significant securities lawsuit, a class action captioned Stumpf v. Tyco International Ltd., et al. , for $79 million. Pursuant to the sharing formula in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, our share of the settlement amount was $24 million. We had previously established reserves for this case in fiscal 2009. As a result of the settlement of the Stumpf case, we concluded that reserves of $22 million could be released. Accordingly, pursuant to the sharing formula, we recorded income of $7 million during fiscal 2010. As of September 30, 2011, there were no remaining securities lawsuits outstanding. During fiscal 2009, we recorded charges of $144 million for our share of Tyco International's settlements of several securities cases and our portion of the estimated probable loss for the then remaining securities litigation claims, including the Stumpf case, subject to the Separation and Distribution Agreement. See "Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings" and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding pre-separation securities litigation. Impairment of Goodwill. During fiscal 2009, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $2,088 million related to the Automotive reporting unit of the Transportation Solutions segment. Also, in fiscal 2009, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1,459 million in the Communications and 42 Table of Contents Industrial Solutions segment, of which $1,347 million and $112 million related to the Communications and Industrial Solutions and Circuit Protection reporting units, respectively. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the impairment of goodwill. Operating Income (Loss). Operating income was $1,741 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $1,516 million in fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 included an additional week which contributed $53 million of operating income. As discussed above, results for fiscal 2011 included net restructuring and other charges of $149 million, charges of $41 million associated with the amortization of acquisition accounting-related fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and customer order backlog, and acquisition and integration costs of $19 million. Fiscal 2010 results included restructuring and other charges, acquisition and integration costs, and pre-separation litigation income of $134 million, $8 million, and $7 million, respectively. Excluding these items, the increase in operating income resulted from increased sales levels and related gross margin, and, to a lesser degree, a reduction in employee incentive compensation-related expense, the acquisition of ADC, cost reduction benefits from restructuring actions, and improved manufacturing productivity, partially offset by price erosion, increases in material costs, and unfavorable product mix. Operating income was $1,516 million in fiscal 2010 compared to an operating loss of $3,474 million in fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2010 results included restructuring and other charges, acquisition and integration costs, and pre-separation litigation income of $134 million, $8 million, and $7 million, respectively. Fiscal 2009 results included goodwill impairment charges, restructuring and other charges, and pre-separation litigation charges of $3,547 million, $373 million, and $144 million, respectively. In addition, fiscal 2009 results included a net loss of approximately $50 million primarily associated with economic hedges of certain anticipated future transactions and resulting primarily from the devaluation of certain eastern European currencies. Excluding these items, the increase in operating income resulted primarily from higher sales and related gross margins, higher gross margins as a percentage of sales due to favorable product mix, and cost reduction benefits from restructuring actions implemented in fiscal 2009, partially offset by price erosion. Non-Operating Items Other Income (Expense), Net In fiscal 2011, we recorded net other income of $27 million, primarily consisting of income pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien. During fiscal 2011, we recorded other expense of $14 million in connection with the completion of fieldwork and the settlement of certain U.S. tax matters. See additional information in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement. In fiscal 2010, we recorded net other income of $177 million, primarily consisting of income pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien. The income in fiscal 2010 reflects a net increase to the receivable from Tyco International and Covidien primarily related to certain proposed adjustments to prior period income tax returns and related accrued interest, partially offset by a decrease related to the completion of certain non-U.S. audits of prior year income tax returns. In fiscal 2009, we recorded net other expense of $48 million, primarily consisting of $68 million of expense pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien and a $22 million gain on the retirement of debt. The $68 million of expense is attributable to a net reduction of the receivable from Tyco International and Covidien primarily as a result of the settlement 43 Table of Contents of various matters with the IRS. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the gain on retirement of debt. Income Taxes Our operations are conducted through our various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world. We have provided for income taxes based upon the tax laws and rates in the countries in which our operations are conducted and income and loss from operations is subject to taxation. Our effective income tax rate was 23.1% for fiscal 2011 and reflects income tax benefits recognized in connection with profitability in certain entities operating in lower tax rate jurisdictions partially offset by accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions. In addition, the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2011 reflects income tax benefits of $35 million associated with the completion of fieldwork and the settlement of certain U.S. tax matters. Our effective income tax rate was 31.6% for fiscal 2010 and reflects charges of $307 million primarily associated with certain proposed adjustments to prior year income tax returns and related accrued interest partially offset by income tax benefits of $101 million recognized in connection with the completion of certain non-U.S. audits of prior year income tax returns. In addition, the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 reflects an income tax benefit of $72 million recognized in connection with a reduction in the valuation allowance associated with tax loss carryforwards in certain non-U.S. locations. Our effective income tax rate was 15.4% for fiscal 2009 and includes the effects of the $3,547 million pre-tax impairment of goodwill for which a partial tax benefit of $523 million was recorded, a $144 million pre-tax charge related to pre-separation securities litigation for which a partial tax benefit of $25 million was recorded, a $28 million charge related to the settlement of a tax matter, and a $24 million detriment related to a $68 million pre-tax expense recognized pursuant to our Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien. Additionally, the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2009 reflects adjustments related to prior years tax returns, including a $49 million tax benefit. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,930 million and $2,236 million at fiscal year end 2011 and 2010, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss, capital loss, and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740 which require that a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, we recognize liabilities for tax as well as related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate 44 Table of Contents of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, income tax benefits may be recognized. We have provided income taxes for earnings that are currently distributed as well as the taxes associated with several subsidiaries' earnings that are expected to be distributed in fiscal 2012. No additional provision has been made for U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or we have concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. As of September 30, 2011, certain subsidiaries had approximately $17 billion of undistributed earnings that we intend to permanently reinvest. A liability could arise if our intention to permanently reinvest such earnings were to change and amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries. Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes In fiscal 2010, we recorded income from discontinued operations of $44 million primarily in connection with the favorable resolution of certain litigation contingencies related to the Printed Circuit Group business which was sold in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2009, we completed the sale of the Wireless Systems business for $664 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a pre-tax gain of $59 million on the transaction. Also, in fiscal 2009, we received additional cash proceeds of $29 million and recognized an additional pre-tax gain on sale of $4 million in connection with the finalization of working capital adjustments related to the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses which were sold in fiscal 2008. Pre-tax loss from discontinued operations for fiscal 2009 included pre-tax charges of $111 million related to the Wireless Systems business's contract with the State of New York. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the State of New York contract. Income tax expense on discontinued operations for fiscal 2009 included $68 million relating to the impact of $319 million of goodwill written off in connection with the divestiture of the Wireless Systems business, for which a tax benefit was not fully realized, as well as $35 million of unfavorable adjustments to the estimated tax provision on the Power Systems business as a result of the finalization of the tax basis of assets sold upon the filing of the fiscal 2008 income tax returns. The Wireless Systems, Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem, Automotive Radar Sensors, Power Systems, and Printed Circuit Group businesses met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and have been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to reclassification to held for sale and discontinued operations, the Wireless Systems, Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem, and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses were components of the former Wireless Systems segment. The Power Systems and Printed Circuit Group businesses were components of the former Other segment. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations. 45 Table of Contents Results of Operations by Segment Transportation Solutions Fiscal 2011 2010 2009 ($ in millions) Net sales $ 5,629 $ 4,799 $ 3,518 Operating income (loss) $ 848 $ 515 $ (2,254 ) Operating margin 15.1 % 10.7 % NM (1) (1) Not meaningful.

Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Transportation Solutions' net sales increased $830 million, or 17.3%, to $5,629 million in fiscal 2011 from $4,799 million in fiscal 2010. Organic net sales increased by $621 million, or 13.0%, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due primarily to an increase of $562 million in the automotive end market. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies positively affected net sales by $179 million, or 3.7%, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 included an additional week which contributed approximately $112 million in net sales. The divestiture of the mechatronics business in fiscal 2010 negatively impacted sales by $82 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. 46 Table of Contents In the automotive end market, our organic net sales growth was 13.5% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was attributable to growth of 17.9% in the EMEA region, 14.4% in the Americas region, and 7.7% in the Asia-Pacific region. Growth in the EMEA and Americas regions resulted from higher automotive production and increased content per vehicle. Growth in the Asia-Pacific region was negatively impacted by the earthquake in Japan. We estimate that the earthquake in Japan negatively impacted our sales in the automotive end market by $38 million in fiscal 2011. We expect global automotive production in fiscal 2012 to increase to approximately 6% over fiscal 2011 levels. In the aerospace, defense, and marine end market, our organic net sales increased 9.5% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily as a result of increased demand from commercial aircraft builders as they continue to increase production and, in the marine market, as a result of increased oil and gas exploration driven by increasing crude oil prices. Transportation Solutions' operating income increased $333 million to $848 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to $515 million in fiscal 2010. Segment results included $14 million of net credits and $94 million of net charges to restructuring and other charges (credits) in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Excluding these items, the increase in operating income was due to favorable impacts of increased volume and improved manufacturing productivity, partially offset by increases in material costs and price erosion. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Transportation Solutions' net sales increased $1,281 million, or 36.4%, to $4,799 million in fiscal 2010 from $3,518 million in fiscal 2009. Organic net sales increased by $1,173 million, or 33.3%, in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 due primarily to an increase of $1,175 million in the automotive end market. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies positively affected net sales by $108 million, or 3.1%, in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. In the automotive end market, our organic net sales increased 40.4% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The increase was broad-based and resulted from growth of 61.4% in the Asia-Pacific region, 40.1% in the Americas region, and 33.8% in the EMEA region driven by increases in vehicle production and replenishment of inventory in the supply chain across all regions. In the aerospace, defense, and marine end market, our organic net sales decline of 0.8% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was due to weak demand in the marine and commercial aircraft markets, partially offset by growth in the defense market. Transportation Solutions had operating income of $515 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to an operating loss of $2,254 million in fiscal 2009. Segment results included restructuring and other charges of $94 million and $171 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Also, during fiscal 2009, segment results included goodwill impairment charges of $2,088 million and a net foreign currency loss of approximately $17 million associated primarily with economic hedges of certain anticipated future transactions and resulting primarily from the devaluation of certain eastern European currencies. Excluding these items, the increase resulted primarily from increases in sales and higher gross margins as a percentage of sales, as well as cost reduction benefits from restructuring actions implemented in fiscal 2009, and improved manufacturing productivity, partially offset by price erosion. 47 Table of Contents Communications and Industrial Solutions Fiscal 2011 2010 2009 ($ in millions) Net sales $ 5,071 $ 4,820 $ 3,858 Operating income (loss) $ 564 $ 682 $ (1,428 ) Operating margin 11.1 % 14.1 % NM (1) (1) Not meaningful.

Fiscal 2011 included an additional week which contributed approximately $91 million in net sales. The divestiture of the mechatronics business in fiscal 2010 negatively impacted sales by $22 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. In the industrial end market, our organic net sales increased 6.9% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due primarily to strong growth in the industrial machinery market, particularly in the EMEA region, as well as growth in the commercial and building and factory automation markets. In the data communications end market, our organic net sales increased 2.6% in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 due to strength in sales in the server, data storage, and wireless markets, particularly in the EMEA region. In the appliance end market, our organic net sales growth of 3.6% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was due to continued consumer demand in the EMEA region, partially offset by decreases in the Americas region. In the consumer devices end market, our organic net sales decreased 12.0% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due to weaker demand in the mobile phone and consumer electronics markets driven by our platform position, as well as the negative impact of the earthquake in Japan. In the computer end market, our organic net sales decrease of 1.2% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was attributable to soft demand in the personal computer market, partially offset by growth in the tablets and portables markets. In the touch solutions end market, our organic net sales increased 1.8% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 as a result of increased sales in the retail market, particularly in the EMEA region. In fiscal 2011, Communications and Industrial Solutions' operating income decreased $118 million to $564 million from $682 million in fiscal 2010. Segment results included net restructuring and other charges of $76 million and $20 million during fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Excluding these items, the decrease in operating income was attributable to price erosion and increased material costs, partially offset by volume increases and cost reduction benefits associated with restructuring actions. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Communications and Industrial Solutions' net sales increased $962 million, or 24.9%, to $4,820 million in fiscal 2010 from $3,858 million in fiscal 2009. Organic net sales increased $955 million, or 24.7%, during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies positively affected net sales by $54 million, or 1.5%, in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The divestiture of the Battery Systems business in fiscal 2009 negatively impacted sales by $47 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. In the industrial end market, our organic net sales increased 28.7% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 due primarily to increased demand for factory automation and other industrial equipment in all regions, with the highest growth in Asia. In the data communications end market, our organic net sales increased 18.1% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 as a result of an increase in sales of our interconnect components to communication equipment manufacturers. In the appliance end market, our organic net sales growth of 45.6% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was attributable to improved consumer demand across all regions, particularly in Asia. In the consumer devices end market, our organic net sales growth of 20.2% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was due primarily to an increase in sales to mobile phone manufacturers. In the computer end market, our organic net sales growth of 14.5% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 resulted from recovery in emerging markets and rising demand for portables, such as notebook computers. In the touch solutions end market, our organic net sales growth of 16.9% in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 was due to improved demand in North America and Asia, particularly with point-of-sale terminal manufacturers, partially offset by continued weakness in global demand in the gaming markets. 49 Table of Contents Communications and Industrial Solutions had operating income of $682 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to an operating loss of $1,428 million in fiscal 2009. Segment results included net restructuring and other charges of $20 million and $138 million during fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. In fiscal 2009, segment results were negatively impacted by goodwill impairment charges of $1,459 million and a net foreign currency loss of approximately $33 million associated primarily with economic hedges of certain anticipated future transactions and resulting primarily from the devaluation of certain eastern European currencies. Excluding these items, the increase in operating income was due primarily to an increase in gross margin, primarily as a result of the increase in sales, and to a lesser degree, favorable product mix and cost reduction benefits from restructuring actions implemented in fiscal 2009, as well as improved manufacturing productivity.

Organic net sales increased $78 million, or 3.3%, in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies positively impacted net sales by $83 million, or 3.3%, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 included an additional week which contributed approximately $74 million in net sales. The acquisition of ADC increased sales by $964 million, of which $26 million is related to the additional week, during fiscal 2011. The divestiture of the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line in fiscal 2010 negatively impacted sales by $12 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. In the telecom networks end market, our organic net sales increase of 22.6% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was largely due to increased fiber network investment by telecommunications companies, particularly in the EMEA and South America regions. In the energy end market, our organic net sales increased 11.4% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due primarily to a continuing strong recovery across all regions. In the enterprise networks end market, our organic net sales increased 9.7% in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 levels as a result of increased data center investment in the EMEA region, particularly in India, and the Asia-Pacific region. The subsea communications end market's organic net sales decreased 21.4% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 as a result of lower levels of project activity. We expect net sales in fiscal 2012 in the subsea communications end market to be similar to fiscal 2011 levels. Network Solutions' operating income increased $17 million to $329 million in fiscal 2011 from $312 million in fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2011, segment results included $142 million of charges related to the acquisition of ADC, including $82 million of restructuring charges, $41 million of charges associated with the amortization of acquisition accounting-related fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and customer order backlog, and $19 million of acquisition and integration costs. Segment results also included additional net restructuring and other charges of $5 million in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2010, segment results included $20 million of net restructuring and other charges and $8 million of acquisition and integration costs. Excluding these items, operating income increased as a result of the acquisition of ADC and volume increases, partially offset by unfavorable product mix, price erosion, and increased material costs. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 In fiscal 2010, Network Solutions' net sales decreased $429 million, or 14.9%, to $2,451 million from $2,880 million in fiscal 2009. Organic net sales decreased $416 million, or 14.5%, in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies favorably affected net sales by $26 million, or 1.0%, in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The divestiture of the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line negatively impacted net sales by $39 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. In the telecom networks end market, our organic net sales decrease of 2.3% in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 levels was primarily attributable to reduced wireline capital spending by telecommunications companies. In the energy end market, our organic net sales decrease of 1.9% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was due to lower investment levels by utilities and reduced customer inventory levels. In the enterprise networks end market, organic sales increased 7.7% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 as a result of strong economic recoveries in Asia and Europe, while the Americas remained relatively flat. In the subsea communications end market, our organic net sales decreased 37.6% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 due to the completion of certain large projects during fiscal 2009 and lower levels of project activity in fiscal 2010. 51 Table of Contents In fiscal 2010, Network Solutions' operating income decreased $40 million to $312 million from $352 million in fiscal 2009. Segment results included $20 million of net restructuring and other charges and $8 million of acquisition and integration costs in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2009, segment results included $64 million of net restructuring and other charges. Excluding these items, the operating income decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales due to lower levels of project activity in the subsea communications end market, and to a lesser degree, price erosion, partially offset by cost reduction benefits from restructuring actions implemented in fiscal 2009 and improved manufacturing productivity. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our ability to access the capital markets, money markets, or other sources of funding, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements. We believe that cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future. We may use excess cash to reduce our outstanding debt, including through the possible repurchase of our debt in accordance with applicable law, to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program, to pay distributions or dividends on our common shares, or to acquire strategic businesses or product lines. The cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial markets, to respond as necessary to changing conditions. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $1,779 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to $1,679 million in fiscal 2010. The increase of $100 million in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 resulted primarily from higher income levels partially offset by a reduction of accrued and other current liabilities related to employee compensation-related payments, higher income taxes paid, and payments for pre-separation tax matters. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $1,679 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to $1,378 million in fiscal 2009. The increase of $301 million in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 primarily resulted from higher income levels, partially offset by increased working capital to support current business levels. Pension and postretirement benefit contributions in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 were $90 million, $180 million, and $145 million, respectively. These amounts included voluntary pension contributions of $69 million and $61 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively; there were no voluntary contributions in fiscal 2011. We expect pension and postretirement benefit contributions to be $102 million in fiscal 2012, before consideration of voluntary contributions. The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 was $299 million, $156 million, and $121 million, respectively. In fiscal 2011, cash payments related to pre-separation tax matters were $129 million, net of indemnification payments under the Tax Sharing Agreement. We expect to make additional net cash payments of approximately $90 million over the next twelve months related to these matters. These amounts include payments in which we are the primary obligor to the taxing authorities and for which we expect a portion to be reimbursed by Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement as well as indemnification payments to Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement for tax matters where they are the primary obligor to the taxing authorities. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to pre-separation tax matters. 52 Table of Contents In addition to net cash provided by operating activities, we use free cash flow as a useful measure of our cash generation which is free from any significant existing obligation. Free cash flow was $1,392 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to $1,404 million in fiscal 2010 and $1,226 million in fiscal 2009. The decline in free cash flow in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily driven by increases in capital expenditures, partially offset by increases in cash provided by operating activities. The increase in free cash flow in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 was due primarily to increases in cash provided by operating activities. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net cash provided by continuing operating activities, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure. Fiscal 2011 2010 2009 (in millions) Net cash provided by continuing operating activities $ 1,779 $ 1,679 $ 1,378 Capital expenditures (581 ) (385 ) (328 ) Proceeds from sale of property, plant, and equipment 65 16 13 Payments related to pre-separation tax matters, net 129 Pre-separation litigation payments 25 102 Voluntary pension contributions 69 61 Free cash flow $ 1,392 $ 1,404 $ 1,226 Cash Flows from Investing Activities We continue to fund capital expenditures to support new programs and to invest in machinery and our manufacturing facilities to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities. Capital spending increased $196 million in fiscal 2011 to $581 million as compared to $385 million in fiscal 2010. Capital spending was $328 million in fiscal 2009. We expect fiscal 2012 capital spending levels to be approximately 4% to 5% of net sales. During fiscal 2011, we acquired ADC for a total purchase price of approximately $1,263 million in cash (excluding cash acquired of $546 million) and $22 million of other non-cash consideration. Short-term investments acquired in connection with the acquisition of ADC were sold for proceeds of $155 million in fiscal 2011. Certain other assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of ADC were sold for net proceeds of $111 million, of which approximately $106 million was received in fiscal 2011. We also acquired another business for $14 million in cash in fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2010, we acquired Sensitive Object for a purchase price of $61 million (net of cash acquired of $6 million), which includes $6 million of contingent consideration paid in fiscal 2011. Also, we acquired the remaining outstanding equity interests of PlanarMag for $23 million in cash and the forgiveness of an approximate $1 million loan payable. In addition, we acquired certain assets of the Optical Products Group of Zarlink for $15 million in cash. During fiscal 2010, we received net cash proceeds of $3 million and $12 million related to the sale of the mechatronics business and the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line, respectively. In fiscal 2009, we received net cash proceeds of $664 million related to the sale of our Wireless Systems business. Also, in fiscal 2009, we received additional cash proceeds related to working capital of $29 million in connection with the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystems and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses which occurred in fiscal 2008 and $17 million primarily related to the divestiture of the Battery Systems business. 53 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Financing Activities and Capitalization Total debt at fiscal year end 2011 and 2010 was $2,669 million and $2,413 million, respectively. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt. In December 2010, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), our wholly-owned subsidiary, issued $250 million principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due January 15, 2021. The notes were offered and sold pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed on July 1, 2008, as amended on June 26, 2009. Interest on the notes accrues from the issuance date at a rate of 4.875% per year and is payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning July 15, 2011. The notes are TEGSA's unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to payment on an unsecured senior basis by TE Connectivity Ltd. Net proceeds from the issuance were approximately $249 million. In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, in connection with the acquisition of ADC, we assumed $653 million of convertible subordinated notes due 2013, 2015, and 2017. Under the terms of the indentures governing these convertible subordinated notes, following the acquisition of ADC, the right to convert the notes into shares of ADC common stock changed to the right to convert the notes into cash. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the ADC acquisition. In December 2010, our ADC subsidiary commenced offers to purchase $650 million aggregate principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes at par plus accrued interest, pursuant to the terms of the indentures for the notes. The offers to purchase expired in January 2011. Promptly thereafter, $198 million principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes due 2013, $55 million principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes due 2015, and $218 million principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes due 2017 were purchased for an aggregate purchase price of $471 million. All of the convertible subordinated notes purchased by ADC have been cancelled. In March 2011, in connection with an internal reorganization related to the acquisition of ADC, our ADC subsidiary commenced offers to purchase $177 million aggregate principal amount of its convertible subordinated notes due 2015 and 2017 at par plus accrued interest, pursuant to the terms of the indentures for the notes. The offers to purchase expired in April 2011. Promptly thereafter, $81 million principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes due 2015 and $7 million principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes due 2017 were purchased for an aggregate purchase price of $89 million. All of the convertible subordinated notes purchased by ADC have been cancelled. Our debt balance at fiscal year end 2011 included the remaining $90 million of 3.50% convertible subordinated notes due 2015 and $2 million of floating rate convertible subordinated notes due 2013. On June 24, 2011, TEGSA entered into a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility"), with total commitments of $1,500 million, and terminated its then existing five-year senior unsecured credit agreement, which at the time of termination had total commitments of $1,425 million and was scheduled to mature on April 25, 2012. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at September 30, 2011. Also, TEGSA had no borrowings under its then existing facility at September 24, 2010. Borrowings under the Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of TEGSA, (1) the London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") plus an applicable margin based upon the senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating of TEGSA, or (2) an alternate base rate equal to the highest of (i) Deutsche Bank AG New York branch's base rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 1 / 2 of 1%, and (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based upon the senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating of TEGSA. TEGSA is required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 12.5 to 30.0 basis points based upon the amount of the lenders' commitments under the Credit Facility and the applicable credit ratings of TEGSA. 54 Table of Contents The Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the Credit Facility) to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.5 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants. None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations. As of September 30, 2011, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future. During June 2009, TEGSA commenced a tender offer to purchase up to $150 million principal amount of its 6.00% senior notes due 2012, up to $100 million principal amount of its 6.55% senior notes due 2017, and up to $100 million principal amount of its 7.125% senior notes due 2037. On July 7, 2009, the tender offer expired and on July 9, 2009, TEGSA purchased and cancelled $86 million principal amount of its 6.00% senior notes due 2012, $42 million principal amount of its 6.55% senior notes due 2017, and $23 million principal amount of its 7.125% senior notes due 2037 for an aggregate payment of $141 million, plus paid accrued interest through July 7, 2009 of $3 million to the sellers of the notes. As a result of the transaction, in fiscal 2009, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $22 million, which is included in other income, including the write-off of unamortized discounts and fees of $1 million and the recognition of a gain of $12 million associated with terminated interest rate swaps previously designated as fair value hedges. Additionally, as a result of the re-purchase and cancellation, unamortized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income of $3 million related to terminated forward starting interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges were recognized as interest expense. Periodically, TEGSA issues commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 as part of our ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are backed by the Credit Facility. TEGSA made no borrowings during fiscal 2011 and had no commercial paper outstanding at fiscal year end 2011. As of fiscal year end 2010, TEGSA had $100 million of commercial paper outstanding at an interest rate of 0.55%. TEGSA's payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by TE Connectivity Ltd. Neither TE Connectivity Ltd. nor any of its subsidiaries provides a guarantee as to payment obligations under notes issued by ADC prior to its acquisition in December 2010. Payments of common share dividends and cash distributions to shareholders were $296 million, $289 million, and $294 million in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. On June 22, 2009, our shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of our common shares of CHF 0.17 per share. During the quarter ended September 25, 2009, the distribution was paid in U.S. Dollars at a rate of $0.16 per share. This capital reduction reduced the par value of our common shares from CHF 2.60 (equivalent to $2.40) to CHF 2.43 (equivalent to $2.24). In October 2009, our shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of our common shares of CHF 0.34 (equivalent to $0.32) per share, payable in two equal installments in each of the first and second quarters of fiscal 2010. We paid the first and second installments of the distribution at a rate of $0.16 per share each during the quarters ended December 25, 2009 and March 26, 2010. These capital reductions reduced the par value of our common shares from CHF 2.43 (equivalent to $2.24) to CHF 2.09 (equivalent to $1.92). In March 2010, our shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of our common shares of CHF 0.72 (equivalent to $0.64) per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 through the 55 Table of Contents second quarter of fiscal 2011. We paid the first and second installments of the distribution at a rate of $0.16 per share each during the quarters ended June 25, 2010 and September 24, 2010. These capital reductions reduced the par value of our common shares from CHF 2.09 (equivalent to $1.92) to CHF 1.73 (equivalent to $1.60). We paid the third and fourth installments of the distribution at a rate of $0.16 per share each during the quarters ended December 24, 2010 and March 25, 2011. These capital reductions reduced the par value of our common shares from CHF 1.73 (equivalent to $1.60) to CHF 1.37 (equivalent to $1.28). In March 2011, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of CHF 0.68 (equivalent to $0.72) per share out of contributed surplus, payable in four equal quarterly installments beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 through the second quarter of fiscal 2012 to shareholders of record on specified dates in each of the four quarters. We paid the first and second installments of the dividend at a rate of $0.18 per share each during the quarters ended June 24, 2011 and September 30, 2011. In September 2011, our board of directors approved a recommendation to increase the quarterly dividend 17%, from $0.18 to $0.21 per share, for the four fiscal quarters beginning with the third quarter of fiscal 2012. This recommendation will be presented for shareholder approval at our annual general meeting of shareholders in March 2012. This recommendation may be in the form of a cash distribution through a capital reduction in the par value of our common shares. Contributed surplus established during the Change of Domicile for Swiss tax and statutory purposes ("Swiss Contributed Surplus"), subject to certain conditions, is a freely distributable reserve. Upon our implementation of recently enacted Swiss tax law regarding the classification of Swiss Contributed Surplus for Swiss tax and statutory purposes, distributions to shareholders from Swiss Contributed Surplus will be free from withholding tax. We are in discussions with Swiss tax authorities regarding certain administrative aspects of the law related to the classification of Swiss Contributed Surplus for tax and statutory reporting purposes. Should we not be successful in our discussions, we may need to formally enter into an appeal process in order to gain a favorable ruling. Should we not gain favorable resolution, we may be required to make certain statutory reclassifications to Swiss Contributed Surplus that likely will limit our ability to make distributions free of withholding tax in future years and may negatively impact our ability to repurchase our shares in future years. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During fiscal 2011, our board of directors authorized a total increase in the share repurchase authorization of $2,250 million, of which $750 million was authorized in the first quarter and $1,500 million was authorized in the fourth quarter. We purchased approximately 25 million of our common shares for $867 million, approximately 18 million of our common shares for $488 million, and approximately 6 million of our common shares for $125 million during fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. At September 30, 2011, we had $1,501 million of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization. 56 Table of Contents Commitments and Contingencies The following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non-cancelable leases, and other obligations at fiscal year end 2011. Payments due by fiscal year Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 There- after (in millions) Long-term debt, including current maturities $ 2,669 $ 1 $ 719 $ 379 $ 90 $ $ 1,480 Interest on long-term debt (1) 1,448 160 139 106 96 92 855 Operating leases 469 127 100 78 60 29 75 Purchase obligations (2) 162 155 5 2 Total contractual cash obligations (3)(4)(5) $ 4,748 $ 443 $ 963 $ 565 $ 246 $ 121 $ 2,410 (1) Interest payments exclude the impact of our interest rate swaps. (2) Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of goods and services. (3) The table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $1,783 million and related accrued interest and penalties of $1,287 million, the timing of which is uncertain. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits, interest, and penalties. (4) The table above does not reflect pension and postretirement benefit obligations to certain employees and former employees. We are obligated to make contributions to our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans; however, we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type, including timing, interest rate charges, investment performance, and amounts of benefit payments. We expect to contribute $102 million to pension and postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2012, before consideration of voluntary contributions. These plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments are more fully described in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (5) Other long-term liabilities of $511 million, of which $228 million related to our ASC 460 guarantee liabilities, are excluded from the table above as we are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding ASC 460. Income Tax Matters In connection with the separation, we entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs our, Covidien's, and Tyco International's respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes, including ordinary course of business taxes and taxes, if any, incurred as a result of any failure of the distribution of all of our shares or the shares of Covidien to qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-offs to qualify for tax-favored treatment under the Code. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, upon separation, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. Under these agreements, principally the Tax Sharing Agreement, we, Tyco International, and Covidien share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters of Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify us for 69% of certain liabilities settled in cash by us with respect to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we have made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. If any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties' 57 Table of Contents obligation. We are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. In addition, Tyco International and Covidien are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. In September 2011, Tyco International announced its intention to spin-off two of its businesses to its shareholders, with Tyco International remaining as a publicly-traded company. Although these transactions are in preliminary stages, we expect that Tyco International will continue to meet its legal obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement. Prior to separation, certain of our subsidiaries filed combined tax returns with Tyco International. Those and other of our subsidiaries' income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. Tyco International, as the U.S. income tax audit controlling party under the Tax Sharing Agreement, is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that management has assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, which relate specifically to our entities, have been recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we may be required to fund portions of Covidien and Tyco International's tax obligations. Estimates about these guarantees have also been recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In prior years, in connection with the IRS audit of various fiscal years, Tyco International submitted to the IRS proposed adjustments to prior period U.S. federal income tax returns resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed. The IRS accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments for fiscal 1997 through 2000 for which the IRS had completed its field work. On the basis of previously accepted amendments, we have determined that acceptance of adjustments presented for additional periods through fiscal 2006 is more likely than not to be accepted and, accordingly, have recorded them, as well as the impacts of the adjustments accepted by the IRS, on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In fiscal 2009, certain proposed adjustments to U.S. federal income tax returns were completed by Tyco International and in connection with these adjustments, we recorded a $97 million increase in income tax liabilities, a $10 million increase in deferred tax assets, a $60 million increase in the receivable from Tyco International and Covidien in connection with the Tax Sharing Agreement, and a $27 million charge to contributed surplus. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the indemnification liability to Tyco International and Covidien. As our tax return positions continue to be updated for periods prior to separation, additional adjustments may be identified and recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements. While the final adjustments cannot be determined until the income tax return amendment process is completed and accepted by the IRS, we believe that any resulting adjustments will not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Additionally, adjustments may be recorded to equity in the future for the impact of filing final or amended income tax returns in certain jurisdictions where those returns include a combination of Tyco International, Covidien, and/or our subsidiaries for the periods prior to the separation. During fiscal 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco International's U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and issued Revenue Agent Reports which reflect the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 1997 through 2000 period. Tyco International has appealed certain proposed adjustments totaling approximately $1 billion. Additionally, the IRS proposed civil fraud penalties against Tyco International arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers of stock in 1998 and 1999. Based upon statutory guidelines, Tyco International estimates the proposed penalties could range between $30 million and $50 million. The penalty is asserted against a prior subsidiary of Tyco International that 58 Table of Contents was distributed to us in connection with the separation. Any penalty ultimately imposed upon our subsidiary would be subject to sharing with Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement. It is our understanding that Tyco International continues to make progress towards resolving a substantial number of the proposed tax adjustments for the years 1997 through 2000; however, several significant matters remain in dispute. The remaining issues in dispute involve the tax treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions. Tyco International has indicated that it is unlikely to achieve the resolution of these contested adjustments through the IRS appeals process, and therefore may be required to litigate the disputed issues. For those issues not remaining in dispute, it is likely that Tyco International will settle with the IRS and pay any related deficiencies within the next twelve months. Over the next twelve months, we expect to pay approximately $90 million, inclusive of related indemnification payments, in connection with pre-separation tax matters. During fiscal 2011, the IRS completed its field examination of certain Tyco International income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004, issued Revenue Agent Reports which reflect the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 2001 through 2004 period, and issued certain notices of deficiency. As a result of the completion of fieldwork and the settlement of certain tax matters in fiscal 2011, we recognized income tax benefits of $35 million and other expense of $14 million pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement. For a portion of these pre-separation deficiencies, we are the primary obligor to the taxing authorities for which we paid $132 million in fiscal 2011. Concurrent with remitting these payments, we were reimbursed $93 million from Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to their indemnifications for pre-separation tax matters. In addition, we paid a total of $115 million in fiscal 2011 to Tyco International and Covidien for our share of 2001 through 2004 pre-separation tax deficiencies for which Tyco International and Covidien are the primary obligors to the taxing authorities. As a result, our net cash payment attributable to these matters was $154 million in fiscal 2011. The IRS commenced its audit of certain Tyco International income tax returns for the years 2005 through 2007 in fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2009, Tyco International settled a matter with the IRS concerning certain tax deductions claimed on Tyco International's income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004. As a result of this settlement, we recorded a $28 million income tax charge in fiscal 2009 to reflect the disallowance of a portion of these deductions. At September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, we have reflected $232 million and $244 million, respectively, of income tax liabilities related to the audits of Tyco International's and our income tax returns in accrued and other current liabilities as certain of these matters could be resolved within one year. We continue to believe that the amounts recorded on our Consolidated Financial Statements relating to the matters discussed above are appropriate. However, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and could result in a material impact to our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Legal Matters In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, employment disputes, tax matters, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, and antitrust claims. Management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. However, one or more of the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows in a future period. 59 Table of Contents See "Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings" and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings. Matters Related to Our Former Wireless Systems Business Certain liabilities and contingencies related to our former Wireless Systems business were retained by us when this business was sold in fiscal 2009. These include certain retained liabilities related to the State of New York contract and a contingent purchase price commitment related to the acquisition of Com-Net by the Wireless Systems business in 2001. See additional information below. Also, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the divestiture of the Wireless Systems business. State of New York Contract In September 2005, we were awarded a twenty-year lease contract with the State of New York (the "State") to construct, operate, and maintain a statewide wireless communications network for use by state and municipal first responders. In August 2008, we were served by the State with a default notice related to the first regional network, pursuant to the contract. Under the terms of the contract, we had 45 days to rectify the purported deficiencies noted by the State. In October 2008, we informed the State that all technical deficiencies had been remediated and the system was operating in accordance with the contract specifications and certified the system ready for testing. The State conducted further testing during November and December 2008. In January 2009, the State notified us that, in the State's opinion, we had not fully remediated the issues cited by the State and it had determined that we were in default of the contract and that it had exercised its right to terminate the contract. The State contends that it has the right under the contract to recoup costs incurred by the State in conjunction with the implementation of the network, and as a result of this contention, in January 2009, the State drew down $50 million against an irrevocable standby letter of credit funded by us. The State has the ability to draw up to an additional $50 million against the standby letter of credit, although we dispute that the State has any basis to do so. In February 2009, we filed a claim in the New York Court of Claims, seeking over $100 million in damages, and alleging a number of causes of action, including breach of contract, unjust enrichment, defamation, conversion, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the imposition of a constructive trust, and seeking a declaration that the State terminated the contract "for convenience." In September 2009, the Court granted the State's motion to dismiss all counts of the complaint, with the exception of the breach of contract claim and a claim for breach of warranty in connection with the State's drawdown on the $50 million letter of credit. In November 2009, the State filed an answer to the complaint and counterclaim asserting breach of contract and alleging that the State has incurred damages in excess of $275 million. We moved to dismiss the counterclaim in February 2010, and in June 2010 the Court denied our motion. We filed our answer to the State's counterclaim in July 2010. We believe that the counterclaim is without merit and intend to vigorously pursue our claims in this matter. A trial date has been set for February 2012. As a result of these actions, in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded pre-tax charges totaling $111 million associated with this contract. These charges are reflected in loss from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as a result of our sale of the Wireless Systems business. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of discontinued operations and the sale of the Wireless Systems business. The charges included an impairment charge of $61 million to write-off all costs incurred in constructing the network as well as a charge equal to the amount drawn by the State against the standby letter of credit of $50 million. 60 Table of Contents Com-Net At September 30, 2011, we had a contingent purchase price commitment of $80 million related to our fiscal 2001 acquisition of Com-Net. This represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system for the State of Florida is finished and the State of Florida has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract. Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, we do not believe we have any obligation to the sellers. However, the sellers have contested our position and initiated a lawsuit in June 2006 in the Court of Common Pleas in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, which is in the discovery phase. A liability for this contingency has not been recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements as we do not believe that any payment is probable or reasonably estimable at this time. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Certain of our segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2012 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance, and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. At September 30, 2011, we had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of $436 million, of which $50 million was related to our contract with the State of New York. In January 2009, the State drew down $50 million against an irrevocable standby letter of credit funded by us. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax charge equal to the draw. Although we dispute that the State has any basis to do so, the State has the ability to draw up to an additional $50 million against the standby letter of credit which could result in additional charges and could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these liabilities. In the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, except for the potential claims related to the contract with the State of New York discussed above, such obligations will not significantly affect our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, upon separation, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. Under these agreements, principally the Tax Sharing Agreement, we, Tyco International, and Covidien share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters of Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify us for 69% of certain liabilities settled in cash by us with respect to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we have made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. If any of the companies 61 Table of Contents responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties' obligation. These arrangements have been valued upon our separation from Tyco International in accordance with ASC 460 and, accordingly, liabilities amounting to $249 million were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2011. See Notes 12 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following noted accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Revenue Recognition Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with ASC 605, Revenue Recognition , and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 13, Revenue Recognition . Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer. This generally occurs when the products reach the free-on-board shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. For those items where title has not yet transferred, we have deferred the recognition of revenue. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales. Other allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies. A reserve for other allowances is generally established at the time of sale based on historical experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales. Contract revenues for construction related projects are recorded primarily on the percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete. Percentage-of-completion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable. In addition, provisions for credit losses related to construction related projects are recorded as reductions of revenue in the period in which they first become determinable. Contract revenues for construction related projects are generated primarily in the Network Solutions segment. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets acquired include both those that have a determinable life and residual goodwill. Intangible assets with a determinable life include primarily intellectual property consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology with estimates of recoverability ranging from 1 to 50 years that are amortized generally on a straight-line basis. An evaluation of the remaining useful life of intangible assets with a determinable life is performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation. We assess intangible assets with a determinable life for impairment consistent with our policy for assessing other long-lived assets. Goodwill is assessed for impairment separately from other intangible assets with a determinable life by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever we believe a 62 Table of Contents triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred. In assessing the existence of a triggering event, management relies on a number of reporting unit specific factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. When testing for goodwill impairment, we follow the guidance prescribed in ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other . First, we perform a step I goodwill impairment test to identify a potential impairment. In doing so, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss. In the step II goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. Estimates about fair value used in the step I goodwill impairment tests have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. The income approach has been generally supported by additional market transaction and guideline analyses. These approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, income tax rates, and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and determined that no impairment existed and that the fair value of all reporting units to which goodwill is allocated is well in excess of the respective carrying value. Income Taxes In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal, and international pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in 63 Table of Contents the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Any changes in a valuation allowance that was established in connection with an acquisition will be reflected in the income tax provision. Changes in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes , we recognize liabilities for tax as well as related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, income tax benefits may be recognized. These tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions. The funded status of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation at the measurement date. For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation, which represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement based on estimated future compensation levels. For the postretirement benefit plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, which represents the actuarial present value of postretirement benefits attributed to employee services already rendered. The fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds, held for the sole benefit of participants, which are invested by the trust funds. Mandatory contribution amounts are actuarially determined; voluntary contributions are at our discretion. The benefits under pension and postretirement plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation. Net periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality, and employee turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. A 25 basis point decrease or increase in the discount rate would 64 Table of Contents have increased or decreased, respectively, the present value of our pension obligations by $107 million at fiscal year end 2011. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease or increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets would have increased or decreased, respectively, our fiscal 2011 pension expense by $10 million. During fiscal 2008, our investment committee made the decision to change the target asset allocation of the U.S. plans' master trust from 60% equity and 40% fixed income to 30% equity and 70% fixed income in an effort to better align asset risk with the anticipated payment of benefit obligations. The target asset allocation transition began in fiscal 2008. Asset reallocation will continue over a multi-year period based on the funded status of the U.S. plans' master trust and market conditions. As of September 30, 2011, our actual asset allocation is approximately 35% equity and 65% fixed income. Share-Based Compensation We determine the fair value of share awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. The Black-Scholes-Merton model requires certain assumptions that involve judgment. Such assumptions are the expected share price volatility, expected annual dividend yield, expected life of options, and risk-free interest rate. (See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to share-based compensation.) An increase in the volatility of our stock will increase the amount of share-based compensation expense on new awards. An increase in the holding period of options will also cause an increase in share-based compensation expense. Dividend yields and risk-free interest rates are less difficult to estimate, but an increase in the dividend yield will cause a decrease in share-based compensation expense and an increase in the risk-free interest rate will increase share-based compensation expense. Acquisitions We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method of accounting for acquired businesses requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We may engage independent third-party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from customer and distributor relationships, acquired developed technologies, and patents; expected costs to develop in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from projects when completed; brand awareness and market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio; customer and distributor attrition rates; and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. 65 Table of Contents Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In December 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an update to guidance in ASC 805, Business Combinations , that clarifies the disclosure requirements for pro forma presentation of revenue and earnings related to a business combination. We elected to early adopt this guidance during the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued updates to guidance in ASC 810, Consolidation , that address accounting for variable interest entities. We adopted these updates to ASC 810 in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In September 2011, the FASB issued an update to guidance in ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other , that introduces the use of qualitative factors when considering the need to perform a step I goodwill impairment test on one of our reporting units. If we conclude that qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value exceeds its carrying value, we do not need to perform a step I goodwill impairment test on that reporting unit. This update to ASC 350 is effective for us in fiscal 2013; however, we intend to early adopt the standard during fiscal 2012. Adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued an update to guidance in ASC 220, Comprehensive Income , that changes the presentation and disclosure requirements of comprehensive income in interim and annual financial statements. These updates to ASC 220 are effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In May 2011, the FASB issued an update to guidance in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement , that clarifies the application of fair value and enhances disclosure regarding valuation of financial instruments and level 3 fair value measurement inputs. These updates to ASC 820 are effective for us in the second quarter of fiscal 2012. Adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Organic Net Sales Growth Organic net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure. The difference between reported net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP measure) and organic net sales growth (the non-GAAP measure) consists of the impact from foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions, divestitures, and an additional week in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year for fiscal years which are 53 weeks in length. Organic net sales growth is a useful measure of the underlying results and trends in our business. It excludes items that are not completely under management's control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity and the impact of an additional week in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year for fiscal years which are 53 weeks in length. We believe organic net sales growth provides useful information to investors because it reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business. Furthermore, it provides investors with a view of our operations from management's perspective. We use organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance, as it is an important measure of the underlying results of our operations. Management uses organic net sales growth together with GAAP measures such as net sales growth and operating income in its decision making processes related to the operations of our reporting segments 66 Table of Contents and our overall company. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The discussion and analysis of organic net sales growth in Results of Operations above utilizes organic net sales growth as management does internally. Because organic net sales growth calculations may vary among other companies, organic net sales growth amounts presented above may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Organic net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on our net sales. This limitation is best addressed by evaluating organic net sales growth in combination with our GAAP net sales. The tables presented in Results of Operations above provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated under GAAP. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. The difference between net cash provided by continuing operating activities (the most comparable GAAP measure) and free cash flow (the non-GAAP measure) consists mainly of significant cash outflows and inflows that we believe are useful to identify. Free cash flow is a useful measure of our cash generation which is free from any significant existing obligation. It also is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. Free cash flow permits management and investors to gain insight into the amount that management employs to measure cash that is free from any significant existing obligation. Free cash flow excludes net capital expenditures, voluntary pension contributions, and the cash impact of special items. Net capital expenditures are subtracted because they represent long-term commitments. Voluntary pension contributions are subtracted from the GAAP measure because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity. Certain special items, including net payments related to pre-separation tax matters and pre-separation litigation payments, are also considered by management in evaluating free cash flow. We believe investors should also consider these items in evaluating our free cash flow. Free cash flow as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on our GAAP cash flow. Also, it subtracts certain cash items that are ultimately within management's and the board of directors' discretion to direct and may imply that there is less or more cash available for our programs than the most comparable GAAP measure indicates. This limitation is best addressed by using free cash flow in combination with the GAAP cash flow results. The tables presented in Liquidity and Capital Resources above provide reconciliations of free cash flow to cash flows from continuing operating activities calculated under GAAP.
