ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. We believe that the estimates and assumptions listed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require the greatest subjective determinations and form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical. These critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets, impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill, and fair value of derivative financial instruments. Revenue recognition We lease multifamily residential apartments under operating leases primarily with terms of one year or less. Rental revenues are recognized using a method that represents a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and other revenues are recorded when earned. We record all gains and losses on real estate in accordance with accounting standards governing the sale of real estate. Capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets We carry real estate assets at depreciated cost. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings, 5 years for furniture, fixtures, and equipment, 3 to 5 years for computers and software, and 6 months for acquired leases, all of which are subjective determinations. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements, renovations and replacements are capitalized. The cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by us in order to elevate the condition of the property to our standards are capitalized as incurred. Development costs are capitalized in accordance with accounting standards for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects and standards for the capitalization of interest cost, real estate taxes and personnel expense. Impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill We account for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal on long-lived assets and evaluate our goodwill for impairment under accounting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets. We evaluate goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified. We periodically evaluate long-lived assets, including investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance, market conditions and legal factors. Long-lived assets, such as real estate assets, equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented on the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the 30 TABLE OF CONTENTS carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss for goodwill is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset fair value. This determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps. First, we determine the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it to its carrying amount. In the apartment industry, the primary method used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate. We determine the appropriate capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in a property market or submarket. Second, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with accounting standards for business combinations. The residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. Fair value of derivative financial instruments We utilize certain derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, during the normal course of business to manage, or hedge, the interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage well-defined interest rate risk associated with the transaction. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedging instrument, changes in the hedging instrument must be highly effective at offsetting changes in the hedged item. The historical correlation of the hedging instruments and the underlying hedged items are assessed before entering into the hedging relationship and on a quarterly basis thereafter, and have been found to be highly effective. We measure ineffectiveness using the change in the variable cash flows method for interest rate swaps and the hypothetical derivative method for interest rate caps for each reporting period through the term of the hedging instruments. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded in earnings if in an overhedged position. The change in fair value of the interest rate swaps and the intrinsic value or fair value of interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of shareholders equity. The valuation of our derivative financial instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The fair values of interest rate caps are determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the interest rate caps. The variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the interest rate cap are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities. Additionally, we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. Changes in the fair values of our derivatives are primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes 5 and 6. OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 We experienced a decrease in income from continuing operations in 2010 as increases in revenues were more than offset by increases in expenses. The increases in revenues came from a 2.5% increase in our secondary market same store segment and a 66.4% increase in our non-same store and other segment which was primarily a result of acquisitions. The increase in expenses included a $1.6 million increase in acquisition costs related to increased acquisition activity in 2010. Our same store portfolio represents those communities 31 TABLE OF CONTENTS that have been held and have been stabilized for at least 12 months. Communities excluded from the same store portfolio would include recent acquisitions, communities being developed or in lease-up, communities undergoing extensive renovations, and communities identified as discontinued operations. We have grown externally during the past three years by following our acquisition strategy to invest in large and mid-sized growing markets in the Sunbelt region of the United States. We acquired five properties for our 100% owned portfolio in 2008, four in 2009 and eight in 2010. We also purchased two properties through our joint venture in 2008, two in 2009 and two in 2010. Offsetting some of this increased revenue stream were three property dispositions in 2009. We continued to benefit from reduced interest rates in 2010 as a reduction in average interest rates more than offset the impact from an increase in the average amount of debt outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2010 from the year ended December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2010, the total number of apartment units that MAA owned or had an ownership interest in was 46,310 in 157 communities, compared to 43,604 apartment units in 147 communities at December 31, 2009, and 42,554 apartment units in 145 communities at December 31, 2008. For communities owned 100% by MAA, the average effective rent per apartment unit, excluding units in lease-up, increased to $736.51 at December 31, 2010 from $715 at December 31, 2009 and $750 at December 31, 2008. For these same units, overall occupancy at December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 was 95.8%, 95.2%, and 93.4%, respectively. Average effective rent per unit is equal to the average of gross rent amounts after the effect of leasing concessions for occupied units plus prevalent market rates asked for unoccupied units, divided by the total number of units. Leasing concessions represent discounts to the current market rate. We believe average effective rent is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pricing. It does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit. The following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008. This discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2010, to the Year Ended December 31, 2009 Property revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 were approximately $401.5 million, an increase of $23.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2009 due to (i) a $4.3 million increase in property revenues from our secondary market same store group primarily as a result of a $3.7 million increase from our new bulk cable program and (ii) a $19.0 million increase in property revenues from our non-same store and other group, mainly as a result of acquisitions. Property operating expenses include costs for property personnel, property personnel bonuses, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and depreciation. Property operating expenses, excluding depreciation, for the year ended December 31, 2010 were approximately $174.6 million, an increase of approximately $14.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2009 due primarily to increases in property operating expenses of (i) $2.6 million from our large market same store group, (ii) $4.0 million from our secondary market same store group, and (iii) $8.3 million from our non-same store and other group, mainly as a result of acquisitions. The increases in the large and secondary market same store groups include $2.8 million and $3.7 million, respectively, related to the accounting for our new bulk cable program. Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 was approximately $104.1 million, an increase of approximately $8.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to the increases in depreciation expense of (i) $1.0 million from our large market same store group, (ii) $1.3 million from our secondary market same store group, and (iii) $5.7 million from our non-same store and other group, mainly as a result of acquisitions. Increases of depreciation expense from our large and secondary market same store groups resulted from asset additions made during the normal course of business. 32 TABLE OF CONTENTS Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 was approximately $56.0 million, a decrease of $1.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was primarily related to the decrease in our average cost of debt from 4.31% for the year ended December 31, 2009 to 3.95% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in our average cost of debt was partially offset by an increase in our average debt outstanding from the year ended December 31, 2009 to the year ended December 31, 2010 of approximately $88.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately $1.9 million related to one of our original initial public offering communities. This community is part of our secondary market same store segment. Fair value of the community was determined by an offer. No asset impairment charges were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2009. Primarily as a result of the foregoing, net income attributable to Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. decreased by approximately $7.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 from the year ended December 31, 2009. During 2010, we redeemed all of the issued and outstanding shares of the 6,200,000 shares of our 8.30% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, or Series H, resulting in a write-off of approximately $5.1 million on the consolidated statements of operations related to premiums and original issuance costs. The redemption also resulted in the decrease of preferred dividends from $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 to $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2009, to the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Property revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased by approximately $8.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2008, due to (i) a $0.1 million increase in property revenues from our large market same store group and (ii) a $9.3 million increase in property revenues from our non-same store and other group, mainly as a result of acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in property revenues of approximately $1.0 million from our secondary market same store group. Property operating expenses include costs for property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and other property related costs. Property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased by approximately $4.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2008, due primarily to increases of property operating expenses of (i) $0.3 million from our secondary market same store group, and (ii) $4.3 million from our non-same store and other group, mainly as a result of acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the property operating expenses of $0.2 million from our large same store group due primarily to real estate tax expense which reflected the favorable impact of successful prior year appeals and assessment challenges. Depreciation expense increased by approximately $5.9 million primarily due to the increases of depreciation expense of (i) $1.4 million from our large market same store group, (ii) $1.0 million from our secondary market same store group, and (iii) $3.5 million from our non-same store and other group, mainly as a result of acquisitions. Increases of depreciation expense from our large and secondary market same store groups resulted from asset additions made during the normal course of business. Interest expense decreased approximately $4.9 million in 2009 from 2008 due primarily to the decrease in our average annual borrowing cost from 4.88% in 2008 to 4.31% in 2009. This decrease was somewhat offset by an increase in our average debt outstanding by approximately $34.9 million from 2008 to 2009 to fund acquisitions and our development and redevelopment programs. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded total gains of approximately $4.6 million from the sale of three communities. We had no property dispositions in 2008. Primarily as a result of the foregoing, net income attributable to Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. increased by approximately $7.0 million in 2009 from 2008. 33 TABLE OF CONTENTS Funds from Operations Funds from operations, or FFO, represents net income (computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP) excluding extraordinary items, minority interest in operating partnership income, gains on disposition of real estate assets, plus depreciation of real estate, and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect FFO on the same basis. This definition of FFO is in accordance with the NAREIT definition. Disposition of real estate assets includes sales of discontinued operations as well as proceeds received from insurance and other settlements from property damage. In response to the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Policy Statement relating to EITF Topic D-42 concerning the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption of preferred stock, we have included the amount charged to retire preferred stock in excess of carrying values in our FFO calculation. Our policy is to expense the cost of interior painting, vinyl flooring, and blinds as incurred for stabilized properties. During the stabilization period for acquisition properties, these items are capitalized as part of the total repositioning program of newly acquired properties, and, thus are not deducted in calculating FFO. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other GAAP measurement of performance, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. We believe that FFO is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance in that such calculation excludes depreciation expense on real estate assets. We believe that GAAP historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. Our calculation of FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. The following table is a reconciliation of FFO to consolidated net income for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 (dollars and shares in thousands): Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Consolidated net income $ 30,875 $ 39,221 $ 32,071 Net income attibutable to noncontrolling interests (1,114 ) (2,010 ) (1,822 ) Net income attributable to Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. 29,761 37,211 30,249 Depreciation of real estate assets 102,000 94,020 88,555 Net casualty (gains) loss and other settlement proceeds (330 ) (32 ) 247 Gains on properties contributed to joint ventures (752 ) Gains on dispositions within real estate joint ventures (38 ) Depreciation of real estate assets of discontinued operations 706 Loss (gains) on sales of discontinued operations 2 (4,649 ) 120 Depreciation of real estate assets of real estate joint ventures 1,896 970 953 Preferred dividend distribution (6,549 ) (12,865 ) (12,865 ) Net income attibutable to noncontrolling interests 1,114 2,010 1,822 Premiums and original issuance costs associated with the redemption of preferred stock (5,149 ) Funds from operations $ 121,993 $ 116,665 $ 109,749 FFO for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased approximately $5.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily as a result of the increase in property revenues of approximately $23.3 million discussed above that was only partially offset by the $14.9 million increase in property operating expenses. FFO for the year ended December 31, 2010 was impacted by a $1.9 million asset impairment charge related to one of our original initial public offering communities. FFO for the year ended December 31, 2010 was also impacted by a decrease in preferred dividends of $6.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2009 34 TABLE OF CONTENTS due to the redemption of the Series H shares. This decrease was materially offset by the recognition of approximately $5.1 million on the consolidated statements of operations representing the write-off of premiums and original issuance costs for the Series H redemption. FFO for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased approximately $6.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily as a result of the increase in property revenues of approximately $8.4 million discussed above that was only partially offset by the $4.4 million increase in property operating expenses. Trends During 2010, rental demand for apartments began to improve relative to 2009. This was evident through higher physical occupancy as compared to 2009 as well as pricing increases on both new leases and renewals signed during the year. However, we have maintained this momentum with job formation, one of the primary drivers of apartment demand, continuing to be slow to return. The job losses that have occurred across the nation and our markets continue to cause us to be cautious about apartment demand and pricing but optimistic about the long term prospects for apartment demand as job growth returns. An important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain a broad diversity of markets across the Sunbelt region of the United States. The diversity of markets tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area. We have found that a well diversified portfolio, including both large and select secondary markets, has tended to perform well in up cycles as well as weather down cycles better. As of December 31, 2010, with the addition of an asset in Charlotte, North Carolina, we were invested in over 49 separate markets, with 62% of our gross assets in large markets and 38% of our gross assets in select secondary markets. We also continue to benefit on the supply side. Supply declined in 2010 and continues to run well below historical new supply delivery averages. Competition from condominiums reverting back to rental units, or new condominiums being converted to rental, was not a major factor in our portfolio because most of our submarkets have not been primary areas for condominium development. We have found the same to be true for rental competition from single family homes. We have avoided committing a significant amount of capital to markets where most of the excessive inflation in house prices has occurred. We saw significant rental competition from condominiums or single family houses in only a few of our submarkets. We expect this relative new supply compression to be an even larger factor over the next several quarters as supply that did come to market before the slowdown moves further away from the lease up stage and new supply remains limited. Our focus throughout 2010 was on maintaining strong occupancy performance and pushing pricing where possible through our revenue management system. Through these efforts, our average same store occupancy (large market same store and secondary market same store segments combined) in 2010 was about 80 basis points higher than the average for 2009. While effective rent per unit for the year was lower than 2009 (primarily due to in place rents going into 2010), we saw the pricing trend reverse and turn positive in 2010. In the third quarter of 2010, we saw the first sequential quarter increase in effective rents in seven quarters. This pricing trend is expected to continue in 2011. Overall same store revenues increased 1.2% for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. This included an increase of $6.5 million due to our new bulk cable program. With cable expense netted into cable revenues, same store revenues decreased 0.6% over this period. As expected, the quarter over quarter decline in same store revenue reversed in the fourth quarter of 2010 and turned positive, as rents continued to rebound from declines seen in 2009 and early 2010. We expect more robust revenue growth will resume in 2011 as the economic growth returns and, most importantly, when sustainable job growth resumes. We also believe reduced availability of financing for new apartment construction will likely limit new apartment construction over the next few quarters, and more sustainable credit terms for residential mortgages should work to favor rental demand at existing multi-family properties. At the same time, we expect long-term demographic trends, including the growth of prime age groups for rentals, immigration and population movement to the southeast and southwest will continue to build apartment rental demand for our markets. 35 TABLE OF CONTENTS Should the economy fall into a deeper recession, the limited new supply of apartments and the more disciplined mortgage financing for single family home buying should lessen the impact to some degree, but a weak economy and employment market would nevertheless limit rent growth prospects. We continue to develop improved products, operating systems and procedures that enable us to capture more revenues. The continued roll-out of ancillary services (such as our cable saver and deposit saver programs), improved collections and utility reimbursements enable us to capture increased revenue dollars. We also actively work on improving processes and products to reduce expenses, such as new web-sites and internet access for our residents that enable them to transact their business with us more simply and effectively. Throughout 2010, we continued to have the benefit of lower interest rates resulting from a continued strong market for Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation debt securities. Short term interest rates continue to be at historically low levels, and as a result, we are forecasting a continuation of favorable interest rates in the near term with the expectation of rising rates as the economy improves. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased to $133.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $140.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. This change was a result of various items, including changes in cash flows associated with the timing of interest payments. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $254.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $154.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, mainly related to acquisition activity. In the year ended December 31, 2010, MAA had acquisition cash outflows of $284.0 million compared to $125.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in cash outflows due to acquisitions was partially offset primarily by an increase in cash inflows from disposition activity. In the year ended December 31, 2010, we had cash inflows of $90.3 million, mainly related to the contributions of three communities to Fund II. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we had cash inflows of approximately $29.9 million, mainly related to the sale of three communities. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $152.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $18.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we received proceeds of approximately $305.5 million primarily from the issuance of shares of common stock through our at-the-market program, or ATM and a waiver through our Dividend and Distribution Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan, or DRSPP. We used $155.0 million of these proceeds to fund the redemption of our 8.30% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, or Series H. During 2010, MAA sold 5,077,201 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately $274.6 million through our ATM. This compares to 763,000 shares for net proceeds of approximately $32.8 million for 2009 and 1,955,300 shares for net proceeds of approximately $103.6 million for 2008. During 2010, MAA issued 551,895 shares at an average discount of 2% for net proceeds of $30.0 million through the direct stock purchase feature of our DRSPP. During 2009, MAA did not offer a discount through our DRSPP and issued approximately 1,100 shares of common stock, generating approximately $39,000 in proceeds. During 2008, MAA offered an average 1.5% discount through our DRSPP and issued approximately 403,000 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase feature of the plan, generating approximately $20 million in proceeds. On June 2, 2010, we redeemed 3,100,001 shares of the 6,200,000 shares of our Series H for approximately $77.5 million. On August 5, 2010 we redeemed all of the remaining and outstanding shares of Series H for approximately $77.5 million, resulting in a combined write-off for the year ended December 31, 2010 of approximately $5.1 million on the consolidated statements of operations related to premiums and original issuance costs. The redemption also resulted in the decrease of preferred dividends to $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. 36 TABLE OF CONTENTS The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2010 for the $1.5 billion of debt outstanding was 3.8%, compared to the weighted average interest rate of 4.0% on $1.4 billion of debt outstanding at December 31, 2009. We utilize both conventional and tax exempt debt to help finance our activities. Borrowings are made through individual property mortgages as well as company-wide secured credit facilities. We utilize fixed rate borrowings, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to manage our current and future interest rate risk. More details on our borrowings can be found in the schedules presented later in this section. At December 31, 2010, we had secured credit facility relationships with Prudential Mortgage Capital which are credit enhanced by the Federal National Mortgage Association, or FNMA, Financial Federal which are credit enhanced by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, and a $50 million bank facility with a syndicate of banks. Together, these credit facilities provided a total line capacity of $1.4 billion with all but $6.5 million collateralized and available to borrow at December 31, 2010. We had total borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities of $1.3 billion at December 31, 2010. Approximately 65% of our outstanding obligations at December 31, 2010 were borrowed through credit facilities with/or credit enhanced by FNMA, also referred to as the FNMA Facilities. The FNMA Facilities have a combined line limit of $1.04 billion, all of which was collateralized and available to borrow at December 31, 2010. We had total borrowings outstanding under the FNMA Facilities of approximately $0.97 billion at December 31, 2010. Various traunches of the FNMA Facilities mature from 2011 through 2018. The FNMA Facilities provide for both fixed and variable rate borrowings. The interest rate on the majority of the variable portion is based on the FNMA Discount Mortgage Backed Security, or DMBS, rate which are credit-enhanced by FNMA and are typically sold every 90 days by Prudential Mortgage Capital at interest rates approximating three-month LIBOR less a spread that has averaged 0.16% over the life of the FNMA Facilities, plus a credit enhancement fee of 0.49% to 0.67%. We have seen more volatility in the spread between the DMBS and three-month LIBOR since late 2007 than was historically prevalent. Approximately 20% of our outstanding obligations at December 31, 2010 were borrowed through credit facilities with/or credit enhanced by Freddie Mac, also referred to as the Freddie Mac Facilities. The Freddie Mac Facilities have a combined line limit of $300 million, of which $298 million was collateralized and available to borrow at December 31, 2010. We had total borrowings outstanding under the Freddie Mac Facilities of approximately $298 million at December 31, 2010. The Freddie Mac facilities mature in 2011 and 2014. The interest rate on the Freddie Mac Facilities renews every 30 or 90 days and is based on the Freddie Mac Reference Bill Rate on the date of renewal, which has historically approximated the equivalent 30 or 90-day LIBOR, plus a credit enhancement fee of 0.65% to 0.69%. The Freddie Mac Reference Bill rate has traded consistently below LIBOR, and the historical average spread was 0.34% below LIBOR at December 31, 2010. Each of our secured credit facilities is subject to various covenants and conditions on usage, and is subject to periodic re-evaluation of collateral. If we were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing, the available credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In the event of a reduction in real estate values the amount of available credit could be reduced. Moreover, if we were to fail to make a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility, after applicable cure periods, one or more of our lenders could declare a default, accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding and/or foreclose on properties securing such facilities. Any such event could have a material adverse effect.

To date, these swaps have proven to be highly effective hedges. We had also entered into interest rate cap agreements totaling a notional amount of approximately $270.7 million as of December 31, 2010.

We rely on the efficient operation of the financial markets to finance debt maturities, and on FNMA and Freddie Mac, or the Agencies. The Agencies provided credit enhancement for approximately $1.3 billion of our outstanding debt through credit facilities as of December 31, 2010. The interest rate markets for FNMA DMBS and Freddie Mac Reference Bills, which in our experience are highly liquid and highly correlated with three-month LIBOR interest rates, are also an important component of our liquidity and interest rate swap effectiveness. Prudential Mortgage Capital, a DUS lender for Fannie Mae, markets 90-day Fannie Mae Discount Mortgage Backed Securities monthly, and is obligated to advance funds to us at DMBS rates plus a credit spread under the terms of the credit agreements between Prudential and us. Financial Federal, a Freddie Mac Program Plus Lender and Servicer, is obligated to advance funds under the terms of credit agreements between Financial Federal and us. For the year ended December 31, 2010, our net cash provided by operating activities was in excess of covering funding improvements to existing real estate assets, distributions to unitholders, and dividends paid on common and preferred shares by approximately $10.5 million, as compared to $10.2 million and $12.7 million for the same periods in 2009 and 2008, respectively. While we had sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings, if necessary, any significant deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate, in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate. The following table reflects our total contractual cash obligations which consist of our long-term debt and operating leases as of December 31, 2010, (dollars in thousands): Contractual Obligations (1) 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Long-Term Debt (2) $ 183,839 $ 84,217 $ 183,123 $ 538,971 $ 172,391 $ 337,652 $ 1,500,193 Fixed Rate or Swapped Interest (3) 44,048 34,970 27,360 18,083 11,933 40,795 177,189 Operating Lease 17 10 27 Total $ 227,904 $ 119,197 $ 210,483 $ 557,054 $ 184,324 $ 378,447 $ 1,677,409 (1) Fixed rate and swapped interest are shown in this table.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2010, and 2009, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Our two joint ventures with Crow Holdings (one terminated in 2005 and one terminated in 2007) were established to acquire approximately $200 million of multifamily properties and to enhance our return on investment through the generation of fee income. Mid-America Multifamily Fund I, LLC, was established to acquire $500 million of apartment communities with redevelopment upside offering value creation opportunity through capital improvements, operating enhancements and restructuring in-place financing. As of December 31, 2010, Mid-America Multifamily Fund I, LLC owned two properties but does not expect to acquire any additional communities. Mid-America Multifamily Fund II, LLC, was established to acquire $250 million of apartment communities with redevelopment upside offering value creation opportunity through capital improvements, operating enhancements and restructuring in-place financing. As of December 31, 2010, Mid-America Multifamily Fund II, LLC owned four properties. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. We do not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with us or our related parties other than those disclosed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 12. 39 TABLE OF CONTENTS Our investments in our real estate joint ventures are unconsolidated and are recorded using the equity method as we do not have a controlling interest. Insurance We renegotiated our insurance programs effective July 1, 2010. We believe that the property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that any insurable loss experienced that can be reasonably anticipated would not have a significant impact on our liquidity, financial position or results of operation. Inflation Substantially all of the resident leases at the apartment communities allow, at the time of renewal, for adjustments in the rent payable there under, and thus may enable MAA to seek rent increases. Almost all leases are for one year or less. The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation. Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2009, the FASB issued ASC 105-10, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles Overall, or ASC 105-10, which establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or the Codification, as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. All guidance contained in the Codification carries an equal level of authority. The Codification superseded all existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards. All other non-grandfathered, non-SEC accounting literature not included in the Codification is non-authoritative. The FASB will not issue new standards in the form of Statements, FASB Staff Positions or Emerging Issues Task Force Abstracts. Instead, it will issue Accounting Standards Updates, or ASUs. The FASB will not consider ASUs as authoritative in their own right. ASUs will serve only to update the Codification, provide background information about the guidance and provide the basis for conclusions on the change(s) in the Codification. We adopted ASC 105-10 effective July 1, 2009 and all references made to FASB guidance throughout this document have been updated for the Codification. In April 2008, the FASB issued ASC 825-10-65-1, Interim Disclosures About Fair Market Value of Financial Instruments , or ASC 825-10-65-1, which extends the disclosure requirements concerning the fair value of financial instruments to interim financial statements of publicly traded companies. ASC 825-10-65-1 is effective for interim financial periods ending after June 15, 2009, and the required disclosures are included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6. In June 2008, the FASB issued ASC 810-10-05, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) , or ASC 810-10-05, which amends events that would require reconsidering whether an entity is a variable interest entity; it amends the criteria used to determine the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity; and it expands disclosures about an enterprise involvement in variable interest entities. ASC 810-10-05 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2009 and earlier application is prohibited. We adopted ASC 810-10-05 effective January 1, 2010. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. 40 TABLE OF CONTENTS
