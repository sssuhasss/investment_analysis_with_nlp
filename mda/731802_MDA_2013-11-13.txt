ITEM 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. INTRODUCTION This section provides management discussion of the financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations of Atmos Energy Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries with specific information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources. It includes management interpretation of our financial results, the factors affecting these results, the major factors expected to affect future operating results and future investment and financing plans. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance, some of which are described in Item 1A above, Risk Factors . They should be considered in connection with evaluating forward-looking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forward-looking statements. Cautionary Statement for the Purposes of the Safe Harbor under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Report are forward-looking statements made in good faith by us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this Report, or any other of our documents or oral presentations, the words anticipate , believe , estimate , expect , forecast , goal , intend , objective , plan , projection , seek , strategy or similar words are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to our strategy, operations, markets, services, rates, recovery of costs, availability of gas supply and other factors. These risks and uncertainties include the following: our ability to continue to access the credit markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements; regulatory trends and decisions, including the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commissions; the impact of adverse economic conditions on our customers; the effects of inflation and changes in the availability and price of natural gas; market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities, including market liquidity, commodity price volatility, increasing interest rates and counterparty creditworthiness; the concentration of our distribution, pipeline and storage operations in Texas; increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy; adverse weather conditions; the capital-intensive nature of our gas distribution business; increased costs of providing pension and postretirement health care benefits and increased funding requirements along with increased costs of health care benefits; possible increased federal, state and local regulation of the safety of our operations; increased federal regulatory oversight and potential penalties; the impact of environmental regulations on our business; the impact of possible future additional regulatory and financial risks associated with global warming and climate change on our business; the inherent hazards and risks involved in operating our gas distribution business; the threat of cyber-attacks or acts of cyber-terrorism that could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems; natural disasters, terrorist activities or other events and other risks and uncertainties discussed herein, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, while we believe these forward-looking statements to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized. Further, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from estimates. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies discussed below are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require 23 Table of Contents management to make difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates. Accordingly, these critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Critical Accounting Policy Summary of Policy Factors Influencing Application of the Policy Regulation Our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations meet the criteria of a cost-based, rate-regulated entity under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Accordingly, the financial results for these operations reflect the effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions to which we are subject. As a result, certain costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States are permitted to be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet because it is probable they can be recovered through rates. Further, regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized. The amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations. Discontinuing the application of this method of accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities could significantly increase our operating expenses as fewer costs would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet, which could reduce our net income. Decisions of regulatory authorities Issuance of new regulations Assessing the probability of the recoverability of deferred costs Unbilled Revenue We follow the revenue accrual method of accounting for natural gas distribution segment revenues whereby revenues attributable to gas delivered to customers, but not yet billed under the cycle billing method, are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to expense. On occasion, we are permitted to implement new rates that have not been formally approved by our regulatory authorities, which are subject to refund. We recognize this revenue and establish a reserve for amounts that could be refunded based on our experience for the jurisdiction in which the rates were implemented. Estimates of delivered sales volumes based on actual tariff information and weather information and estimates of customer consumption and/or behavior Estimates of purchased gas costs related to estimated deliveries Estimates of uncollectible amounts billed subject to refund 24 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policy Summary of Policy Factors Influencing Application of the Policy Pension and other postretirement plans Pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis using a September 30 measurement date and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data. The assumed discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities. The assumed discount rate, the assumed health care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities. The discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligations and net periodic pension and postretirement benefit plan costs. When establishing our discount rate, we consider high quality corporate bond rates based on bonds available in the marketplace that are suitable for settling the obligations, changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching our projected benefit disbursements with currently available high quality corporate bonds. The expected long-term rate of return on assets is utilized in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan costs. We estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate, that year annual pension or postretirement plan costs are not affected. Rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan costs over a period of approximately ten to twelve years. The market-related value of our plan assets represents the fair market value of the plan assets, adjusted to smooth out short-term market fluctuations over a five-year period. The use of this methodology will delay the impact of current market fluctuations on the pension expense for the period. We estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions. Our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our participant census information as of the measurement date. General economic and market conditions Assumed investment returns by asset class Assumed future salary increases Projected timing of future cash disbursements Health care cost experience trends Participant demographic information Actuarial mortality assumptions Impact of legislation Contingencies In the normal course of business, we are confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability. These generally relate to uncollectible receivables, lawsuits, claims made by third parties or the action of various regulatory agencies. We recognize these contingencies in our consolidated financial statements when we determine, based on currently available facts and circumstances it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset will not be recovered, and an amount can be reasonably estimated. Actual results may differ from estimates, depending on actual outcomes or changes in the facts or expectations surrounding each potential exposure. Changes in the estimates related to contingencies could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Our contingencies are further discussed in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. Currently available facts Management estimate of future resolution 25 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policy Summary of Policy Factors Influencing Application of the Policy Financial instruments and hedging activities We use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk and interest rate risk. The objectives for using financial instruments have been tailored to meet the needs of our regulated and nonregulated businesses. These objectives are more fully described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. We record all of our financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with changes in fair value ultimately recorded in the income statement. The recognition of the changes in fair value of these financial instruments recorded in the income statement is contingent upon whether the financial instrument has been designated and qualifies as a part of a hedging relationship or if regulatory rulings require a different accounting treatment. Our accounting elections for financial instruments and hedging activities utilized are more fully described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. The criteria used to determine if a financial instrument meets the definition of a derivative and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment are complex and require management to exercise professional judgment. Further, as more fully discussed below, significant changes in the fair value of these financial instruments could materially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Finally, changes in the effectiveness of the hedge relationship could impact the accounting treatment. Designation of contracts under the hedge accounting rules Judgment in the application of accounting guidance Assessment of the probability that future hedged transactions will occur Changes in market conditions and the related impact on the fair value of the hedged item and the associated designated financial instrument Changes in the effectiveness of the hedge relationship Fair Value Measurements We report certain assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The fair value of our financial instruments is subject to potentially significant volatility based on numerous considerations including, but not limited to changes in commodity prices, interest rates, maturity and settlement of these financial instruments. Prices actively quoted on national exchanges are used to determine the fair value of most of our assets and liabilities recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. Within our nonregulated operations, we utilize a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point between the bid and ask prices) for determining fair value measurement, as permitted under current accounting standards. Values derived from these sources reflect the market in which transactions involving these financial instruments are executed. We utilize models and other valuation methods to determine fair value when external sources are not available. Values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under then-current market conditions. We believe the market prices and models used to value these financial instruments represent the best information available with respect to the market in which transactions involving these financial instruments are executed, the closing exchange and over-the-counter quotations, time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts. Fair-value estimates also consider our own creditworthiness and the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved. Our counterparties consist primarily of financial institutions and major energy companies. This concentration of counterparties may materially impact our exposure to credit risk resulting from market, economic or regulatory conditions. We seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through an evaluation of their financial condition and credit ratings and the use of collateral requirements under certain circumstances. General economic and market conditions Volatility in underlying market conditions Maturity dates of financial instruments Creditworthiness of our counterparties Creditworthiness of Atmos Energy Impact of credit risk mitigation activities on the assessment of the creditworthiness of Atmos Energy and its counterparties 26 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policy Summary of Policy Factors Influencing Application of the Policy Impairment assessments We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including goodwill and identifiable intangibles, whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable, and at least annually for goodwill, as required by U.S. accounting standards. The evaluation of our goodwill balances and other long-lived assets or identifiable assets for which uncertainty exists regarding the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets involves the assessment of future cash flows and external market conditions and other subjective factors that could impact the estimation of future cash flows including, but not limited to the commodity prices, the amount and timing of future cash flows, future growth rates and the discount rate. Unforeseen events and changes in circumstances or market conditions could adversely affect these estimates, which could result in an impairment charge. General economic and market conditions Projected timing and amount of future discounted cash flows Judgment in the evaluation of relevant data RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Atmos Energy Corporation is involved in the distribution, marketing and transportation of natural gas. Accordingly, our results of operations are impacted by the demand for natural gas, particularly during the winter heating season, and the volatility of the natural gas markets. Historically, this has generally resulted in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from October through March of each fiscal year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from April through September of each fiscal year. As a result of the seasonality of the natural gas industry, our second fiscal quarter has historically been our most critical earnings quarter with an average of approximately 54 percent of our consolidated net income having been earned in the second quarter during the three most recently completed fiscal years. However, we believe rate design changes implemented during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 in our Mid-Tex and West Texas Divisions should continue to cause this pattern to change. The rate design approved in these regulatory proceedings includes an increase to the customer base charge and a decrease in the consumption charge applied to customer usage. The effect of this change in rate design should result in a more equal distribution of operating income earned over the fiscal year for approximately 50 percent of our natural gas distribution segment. Additionally, the seasonality of our business impacts our working capital differently at various times during the year. Typically, our accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt balances peak by the end of January and then start to decline, as customers begin to pay their winter heating bills. Gas stored underground, particularly in our natural gas distribution segment, typically peaks in November and declines as we utilize storage gas to serve our customers. During fiscal 2013 , we earned $243.2 million, or $2.64 per diluted share, which represents a twelve percent increase in net income and diluted net income per share over fiscal 2012 , primarily due to recent improvements in rate designs in our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage segments combined with a two percent year-over-year increase in consolidated natural gas distribution throughput due to colder weather. We completed the sale of our Georgia natural gas distribution operations on April 1, 2013 to Liberty Energy (Georgia) Corp., an affiliate of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. for a cash price of approximately $153 million pursuant to a purchase agreement executed on August 8, 2012. In connection with the sale, we recognized a net of tax gain of $5.3 million. Accordingly, the results of operations for this service area are shown in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Prior-year results also reflect our Illinois, Iowa and Missouri service areas in discontinued operations. The sale of these three service areas was completed in August 2012. We also took several steps during the year ended September 30, 2013 to further strengthen our balance sheet and borrowing capability. In December 2012, we amended our $750 million revolving credit agreement primarily to (i) increase our borrowing capacity to $950 million while retaining the accordion feature that would allow an increase in borrowing capacity up to $1.2 billion and (ii) to permit same-day funding on base rate loans. In August 2013, we amended our revolving credit agreement primarily to increase the term through August 2018. We also terminated Atmos Energy Marketing $200 million committed and secured credit facility and replaced this facility with two $25 million 364-day bilateral facilities, which should result in a decrease in external credit expense incurred in our nonregulated operations. After giving effect to these changes, we have over $1 billion of working capital funding from four committed revolving credit facilities and one noncommitted revolving credit facility. 27 Table of Contents On January 11, 2013, we issued $500 million of 4.15% 30-year unsecured senior notes, which replaced, on a long-term basis, our $250 million 5.125% 10-year unsecured senior notes we redeemed in August 2012. The net proceeds of approximately $494 million were used to repay $260 million outstanding under the short-term financing facility used to redeem our 5.125% senior notes and to partially repay commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes. Consolidated Results The following table presents our consolidated financial highlights for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 .

Income from continuing operations was $230.7 million , or $2.50 per diluted share compared with $192.2 million , or $2.10 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Income from discontinued operations was $12.5 million or $0.14 per diluted share for the year, which includes the gain on sale of substantially all our assets in Georgia of $5.3 million, compared with $24.5 million or $0.27 per diluted share in the prior year. Unrealized gains in our nonregulated operations during the current year increased net income by $5.3 million or $0.05 per diluted share compared with net losses recorded in the prior year of $5.0 million, or $0.05 per diluted share. Additionally, net income in both periods was impacted by nonrecurring items. In fiscal 2012, net income included the net positive impact of several one-time items totaling $10.3 million, or $0.11 per diluted share related to the pre-tax items, which are discussed in further detail below. In fiscal 2013, net income includes an $8.2 million ($5.3 million, net of tax), or $0.06 per diluted share, favorable impact related to the gain recorded in association with the April 1, 2013 completion of the sale of our Georgia assets. We reported net income of $216.7 million , or $2.37 per diluted share for the year ended September 30, 2012 , compared with net income of $207.6 million or $2.27 per diluted share in fiscal 2011. Income from continuing operations was $192.2 million , or $2.10 per diluted share compared with $189.6 million , or $2.07 per diluted share in fiscal 2011. Income from discontinued operations was $24.5 million or $0.27 per diluted share for the year, which includes the gain on sale of substantially all our assets in Missouri, Illinois and Iowa of $6.3 million, compared with $18.0 million or $0.20 per diluted share in fiscal 2011. Unrealized losses in our nonregulated operations during fiscal 2012 reduced net income by $5.0 million or $0.05 per diluted share compared with net losses recorded in fiscal 2011 of $6.6 million, or $0.07 per diluted share. Additionally, net income in both periods was impacted by nonrecurring items. In fiscal 2011, net income included the net positive impact of several one-time items totaling $3.2 million, or $0.03 per diluted share related to pre-tax items. In fiscal 2012, net income included the net positive impact of several one-time items totaling $10.3 million, or $0.11 per diluted share related to the following amounts: $13.6 million positive impact of a deferred tax rate adjustment. $10.0 million ($6.3 million, net of tax) unfavorable impact related to a one-time donation to a donor advised fund. $9.9 million ($6.3 million, net of tax) favorable impact related to the gain recorded in association with the August 1, 2012 completion of the sale of our Iowa, Illinois and Missouri assets. $5.3 million ($3.3 million, net of tax) unfavorable impact related to the noncash impairment of certain assets in our nonregulated business. See the following discussion regarding the results of operations for each of our business operating segments. Natural Gas Distribution Segment The primary factors that impact the results of our natural gas distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return, the cost of natural gas, competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas. Our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions by reducing or eliminating regulatory lag and, ultimately, separating the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns. Improving rate design is a long-term process and is further complicated by the fact that 29 Table of Contents we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions. The Ratemaking Activity section of this Form 10-K describes our current rate strategy, progress towards implementing that strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail. We are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our customers without markup under purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms; therefore the cost of gas typically does not have an impact on our gross profit as increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues. Accordingly, we believe gross profit is a better indicator of our financial performance than revenues. However, gross profit in our Texas and Mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipt taxes, which are calculated as a percentage of revenue (inclusive of gas costs). Therefore, the amount of these taxes included in revenue is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes. We record the tax expense as a component of taxes, other than income. Although changes in revenue related taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect gross profit, over time the impact is offset within operating income. Although the cost of gas typically does not have a direct impact on our gross profit, higher gas costs may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections, resulting in higher bad debt expense, and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense. In addition, higher gas costs, as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or, in the case of industrial consumers, to use alternative energy sources. However, gas cost risk has been mitigated in recent years through improvements in rate design that allow us to collect from our customers the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense on approximately 75 percent of our residential and commercial margins. We completed the sale of our Georgia natural gas distribution operations on April 1, 2013 to Liberty Energy (Georgia) Corp., an affiliate of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. for a cash price of approximately $153 million. In connection with the sale, we recognized a net of tax gain of $5.3 million. On August 1, 2012, we completed the sale of substantially all of our natural gas distribution operations in Missouri, Illinois and Iowa. During fiscal 2013, we completed 13 regulatory proceedings, which should result in a $71.4 million increase in annual operating income. The majority of this rate increase related to our Mid-Tex Division, where rates became effective January 1, 2013. The rate design approved in our Mid-Tex Division and West Texas Division regulatory proceedings includes an increase to the base customer charge and a decrease in the commodity charge applied to customer consumption. The effect of this change in rate design allows the Company rates to be more closely aligned with the utility industry standard rate design. In addition, we anticipate these divisions will earn their operating income more ratably over the fiscal year as they are now less dependent on customer consumption. 30 Table of Contents Review of Financial and Operating Results Financial and operational highlights for our natural gas distribution segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 are presented below. For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 (In thousands, unless otherwise noted) Gross profit $ 1,081,236 $ 1,022,743 $ 1,017,943 $ 58,493 $ 4,800 Operating expenses 738,143 718,282 695,855 19,861 22,427 Operating income 343,093 304,461 322,088 38,632 (17,627 ) Miscellaneous income (expense) 2,535 (12,657 ) 16,242 15,192 (28,899 ) Interest charges 98,296 110,642 115,740 (12,346 ) (5,098 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes 247,332 181,162 222,590 66,170 (41,428 ) Income tax expense 96,476 57,314 77,885 39,162 (20,571 ) Income from continuing operations 150,856 123,848 144,705 27,008 (20,857 ) Income from discontinued operations, net of tax 7,202 18,172 18,013 (10,970 ) 159 Gain on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax 5,649 6,349 (700 ) 6,349 Net Income $ 163,707 $ 148,369 $ 162,718 $ 15,338 $ (14,349 ) Consolidated natural gas distribution sales volumes from continuing operations MMcf 269,162 244,466 275,540 24,696 (31,074 ) Consolidated natural gas distribution transportation volumes from continuing operations MMcf 123,144 128,222 125,812 (5,078 ) 2,410 Consolidated natural gas distribution throughput from continuing operations MMcf 392,306 372,688 401,352 19,618 (28,664 ) Consolidated natural gas distribution throughput from discontinued operations MMcf 4,731 18,295 22,668 (13,564 ) (4,373 ) Total consolidated natural gas distribution throughput MMcf 397,037 390,983 424,020 6,054 (33,037 ) Consolidated natural gas distribution average transportation revenue per Mcf $ 0.46 $ 0.43 $ 0.47 $ 0.03 $ (0.04 ) Consolidated natural gas distribution average cost of gas per Mcf sold $ 4.91 $ 4.64 $ 5.30 $ 0.27 $ (0.66 ) Fiscal year ended September 30, 2013 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 The $58.5 million period-over-period increase in natural gas distribution gross profit primarily reflects the following: $25.7 million increase in our Mid-Tex and West Texas divisions associated with the rate design changes implemented in the fiscal first quarter. $16.1 million increase in rates in our Kentucky/Mid-States, Mississippi, Colorado-Kansas and Louisiana divisions. $7.5 million increase due to colder weather, primarily in the Mississippi, Kentucky/Mid-States and Colorado-Kansas divisions. $5.9 million increase in revenue-related taxes in our Mid-Tex and West Texas service areas primarily due to higher revenues on which the tax is calculated. $4.5 million increase in transportation revenues. Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization expense and taxes, other than income, increased by $19.9 million , primarily due to the following: $12.2 million increase in employee-related expenses due to lower labor capitalization rates, increased benefit costs and increased variable compensation expense. 31 Table of Contents $11.7 million increase primarily associated with higher line locate activities, pipeline and right-of-way maintenance spending to improve the safety and reliability of our system. $5.0 million increase in taxes, other than income due to higher revenue-related taxes, as discussed above. $6.8 million increase in bad debt expense primarily attributable to an increase in revenue arising from the rate design changes and the temporary suspension of active customer collection activities following the implementation of a new customer information system during the third fiscal quarter. These increases were partially offset by: $6.9 million decrease in legal and other administrative costs. $6.4 million decrease in depreciation expense due to new depreciation rates approved in the most recent Mid-Tex rate case that went into effect in January 2013. $2.4 million gain realized on the sale of certain investments. Miscellaneous income increased $15.2 million , primarily due to the absence of a $10.0 million one-time donation to a donor advised fund in the prior year, the completion of a periodic review of our performance-based ratemaking (PBR) mechanism in our Tennessee service area and the implementation of a new PBR program in our Mississippi Division during fiscal 2013. Interest charges decreased $12.3 million , primarily from interest deferrals associated with our infrastructure spending activities in Texas. Fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 The $4.8 million increase in natural gas distribution gross profit was primarily due to a $17.7 million net increase in rate adjustments, primarily in the Mid-Tex, Louisiana, Mississippi, West Texas and Kentucky service areas. These increases were partially offset by the following: $11.1 million decrease in revenue-related taxes in our Mid-Tex, West Texas and Mississippi service areas, primarily due to lower revenues on which the tax is calculated. $1.6 million decrease due to an eight percent decrease in consolidated throughput caused principally by lower residential and commercial consumption combined with warmer weather in the current year compared to fiscal 2011 in most of our service areas. Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization expense and taxes, other than income increased $22.4 million primarily due to the following: $11.2 million increase in legal costs, primarily due to settlements. $10.6 million increase in employee-related costs. $8.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization associated with an increase in our net plant as a result of our capital investments in fiscal 2011. $2.6 million increase in software maintenance costs. These increases were partially offset by the following: $6.8 million decrease in operating expenses due to increased capital spending and warmer weather allowing us time to complete more capital work than in the prior year. $2.9 million decrease due to the establishment of regulatory assets for pension and postretirement costs. Miscellaneous income decreased $28.9 million primarily due to the absence of a $21.8 million pre-tax gain recognized in fiscal 2011 as a result of unwinding two Treasury locks ($13.6 million, net of tax) and a $10.0 million one-time donation to a donor advised fund in fiscal 2012. Interest charges decreased $5.1 million compared to the prior year due primarily to the prepayment of our 5.125% $250 million senior notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, refinancing long-term debt at reduced interest rates and reducing commitment fees from decreasing the number of credit facilities and extending the length of their terms in fiscal 2011. Additionally, results for fiscal 2012 were favorably impacted by a state tax benefit of $11.3 million. Due to the completion of the sale of our Missouri, Iowa and Illinois service areas in the fiscal fourth quarter, the Company updated its analysis of the tax rate at which deferred taxes would reverse in the future to reflect the sale of these service areas. The updated 32 Table of Contents analysis supported a reduction in the deferred tax rate which when applied to the balance of taxable income deferred to future periods resulted in a reduction of the Company overall deferred tax liability. The following table shows our operating income from continuing operations by natural gas distribution division, in order of total rate base, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 . The presentation of our natural gas distribution operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for ratemaking purposes. For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 (In thousands) Mid-Tex $ 158,900 $ 142,755 $ 144,204 $ 16,145 $ (1,449 ) Kentucky/Mid-States 46,164 32,185 37,593 13,979 (5,408 ) Louisiana 52,125 48,958 50,442 3,167 (1,484 ) West Texas 28,085 27,875 29,686 210 (1,811 ) Mississippi 29,112 27,369 26,338 1,743 1,031 Colorado-Kansas 25,478 23,898 25,920 1,580 (2,022 ) Other 3,229 1,421 7,905 1,808 (6,484 ) Total $ 343,093 $ 304,461 $ 322,088 $ 38,632 $ (17,627 ) Regulated Transmission and Storage Segment Our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the Atmos Pipeline Texas Division. The Atmos Pipeline Texas Division transports natural gas to our Mid-Tex Division and third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in Texas. We also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking arrangements, lending and sales of excess gas. Our regulated transmission and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns, competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our Mid-Tex service area. Natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation of natural gas. However, natural gas prices and demand for natural gas could influence the level of drilling activity in the markets that we serve, which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipeline. Further, natural gas price differences between the various hubs that we serve could influence customers to transport gas through our pipeline to capture arbitrage gains. The results of Atmos Pipeline Texas Division are also significantly impacted by the natural gas requirements of the Mid-Tex Division because it is the primary supplier of natural gas for our Mid-Tex Division. Finally, as a regulated pipeline, the operations of the Atmos Pipeline Texas Division may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs. 33 Table of Contents Review of Financial and Operating Results Financial and operational highlights for our regulated transmission and storage segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 are presented below. For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 (In thousands, unless otherwise noted) Mid-Tex Division transportation $ 179,628 $ 162,808 $ 125,973 $ 16,820 $ 36,835 Third-party transportation 66,939 64,158 73,676 2,781 (9,518 ) Storage and park and lend services 5,985 6,764 7,995 (779 ) (1,231 ) Other 16,348 13,621 11,729 2,727 1,892 Gross profit 268,900 247,351 219,373 21,549 27,978 Operating expenses 129,047 118,527 111,098 10,520 7,429 Operating income 139,853 128,824 108,275 11,029 20,549 Miscellaneous income (expense) (2,285 ) (1,051 ) 4,715 (1,234 ) (5,766 ) Interest charges 30,678 29,414 31,432 1,264 (2,018 ) Income before income taxes 106,890 98,359 81,558 8,531 16,801 Income tax expense 38,630 35,300 29,143 3,330 6,157 Net income $ 68,260 $ 63,059 $ 52,415 $ 5,201 $ 10,644 Gross pipeline transportation volumes MMcf 649,740 640,732 620,904 9,008 19,828 Consolidated pipeline transportation volumes MMcf 467,178 466,527 435,012 651 31,515 Fiscal year ended September 30, 2013 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 The $21.5 million increase in regulated transmission and storage gross profit compared to the prior-year period was primarily a result of the Gas Reliability Infrastructure Program (GRIP) filings approved by the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) during fiscal 2012 and 2013. During fiscal 2012, the RRC approved the Atmos Pipeline - Texas GRIP filing with an annual operating income increase of $14.7 million, effective April 2012. On May 7, 2013, the RRC approved the Atmos Pipeline - Texas GRIP filing with an annual operating income increase of $26.7 million that went into effect with bills rendered on and after May 7, 2013. GRIP filings increased period-over-period gross profit by $19.7 million. This increase was partially offset by a $10.5 million increase in operating expenses largely attributable to increased depreciation expense as a result of increased capital investments and increased levels of pipeline and right-of-way maintenance activities to improve the safety and reliability of our system. The APT rate case approved by the RRC on April 18, 2011 contained an annual adjustment mechanism, approved for a three-year pilot program, that adjusted regulated rates up or down by 75 percent of the difference between APT non-regulated annual revenue and a pre-defined base credit. The annual adjustment mechanism expired on June 30, 2013. APT requested to extend the annual adjustment mechanism until November 1, 2017. A hearing to review the request was held on October 29, 2013 with a final decision expected in December 2013. Fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 The $28.0 million increase in regulated transmission and storage gross profit compared to the prior year was primarily a result of the rate case that was finalized and became effective in May 2011 as well as the GRIP filings approved by the RRC during fiscal 2011 and 2012. In May 2011, the RRC issued an order in the rate case of Atmos Pipeline - Texas that approved an annual operating income increase of $20.4 million. During fiscal 2011, the RRC approved the Atmos Pipeline - Texas GRIP filing with an annual operating income increase of $12.6 million that went into effect in the fiscal fourth quarter. On April 10, 2012, the RRC approved the Atmos Pipeline - Texas GRIP filing with an annual operating income increase of $14.7 million that went into effect with bills rendered on an after April 10, 2012. Operating expenses increased $7.4 million primarily due to a $5.4 million increase in depreciation expense, resulting from higher investment in net plant. 34 Table of Contents Additionally, results for fiscal 2012 were favorably impacted by a state tax benefit of $2.3 million associated with an update of the estimated tax rate at which deferred taxes would reverse in future periods after the completion of the sale of our Missouri, Illinois and Iowa assets. Net income for this segment for fiscal 2011 was favorably impacted by a $6.0 million pre-tax gain recognized in March 2011 as a result of unwinding two Treasury locks ($3.9 million, net of tax). Nonregulated Segment Our nonregulated operations are conducted through Atmos Energy Holdings, Inc. (AEH), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Atmos Energy Corporation and represent approximately five percent of our consolidated net income. AEH's primary business is to buy, sell and deliver natural gas at competitive prices to approximately 1,000 customers located primarily in the Midwest and Southeast areas of the United States. AEH accomplishes this objective by aggregating and purchasing gas supply, arranging transportation and storage logistics and effectively managing commodity price risk. AEH also earns storage and transportation demand fees primarily from our regulated natural gas distribution operations in Louisiana and Kentucky. These demand fees are subject to regulatory oversight and are renewed periodically. Our nonregulated activities are significantly influenced by competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions. Therefore, the margins earned from these activities are dependent upon our ability to attract and retain customers and to minimize the cost of buying, selling and delivering natural gas to offer more competitive pricing to those customers. Further, natural gas market conditions, most notably the price of natural gas and the level of price volatility affect our nonregulated businesses. Natural gas prices and the level of volatility are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, the demand for natural gas in different parts of the country, the level of domestic natural gas production and the level of natural gas inventory levels. Natural gas prices can influence: The demand for natural gas. Higher prices may cause customers to conserve or use alternative energy sources. Conversely, lower prices could cause customers such as electric power generators to switch from alternative energy sources to natural gas. Collection of accounts receivable from customers, which could affect the level of bad debt expense recognized by this segment. The level of borrowings under our credit facilities, which affects the level of interest expense recognized by this segment. Natural gas price volatility can also influence our nonregulated business in the following ways: Price volatility influences basis differentials, which provide opportunities to profit from identifying the lowest cost alternative among the natural gas supplies, transportation and markets to which we have access. Increased or decreased volatility impacts the amounts of unrealized margins recorded in our gross profit and could impact the amount of cash required to collateralize our risk management liabilities. Our nonregulated segment manages its exposure to natural gas commodity price risk through a combination of physical storage and financial instruments. Therefore, results for this segment include unrealized gains or losses on its net physical gas position and the related financial instruments used to manage commodity price risk. These margins fluctuate based upon changes in the spreads between the physical and forward natural gas prices. The magnitude of the unrealized gains and losses is also contingent upon the levels of our net physical position at the end of the reporting period. 35 Table of Contents Review of Financial and Operating Results Financial and operational highlights for our nonregulated segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 are presented below. For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 (In thousands, unless otherwise noted) Realized margins Gas delivery and related services $ 39,839 $ 46,578 $ 58,990 $ (6,739 ) $ (12,412 ) Storage and transportation services 14,641 13,382 14,570 1,259 (1,188 ) Other (103 ) 3,179 1,841 (3,282 ) 1,338 Total realized margins 54,377 63,139 75,401 (8,762 ) (12,262 ) Unrealized margins 8,954 (8,015 ) (10,401 ) 16,969 2,386 Gross profit 63,331 55,124 65,000 8,207 (9,876 ) Operating expenses, excluding asset impairment 44,404 36,886 39,113 7,518 (2,227 ) Asset impairment 5,288 30,270 (5,288 ) (24,982 ) Operating income (loss) 18,927 12,950 (4,383 ) 5,977 17,333 Miscellaneous income 2,316 1,035 657 1,281 378 Interest charges 2,168 3,084 4,015 (916 ) (931 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 19,075 10,901 (7,741 ) 8,174 18,642 Income tax expense (benefit) 7,493 5,612 (209 ) 1,881 5,821 Income (loss) from continuing operations 11,582 5,289 (7,532 ) 6,293 12,821 Loss on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax (355 ) (355 ) Net income (loss) $ 11,227 $ 5,289 $ (7,532 ) $ 5,938 $ 12,821 Gross nonregulated delivered gas sales volumes MMcf 396,561 400,512 446,903 (3,951 ) (46,391 ) Consolidated nonregulated delivered gas sales volumes MMcf 343,669 351,628 384,799 (7,959 ) (33,171 ) Net physical position (Bcf) 12.0 18.8 21.0 (6.8 ) (2.2 ) Fiscal year ended September 30, 2013 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 Gross profit increased $8.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2013 compared to the prior year. Realized margins decreased $8.8 million , primarily attributable to lower gas delivery margins. Consolidated sales volumes decreased two percent due to increased competition which reduced industrial and power generation sales. The impact of lower sales volumes was compounded by a decrease in per-unit margins from 11.6 cents per Mcf to 10.0 cents per Mcf. This decrease was offset by an increase of $17.0 million in unrealized margins, primarily due to the year-over-year timing of realized margins on the settlement of hedged natural gas inventory positions. Operating expenses increased $7.5 million , primarily due to increased litigation and software support costs, partially offset by reduced employee costs. Miscellaneous income increased $1.3 million primarily due to a gain realized from the sale of a peaking power facility and related assets during the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 Realized margins for gas delivery, storage and transportation services and other services were $63.1 million during the year ended September 30, 2012 compared with $75.4 million for fiscal 2011. The decrease reflects the following: A nine percent decrease in consolidated sales volumes. The decrease was largely attributable to warmer weather, which reduced sales to utility, municipal and other weather-sensitive customers. A $0.02/Mcf decrease in gas delivery per-unit margins compared to the prior year primarily due to lower basis differentials resulting from increased natural gas supply and increased transportation costs. 36 Table of Contents Unrealized margins increased $2.4 million in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to the year-over-year timing of realized margins on the settlement of hedged natural gas inventory positions. Operating expenses, excluding asset impairments decreased $2.2 million primarily due to lower employee-related expenses. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we recorded a $5.3 million noncash charge to impair our natural gas gathering assets located in Kentucky. The charge reflected a reduction in the value of the project due to the current low natural gas price environment and management decision to focus AEH activities on its gas delivery, storage and transportation services. In fiscal 2011, asset impairments included an asset impairment charge of $19.3 million related to our investment in our Fort Necessity storage project as well as an $11.0 million pre-tax impairment charge related to the write-off of certain natural gas gathering assets. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The liquidity required to fund our working capital, capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a variety of sources, including internally generated funds and borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities. Additionally, we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis. Finally, from time to time, we raise funds from the public debt and equity capital markets to fund our liquidity needs. We regularly evaluate our funding strategy and profile to ensure that we (i) have sufficient liquidity for our short-term and long-term needs in a cost-effective manner and (ii) maintain our debt to capitalization ratio in a target range of 50 to 55 percent. The following table presents our capitalization as of September 30, 2013 and 2012 : September 30 2013 2012 (In thousands, except percentages) Short-term debt $ 367,984 6.8 % $ 570,929 11.7 % Long-term debt 2,455,671 45.4 % 1,956,436 40.0 % Shareholders equity 2,580,409 47.8 % 2,359,243 48.3 % Total capitalization, including short-term debt $ 5,404,064 100.0 % $ 4,886,608 100.0 % Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, including short-term debt, was 52.2 percent and 51.7 percent at September 30, 2013 and 2012 . On January 11, 2013, we issued $500 million of 4.15% 30-year unsecured senior notes, which, in effect, replaced our $250 million 5.125% 10-year unsecured senior notes we redeemed in August 2012, on a long-term basis. The net proceeds of approximately $494 million were used to repay $260 million outstanding under our short-term financing facility used to redeem our 5.125% senior notes and to partially repay commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes. Going forward, we anticipate our capital spending will be more consistent with levels experienced during fiscal 2013 as we continue to invest in the safety and reliability of our distribution and transportation system. We plan to continue to fund our growth and maintain a balanced capital structure through the use of long-term debt securities and, to a lesser extent, equity. Further, $500 million of long-term debt will mature in October 2014. We plan to issue new senior notes to replace this maturing debt. During the current year, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to fix the Treasury yield component associated with this anticipated issuance at 3.129%. We believe the liquidity provided by our senior notes and committed credit facilities, combined with our operating cash flows, will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs and capital expenditure program for fiscal year 2014 . Cash Flows Our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors, some of which we cannot control. These factors include regulatory changes, the price for our services, the demand for such products and services, margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices, operational risks and other factors. 37 Table of Contents Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended September 30, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 are presented below. For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 (In thousands) Total cash provided by (used in) Operating activities $ 613,127 $ 586,917 $ 582,844 $ 26,210 $ 4,073 Investing activities (696,914 ) (609,260 ) (627,386 ) (87,654 ) 18,126 Financing activities 85,747 (44,837 ) 44,009 130,584 (88,846 ) Change in cash and cash equivalents 1,960 (67,180 ) (533 ) 69,140 (66,647 ) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 64,239 131,419 131,952 (67,180 ) (533 ) Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 66,199 $ 64,239 $ 131,419 $ 1,960 $ (67,180 ) Cash flows from operating activities Year-over-year changes in our operating cash flows primarily are attributable to changes in net income, working capital changes, particularly within our natural gas distribution segment resulting from the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections, payments for natural gas purchases and purchased gas cost recoveries. The significant factors impacting our operating cash flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below. Fiscal Year ended September 30, 2013 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013 , we generated operating cash flow of $613.1 million from operating activities compared with $586.9 million in the prior year. The year-over-year increase reflects changes in working capital offset by a $10.5 million decrease in contributions made to our pension and postretirement plans in the current year. Fiscal Year ended September 30, 2012 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 , we generated operating cash flow of $586.9 million from operating activities compared with $582.8 million in fiscal 2011 . The year-over-year increase reflects changes in working capital offset by a $56.7 million increase in contributions made to our pension and postretirement plans during fiscal 2012. Cash flows from investing activities Our ongoing capital expenditure program enables us to provide safe and reliable natural gas distribution services to our existing customer base, expand our natural gas distribution services into new markets and enhance the integrity of our pipelines. In recent years, we have increased our level of capital spending to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution system and to expand our intrastate pipeline network. Over the last three fiscal years, approximately 68 percent of our capital spending has been committed to improving the safety and reliability of our system. Over the next five years, we anticipate our capital spending will be more consistent with levels experienced during fiscal 2013 as we continue to invest in the safety and reliability of our distribution and transportation system. Where possible, we will also continue to focus our capital spending in jurisdictions that permit us to earn an adequate return timely on our investment without compromising the safety or reliability of our system. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013 , we incurred $845.0 million for capital expenditures compared with $732.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 and $623.0 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 . Fiscal Year ended September 30, 2013 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 The $112.1 million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily reflects spending incurred for the Line W and Line WX expansion projects and increased cathodic protection spending in our regulated transmission and storage segment. Fiscal Year ended September 30, 2012 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 The $109.9 million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily reflects spending for the steel service line replacement program in the Mid-Tex Division, the development of new customer billing and information systems for our natural gas distribution and our nonregulated segments and increased capital spending to increase the capacity on our Atmos Pipeline Texas system. 38 Table of Contents Cash flows from financing activities We received a net $85.7 million and $44.0 million in cash from financing activities for fiscal years 2013 and 2011. In fiscal 2012, we used a net $44.8 million in financing activities. Our significant financing activities for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 are summarized as follows: 2013 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013 , our financing activities generated $85.7 million of cash compared with $44.8 million of cash used in the prior year. Current year cash flows from financing activities were significantly influenced by the issuance of $500 million 4.15% 30-year unsecured senior notes on January 11, 2013. We used a portion of the net cash proceeds of $493.8 million to repay a $260 million short-term financing facility executed in fiscal 2012, to settle, for $66.6 million, three Treasury Locks associated with the issuance and to reduce short-term debt borrowings by $167.2 million. 2012 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 , our financing activities used $44.8 million of cash, primarily due to the payment of $257.0 million associated with the early redemption of our $250 million 5.125% Senior notes that were scheduled to mature in January 2013. The repayment of our $250 million 5.125% Senior notes was financed using a $260 million short-term loan. Additionally, we repurchased $12.5 million of common stock under our 2011 share repurchase program. 2011 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 , our financing activities generated $44.0 million of cash, primarily related to the issuance of $400 million 5.50% Senior Notes in June 2011 and the related settlement of three Treasury locks for $20.1 million. We used a portion of the net cash proceeds of $394.5 million to pay scheduled long-term debt repayments, including our $350 million 7.375% senior notes that were paid on their maturity date in May 2011. Additionally, we received $27.8 million cash in March 2011 related to the unwinding of two Treasury locks. The following table shows the number of shares issued for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 : For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2013 2012 2011 Shares issued: 1998 Long-term incentive plan 531,672 482,289 675,255 Outside directors stock-for-fee plan 2,088 2,375 2,385 Total shares issued 533,760 484,664 677,640 The increase in the number of shares issued in fiscal 2013 compared with the number of shares issued in fiscal 2012 primarily reflects the type of awards that were issued from the 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). In the current year, employees were issued restricted stock units, for which we issued new shares. In the prior year, employees were issued restricted stock awards, which were held in trust and did not require the issuance of new shares. During fiscal 2013 , we canceled and retired 133,449 shares attributable to federal withholdings on equity awards which are not included in the table above. At September 30, 2013, of the 8.7 million shares authorized for issuance from the LTIP, 1.4 million shares remained available. The decreased number of shares issued in fiscal 2012 compared with the number of shares issued in fiscal 2011 primarily reflects the exercise of a significant number of stock options during fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2012, we canceled and retired 153,255 shares attributable to federal withholdings on equity awards and repurchased and retired 387,991 shares attributable to our share repurchase program, which are not included in the table above. Credit Facilities Our short-term borrowing requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business. Changes in the price of natural gas and the amount of natural gas we need to supply to meet our customers needs could significantly affect our borrowing requirements. We finance our short-term borrowing requirements through a combination of a $950 million commercial paper program, which is collateralized by our $950 million unsecured credit facility, as well as three additional committed revolving credit facilities and one uncommitted revolving credit facility with third-party lenders. As a result, we have approximately $1 billion of working capital funding. Additionally, our $950 million unsecured credit facility has an accordion feature, which, if utilized, would increase borrowing capacity to $1.2 billion. We also use intercompany credit facilities to supplement the funding provided by these third-party committed credit facilities. Shelf Registration 39 Table of Contents On March 28, 2013, we filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue, from time to time, up to $1.75 billion in common stock and/or debt securities available for issuance, which replaced our registration statement that expired on March 31, 2013. As of September 30, 2013, $1.75 billion was available under the shelf registration statement. Credit Ratings Our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain short-term and long-term financing, in addition to the cost of such financing. In determining our credit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors, including debt to total capitalization, operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt, operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status. In addition, the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time, the quality of our management and business strategy, the risks associated with our regulated and nonregulated businesses and the regulatory environment in the states where we operate. Our debt is rated by three rating agencies: Standard & Poor Corporation (S&P), Moody Investors Service (Moody s) and Fitch Ratings, Ltd. (Fitch). Our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows: S&P Moody Fitch Unsecured senior long-term debt A- Baa1 A- Commercial paper A-2 P-2 F-2 On October 8, 2013, S&P upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to A- from BBB+, with a ratings outlook of stable, citing an improved business risk profile from an increasing contribution of earnings from our regulated operations and focusing our nonregulated operations on our delivered gas business. A significant degradation in our operating performance or a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of deteriorating global or national financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the three credit rating agencies. This would mean more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. The highest investment grade credit rating is AAA for S&P, Aaa for Moody and AAA for Fitch. The lowest investment grade credit rating is BBB- for S&P, Baa3 for Moody and BBB- for Fitch. Our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. There can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered, or withdrawn entirely, by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Debt Covenants We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of September 30, 2013 . Our debt covenants are described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. 40 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table provides information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments at September 30, 2013 .

(2) Interest charges were calculated using the stated rate for each debt issuance. (3) Gas purchase commitments were determined based upon contractually determined volumes at prices estimated based upon the index specified in the contract, adjusted for estimated basis differentials and contractual discounts as of September 30, 2013 . (4) See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. (5) Represents third party contractual demand fees for contracted storage in our nonregulated segment. Contractual demand fees for contracted storage for our natural gas distribution segment are excluded as these costs are fully recoverable through our purchase gas adjustment mechanisms. (6) Represents third party contractual demand fees for transportation in our nonregulated segment. (7) Represents liabilities for natural gas commodity financial instruments that were valued as of September 30, 2013 . The ultimate settlement amounts of these remaining liabilities are unknown because they are subject to continuing market risk until the financial instruments are settled. (8) Represents expected contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans, which are discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. (9) Represents liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions claimed or expected to be claimed on tax returns. With the exception of our Mid-Tex Division, our natural gas distribution segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year. Commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices. Commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of individual contracts. Our Mid-Tex Division maintains long-term supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of natural gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market prices. The estimated commitments under the terms of these contracts as of September 30, 2013 are reflected in the table above. AEH has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural gas under contracts indexed to the forward NYMEX strip or fixed price contracts. At September 30, 2013 , AEH was committed to purchase 78.0 Bcf within one year, 21.9 Bcf within one to three years and 1.0 Bcf after three years under indexed contracts. AEH is committed to purchase 6.1 Bcf within one year and 0.2 Bcf within one to three years under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from $3.32 to $6.36 per Mcf. 41 Table of Contents Risk Management Activities As discussed above in our Critical Accounting Policies, we use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk and, periodically, to manage interest rate risk. We conduct risk management activities through our natural gas distribution and nonregulated segments. In our natural gas distribution segment, we use a combination of physical storage, fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winter-period gas price increases. In our nonregulated segments, we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments, including futures, over-the-counter and exchange-traded options and swap contracts with counterparties. To the extent our inventory cost and actual sales and actual purchases do not correlate with the changes in the market indices we use in our hedges, we could experience ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting requirements for hedge accounting, resulting in the financial instruments being treated as mark to market instruments through earnings. We record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities, which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument. Substantially all of our financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices. The following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our natural gas distribution segment financial instruments for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013 (in thousands): Fair value of contracts at September 30, 2012 $ (76,260 ) Contracts realized/settled 2,590 Fair value of new contracts 3,077 Other changes in value 180,241 Fair value of contracts at September 30, 2013 $ 109,648 The fair value of our natural gas distribution segment financial instruments at September 30, 2013 , is presented below by time period and fair value source: Fair Value of Contracts at September 30, 2013 Maturity in years Source of Fair Value Less than 1 1-3 4-5 Greater than 5 Total Fair Value (In thousands) Prices actively quoted $ 294 $ 109,354 $ $ $ 109,648 Prices based on models and other valuation methods Total Fair Value $ 294 $ 109,354 $ $ $ 109,648 The following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our nonregulated segment financial instruments for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013 (in thousands): Fair value of contracts at September 30, 2012 $ (15,123 ) Contracts realized/settled (245 ) Fair value of new contracts Other changes in value 668 Fair value of contracts at September 30, 2013 (14,700 ) Netting of cash collateral 24,829 Cash collateral and fair value of contracts at September 30, 2013 $ 10,129 42 Table of Contents The fair value of our nonregulated segment financial instruments at September 30, 2013 , is presented below by time period and fair value source.

These programs include medical and dental insurance coverage and pension and postretirement programs. Medical and Dental Insurance We offer medical and dental insurance programs to substantially all of our employees, and we believe these programs are consistent with other programs in our industry. Since 2006, we have experienced medical and prescription inflation of approximately four percent. In recent years, we have strived to actively manage our health care costs through the introduction of a wellness strategy that is focused on helping employees to identify health risks and to manage these risks through improved lifestyle choices. In March 2010, President Obama signed The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act into law (the Health Care Reform Act ). The Health Care Reform Act will be phased in over an eight-year period. We have changed the design of our health care plans to comply with provisions of the Health Care Reform Act that have already gone into effect or will be going into effect in future years. We will continue to monitor all developments on health care reform and continue to comply with all existing relevant laws and regulations. For fiscal 2014 , we anticipate an approximate six percent medical and prescription drug inflation rate, primarily due to anticipated higher claims costs and the implementation of the Health Care Reform Act. Net Periodic Pension and Postretirement Benefit Costs For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013 , our total net periodic pension and other benefits costs was $78.5 million , compared with $69.2 million and $56.6 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 . These costs relating to our natural gas distribution operations are recoverable through our gas distribution rates. A portion of these costs is capitalized into our gas distribution rate base, and the remaining costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense. Our fiscal 2013 costs were determined using a September 30, 2012 measurement date. At that date, interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates were lower than the interest and corporate bond rates as of September 30, 2011 , the measurement date for our fiscal 2012 net periodic cost. As a result of the lower interest and corporate bond rates, we decreased the discount rate used to determine our fiscal 2013 pension and benefit costs to 4.04 percent. Our expected return on our pension plan assets was maintained at 7.75 percent due to historical experience and the current market projection of the target asset allocation. As a result, our fiscal 2013 pension and postretirement medical costs were higher than in the prior year. The increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits costs during fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 primarily reflects the decrease in our discount rate at September 30, 2011 , the measurement date for our fiscal 2012 pension and postretirement costs. The discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan liabilities generally is based on rates of high-grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which the benefits will be paid. At our September 30, 2011 measurement date, the interest and corporate bond rates used to determine our fiscal 2012 net periodic pension cost were significantly lower than the rates at September 30, 2010, the measurement date used to determine our fiscal 2011 net periodic cost. Our expected return on our pension plan assets was reduced to 7.75 percent due to historical experience and the then-current market projection of the target asset allocation. Pension and Postretirement Plan Funding Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to comply with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). However, additional voluntary contributions are 43 Table of Contents made from time to time as considered necessary. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future. In accordance with the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), we determined the funded status of our plans as of January 1, 2013. Based on this valuation, we were required to contribute cash of $32.7 million , $46.5 million and $0.9 million to our pension plans during fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 . The higher level of contributions experienced during fiscal 2013 and 2012 reflect lower discount rates than in previous years. Each contribution increased the level of our plan assets to achieve a desirable PPA funding threshold. We contributed $26.6 million and $22.1 million to our postretirement benefits plans for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2013 and 2012 . The contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory commissions. Outlook for Fiscal 2014 and Beyond As of September 30, 2013 , interest and corporate bond rates were higher than the rates as of September 30, 2012. Therefore, we increased the discount rate used to measure our fiscal 2014 net periodic cost from 4.04 percent to 4.95 percent. However, we decreased the expected return on plan assets from 7.75 percent to 7.25 percent in the determination of our fiscal 2014 net periodic pension cost based upon expected market returns for our targeted asset allocation. As a result of the net impact of changes in these and other assumptions, we expect our fiscal 2014 net period pension cost to decrease by less than five percent. Based upon market conditions subsequent to September 30, 2013 , the current funded position of the plans and the funding requirements under the PPA, we anticipate contributing between $15 million and $25 million to the Plans in fiscal 2014 . Further, we will consider whether an additional voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain PPA funding thresholds. With respect to our postretirement medical plans, we anticipate contributing between $25 million and $30 million during fiscal 2014 . Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension costs ultimately recognized. A 0.25 percent change in our discount rate would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately $2.8 million. A 0.25 percent change in our expected rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately $1.0 million. The projected pension liability, future funding requirements and the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the Plan are subject to change, depending upon the actuarial value of plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date. These amounts are impacted by actual investment returns, changes in interest rates and changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plan. RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS Recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
