Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition. Management discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes to enhance the understanding of our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. References in this document to Viacom, Company, we, us and our mean Viacom Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise. Significant components of the management discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition section include: Page Overview : The overview section provides a summary of Viacom and our reportable business segments and the principal factors affecting our results of operations. 30 Results of Operations : The results of operations section provides an analysis of our results on a consolidated and reportable segment basis for the three years ended September 30, 2014. In addition, we provide a discussion of items affecting the comparability of our results of operations. 32 Liquidity and Capital Resources : The liquidity and capital resources section provides a discussion of our cash flows for the three years ended September 30, 2014, and of our outstanding debt, commitments and contingencies existing as of September 30, 2014. 41 Market Risk : The market risk section discusses how we manage exposure to market and interest rate risks. 45 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates : The critical accounting policies and estimates section provides detail with respect to accounting policies that are considered by management to require significant judgment and use of estimates and that could have a significant impact on our financial statements. 45 Other Matters : The other matters section provides a discussion of related party transactions and agreements. 49 OVERVIEW Summary We are a leading global entertainment content company that connects with audiences in more than 165 countries and territories and creates compelling television programs, motion pictures, short-form video, apps, games, brands for consumer products, social media and other entertainment content. We operate through two reporting segments: Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment . Our measure of segment performance is adjusted operating income (loss). We define adjusted operating income (loss) for our segments as operating income (loss), before equity-based compensation and certain other items identified as affecting comparability, including restructuring, asset impairments and other charges, when applicable. Equity-based compensation is excluded from our segment measure of performance since it is set and approved by the Compensation Committee of Viacom Board of Directors in consultation with corporate executive management, and is included as a component of consolidated adjusted operating income. When applicable, we use consolidated adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom and adjusted diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) from continuing operations, among other measures, to evaluate our actual operating performance and for planning and forecasting of future periods. We believe that the adjusted results provide 30 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) relevant and useful information for investors because they clarify our actual operating performance, make it easier to compare our results with those of other companies and allow investors to review performance in the same way as our management. Since these are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom and diluted EPS as indicators of operating performance and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. For a reconciliation of our adjusted measures and discussion of the items affecting comparability, refer to the section entitled Factors Affecting Comparability . Media Networks Our Media Networks segment, which includes brands such as MTV, VH1, CMT, Logo, BET, CENTRIC, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., TeenNick, Nicktoons, Nick at Nite, Comedy Central, TV Land, SPIKE, Channel 5 (UK), Tr3s, the Paramount Channel and VIVA, among others, provides entertainment content and related branded products for consumers in targeted demographics attractive to advertisers, content distributors and retailers. We create, acquire and distribute programming and other content to our audiences across multiple platforms, which allows our audiences to engage and interact with our content in a variety of ways: through traditional cable and satellite distribution, on connected TVs, PCs, tablets and other mobile devices, and using apps, browsers and other interfaces. Our Media Networks segment generates revenues in three categories: (i) the sale of advertising and marketing services related to our content, (ii) affiliate fees from multichannel television service providers, including cable television operators, direct-to-home satellite television operators and telecommunications operators, subscription and advertising supported video-on-demand services, and other distributors of our programming and program services, and (iii) ancillary revenues, which include consumer products licensing, brand licensing, sale of content on DVDs and Blu-ray discs, licensing of our content for download-to-own and download-to-rent services and television syndication. Demand and pricing for our advertising depend on our ratings and overall market conditions. We also drive additional demand through integrated sales of digital advertising inventory and through our marketing services, providing unique branded entertainment and custom sponsorship opportunities to our advertisers. Our advertising revenues may be affected by the strength of advertising markets and general economic conditions and may fluctuate depending on the success of our programming, as measured by viewership, at any given time. Audience measurement ratings may vary due to the timing of availability of new episodes of popular programming, success of our programming and performance of competing programs and other entertainment alternatives for viewers, as well as variations related to the methods used by third parties to measure ratings. Advertising revenues may also fluctuate due to seasonal variations, the timing of holidays and significant programming events such as awards shows or premieres. Typically, advertising revenues are highest in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Affiliate revenue agreements with multichannel television service providers are generally multi-year carriage agreements with set rate increases that provide us with a reasonably stable source of revenues. The amount of the fees we receive is generally a function of the number of subscribers and the rates we receive per subscriber. Expirations of these affiliate agreements are staggered. Certain other distribution agreements include multiple programs made available for distribution on one or more dates and revenue under such arrangements fluctuates depending on the initial availability of the programs licensed. Our ancillary revenues vary based on consumer spending, the popularity of our programming, volume of content available for sale during a particular period and acceptance of our or our partners products. Media Networks segment expenses consist of operating expenses, selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses and depreciation and amortization. Operating expenses are comprised of costs related to original and acquired programming, including programming amortization, expenses associated with the distribution of home entertainment products and consumer products licensing, participation fees, integrated marketing expenses and other costs of sales. SG&A expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, marketing, research and professional service fees and facility and occupancy costs. Depreciation and amortization expenses reflect depreciation of fixed assets, including transponders financed under capital leases, and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. Filmed Entertainment Our Filmed Entertainment segment produces, finances, acquires and distributes motion pictures, television programming and other entertainment content under the Paramount Pictures, Paramount Vantage, Paramount Classics, Insurge Pictures, MTV Films, Nickelodeon Movies and Paramount Television brands. Paramount Television, a new television production division, is focused on developing programming for television and digital platforms. 31 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Motion pictures produced, acquired and/or distributed by the Filmed Entertainment segment are exhibited theatrically domestically and internationally, followed by their release in various windows, through download-to-own, DVDs and Blu-ray discs, transactional video-on-demand, pay television and subscription video-on-demand, basic cable television, broadcast television, and syndicated television and, in some cases, by other exhibitors such as airlines and hotels (the distribution windows ). Our Filmed Entertainment segment generates revenues worldwide principally from: (i) the theatrical release and/or distribution of motion pictures, (ii) home entertainment, which includes sales of DVDs and Blu-ray discs relating to the motion pictures we release theatrically and direct-to-DVD, as well as content distributed on behalf of Viacom and third parties, (iii) licensing of film exhibition rights to television services, including transactional video-on-demand, pay and basic cable television, broadcast television and syndicated television and (iv) ancillary revenues from licensing of film exhibition rights to digital platforms through subscription video-on-demand, download-to-own, digital transactional video-on-demand, providing production services to third parties, primarily at Paramount studio lot, licensing of its brands for consumer products and theme parks, and distribution of content specifically developed for digital platforms and game distribution. Paramount releases films theatrically in domestic and international markets and generates revenues from audience ticket sales. Each motion picture is a separate and distinct product with its revenues, and ultimate profitability, dependent upon many factors, among which audience response is of fundamental importance. Theatrical revenues may be also affected by the number, timing and mix of competitive releases in any given period, consumer tastes and consumption habits, and overall economic conditions, including trends in discretionary spending. The theatrical success of a motion picture is a significant factor in determining the revenues it is likely to generate in home entertainment sales and licensing fees during the various other distribution windows. Revenues from motion picture theatrical releases tend to be cyclical with increases around the holidays that fall during the first quarter of our fiscal year, and in the summer months during our fourth quarter. Our home entertainment revenues may be affected by the number, timing and mix of home entertainment releases in any given period, consumer tastes and consumption habits, the prominence given by distributors and retailers to our releases compared to those of our competitors, and overall economic conditions, including consumer preference for rental or purchase and trends in discretionary spending. The mix of our revenues from home entertainment is shifting away from physical home entertainment toward digital forms of consumption. Filmed Entertainment segment expenses consist of operating expenses, SG&A expenses and depreciation and amortization. Operating expenses principally include the amortization of film costs of our released feature films (including participations and residuals), print and advertising expenses and other distribution costs. We incur marketing costs before and throughout the theatrical release of a film and, to a lesser extent, other distribution windows. Such costs are incurred to generate public interest in our films and are expensed as incurred; therefore, we typically incur losses with respect to a particular film prior to and during the film theatrical exhibition and profitability may not be realized until well after a film theatrical release. Therefore, the results of the Filmed Entertainment segment can be volatile as films work their way through the various distribution windows. SG&A expenses include employee compensation, facility and occupancy costs, professional service fees and other overhead costs. Depreciation and amortization expense principally consists of depreciation of fixed assets. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2014 vs. 2013 Consolidated Results of Operations Our summary consolidated results of operations are presented below for the years ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 . Year Ended September 30, Better/(Worse) (in millions, except per share amounts) 2014 2013 $ % Revenues $ 13,783 $ 13,794 $ (11 ) % Operating income 4,082 3,836 246 6 Adjusted operating income 4,125 3,942 183 5 Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom 2,392 2,407 (15 ) (1 ) Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom 2,376 2,316 60 3 Diluted EPS from continuing operations 5.43 4.86 0.57 12 Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations $ 5.40 $ 4.68 $ 0.72 15 % 32 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) See the section entitled Factors Affecting Comparability for a reconciliation of our adjusted measures to our reported results. Revenues Worldwide revenues were substantially flat at $13.783 billion in the year ended September 30, 2014 . Filmed Entertainment revenues decreased $557 million , principally due to lower revenues across the distribution windows reflecting the number and mix of films. Media Networks contributed a partially offsetting increase in revenues of $515 million principally reflecting higher affiliate fees and advertising revenues. Operating Income Adjusted operating income increased $183 million , or 5% , to $4.125 billion in the year ended September 30, 2014 . Media Networks adjusted operating income increased $175 million , reflecting higher revenues, partially offset by an increase in expenses. Filmed Entertainment adjusted operating income decreased $29 million , reflecting the benefit of Marvel distribution rights sales in the prior year. Corporate expenses decreased 10% in the period, primarily due to lower deferred compensation costs. Adjusted results exclude the impact of a $43 million non-cash impairment charge in 2014 and the impact of $106 million of restructuring, asset impairment and other charges in 2013. Including these items in both years, operating income increased $246 million , or 6% . See the section entitled Segment Results of Operations for a more in-depth discussion of the revenues, expenses and adjusted operating income for each of the Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment segments. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Viacom Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom increased $60 million , or 3% , to $2.376 billion in the year ended September 30, 2014 . The increase in tax-effected adjusted operating income described above, higher equity in net earnings of investee companies and a lower effective income tax rate were partially offset by an increase in interest expense, reflecting higher levels of debt outstanding, and higher net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, which includes the renewal of a content distribution arrangement at a consolidated majority-owned joint venture. Our effective income tax rate was 31.4% in 2014 , as compared with 32.9% in 2013 , excluding the impact of discrete tax items. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is principally due to incremental tax benefits associated with qualified production activities, as well as a change in the mix of domestic and international income. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations increased $0.72 per diluted share to $5.40 , reflecting fewer outstanding shares and the impact of higher tax-effected adjusted operating income, partially offset by an increase in interest expense. In addition to the operating items mentioned above, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom exclude a loss on the extinguishment of debt in 2014 and gains from the sales of our 20% interest in HBO Pacific Partners, V.O.F. ( HBO Pacific Partners ) and our 22.5% interest in LAPTV, LLC ( LAPTV ) in 2013, as well as discrete taxes in both years. Including these items in both years, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom decreased $15 million , or 1% , and diluted EPS from continuing operations increased $0.57 per diluted share to $5.43 . Segment Results of Operations Transactions between reportable segments are accounted for as third-party arrangements for the purposes of presenting segment results of operations. Typical intersegment transactions include the purchase of advertising by the Filmed Entertainment segment on Media Networks properties and the purchase of Filmed Entertainment feature films exhibition rights by Media Networks . 33 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Media Networks Year Ended September 30, Better/(Worse) (in millions) 2014 2013 $ % Revenues by Component Advertising $ 4,953 $ 4,855 $ 98 2 % Affiliate fees 4,660 4,245 415 10 Ancillary 558 556 2 Total revenues by component $ 10,171 $ 9,656 $ 515 5 % Expenses Operating $ 3,622 $ 3,405 $ (217 ) (6 )% Selling, general and administrative 2,130 2,011 (119 ) (6 ) Depreciation and amortization 148 144 (4 ) (3 ) Total expenses $ 5,900 $ 5,560 $ (340 ) (6 ) Adjusted Operating Income $ 4,271 $ 4,096 $ 175 4 % Revenues Worldwide revenues increased $515 million , or 5% , to $10.171 billion in the year ended September 30, 2014 , driven primarily by higher affiliate fees and advertising revenues.

Revenues Worldwide revenues decreased $93 million , or 1% , to $13.794 billion in the year ended September 30, 2013 . Filmed Entertainment revenues decreased $538 million , principally due to lower revenues across the distribution windows reflecting the number and mix of films, partially offset by higher ancillary revenues.

Filmed Entertainment adjusted operating income decreased $91 million , reflecting lower contribution from prior period releases and catalog, partially offset by higher ancillary revenues. Corporate expenses increased 31% in 2013, primarily due to higher deferred compensation costs reflecting our increased stock price, as well as higher incentive compensation costs and professional fees.

Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Viacom Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom increased $52 million , or 2% , to $2.316 billion in the year ended September 30, 2013 , principally due to the increase in tax-effected adjusted operating income described above and a lower effective income tax rate. Our effective income tax rate was 32.9% in 2013, as compared with 34.0% in 2012, excluding the impact of discrete tax items. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is principally due to a change in the mix of domestic and international income. 36 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations increased $0.47 per diluted share to $4.68 , principally reflecting fewer outstanding shares and the increase in earnings described above.

Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax The $12 million loss from discontinued operations in 2013 primarily reflects interest on the earn-out dispute with the former shareholders of Harmonix Music Systems Inc., a developer of music-based games, and the $364 million loss in 2012 principally reflects a $383 million pre-tax charge related to the dispute. Segment Results of Operations Transactions between reportable segments are accounted for as third-party arrangements for the purposes of presenting segment results of operations. Typical intersegment transactions include the purchase of advertising by the Filmed Entertainment segment on Media Networks properties and the purchase of Filmed Entertainment feature films exhibition rights by Media Networks .

Home Entertainment Worldwide home entertainment revenues decreased $362 million , or 22% , to $1.300 billion in the year ended September 30, 2013 , driven by lower carryover and catalog revenues of $284 million, reflecting the prior period release of Transformers: Dark of the Moon and lower revenues from our 2013 releases of $78 million due to the number and mix of titles released. In 2013, we released fourteen titles, including Madagascar 3: Europe Most Wanted , Star Trek into Darkness , Rise of the Guardians , G.I. Joe: Retaliation , World War Z , Jack Reacher , Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters and Flight . In 2012, we released eighteen 38 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) titles, including Marvel Captain America: The First Avenger , DreamWorks Animation Puss in Boots and Kung Fu Panda 2 , Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol and Super 8 . Domestic and international home entertainment revenues decreased 12% and 32% , respectively. Foreign exchange had a 1-percentage point unfavorable impact on international home entertainment revenues. Television License Fees Television license fees decreased $191 million , or 14% , to $1.203 billion in the year ended September 30, 2013 , driven by the number and mix of available titles. Ancillary Ancillary revenues increased $86 million , or 19% , to $540 million in the year ended September 30, 2013 , principally driven by Marvel distribution rights sales. Expenses Filmed Entertainment segment expenses decreased $447 million , or 10% , to $4.048 billion in the year ended September 30, 2013 , primarily driven by lower operating expenses. Operating Operating expenses decreased $419 million , or 11% , to $3.516 billion in the year ended September 30, 2013 , principally due to the number and mix of our home entertainment and theatrical releases. Film costs decreased $236 million , or 11% . Distribution and other costs, principally print and advertising expenses, decreased $183 million , or 10% . Selling, General and Administrative SG&A expenses decreased $30 million , or 6% , to $443 million in the year ended September 30, 2013 , principally driven by lower overhead costs. Adjusted Operating Income Adjusted operating income decreased $91 million , or 28% , to $234 million in the year ended September 30, 2013 , principally reflecting lower contributions from prior period releases and catalog, partially offset by higher ancillary revenues. Factors Affecting Comparability The Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three years ended September 30, 2014 reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows reported in accordance with GAAP. Results for the aforementioned periods, as discussed in the section entitled Overview , have been affected by certain items identified as affecting comparability. Accordingly, when applicable, we use adjusted measures to evaluate our actual operating performance. The following tables reconcile our adjusted measures to our reported results for the three years ended September 30, 2014 . The tax impacts included in the tables have been calculated using the rates applicable to the adjustments presented. 2014 Year Ended September 30, 2014 (in millions, except per share amounts) Operating Income Pre-tax Earnings from Continuing Operations Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Viacom Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Reported results $ 4,082 $ 3,514 $ 2,392 $ 5.43 Factors Affecting Comparability: Asset impairment 43 43 26 0.06 Loss on extinguishment of debt 11 7 0.02 Discrete tax benefits (49 ) (0.11 ) Adjusted results $ 4,125 $ 3,568 $ 2,376 $ 5.40 Asset impairment : As a result of strategic decisions made by us resulting in channel realignment in several international markets, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $43 million related to an international trade name at Media Networks . 39 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Loss on extinguishment of debt : In April 2014, we redeemed all $600 million of our outstanding 4.375% Senior Notes due September 2014 (the "2014 Notes") at a redemption price equal to the sum of the principal amount and a make-whole amount, together totaling $611 million, and accrued and unpaid interest of $1 million. As a result of the redemption, we recognized a pre-tax extinguishment loss of $11 million . Discrete tax benefits : Our discrete tax benefits are principally related to the reversal of deferred taxes on earnings deemed permanently reinvested and the recognition of capital loss carryforwards . Our effective income tax rate was 31.4% in 2014, excluding the impact of discrete tax items. Discrete tax benefits of $49 million , taken together with the impact of the asset impairment and the loss on extinguishment of debt, contributed 1.5 percentage points of benefit to the effective tax rate, which reconciles to the reported effective rate of 29.9% . 2013 Year Ended September 30, 2013 (in millions, except per share amounts) Operating Income Pre-tax Earnings from Continuing Operations Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Viacom Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Reported results $ 3,836 $ 3,519 $ 2,407 $ 4.86 Factors Affecting Comparability: Restructuring, asset impairment and other charges 106 106 74 0.15 Gain on sale of HBO Pacific Partners and LAPTV (111 ) (111 ) (0.22 ) Discrete tax benefits (54 ) (0.11 ) Adjusted results $ 3,942 $ 3,514 $ 2,316 $ 4.68 Restructuring, asset impairment and other charges : During 2013, we engaged in a global business transformation initiative, which included the migration of certain financial processing systems to an enterprise-wide general ledger system. As a result, we approved a restructuring plan which included severance charges of $86 million ($61 million at Media Networks and $25 million at Filmed Entertainment ). We also undertook a strategic review of some of our brands and incurred a $7 million intangible asset impairment charge resulting from the decision to abandon the asset and $13 million of charges related to management decision to cease use of certain original and acquired programming on one of our Media Networks channels. Gain on sale of HBO Pacific Partners and LAPTV : In 2013, we completed the sales of our 20% interest in HBO Pacific Partners and our 22.5% interest in LAPTV, partnerships that own pay television channels under various brand names and that were accounted for under the equity method. The sales resulted in aggregate total proceeds of $124 million and gain of $111 million . The tax provision associated with the gains was offset by the reversal of a valuation allowance on capital loss carryforwards. Discrete tax benefits : Our discrete tax benefits principally reflect the release of tax reserves with respect to certain effectively settled tax positions, as well as the recognition of certain capital loss carryforward and tax credit benefits. Our effective income tax rate was 32.9% in 2013, excluding the impact of discrete tax items. Discrete tax benefits of $54 million , taken together with the effective income tax rate impact of the restructuring, asset impairment and other charges and the gain on sale of HBO Pacific Partners and LAPTV investments, contributed 2.5 percentage points of benefit to the effective tax rate, which reconciles to the reported effective tax rate of 30.4% . 40 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) 2012 Year Ended September 30, 2012 (in millions, except per share amounts) Operating Income Pre-tax Earnings from Continuing Operations Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Viacom Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Reported results $ 3,901 $ 3,470 $ 2,345 $ 4.36 Factors Affecting Comparability: Loss on extinguishment of debt 21 13 0.02 Discrete tax benefits (94 ) (0.17 ) Adjusted results $ 3,901 $ 3,491 $ 2,264 $ 4.21 Loss on extinguishment of debt : We redeemed all $750 million of our outstanding 6.850% Senior Notes due December 2055 (the 2055 Notes ) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of each 2055 Notes, plus accrued interest thereon. As a result of the redemption, we expensed the unamortized issuance costs associated with the 2055 Notes, which resulted in a pre-tax extinguishment loss of $21 million . Discrete tax benefits : Our discrete tax benefits include certain operating and capital loss carryforward benefits, as well as the release of tax reserves with respect to certain effectively settled tax positions. Our effective income tax rate was 34.0% in 2012, excluding the impact of discrete tax items. Discrete tax benefits of $94 million , taken together with the impact of the loss on extinguishment of debt, contributed 2.7 percentage points of benefit to the effective tax rate, which reconciles to the reported effective rate of 31.3% . LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Sources and Uses of Cash Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided through the operations of our businesses. We have access to external financing sources such as our $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility and the capital markets. Our principal uses of cash from operations include the creation of new programming and film content, acquisitions of third-party content, and interest and income tax payments. We also use cash for discretionary share repurchases under our stock repurchase program, as deemed appropriate, as well as quarterly cash dividends, capital expenditures and acquisitions of businesses. The Media Networks segment consistently generates a significant percentage of our cash flow from operating activities. Advertising is generally purchased by large media buying agencies and our affiliate fees are principally earned from cable and satellite television operators. The Filmed Entertainment segment operational results and ability to generate cash flow from operations substantially depend on the number and timing of films in development and production, the level and timing of print and advertising costs and the public response to our theatrical film and home entertainment releases. In general, our segments require relatively low levels of capital expenditures in relation to our annual cash flow from operations. This contributes to our ability to generate cash flow for future investment in our content and business operations, which we expect to be able to maintain over time. We use commercial paper borrowings, backstopped by our credit facility, to fund short-term domestic liquidity needs principally driven by the timing of our domestic operating cash flows and the amount of share repurchases in the period. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2014 , of which $715 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries and is substantially all deemed permanently reinvested in our foreign operations. While we currently do not intend or foresee a need for repatriating funds held in our foreign subsidiaries, should we require additional capital in the United States ( U.S. ), we could elect to repatriate these funds or access external financing. Repatriating funds could result in a higher effective tax rate and cash taxes paid. We believe that our cash flows from operating activities together with our credit facility provide us with adequate resources to fund our anticipated ongoing cash requirements. We anticipate that future debt maturities will be funded with cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operating activities and future access to capital markets, including our credit facility. 41 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) We may continue to access external financing from time to time depending on our cash requirements, assessments of current and anticipated market conditions and after-tax cost of capital. Our access to capital markets can be impacted by factors outside our control, including economic conditions; however, we believe that our strong cash flows and balance sheet, our credit facility and our credit rating will provide us with adequate access to funding given our expected cash needs. Any new borrowing cost would be affected by market conditions and short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to access capital markets on terms and conditions that will be favorable to us. Cash Flows The net change in cash and cash equivalents for each of the years ended September 30, 2014, 2013 and 2012 is detailed below: Cash Flows (in millions) Year Ended September 30, 2014 2013 2012 Cash provided by operations $ 2,597 $ 3,083 $ 2,498 Net cash flow used in investing activities (855 ) (335 ) (256 ) Net cash flow used in financing activities (3,100 ) (1,159 ) (2,413 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (45 ) (34 ) (2 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,403 ) $ 1,555 $ (173 ) Operating Activities Cash provided by operations was $2.597 billion in 2014, a decrease of $486 million compared with 2013 . The decrease is primarily driven by higher income tax payments. Cash provided by operations was $3.083 billion in 2013, an increase of $585 million compared with 2012 . The increase reflects favorable working capital, principally driven by lower income tax payments. See Note 19 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding income tax payments. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $855 million in 2014, principally reflecting the purchase price for the acquisition of Channel 5 and capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities was $335 million in 2013 , which included payments related to the earn-out dispute with the former shareholders of Harmonix and capital expenditures, partially offset by $124 million of proceeds received from the sales of our investments in HBO Pacific Partners and LAPTV. Cash used in investing activities of $256 million in 2012 , included a payment related to the earn-out dispute with the former shareholders of Harmonix. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $3.100 billion in 2014, primarily driven by the settlement of share repurchases totaling $3.529 billion and dividend payments of $541 million , partially offset by net proceeds of $884 million from debt transactions. Proceeds of $1.484 billion from the issuance of senior notes and debentures with an aggregate face value of $1.5 billion were partially offset by the debt extinguishment payment of $600 million . Cash used in financing activities was $1.159 billion in 2013 , driven by the settlement of share repurchases totaling $4.664 billion and dividends of $555 million , partially offset by the issuance of senior notes and debentures, for aggregate net cash proceeds of $3.732 billion and stock option proceeds of $403 million and $97 million from excess tax benefits, which represents the actual tax deductions in excess of amounts previously recognized. Cash used in financing activities was $2.413 billion in 2012 , driven by the settlement of share repurchases totaling $2.809 billion and dividends of $554 million , partially offset by the net impact of our senior notes and debentures issuances and debt repayments. In May 2014, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.33 per share of Class A and Class B common stock from $0.30 per share, beginning with the dividend paid on July 1, 2014. 42 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Capital Resources Capital Structure and Debt At September 30, 2014 , total debt was $12.769 billion , an increase of $884 million from $11.885 billion at September 30, 2013 . The increase in debt reflects the impact of new issuances of senior notes and debentures. Debt (in millions) September 30, 2014 2013 Senior notes and debentures $ 12,601 $ 11,695 Capital leases and other obligations 168 190 Total debt $ 12,769 $ 11,885 Amounts classified in the current portion of debt consist of the portion of capital leases payable in the next twelve months. Our Senior Notes due in February 2015 and September 2015 are classified as long-term debt as we have the intent as well as the ability, through utilization of our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, to refinance this debt. Senior Notes and Debentures In March 2014, we issued a total of $1.5 billion of senior notes and debentures as follows: 2.200% Senior Notes due April 2019 with an aggregate principal amount of $400 million at a price equal to 99.947% of the principal amount. 3.875% Senior Notes due April 2024 with an aggregate principal amount of $550 million at a price equal to 99.192% of the principal amount. 5.250% Senior Debentures due April 2044 with an aggregate principal amount of $550 million at a price equal to 99.831% of the principal amount. The proceeds, net of the discount and other issuance fees and expenses, from the issuance of the senior notes and debentures were $1.484 billion . We utilized a portion of the proceeds to redeem our Senior Notes due September 2014 as detailed below. We used the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of shares under our stock repurchase program. In April 2014, we redeemed all $600 million of our outstanding 2014 Notes at a redemption price equal to the sum of the principal amount and a make-whole amount, together totaling $611 million , and accrued and unpaid interest of $1 million . As a result of the redemption, we recognized a pre-tax extinguishment loss of $11 million . Our outstanding senior notes and debentures provide for certain covenant packages typical for an investment grade company. There is one acceleration trigger for certain of the senior notes and debentures in the event of a change in control under certain specified circumstances coupled with ratings downgrades due to the change in control. At September 30, 2014 and 2013 , the total unamortized net discount related to the fixed rate senior notes and debentures was $419 million and $425 million , respectively. Credit Facility : At September 30, 2014 and 2013 , there were no amounts outstanding under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility. The credit facility, with a maturity date of November 2017, is used for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper outstanding, if any. The borrowing rate under the credit facility is LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.75% based on our current public debt rating. The credit facility has one principal financial covenant that requires our interest coverage for the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters to be at least 3.0x, which we met at September 30, 2014 . Commercial Paper : At September 30, 2014 and 2013 there was no commercial paper outstanding. The average commercial paper outstanding for the twelve months ending September 30, 2014 , was $563 million, which had a weighted average interest rate of 0.23%. Stock Repurchase Program : During 2014 , we repurchased 40.7 million shares of Class B common stock for an aggregate price of $3.4 billion . From October 1, 2014 through November 12, 2014, we repurchased an additional 3.6 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $260 million , leaving $6.24 billion of remaining capacity under our program. Share repurchases under the program are expected to be funded through a combination of debt and cash generated by operations, as deemed 43 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) appropriate. During 2013 and 2012 , we repurchased 69.2 million and 59.9 million shares for an aggregate price of $4.8 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. Commitments and Contingencies Our commitments primarily consist of programming and talent commitments, operating and capital lease arrangements, and purchase obligations for goods and services. These arrangements result from our normal course of business and represent obligations that may be payable over several years. Additionally, we are subject to a redeemable put option (see Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Guarantees : In the course of our business, we both provide and receive the benefit of indemnities that are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, we may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification agreement. Leases - We have certain indemnification obligations with respect to leases primarily associated with the previously discontinued operations of Famous Players Inc. ( Famous Players ). In addition, we have certain indemnities provided by the acquirer of Famous Players. Other - We have indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. We and our venture partner each have a commitment to guarantee up to approximately $86 million of bank debt of Viacom 18. There were no borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2014 subject to this guarantee. Legal Matters : Litigation is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on our understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, we believe that our litigation to which we are a party is not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our results of continuing operations, financial position or operating cash flows. See Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our guarantees and legal matters. Film Financing Arrangements : From time to time we enter into film financing arrangements that involve the sale of a partial copyright interest in a film to third-party investors. Since the investors typically have the risks and rewards of ownership proportionate to their ownership in the film, we generally record the amounts received for the sale of copyright interest as a reduction of the cost of the film and related cash flows are reflected in net cash flow from operating activities. We also enter into collaborative arrangements with other studios to jointly finance and distribute theatrical productions ( co-financing arrangements ). A co-financing arrangement typically involves joint ownership of the film asset with each partner responsible for distribution of the film in specific territories. The partners share in the profits and losses of the film in accordance with their respective ownership interest. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations include amounts reflected on our balance sheet, as well as off-balance sheet arrangements. At September 30, 2014 , our significant contractual obligations, including payments due for the next five fiscal years and thereafter, were as follows: Contractual Obligations (in millions) Total 1 year 2-3 years 4-5 years After 5 years Off-balance Sheet Arrangements Programming and talent commitments (1) $ 1,873 $ 631 $ 830 $ 307 $ 105 Operating leases (2) 1,876 247 430 245 954 Purchase obligations (3) 1,177 497 345 273 62 On-Balance Sheet Arrangements Capital lease obligations (4) 140 23 50 50 17 Debt 13,068 898 1,818 1,950 8,402 Interest payments 8,940 590 1,088 922 6,340 Other long-term obligations (5) $ 2,559 $ 1,697 $ 706 $ 156 $ (1) Programming and talent commitments include $1.6 billion relating to media networks programming and $273 million for talent contracts. (2) Operating leases include long-term non-cancelable operating lease commitments for office space, equipment, transponders, studio facilities and vehicles. 44 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) (3) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders. (4) Capital lease obligations include capital leases for satellite transponders. (5) Other long-term obligations principally consist of participations, residuals and programming obligations for content that is available for airing. Note: Not included in the amounts above are payments which may result from our defined benefit pension plans of $404 million , unrecognized tax benefits of $225 million, including interest and penalties, interest payments to be made under our credit facility, $216 million of redeemable noncontrolling interest and lease indemnification obligations of approximately $381 million . The amount and timing of payments with respect to these items are subject to a number of uncertainties such that we are unable to make sufficiently reliable estimations of future payments. MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We use or expect to use derivative financial instruments to modify exposure to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In accordance with our policy, we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure, and we do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Foreign Exchange Risk We conduct business in various countries outside the United States, resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. Dollar. We use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge anticipated cash flows and foreign currency balances in such currencies as the British Pound, the Indian Rupee, the Euro, the Brazilian Real, the Japanese Yen, the Australian Dollar, the Singapore Dollar and the Canadian Dollar. We also enter into forward contracts to hedge future production costs or programming obligations. The change in fair value of non-designated foreign exchange contracts is included in current period earnings as part of Other items, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. We manage the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally. At September 30, 2014 and 2013 , the notional value of all foreign exchange contracts was $628 million and $196 million , respectively. In 2014, $390 million related to our foreign currency balances, $154 million related to anticipated investing cash flows and $84 million related to future production costs. In 2013, $178 million related to our foreign currency balances and $18 million related to future production costs and programming obligations. Interest Rate Risk A portion of our interest expense is exposed to movements in short-term rates. Also, interest expense for future long-term debt issues is exposed to movements in long-term rates. Interest rate hedges may be used to modify both of these exposures at our discretion. There were no interest rates hedges outstanding at September 30, 2014 and 2013 . Since the majority of our debt is fixed rate, we do not expect that a 1% increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Viacom has issued senior notes and debentures that, at September 30, 2014 , had an outstanding balance of $12.6 billion and an estimated fair value of $13.7 billion . A 1% increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of the senior notes and debentures by approximately $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion , respectively. Credit Risk We continually monitor our positions with, and credit quality of, our customers and the financial institutions, which are counterparties to our financial instrument agreements. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonpayment by our customers and nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial instrument agreements. However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial instrument agreements and we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover any anticipated nonpayment by our customers. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying 45 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that are considered by management to require significant judgment and use of estimates and that could have a significant impact on our financial statements. An understanding of our critical accounting policies is necessary to analyze our financial results. Our critical accounting policies include our accounting for original production costs, acquired programming rights, multiple-element arrangements, revenue allowances, income taxes and goodwill and other intangible assets. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying our critical accounting policies are provided below. Unless otherwise noted, we applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented, and have discussed such policies with our Audit Committee. For a summary of our significant accounting policies see Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Original Production Costs We capitalize original programming and feature film costs, on a title-specific basis, as Inventory, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We use an individual-film-forecast-computation method to amortize original production costs and to accrue estimated liabilities for residuals and participations over the applicable title life cycle based upon the ratio of current period to estimated remaining total gross revenues ( ultimate revenues ) for each title. The estimate of ultimate revenues impacts the timing of amortization and accrual of residuals and participations. Our estimate of ultimate revenues for feature films includes revenues from all sources that are estimated to be earned within ten years from the date of a film initial theatrical release. For acquired film libraries, our estimate of ultimate revenues is for a period within 20 years from the date of acquisition. Prior to the release of a feature film and throughout its life, we estimate the ultimate revenues based on the historical performance of similar content, as well as incorporating factors of the content itself, including, but not limited to, the expected number of theaters and markets in which the original content will be released, the genre of the original content and the past box office performance of the lead actors and actresses. We believe the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues for films intended for theatrical release is domestic theatrical exhibition, as subsequent markets have historically exhibited a high correlation to domestic theatrical performance. Upon a film release and determination of domestic theatrical performance, our estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimates for films subsequent to their initial release is the extent of home entertainment sales achieved. In addition to theatrical performance, home entertainment sales vary based on a variety of factors including demand for our titles, the volume and quality of competing home entertainment products, marketing and promotional strategies, as well as economic conditions. Upon a film initial release we update our estimate of ultimate revenues based on expected future and actual results. We also review and revise estimates of ultimate revenue and participation costs as of each reporting date to reflect the most current available information. If estimates for a film are revised, the difference between amortization expense determined using the new estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year are charged or credited to our Consolidated Statement of Earnings in the quarter in which the estimates are revised. For original programming, capitalized program costs are amortized over the projected useful life of the programming, depending on genre and historical experience, beginning with the month of initial exhibition. The most sensitive factor affecting ultimate revenues is ratings, which are an indication of audience acceptance and directly impact the level of advertising revenues we will be able to generate during the airing of the programming. Poor ratings may result in abandonment of a program, which would require the immediate write-off of any unamortized production costs. If we believe that the release of our content will not be or has not been favorably received, then we would assess whether the fair value of such content is less than the unamortized portion of its capitalized costs and, if need be, recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the fair value. We utilize the individual-film-forecast-computation method (adjusted to incorporate revenue and related costs, including future exploitation costs, if any, expected to occur in periods beyond 10 years from the date of a film initial release) to develop the cash flows which are subsequently discounted to compute the fair value of a title that is being assessed for impairment. The discount rate utilized takes into account the time value of money as well as a risk premium. The risk premium reflects the uncertainties of realizing the expected cash flows of a title which is impacted by the title position within its product life cycle. 46 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Acquired Programming Rights We report an asset and liability for the rights acquired and obligations incurred at the commencement of the licensing period when the cost of the programming is known or reasonably determinable, the program material has been accepted and the programming is available for airing. The asset is amortized to operating expenses over the license period or projected useful life of the programming, if shorter, commencing upon availability, based on estimated future airings. If initial airings are expected to generate higher revenues an accelerated method of amortization is used. Determining factors used in estimating the useful life of programming include the expected number of future airings, which may differ from the contracted number of airings, the length of the license period and expected future revenues to be generated from the programming. The cost basis of acquired programming is the capitalized cost of each program and is equal to the cost of the programming pursuant to the license agreement less the cumulative amortization recorded for the program. Capitalized costs of rights to program materials are reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value. We evaluate net realizable value of acquired rights programming quarterly on a daypart basis. A daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or an aggregation of programs of a similar type. We aggregate similar programming based on the specific demographic targeted by each respective program service. Net realizable value is determined by estimating advertising revenues to be derived from the future airing of the programming within the daypart as well as an allocation of affiliate fee revenue to programming. An impairment charge may be necessary if our estimates of future cash flows of similar programming are insufficient or if programming is abandoned. Multiple-Element Arrangements We enter into arrangements under which we perform multiple revenue-generating activities. We must allocate consideration to separate units of account in the arrangement, which could impact the timing of revenue recognition. Advertising revenues are principally generated from the sale of advertising time comprised of multiple commercial units. Each advertising spot comprises a deliverable for accounting purposes. Consideration for these arrangements is allocated among the individual advertising spots based on relative fair value using Viacom-specific prices. Certain distributors include multiple programs made available for distribution on one or more dates for a fixed fee. Consideration for such arrangements is allocated among the programs based on relative fair value using management best estimate considering viewing performance and other factors. Revenue Allowances In accordance with the accounting guidance related to revenue recognition when a right of return exists, revenue allowances are recorded to adjust amounts originally invoiced to the estimated net realizable value of a particular product. Upon the sale of home entertainment products to wholesalers and retailers, we record a reduction of revenue for the impact of estimated future returns, rebates and other incentives ( estimated returns ). In determining estimated returns, we consider numerous sources of qualitative and quantitative evidence including forecasted sales data, customers rights of return, units shipped and units remaining at retail, historical return rates for similar product, current economic trends, competitive environment, promotions and sales strategies. Forecasted sales data is determined by comparing a particular release to product that has similar characteristics where applicable, such as franchise, genre, box office levels and release patterns, using regression analysis, decay rates and other tools. Based on the results of this analysis and the sales strategies to be used for the release, we reserve an appropriate percentage of each dollar of product revenue on a title taking into consideration the qualitative and quantitative factors described above. Forecasted sales data is reviewed and updated throughout each quarter and is consistent with the projections of ultimate revenues used in applying the individual-film-forecast-computation method to amortize our film costs. Accordingly, a change in forecasted sales affects both the revenue allowance and related expenses. Actual sell-through data is reviewed as it becomes available against the forecasted sales data to ensure that estimates continue to be consistent with actual sales performance. Our estimate of future returns affects reported revenue and operating income. If we underestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period, then we may record less revenue and related expenses in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amounts. If we overestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period, then we may record additional revenue and related expenses in later periods when returns are less than estimated. An incremental change of 1% in our estimated sales returns rate (i.e., provisions for returns divided by gross sales of related product) for home entertainment products would have a $14 million impact on our total revenue for the year ended September 30, 2014 . This revenue impact would be partially offset by a corresponding impact on related expenses depending on the margin associated with a specific film and other factors. 47 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) We also continually evaluate accounts receivable and establish judgments as to their ultimate collectability. Judgments and estimates involved include an analysis of specific risks on a customer-by-customer basis for larger accounts and an analysis of actual historical write-off experience in conjunction with the length of time the receivables are past due. Using this information, management reserves an amount that is estimated to be uncollectible. An incremental change of 1% in our allowance for uncollectible accounts relative to our trade accounts receivables would have a $27 million impact on our operating results for the year ended September 30, 2014 . Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in determining our annual provision for income taxes and evaluating our income tax positions. Our tax rates are impacted by the tax laws, regulations and policies in federal, state and local and international territories where our businesses operate. Changes to these laws and regulations and uncertainty generated by the prospect of future tax legislation may also affect our income tax positions, in addition to other factors, including our global mix of earnings, acquisitions and dispositions, as well as the tax characteristics of our income. In determining our income tax provisions on a jurisdiction basis, we are required to make judgments on the need to record deferred tax assets and liabilities, including the realizability of deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is established if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In evaluating uncertain tax positions, we make determinations of the application of complex tax rules, regulations and practices. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions quarterly based on many factors including, but not limited to, new facts, changes in tax law and information received from regulators. A change in any one of these factors could change our evaluation of an existing uncertain tax position, resulting in the recognition of an additional charge or benefit to our income tax provision in the period and may result in fluctuations in our effective income tax rate. Additionally, our income tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our income tax provisions. The resolution of audit issues and income tax positions taken may take extended periods of time due to the length of examinations by tax authorities and the possible extension of statutes of limitations. A 1% change in our effective income tax rate, excluding discrete items, would result in additional income tax expense of approximately $35 million for the year ended September 30, 2014 . We permanently reinvest the earnings of substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries outside the United States. We do not provide for U.S. taxes on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries for which the earnings are permanently reinvested. Goodwill Goodwill at September 30, 2014 relates to our reporting units Music ($2.0 billion), Nickelodeon ($2.9 billion), Entertainment ($2.3 billion), BET Networks ($2.7 billion) and Paramount ($1.6 billion). A qualitative assessment (elected for our impairment test as of August 31, 2014) to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value includes, but is not limited to, consideration of the results of our most recent quantitative impairment test, consideration of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, cash flows, changes in key Company personnel and our share price. Based on this assessment, we concluded that it is more likely than not that goodwill is not impaired. A quantitative goodwill impairment test, when performed, requires estimating fair value of a reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions, including assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. Given the inherent uncertainty in determining these assumptions, actual results may differ from those used in our valuations. Other Intangible Assets The impairment test employed for finite-lived intangible assets (e.g., broadcast license, trade names and customer lists) is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. If the intent is to hold the asset for continued use, first a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows against the carrying value of the asset is performed. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, the asset would be written down to its fair value. If the intent is to hold the asset for sale, to the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred, the determination of the cash flows for the assets involved and the discount rate to be applied in determining fair value. See Notes 14 and 20 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on asset impairments in 2014 and 2013. 48 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) OTHER MATTERS Related Parties In the ordinary course of business we enter into transactions with related parties, including National Amusements, Inc., CBS, their respective subsidiaries and affiliates, and companies that we account for under the equity method of accounting. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding the related party transactions and their impact on the Financial Statements. Agreements with CBS Corporation In connection with our separation from CBS, effective as of January 1, 2006 (the separation ), we and CBS entered into a Separation Agreement, a Transition Services Agreement and a Tax Matters Agreement, as well as certain other agreements to govern the terms of the separation and certain of the ongoing relationships between CBS and us after the separation. These related party arrangements are more fully described below. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, each company is obligated to indemnify the other company and the other company officers, directors and employees for any losses arising out of its failure to perform or discharge any of the liabilities it assumed pursuant to the Separation Agreement, including with respect to certain legal matters, its businesses as conducted as of the date of the separation and its breaches of shared contracts. Subject to limited exceptions, the Separation Agreement provides that none of Viacom, any subsidiary of Viacom or any person that is controlled by Viacom after the separation will own or acquire an interest in a radio or television broadcast station, television broadcast network or daily newspaper, if such ownership or acquisition would (i) cause CBS, any subsidiary of CBS or any entity controlled by CBS after the date of the separation to be in violation of U.S. federal laws limiting the ownership or control of radio broadcast stations, television broadcast stations and/or television broadcast networks or (ii) limit in any manner at any time under such laws CBS ability to acquire additional interests in a radio or television broadcast station and/or television broadcast network. These restrictions will terminate when none of Mr. Redstone, NAI, NAIRI Inc. or any of their successors, assigns or transferees are deemed to have interests in both CBS and Viacom that are attributable under applicable U.S. federal laws. The Separation Agreement also provides that neither Viacom, any subsidiary of Viacom or any person controlled by Viacom nor CBS, any subsidiary of CBS or any person controlled by CBS will acquire any asset, enter into any agreement or accept or agree to any condition that purports to bind, or subjects to a legal order, the other company, its subsidiaries or any person it controls without such other party written consent. The Tax Matters Agreement sets forth Viacom responsibilities with respect to, among other things, liabilities for federal, state, local and foreign income taxes for periods before and including the merger, the preparation and filing of income tax returns for such periods, disputes with taxing authorities regarding income taxes for such periods and indemnification for income taxes that would become due if the merger were taxable. Viacom is generally responsible for federal, state and local, and foreign income taxes for periods before the merger relating to Viacom respective businesses. Income tax liabilities relating to discontinued operations and previously disposed businesses have been allocated in accordance with the principles applicable under the Separation Agreement for liabilities relating to those operations and businesses. Other income tax liabilities, including items that do not specifically relate to either business, will be shared equally. Viacom and CBS will generally be jointly responsible for managing any dispute relating to income taxes for which both parties may be responsible.
