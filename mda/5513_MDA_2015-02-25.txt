ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis presented in this section should be read in conjunction with the "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" included below the Table of Contents, "Risk Factors" included in Item 1A, "Selected Financial Data" included in Item 6, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Item 8. Executive Summary 2014 Operating Performance and Capital Management For 2014 , we reported net income of $413.4 million , or $1.61 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $858.1 million , or $3.23 per diluted common share, in 2013 . Included in our results for both years are net realized investment gains and losses and non-operating retirement-related gains or losses. Included in our 2014 results is a reserve increase related to our long-term care block of business ($698.2 million before tax and $453.8 million after tax, or $1.77 per diluted common share) and costs related to the early retirement of debt ($13.2 million before tax and $10.4 million after tax, or $0.04 per diluted common share). Included in our 2013 results is a reserve increase related to unclaimed death benefits ($95.5 million before tax and $62.1 million after tax, or $0.24 per diluted common share) and a reserve reduction related to group life waiver of premium benefits ($85.0 million before tax and $55.2 million after tax, or $0.21 per diluted common share). Adjusting for these items, after-tax operating income was $910.4 million , or $3.55 per diluted common share, in 2014 , compared to $882.5 million , or $3.32 per diluted common share, in 2013 . The growth in after-tax operating income per diluted common share is aided by our capital management strategy of returning capital to shareholders through repurchases of our common stock. See "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" contained in this Item 7 for further discussion of these items. Operating revenue, which excludes net realized investment gains and losses, increased in 2014 relative to the prior year, driven by growth in premium income. Net investment income, also a significant source of revenue for us, was lower than the prior year. Before-tax operating income, which excludes net realized investment gains and losses and non-operating retirement-related gains or losses, declined relative to 2013 . Before-tax operating income, when also excluding the reserve adjustments and costs related to the early retirement of debt, as discussed in the preceding paragraph, increased relative to 2013 , with favorable earnings in all of our reporting segments except Unum US where we experienced slightly less favorable earnings in the group disability line of business. Our Unum US segment reported a decrease in operating income of 1.4 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 . Operating income, excluding the 2013 reserve adjustments related to unclaimed death benefits and group life waiver of premium benefits, decreased slightly by 0.3 percent, with lower net investment income and higher expenses offset partially by growth in premium income and overall favorable risk results. Premium income increased 3.2 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 . The benefit ratio for our Unum US segment for 2014 was 70.6 percent, compared to 71.3 percent, or 71.6 percent excluding the reserve adjustments, in 2013 . Unum US sales increased 21.0 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 . Persistency remains strong and is generally consistent with our expectations. Our Unum UK segment reported an increase in operating income, as measured in Unum UK's local currency, of 6.5 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 , with an increase in premium income and overall favorable risk results. Premium income in local currency increased 3.6 percent in 2014 relative to 2013. The benefit ratio for Unum UK was 71.0 percent in 2014 compared to 74.3 percent in 2013 . Unum UK sales in 2014 increased 7.2 percent, in local currency, compared to 2013 . Persistency is favorable relative to the prior year, but group life persistency continues to be lower than our long-term expectations as a result of pursuing rate increases on renewing business. Our Colonial Life segment reported an increase in operating income of 13.4 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 . Operating income, excluding the 2013 reserve increase related to unclaimed death benefits, increased 5.4 percent in 2014 , with growth in premium income and favorable risk results. Premium income grew 3.4 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 . The 2014 benefit ratio for Colonial Life was 51.9 percent compared to 54.1 percent, or 52.5 percent excluding the reserve increase, in 2013 . Colonial Life sales increased 11.6 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 . Persistency is generally stable relative to the prior year. Our Closed Block segment reported a loss in 2014 as a result of the reserve increase for long-term care. Excluding the reserve increase, operating income increased 12.1 percent in 2014 relative to 2013 , with an increase in net investment income and favorable risk results in our long-term care line of business offset partially by less favorable risk results in our individual disability line of business. 32 Although the low interest rate environment and tighter credit spreads continue to place pressure on our profit margins by impacting our net investment income yields, our invested asset quality remains strong. The net unrealized gain on our fixed maturity securities was $6.3 billion at December 31, 2014 compared to $4.1 billion at December 31, 2013 , with the increase due primarily to a decline in U.S. Treasury rates during 2014. The earned book yield on our investment portfolio was 5.48 percent for 2014 compared to a yield of 5.57 percent for 2013. We believe our capital and financial positions are strong. At December 31, 2014, the RBC ratio for our traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries, calculated on a weighted average basis using the NAIC Company Action Level formula, was in excess of 400 percent and generally consistent with the prior year. During 2014 , we repurchased 8.7 million shares of Unum Group common stock at a cost of approximately $301 million under our share repurchase program. Cash equivalents and marketable securities held at Unum Group and our other intermediate holding companies, which are a significant source of liquidity for us, were approximately $575 million at December 31, 2014 . 2014 Long-term Care Reserve Increase Policy reserves for our long-term care block of business are determined using the gross premium valuation method and, prior to the fourth quarter of 2014, were valued based on assumptions established as of December 31, 2011, the date of the initial loss recognition. Gross premium valuation assumptions do not change after the date of loss recognition unless reserves are again determined to be deficient. We undertake a review of policy reserve adequacy annually during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if appropriate, using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the review. Included in our fourth quarter of 2014 review was an analysis of our reserve assumptions, including those for the discount rate, mortality and morbidity rates, persistency, and premium rate increases. Our analysis of reserve discount rate assumptions considered the continued historic low interest rate environment, future market expectations, and our view of future portfolio yields. The assumptions we established in 2011 were set at a level that we estimated would be sustainable in a low interest rate environment for three to five years, with improvements in market yields beginning after the third year. Since that time, however, interest rates have continued to hover near historic lows, and credit spreads have tightened. Our assumption update for mortality incorporates the last three years of Company-specific experience and emerging trends as well as industry data, where available and appropriate, and reflects improvements in life expectancies beyond what was initially anticipated in 2011. Our morbidity assumptions were updated to reflect trends from our own emerging Company experience in claim incidence and terminations, as well as trends based on available and appropriate industry data and studies. Our premium rate increase assumptions were updated to reflect progress-to-date and our on-going rate increase strategy. Based on our analysis, as of December 31, 2014 we lowered the discount rate assumption to reflect the low interest rate environment and our revised expectation of future investment portfolio yield rates. Our revised assumptions anticipate the low interest rate environment persisting for the next three to five years, with a return to more historical averages over the following five year period. We updated our mortality assumptions to reflect emerging experience due to an increase in life expectancies which increases the ultimate number of people who will utilize long-term care benefits and also lengthens the amount of time a claimant may receive long-term care benefits. We changed our morbidity assumptions to reflect emerging industry experience as well as our own company experience, and we updated our projection of future premium rate increase approvals. Using our revised best estimate assumptions, as of December 31, 2014 we determined that our policy and claim reserves should be increased $698.2 million to reflect our current estimate of future benefit obligations. This charge decreased our 2014 net income $453.8 million. We do not expect these reserve charges to have a material impact on future cash flows available from our subsidiaries or on our capital management plans. 2014 and 2013 Retirement Benefit Changes In 2014, we amended our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan to allow a limited-time offer of benefit payouts to eligible former employees with a vested right to a pension benefit. The offer provided eligible former employees, regardless of age, with an option to elect to receive a lump-sum settlement of his or her entire accrued pension benefit in December 2014 or to elect receipt of monthly pension benefits commencing in January 2015. We recognized a settlement loss of $64.4 million before tax, or $41.9 million after tax, during the fourth quarter of 2014. This non-operating retirement-related loss represented the applicable portion of the unrecognized actuarial loss which had previously been included in accumulated other comprehensive income and which pertained to the settled benefit obligation. 33 In 2013, we adopted plan amendments which froze participation and benefit accruals in our defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. and U.K., effective December 31, 2013 for the U.S. plans and June 30, 2014 for the U.K. plan. As a result of these plan amendments we recognized a net before-tax curtailment gain of $3.0 million during 2013. Because the amendments eliminated all future service accruals subsequent to the effective dates of the amendments, we were also required to remeasure the benefit obligations of our pension plans, which decreased our net pension liability approximately $330 million during 2013, with a corresponding increase in other comprehensive income, less applicable income tax of approximately $115 million. Concurrent with our amendments to our defined benefit pension plans, we adopted amendments to increase the benefits under our defined contribution plans commensurate with the effective dates of the pension plan amendments. 2013 Unclaimed Death Benefits Reserve Increase Beginning in 2011, a number of state regulators began requiring insurers to cross-check specified insurance policies with the Social Security Administration Death Master File to identify potential matches. If a potential match was identified, insurers were requested to determine if benefits were due, locate beneficiaries, and make payments where appropriate. We initiated this process where requested, and in 2012 we began implementing this process in all states on a forward-looking basis. We believe adopting this process, which reflects an evolving regulatory and industry practice, is in the best interest of our customers. Therefore, in addition to implementing this on a forward-looking basis, in 2013 we began an initiative to search for potential claims from previous years. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed our assessment of benefits which we estimate will be paid under this initiative, and as such, established additional reserves for payment of these benefits. Claim reserves were increased $49.1 million for Unum US group life, $26.3 million for Unum US voluntary life, and $20.1 million for Colonial Life voluntary life, for a total reserve increase of $95.5 million. These reserve adjustments decreased 2013 net income $62.1 million. Although the legal and regulatory environment continues to evolve, we believe our decision to adopt this claims practice and establish additional reserves is in the best interests of our customers. 2013 Group Life Waiver of Premium Benefit Reserve Reduction Within our Unum US segment, we offer group life insurance coverage which consists primarily of renewable term life insurance and includes a provision for waiver of premium, if disabled. The group life waiver of premium benefit (group life waiver) provides for continuation of life insurance coverage when an insured, or the employer on behalf of the insured, is no longer paying premium because the employee is not actively at work due to a disability. The group life waiver claim reserve is the present value of future anticipated death benefits reflecting the probability of death while remaining disabled. Claim reserves are calculated using assumptions based on past experience adjusted for current trends and any other factors that would modify past experience and are subject to revision as current claim experience emerges and alters our view of future expectations. The two fundamental assumptions in the development of the group life waiver reserve are mortality and recovery. Our emerging experience and that which continues to emerge within the industry indicate an increase in life expectancies, which decreases the ultimate anticipated death benefits to be paid under the group life waiver benefit. Emerging experience also reflects an improvement in claim recovery rates, which also lessens the likelihood of payment of a death benefit while the insured is disabled. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed a review of our assumptions and modified our mortality and claim recovery assumptions for our Unum US group life waiver reserves and, as a result, reduced the applicable claim reserves by $85.0 million and increased 2013 net income $55.2 million. Consolidated Company Outlook for 2015 We believe our disciplined approach to providing financial protection products at the workplace puts us in a position of strength as we seek to capitalize on the growing and largely unfilled need for our products and services. We believe the need for our products and services remains strong, and we intend to continue protecting our solid margins and returns through our pricing and risk actions. We continue to invest in our infrastructure and our employees, with a focus on quality and simplification of processes and offerings. Our strategy is centered on maintaining a strong customer focus while providing an innovative product portfolio of financial protection choices to deepen employee coverages, broaden employer relationships, and open new markets. The low interest rate environment continues to be a challenge and may put pressure on our profitability and reserve levels for some products, but we continue to analyze and employ strategies that we believe will help us navigate this environment. We 34 believe that consistent operating results, combined with the implementation of strategic initiatives and the effective deployment of capital, will allow us to meet our long-term financial objectives. Further discussion is included in "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures," "Consolidated Operating Results," "Segment Results," "Investments," and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" contained in this Item 7 and in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures We analyze our performance using non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures of "operating revenue," "before-tax operating income" or "before-tax operating loss," and "after-tax operating income" differ from total revenue, income before income tax, and net income as presented in our consolidated operating results and in income statements prepared in accordance with GAAP due to the exclusion of net realized investment gains and losses, non-operating retirement-related gains or losses, and certain other items as specified in the reconciliations below. We believe operating revenue and operating income or loss are better performance measures and better indicators of the revenue and profitability and underlying trends in our business. Realized investment gains or losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments. Our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains or losses. Although we may experience realized investment gains or losses which will affect future earnings levels, a long-term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business since our underlying business is long-term in nature, and we need to earn the interest rates assumed in calculating our liabilities. The amortization of prior period actuarial gains or losses, a component of the net periodic benefit cost for our pensions and other postretirement benefit plans, is driven by market performance as well as plan amendments and is not indicative of the operational results of our businesses. We believe that excluding the amortization of prior period gains or losses, as well as the settlement loss from our pension plan amendment, from operating income or loss provides investors with additional information for comparison and analysis of our operating results. Although we manage our non-operating retirement-related gains or losses separately from the operational performance of our business, these gains or losses impact the overall profitability of our company and have historically increased or decreased over time, depending on plan amendments and market conditions and the resulting impact on the actuarial gains or losses in our pensions and other postretirement benefit plans. We believe that excluding the 2014 costs related to the early retirement of debt is appropriate because in conjunction with the debt redemption, we recognized in realized investment gains and losses a deferred gain from previously terminated derivatives which were associated with the hedge of this debt. The amount recognized as a realized investment gain, which basically offsets the cost of the debt redemption, is also excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures since we analyze our performance excluding amounts reported as realized investment gains or losses. We believe it provides investors with a more realistic view of our overall profitability if we are consistent in excluding both the cost of the debt retirement as well as the gain on the hedge of the debt. We may at other times exclude certain other items from our discussion of financial ratios and metrics in order to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur and does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of our overall profitability. 35 A reconciliation of "operating revenue" to total revenue and "before-tax operating income" to income before income tax is as follows: (in millions of dollars) Year Ended December 31 2014 2013 2012 Operating Revenue $ 10,493.6 $ 10,347.0 $ 10,459.2 Net Realized Investment Gain 16.1 6.8 56.2 Total Revenue $ 10,509.7 $ 10,353.8 $ 10,515.4 Before-tax Operating Income $ 1,292.5 $ 1,241.8 $ 1,239.7 Net Realized Investment Gain 16.1 6.8 56.2 Non-operating Retirement-related Loss (70.0 ) (32.9 ) (46.4 ) Costs Related to Early Retirement of Debt (13.2 ) Long-term Care Reserve Increase (698.2 ) Unclaimed Death Benefits Reserve Increase (95.5 ) Group Life Waiver of Premium Benefit Reserve Reduction 85.0 Income Before Income Tax $ 527.2 $ 1,205.2 $ 1,249.5 The after-tax impacts of these items are reflected in the following reconciliation of after-tax operating income to net income.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in our financial statements. The accounting estimates deemed to be most critical to our financial position and results of operations are those related to reserves for policy and contract benefits, deferred acquisition costs, valuation of investments, pension and postretirement benefit plans, income taxes, and contingent liabilities. For additional information, refer to our significant accounting policies in Note 1 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8. 36 Reserves for Policy and Contract Benefits Reserves for policy and contract benefits are our largest liabilities and represent claims that we estimate we will eventually pay to our policyholders. The two primary categories of reserves are policy reserves for claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported to us. Reserves for policy and contract benefits equaled $ 41.3 billion and $ 40.5 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, or approximately 76.6 percent and 79.8 percent of our total liabilities, respectively. Reserves ceded to reinsurers were $ 6.9 billion and $ 6.8 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, and are reported as a reinsurance recoverable in our consolidated balance sheets. Policy Reserves Policy reserves are established in the same period we issue a policy and equal the difference between projected future policy benefits and future premiums, allowing a margin for expenses and profit. These reserves relate primarily to our non interest-sensitive products, including our individual disability and voluntary benefits products in our Unum US segment; individual disability products in our Unum UK segment; disability and cancer and critical illness policies in our Colonial Life segment; and individual disability, long-term care, and other products in our Closed Block segment. The reserves are calculated based on assumptions that were appropriate at the date the policy was issued and are not subsequently modified unless the policy reserves become inadequate (i.e. loss recognition occurs). Persistency assumptions are based on our actual historical experience adjusted for future expectations. Claim incidence and claim resolution rate assumptions related to mortality and morbidity are based on actual experience or industry standards adjusted as appropriate to reflect our actual experience and future expectations. Discount rate assumptions are based on our current and expected net investment returns. In establishing policy reserves, we use assumptions that reflect our best estimate while considering the potential for adverse variances in actual future experience, which results in a total policy reserve balance that has an embedded reserve for adverse deviation. We do not, however, establish an explicit and separate reserve as a provision for adverse deviation from our assumptions. We perform loss recognition tests on our policy reserves annually, or more frequently if appropriate, using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test, without a provision for adverse deviation. We group the policy reserves for each major product line within a segment when we perform the loss recognition tests. If the policy reserves determined using these best estimate assumptions are higher than our existing policy reserves net of any deferred acquisition cost balance, the existing policy reserves are increased or deferred acquisition costs are reduced to immediately recognize the deficiency. Thereafter, the policy reserves for the product line are calculated using the same method we used for the loss recognition testing, referred to as the gross premium valuation method, wherein we use our best estimate as of the gross premium valuation (loss recognition) date rather than the initial policy issue date to determine the expected future claims, commissions, and expenses we will pay and the expected future gross premiums we will receive. Because the key policy reserve assumptions for policy persistency, mortality and morbidity, and discount rates are all locked in at policy issuance based on assumptions appropriate at that time, policy reserve assumptions are generally not changed due to a change in claim status from active to disabled subsequent to policy issuance. Depending on the funding mechanism, a full policy reserve is held during disability reflecting continued funding of the full policy reserve during a disability claim, or a fractional policy reserve is held reflecting that the individual policyholder would need to recover before he or she can again generate future claims for a separate occurrence. The policy reserves build up and release over time based on assumptions made at the time of policy issuance such that the reserve is eliminated as policyholders either reach the terminal age for coverage, die, or voluntarily lapse the policy. Policy reserves for Unum US, Unum UK, and Colonial Life products are determined using the net level premium method as prescribed by GAAP. In applying this method, we use, as applicable by product type, morbidity and mortality incidence rate assumptions, claim resolution rate assumptions, and policy persistency assumptions, among others, to determine our expected future claim payments and expected future premium income. We then apply an interest, or discount, rate to determine the present value of the expected future claims and claim expenses we will pay and the expected future premiums we will receive, with a provision for profit allowed. Policy reserves for our Closed Block segment include certain older policy forms for individual disability, individual and group long-term care, and certain other products, all of which are no longer actively marketed. The reserves for individual disability and individual and group long-term care are determined using the gross premium valuation method. Key assumptions are persistency, mortality and morbidity, claim incidence, claim resolution rates, commission rates, and maintenance expense rates. For long-term care, premium rate increases are also a key assumption. We apply an interest, or discount, rate to determine the 37 present value of the expected future claims, commissions, and expenses we will pay as well as the expected future premiums we will receive, with no provision for future profit. The interest rate is based on our expected net investment returns on the investment portfolio supporting the reserves for these blocks of business. Under the gross premium valuation method, we do not include an embedded provision for the risk of adverse deviation from these assumptions. Gross premium valuation assumptions do not change after the date of loss recognition unless reserves are again determined to be deficient. We perform loss recognition tests on the policy reserves for this block of business annually, or more frequently if appropriate. Policy reserves for certain other products, excluding individual disability and individual and group long-term care, which are no longer actively marketed and are reported in our Closed Block segment represent $ 5.8 billion on a gross basis. We have ceded $4.7 billion of these other products' policy reserves to reinsurers. The ceded reserve balance is reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a reinsurance recoverable. We continue to service a block of group pension products, which we have not ceded, and the policy reserves for these products are based on expected mortality rates and retirement rates. Expected future payments are discounted at interest rates reflecting the anticipated investment returns for the assets supporting the liabilities. Claim Reserves Claim reserves are established when a claim is incurred or is estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported (IBNR) to us and, as prescribed by GAAP, equals our long-term best estimate of the present value of the liability for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses. A claim reserve is based on actual known facts regarding the claim, such as the benefits available under the applicable policy, the covered benefit period, the age, and, as appropriate, the occupation and cause of disability of the claimant, as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience for factors such as the claim duration, discount rate, and policy benefit offsets, including those for social security and other government-based welfare benefits. Reserves for IBNR claims, similar to incurred claim reserves, include our assumptions for claim duration and discount rates, but because we do not yet know the facts regarding the specific claims, these reserves are also established based on historical incidence rate assumptions, including claim reporting patterns, the average cost of claims, and the expected volumes of incurred claims. Our incurred claim reserves and IBNR claim reserves do not include any provision for the risk of adverse deviation from our assumptions. Claim reserves, unlike policy reserves, are subject to revision as current claim experience and projections of future factors affecting claim experience change. Each quarter we review our emerging experience to ensure that our claim reserves are appropriate. If we believe, based on our actual experience and our view of future events, that our long-term assumptions need to be modified, we adjust our reserves accordingly with a charge or credit to our current period income. Multiple estimation methods exist to establish claim reserve liabilities, with each method having its own advantages and disadvantages. Available reserving methods utilized to calculate claim reserves include the tabular reserve method, the paid development method, the incurred loss development method, the count and severity method, and the expected claim cost method. No single method is better than the others in all situations and for all product lines. The estimation methods we have chosen are those that we believe produce the most reliable reserves. We use a tabular reserve methodology for our Unum US group and individual long-term disability claims and for our Closed Block group and individual long-term care claims that have been reported. Under the tabular reserve methodology, reserves for reported claims are based on certain characteristics of the actual reported claimants, such as age, length of time disabled, and medical diagnosis, as well as assumptions regarding claim duration, discount rate, and policy benefit offsets. We believe the tabular reserve method is the most accurate to calculate long-term liabilities and allows us to use the most available known facts about each claim. IBNR claim reserves for our long-term products are calculated using the count and severity method using historical patterns of the claims to be reported and the associated claim costs. For Unum US group short-term disability products, an estimate of the value of future payments to be made on claims already submitted, as well as on IBNR claims, is determined in aggregate using a paid development method rather than on the individual claimant basis that we use for reported claims on long-term products. The average length of time between the event triggering a claim under a policy and the final resolution of those claims is much shorter for these products than for our long-term liabilities and results in less estimation variability. Claim reserves for Unum US group life and accidental death and dismemberment products are related primarily to death claims reported but not yet paid, IBNR death claims, and a liability for waiver of premium benefits. The death claim reserve is based on the actual face amount to be paid, the IBNR reserve is calculated using the paid development method, and the waiver of premium benefits reserve is calculated using the tabular reserve methodology. 38 Claim reserves supporting our Unum UK segment are calculated using generally the same methodology that we use for Unum US disability and group life reserves. The assumptions used in calculating claim reserves for this line of business are based on standard United Kingdom industry experience, adjusted for Unum UK's own experience. The majority of the Colonial Life segment lines of business have short-term benefits, which generally have less estimation variability than our long-term products because of the shorter claim payout period. Our claim reserves for Colonial Life's lines of business are predominantly determined using the incurred loss development method based on our own experience. The incurred loss development method uses the historical patterns of payments by loss date to predict future claim payments for each loss date. Where the incurred loss development method may not be appropriate, we estimate the incurred claims using an expected claim cost per policy or other measure of exposure. The key assumptions for claim reserves for the Colonial Life lines of business are: (1) the timing, rate, and amount of estimated future claim payments; and (2) the estimated expenses associated with the payment of claims. The following table displays policy reserves, incurred claim reserves, and IBNR claim reserves by major product line, with the summation of the policy reserves and claim reserves shown both gross and net of the associated reinsurance recoverable. Incurred claim reserves represent the expected benefits payable under each incurred claim, along with other expenses associated with the payment of the claims. IBNR claim reserves include provisions for incurred but not reported claims and a provision for reopened claims for our disability products. The IBNR and reopened claim reserves for our disability products are developed and maintained in aggregate based on historical monitoring.

Of these assumptions, our discount rate and claim resolution rate assumptions have historically had the most significant effects on our level of reserves because many of our product lines provide benefit payments over an extended period of time. 1. The discount rate , which is used in calculating both policy reserves and incurred and IBNR claim reserves, is the interest rate that we use to discount future claim payments to determine the present value. A higher discount rate produces a lower reserve. If the discount rate is higher than our future investment returns, our invested assets will not earn enough investment income to support our future claim payments. In this case, the reserves may eventually be insufficient. We set our assumptions based on our current and expected future investment yield of the assets supporting the reserves, considering current and expected future market conditions. If the investment yield on new investments that are purchased is below or above the investment yield of the existing investment portfolio, it is likely that the discount rate assumption on claims will be established to reflect the effect of the new investment yield. 2. The claim resolution rate , used for both policy reserves and incurred and IBNR claim reserves, is the probability that a disability or long-term care claim will close due to recovery or death of the insured. It is important because it is used to estimate how long benefits will be paid for a claim. Estimated resolution rates that are set too high will result in reserves that are lower than they need to be to pay the claim benefits over time. Claim resolution assumptions involve many factors, including the cause of disability, the policyholder's age, the type of contractual benefits provided, and the time since initially becoming disabled. We primarily use our own claim experience to develop our claim resolution assumptions. These assumptions are established for the probability of death and the probability of recovery from disability. Our studies review actual claim resolution experience over a number of years, with more weight placed on our experience in the more recent years. We also consider any expected future changes in claim resolution experience. 40 3. The incidence rate , used for policy reserves and IBNR claim reserves, is the rate at which new claims are submitted to us. The incidence rate is affected by many factors, including the age of the insured, the insured's occupation or industry, the benefit plan design, and certain external factors such as consumer confidence and levels of unemployment. We establish our incidence assumption using a historical review of actual incidence results along with an outlook of future incidence expectations. Establishing reserve assumptions is complex and involves many factors. Reserves, particularly for policies offering insurance coverage for long-term disabilities and long-term care, are dependent on numerous assumptions other than just those presented in the preceding discussion. The impact of internal and external events, such as changes in claims operational procedures, economic trends such as the rate of unemployment and the level of consumer confidence, the emergence of new diseases, new trends and developments in medical treatments, and legal trends and legislative changes, including changes to social security and other government-based welfare benefits programs which provide policy benefit offsets, among other factors, will influence claim incidence rates, claim resolution rates, and claim costs. In addition, for policies offering coverage for disability or long-term care at advanced ages, the level and pattern of mortality rates at advanced ages will impact overall benefit costs. Reserve assumptions differ by product line and by policy type within a product line. Additionally, in any period and over time, our actual experience may have a positive or negative variance from our long-term assumptions, either singularly or collectively, and these variances may offset each other. We test the overall adequacy of our reserves using all assumptions and with a long-term view of our expected experience over the life of a block of business rather than test just one or a few assumptions independently that may be aberrant over a short period of time. Therefore, it is not possible to bifurcate the assumptions to evaluate the sensitivity of a change in each assumption, but rather in the aggregate by product line. The following section presents an overview of our trend analysis for key assumptions and the results of variability in our assumptions, in aggregate, for the reserves which we believe are reasonably possible to have a material impact on our future financial results if actual claims yield a materially different amount than what we currently expect and have reserved for, either favorable or unfavorable. Trends in Key Assumptions Generally, we do not expect our mortality and morbidity claim incidence trends or our persistency trends to change significantly in the short-term, and to the extent that these trends do change, we expect those changes to be gradual over a longer period of time. We have historically experienced an increase in our group long-term disability morbidity claim incidence trends during and following a recessionary period, particularly in our Unum US operations. During 2014, claim incidence rates for Unum US group long-term disability were stable relative to the prior year, continuing to benefit from the gradual improvement in the economy. During 2013, claim incidence rates for Unum US group long-term disability improved slightly compared to the slightly elevated level of incidence rates in 2012. We expect that claim incidence trends for Unum US group long-term disability may continue to somewhat follow general economic conditions and demographics of the general U.S. workforce. During 2014 , our claim incidence rates for our Closed Block long-term care line of business improved slightly relative to the levels of 2013 and 2012 , when we experienced claim incidence rates higher than the long-term assumptions we established at the time of loss recognition in 2011. We undertook a thorough review of our reserve assumptions related to our long-term care line of business during 2014 and updated our reserves using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the review. See "2014 Long-term Care Reserve Increase" contained in this Item 7. Interest rates improved somewhat during 2013 and early 2014 before returning to levels well below historical norms in the latter part of 2014, and the assumptions we used to discount our reserves during these periods generally trended downward slightly for all segments and product lines. Reserve discount rate assumptions for new policies and new claims are adjusted to reflect our current and expected net investment returns. Changes in our average discount rate assumptions tend to occur gradually over a longer period of time because of the long-duration investment portfolios which support the reserves for the majority of our lines of business. Claim resolution rates have a greater chance of significant variability in a shorter period of time than our other reserve assumptions. These rates are reviewed on a quarterly basis for the death and recovery components separately. Claim resolution rates in our Unum US group and individual long-term disability product lines and our Closed Block individual disability product line have over the last several years exhibited some variability. Relative to the resolution rate we expect to experience over the life of the block of business, actual quarterly rates during 2013 and 2014 have varied by +3 and -2 percent in our Unum US group long-term disability line of business, between +10 and -13 percent in our Unum US individual disability line of business, and between +7 and -6 percent in our Closed Block individual disability line of business. Claim resolution rates are very sensitive to operational and environmental changes and can be volatile over short periods of time. Throughout the period 2012 to 2014 , our claim resolution rates were fairly consistent with or slightly favorable to our long-term assumptions. Our claim 41 resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period, both favorably and unfavorably. Regarding experience for our older age, longer duration disabled claimants in our Closed Block individual disability line of business, the claim resolution rates, primarily as pertaining to life expectancy of the insured, showed a reduction in the number of deaths at these older ages during 2014, which we believe is temporary in nature. During 2013 and 2012, mortality assumptions remained relatively consistent with the assumptions that we updated in 2011 for this particular claim block. We monitor and test our reserves for adequacy relative to all of our assumptions in the aggregate. In our estimation, scenarios based on reasonably possible variations in each of our reserve assumptions, when modeled together in aggregate, could produce potential results as illustrated in the chart below. The major contributor to the variance for both the Unum US group long-term disability line of business and the Closed Block individual disability line of business is the claim resolution rate. Potential impact, positive or negative, of variations in reserve assumptions on our December 31, 2014 claim reserve balance (in millions of dollars) Unum US group long-term disability 3.6% $250 Closed Block individual disability 2.5% $245 In addition, we consider variability in our reserve assumptions related to long-term care policy reserves. These reserves are held under the gross premium valuation method with assumptions established as of December 31, 2014, the date of loss recognition. Assumptions for policy reserves do not change after the date of loss recognition unless reserves are again determined to be deficient. As such, positive developments will result in the accumulation of reserve margin, while adverse developments would result in an additional reserve charge. Policy reserves for long-term care are based upon a number of key assumptions, and each assumption has various factors which may impact the long-term outcome. Key assumptions with respect to morbidity, mortality, persistency, interest rates, and future premium rate increases must incorporate extended views of expectations for many years into the future. Reserves are highly sensitive to these estimates. For example, a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate over the lifetime of this business would impact reserves by approximately $475 million, assuming all other factors held constant. Key assumptions and related impacts are also heavily interrelated in both their outcome and in their effects on reserves. For example, changes in the view of morbidity and mortality might be mitigated by either potential future premium rate increases and/or morbidity improvements due to general improvement in health and/or medical breakthroughs. There is potentially a wide range of outcomes for each assumption and in totality. We believe that these ranges provide a reasonable estimate of the possible changes in reserve balances for those product lines where we believe it is possible that variability in the assumptions, in the aggregate, could result in a material impact on our reserve levels, but we record our reserves based on our long-term best estimate. Because these product lines have long-term claim payout periods, there is a greater potential for significant variability in claim costs, either positive or negative. We closely monitor emerging experience and use these results to inform our view of long-term assumptions. Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC) We defer incremental direct costs associated with the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts and amortize (expense) these costs over the life of the related policies. Deferred costs include certain commissions, other agency compensation, selection and policy issue expenses, and field expenses. Acquisition costs that do not vary with the production of new business, such as commissions on group products which are generally level throughout the life of the policy, are excluded from deferral. Approximately 83.7 percent of our DAC relates to non interest-sensitive products, and we amortize DAC for these products in proportion to the premium income we expect to receive over the life of the policies. DAC related to interest-sensitive policies is amortized over the lives of the policies in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits from surrender charges, mortality margins, investment returns, and expense margins. Key assumptions used in developing the future amortization of DAC are persistency, premium income, and for our interest-sensitive products, mortality margins and investment returns. We use our own historical experience and expectation of the future performance of our businesses in determining our assumptions. For non-interest sensitive products, the estimated premium income in the early years of the amortization period is generally higher than in the later years due to the anticipated cumulative effect of policy persistency in the early years, which results in a greater proportion of the costs being amortized in the early years of the life of the policy. During 2014 , our key assumptions 42 used to develop the future amortization of acquisition costs deferred during 2014 did not change materially from those used in 2013 . Generally, we do not expect our key assumptions to change significantly in the short-term, and to the extent that these trends do change, we expect those changes to be gradual over a longer period of time. The following are our current assumptions regarding the length of our amortization periods, the approximate DAC balance that remains at the end of years 3, 10, and 15 as a percentage of the cost initially deferred, and our DAC balances as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 .

Any deviations from projections may result in a change to the rate of amortization in the period such events occur. As an example, for our non-interest sensitive products, we may experience accelerated amortization if policies terminate earlier than projected, or we may experience a slower rate of amortization if policies persist longer than projected. Our actual experience has not varied materially from our assumptions during the last three years. See Note 1 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion of our DAC accounting policy. Fair Value of Investments All of our fixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value. Our derivative financial instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, are reported as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. We hold an immaterial amount of equity securities, which are also reported at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and therefore represents an exit price, not an entry price. The exit price objective applies regardless of our intent and/or ability to sell the asset or transfer the liability at the measurement date. We generally use valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, and to a lesser extent, the income approach. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities and the income approach converts future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, to a single present amount, or a discounted amount. We believe the market approach valuation technique provides more observable data than the income approach, considering the types of investments we hold. 43 The degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability. Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment utilized in measuring fair value. The market sources from which we obtain or derive the fair values of our assets and liabilities carried at market value include quoted market prices for actual trades, price quotes from third party pricing vendors, price quotes we obtain from outside brokers, matrix pricing, discounted cash flow, and observable prices for similar publicly traded or privately traded issues that incorporate the credit quality and industry sector of the issuer. Our fair value measurements could differ significantly based on the valuation technique and available inputs. Inputs to valuation techniques refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities, including assumptions about risk, for example, the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value and/or the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. We use observable and unobservable inputs in measuring the fair value of our financial instruments. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. Certain of our investments do not have readily determinable market prices and/or observable inputs or may at times be affected by the lack of market liquidity. For these securities, we use internally prepared valuations combining matrix pricing with vendor purchased software programs, including valuations based on estimates of future profitability, to estimate the fair value. Additionally, we may obtain prices from independent third-party brokers to aid in establishing valuations for certain of these securities. Key assumptions used by us to determine fair value for these securities include risk free interest rates, risk premiums, performance of underlying collateral (if any), and other factors involving significant assumptions which may or may not reflect those of an active market. As of December 31, 2014 , the key assumptions we generally used to estimate the fair value of these types of securities included those listed below. Where appropriate, we have noted the assumption used for the prior period as well as the reason for the change. Risk free interest rates of 1.65 percent for five-year maturities to 2.75 percent for 30-year maturities were derived from the December 31, 2014 yield curve for U.S. Treasury Bonds with similar maturities. This compares to interest rates of 1.74 percent for five-year maturities to 3.97 percent for 30-year maturities used at December 31, 2013. Baa corporate bond spread adjustments ranging from 1.21 percent to 2.54 percent were added to the risk free rate to reflect additional credit risk and the lack of liquidity. We used spread adjustments ranging from 1.01 percent to 2.10 percent at December 31, 2013. The changes were based on observable market spreads. Newly issued private placement securities have historically offered yield premiums higher than a similar interest rate spread on comparable newly issued public securities. Additional basis points were added as deemed appropriate for foreign investments, certain industries, and individual securities in certain industries that are considered to be of greater risk. As of December 31, 2014 , approximately 6.6 percent of our fixed maturity securities were categorized as Level 1, 89.0 percent as Level 2, and 4.4 percent as Level 3. Level 1 is the highest category of the three-level fair value hierarchy classification wherein inputs are unadjusted and represent quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Level 2 category includes assets or liabilities valued using inputs (other than those included in the Level 1 category) that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument's anticipated life. The Level 3 category is the lowest category of the fair value hierarchy and reflects the judgment of management regarding what market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities at the measurement date using unobservable inputs to extrapolate an estimated fair value. Rapidly changing credit and equity market conditions can materially impact the valuation of securities, and the period to period changes in value can vary significantly. See Note 2 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8. 44 Investment Impairments One of the significant estimates related to investments is our impairment valuation. In determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary, we evaluate the following factors: Whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security Whether we intend to sell the security or will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis Whether the security is current as to principal and interest payments The significance of the decline in value The time period during which there has been a significant decline in value Current and future business prospects and trends of earnings The valuation of the security underlying collateral Relevant industry conditions and trends relative to their historical cycles Market conditions Rating agency and governmental actions Bid and offering prices and the level of trading activity Adverse changes in estimated cash flows for securitized investments Changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date Any other key measures for the related security We evaluate available information, including the factors noted above, both positive and negative, in reaching our conclusions. In particular, we also consider the strength of the issuer balance sheet, its debt obligations and near term funding requirements, cash flow and liquidity, the profitability of its core businesses, the availability of marketable assets which could be sold to increase liquidity, its industry fundamentals and regulatory environment, and its access to capital markets. Although all available and applicable factors are considered in our analysis, our expectation of recovering the entire amortized cost basis of the security, whether we intend to sell the security, whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost, and whether the security is current on principal and interest payments are the most critical factors in determining whether impairments are other than temporary. The significance of the decline in value and the length of time during which there has been a significant decline are also important factors, but we generally do not record an impairment loss based solely on these two factors, since often other more relevant factors will impact our evaluation of a security. While determining other-than-temporary impairments is a judgmental area, we utilize a formal, well-defined, and disciplined process to monitor and evaluate our fixed income investment portfolio, supported by issuer specific research and documentation as of the end of each period. The process results in a thorough evaluation of problem investments and the recording of losses on a timely basis for investments determined to have an other-than-temporary impairment. We use a comprehensive rating system to evaluate the investment and credit risk of our mortgage loans and to identify specific properties for inspection and reevaluation. Mortgage loans are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. We establish an allowance for probable losses on mortgage loans based on a review of individual loans, considering the value of the underlying collateral, the value of which is periodically assessed. Mortgage loans are not reported at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets unless the mortgage loan is considered impaired, in which case the impairment is recognized as a realized investment loss in our consolidated statements of income. 45 There are a number of significant risks inherent in the process of monitoring our investments for impairments and determining when and if an impairment is other than temporary. These risks and uncertainties include the following possibilities: The assessment of a borrower's ability to meet its contractual obligations will change. The economic outlook, either domestic or foreign, may be less favorable or may have a more significant impact on the borrower than anticipated, and as such, the investment may not recover in value. New information may become available concerning the security, such as disclosure of accounting irregularities, fraud, or corporate governance issues. Significant changes in credit spreads may occur in the related industry. Significant increases in interest rates may occur and may not return to levels similar to when securities were initially purchased. Adverse rating agency actions may occur. See Notes 1 and 3 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans We sponsor several defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans for our employees, including non-qualified pension plans. The U.S. qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans comprise the majority of our total benefit obligation and benefit cost. We have a separate defined benefit plan for eligible employees in our U.K. operation. During 2013, our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were closed to new entrants and were amended to freeze participation and benefit accruals as of December 31, 2013. In 2014, we further amended our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan to allow a limited-time offer of benefit payouts to eligible former employees with a vested right to a pension benefit. The offer provided eligible former employees, regardless of age, with an option to elect to receive a lump-sum settlement of his or her entire accrued pension benefit in December 2014 or to elect receipt of monthly pension benefits commencing in January 2015. For those who elected to receive lump-sum settlements, distributions from plan assets were made on or before December 31, 2014. The U.K. defined benefit pension plan was closed to new entrants effective December 31, 2002 and was amended in 2013 to freeze participation effective June 30, 2014 and to reduce the maximum rate of inflation indexation from 5.0 percent to 2.5 percent for pension benefits which were earned prior to April 1997 effective at the date of adoption in 2013. Assumptions Our net periodic benefit costs and the value of our benefit obligations for these plans are determined based on a set of economic and demographic assumptions that represent our best estimate of future expected experience. Major assumptions used in accounting for these plans include the expected discount (interest) rate, the long-term rate of return on plan assets, and mortality rates. We also use, as applicable, expected increases in compensation levels and a weighted average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits, which reflects a health care cost trend rate, and the U.K. pension plan also uses expected cost of living increases to plan benefits. The assumptions chosen for our pension and OPEB plans are reviewed annually, using a December 31 measurement date for each of our plans unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement. The discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, and mortality rate assumptions have the most significant effect on our net periodic benefit costs associated with these plans. In addition to the effect of changes in our assumptions, the net periodic cost or benefit obligation under our pension and OPEB plans may change due to factors such as plan amendments, actual experience being different from our assumptions, special benefits to terminated employees, and/or changes in benefits provided under the plans. Discount rate - This interest assumption is based on the yield derived from a portfolio of high quality fixed income corporate debt instruments that reasonably match the timing and amounts of projected future benefits for each of our retirement-related benefit plans. The rate is determined at the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases our net periodic benefit cost. Long-term rate of return - This assumption is our best estimate of the average annual assumed return on plan assets until current benefits are paid. The market-related value as it relates to our estimate of long-term rate of return equals the fair value of plan assets, determined as of the measurement date. The return on plan assets recognizes all asset gains and losses, including changes in fair value, through the measurement date. Our expectations for the future 46 investment returns of the asset categories are based on a combination of historical market performance, evaluations of investment forecasts obtained from external consultants and economists, and current market yields. The expected return for the total portfolio is calculated based on the plan's current asset holdings. The actual rate of return on plan assets is determined based on the fair value of the plan assets at the beginning and the end of the period, adjusted for contributions and benefit payments. A lower long-term rate of return on plan assets increases our net periodic benefit cost. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies, and quarterly investment portfolio reviews. Risk tolerance is established through consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition. We believe our investment portfolios are well diversified by asset class and sector, with no potential risk concentrations in any one category. See Note 9 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion of the investment portfolios for our plans. Mortality rate - This assumption reflects our best estimate, as of the measurement date, of the life expectancies of plan participants in order to determine the expected length of time for benefit payments. We derive our assumptions from industry mortality tables. The Society of Actuaries released updated mortality tables during the fourth quarter of 2014 which show that longevity in the United States is increasing, thereby establishing a new benchmark for mortality rates of private pension plan participants in the United States. Our mortality assumptions, which reflect the updated mortality tables, increased the benefit obligation of our U.S. defined benefit pension plans by approximately $125 million and of our OPEB plan by approximately $14 million. These updated tables do not impact the calculation of the benefit obligation for our U.K. defined benefit pension plan. The weighted average assumptions used in the measurement of our net periodic benefit costs for the years ended December 31 are as follows: Pension Benefits U.S. Plans U.K. Plan OPEB Assumption 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 Discount Rate 4.40 % 5.30 % 3.60 % 4.40 % 4.30 % 5.00 % Expected Long-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets 7.50 % 7.50 % 5.20 % 6.10 % 5.75 % 5.75 % The following illustrates the sensitivity of the below items to a 50 basis point change in the discount rate or the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets: ($ in millions) At or for the Year Ended December 31, 2014 Assumption Change Net Periodic Benefit Cost, Before Tax Benefit Obligation Stockholders' Equity, After Tax Discount Rate + 50 bp $ (3.5 ) $ (181.9 ) $ 121.4 Discount Rate - 50 bp 2.6 205.9 (137.5 ) Expected Long-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets + 50 bp (9.1 ) N/A N/A Expected Long-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets - 50 bp 9.1 N/A N/A Benefit Obligation and Fair Value of Plan Assets During 2014 , the fair value of plan assets in our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan decreased $117.0 million, or approximately 7.4 percent, due primarily to the payment of $214.5 million in benefit payments related to our limited-time offer for benefit payouts, offset partially by an appreciation in the fair value of the remaining plan assets. The fair value of plan assets in our U.K. pension plan increased 21.7 million, or approximately 15.9 percent. Although the effect of these changes in fair value had no impact on our 2014 net periodic pension costs, the favorable rate of return on these U.S. plan assets during 2014 , in excess of our assumed rate of return for 2014, will have a favorable impact on our net periodic pension costs for 2015 . This favorable impact on costs is offset by a decrease in the discount rate for all of our plans and a decrease in the expected long-term rate of return assumption for our U.K. pension plan assets. We believe our assumptions appropriately reflect the impact of the current economic environment. 47 Our pension and OPEB plans have an aggregate unrecognized net actuarial loss of $ 631.0 million and an unrecognized prior service credit of $ 0.7 million , which together represent the cumulative liability and asset gains and losses as well as the portion of prior service credits that have not been recognized in pension expense. As of December 31, 2014 , the unrecognized net loss for these two items combined was $ 630.3 million . The unrecognized gains or losses are amortized as a component of the net benefit cost. Our 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 pension and OPEB expense includes $ 3.9 million , $ 27.9 million , and $43.4 million, respectively, of amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial loss and prior service credit. Our 2014 net periodic benefit cost for our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan also includes a $64.4 million settlement loss related to our 2014 plan amendment, with a corresponding reduction in the unrecognized net actuarial loss in accumulated other comprehensive income. The unrecognized net actuarial loss for our pension plans, which is $ 628.4 million at December 31, 2014 , will be amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of the plan participants, which is approximately 35 years for U.S. participants and 34 years for U.K. participants, to the extent that it exceeds the 10 percent corridor, as described below. The unrecognized net actuarial loss of $ 2.6 million for our OPEB plan will be amortized over the average future working life of OPEB plan participants, estimated at five years, to the extent the loss is outside of a corridor established in accordance with GAAP. The corridor for the pension and OPEB plans is established based on the greater of 10 percent of the plan assets or 10 percent of the benefit obligation. At December 31, 2014 , $403.7 million of the actuarial loss was outside of the corridor for the U.S. plans and 6.9 million was outside of the corridor for the U.K. plan. At December 31, 2014 , none of the actuarial loss was outside of the corridor for the OPEB plan. The fair value of plan assets in our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan was $ 1,473.7 million at December 31, 2014 , compared to $ 1,590.7 million at December 31, 2013 . The plan was in a $245.1 million underfunded position at December 31, 2014 compared to an overfunded position of $13.4 million at December 31, 2013 . This year-over-year change was due primarily to the decrease in the discount rate and the adoption of updated mortality assumptions. The fair value of plan assets in our U.K. pension plan was 158.1 million at December 31, 2014 , compared to 136.4 million at December 31, 2013 . The U.K. pension plan was in an overfunded position of 12.4 million and 10.3 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The fair value of plan assets in our OPEB plan was $ 11.3 million at December 31, 2014 , compared to $ 11.4 million at December 31, 2013 . These assets represent life insurance contracts to fund the life insurance benefit portion of our OPEB plan. Our OPEB plan represents a non-vested, non-guaranteed obligation, and current regulations do not require specific funding levels for these benefits, which are comprised of retiree life, medical, and dental benefits. It is our practice to use general assets to pay medical and dental claims as they come due in lieu of utilizing plan assets for the medical and dental benefit portions of our OPEB plan. See Executive Summary contained herein in Item 7 and Note 9 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion of our plans. Income Taxes We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets, we have considered all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event we determine that we most likely would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an increase to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets would be realized, the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , we had no valuation allowance. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions, both domestic and foreign. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect profitability. GAAP prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. The evaluation of a tax position is a two step process. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. The second step is to measure a position that satisfies the recognition threshold at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold but that now satisfy the recognition threshold are recognized in the first 48 subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. If a previously recognized tax position is settled for an amount that is different from the amount initially measured, the difference will be recognized as a tax benefit or expense in the period the settlement is effective. See Note 7 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8. Contingent Liabilities On a quarterly basis, we review relevant information with respect to litigation and contingencies to be reflected in our consolidated financial statements. An estimated loss is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. It is possible that our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable outcome of pending litigation or regulatory matters depending, in part, on our results of operations or cash flows for the particular period. See Note 14 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8. Accounting Developments For information on new accounting standards and the impact, if any, on our financial position or results of operations, see Note 1 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8. 49 Consolidated Operating Results (in millions of dollars) Year Ended December 31 2014 % Change 2013 % Change 2012 Revenue Premium Income $ 7,797.2 2.3 % $ 7,624.7 (1.2 )% $ 7,716.1 Net Investment Income 2,477.4 (0.6 ) 2,492.1 (0.9 ) 2,515.2 Net Realized Investment Gain 16.1 136.8 6.8 (87.9 ) 56.2 Other Income 219.0 (4.9 ) 230.2 1.0 227.9 Total Revenue 10,509.7 1.5 10,353.8 (1.5 ) 10,515.4 Benefits and Expenses Benefits and Change in Reserves for Future Benefits 7,310.8 10.8 6,595.7 (1.9 ) 6,722.2 Commissions 935.3 2.8 909.5 (0.8 ) 917.2 Interest and Debt Expense 167.5 12.1 149.4 2.8 145.4 Deferral of Acquisition Costs (524.0 ) 12.3 (466.8 ) (0.1 ) (467.3 ) Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs 440.8 5.2 418.9 10.6 378.7 Compensation Expense 820.9 3.9 790.4 0.5 786.8 Other Expenses 831.2 10.6 751.5 (4.0 ) 782.9 Total Benefits and Expenses 9,982.5 9.1 9,148.6 (1.3 ) 9,265.9 Income Before Income Tax 527.2 (56.3 ) 1,205.2 (3.5 ) 1,249.5 Income Tax 113.8 (67.2 ) 347.1 (2.3 ) 355.1 Net Income $ 413.4 (51.8 ) $ 858.1 (4.1 ) $ 894.4 In describing our results, we may at times note certain items and exclude the impact on financial ratios and metrics to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur. See "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" contained in this Item 7 for additional discussion of these items. The comparability of our financial results between years is affected by the fluctuation in the British pound sterling to dollar exchange rate. The functional currency of our U.K. operations is the British pound sterling. In periods when the pound weakens relative to the preceding period, translating pounds into dollars decreases current period results relative to the prior period. In periods when the pound strengthens, translating pounds into dollars increases current period results relative to the prior period. Our weighted average pound/dollar exchange rate was 1.646 , 1.566 , and 1.584 for years ended 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. If the 2013 and 2012 results for our U.K. operations had been translated at the higher exchange rate of 2014, our operating revenue by segment in 2013 and 2012 would have been higher by approximately $37.0 million and $32.9 million, respectively, and our operating income in 2013 and 2012 would have been higher by approximately $6.7 million and $5.1 million, respectively. However, it is important to distinguish between translating and converting foreign currency. Except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert pounds into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting item and not a reflection of operations or profitability in the U.K. Premium income for 2014 increased relative to the prior year, with premium growth in each of our principal operating business segments due to increased sales, premium rate increases, and favorable persistency in most of our product lines. While we are pleased with the improvement we saw throughout 2014, our premium growth rates remain below our long-term expectations for each of our principal operating business segments. For 2013, we reported premium growth in our Unum US and Colonial Life segments relative to 2012, but premium income in total declined for 2013, as we believe growth in many of our product lines was unfavorably impacted during 2013 by the weak pace of economic growth, low levels of employment growth, the competitive environment, and the distraction caused by political instability and the implementation of healthcare reform. Also unfavorably impacting year over year comparisons for 2013 relative to 2012 were the reinsurance agreements we entered into during 2013 to cede a portion of certain product lines in Unum US individual disability and in Unum UK group life. Premium income continues to decline year over year, as expected, in our Closed Block segment. 50 Net investment income declined in 2014 relative to 2013 due primarily to a decrease in yield on invested assets and lower miscellaneous income, which includes income from bond call premiums, mortgage fees and payoffs, and partnership investments, partially offset by an increase in the level of invested assets. Net investment income was lower in 2013 relative to 2012 due primarily to a decline in the yield on invested assets, partially offset by a higher level of invested assets. We recognized net realized investment gains of $16.1 million , $6.8 million , and $56.2 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. The net realized investment gain for 2014 includes a $13.1 million hedge gain associated with the early retirement of a portion of the outstanding debt issued by one of our U.K. subsidiaries and an other-than-temporary impairment loss on fixed maturity securities of $13.5 million. The 2013 net realized investment gain includes a $30.0 million loss related to the sale of lower yielding securities during a period when interest rates increased, and we advantageously reinvested the proceeds into higher yielding investments, thereby increasing our investment yield and also improving the credit quality of our fixed maturity securities portfolio. Also included in net realized investment gains is the change in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement, which resulted in realized gains of $3.3 million , $30.7 million , and $51.8 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. See Notes 4 and 8 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion of the hedge gain related to the retirement of debt in 2014. The consolidated benefit ratios were 93.8 percent in 2014 compared to 86.5 percent in 2013 and 87.1 percent in 2012. Excluding the 2014 and 2013 reserve adjustments, the benefit ratios for 2014 and 2013 were 84.8 percent and 86.4 percent, respectively. The underlying risk results in 2014 for each of our principal operating business segments, as well as for the majority of our product lines within those segments, were favorable or consistent with the prior year periods. Interest and debt expense for 2014 was higher than the prior year due primarily to the first quarter of 2014 issuance of $350 million of 4.00% senior notes, partially offset by the second quarter of 2014 retirement of $145 million of principal outstanding on 6.85% debt. Interest and debt expense for 2014 also includes $13.2 million of costs related to the second quarter of 2014 early retirement of debt. Interest and debt expense for 2013 was higher than 2012 due primarily to the issuance of $250 million of 5.75% senior notes in the third quarter of 2012, offset partially by lower interest expense on our floating rate debt and the purchase and retirement of the debt held by Tailwind Holdings, LLC (Tailwind Holdings) in the first quarter of 2013. See Note 8 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion of our debt. The deferral of acquisition costs increased in 2014 due primarily to sales growth in each of our principal operating business segments. The deferral of acquisition costs in 2013 was generally consistent with 2012. Amortization of acquisition costs was higher year-over-year in both 2014 and 2013 due to growth in the level of the deferred assets in our Unum US and Colonial Life businesses. Also contributing to the increase in amortization of acquisition costs in 2013 compared to 2012 was a higher level of policy terminations experienced in 2013 relative to assumptions for certain issue years within some of our Unum US supplemental and voluntary product lines. Other expenses, including compensation expense, increased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to an increase in acquisition-related expenses, including sales compensation, resulting from higher sales in certain of our product lines, higher expenses related to technology and other growth-related investments, increased contributions to our defined contribution plans as a result of amendments to these plans which became effective in 2014, and the settlement loss related to our 2014 pension plan amendment. Partially offsetting these expense increases is a lower level of net actuarial loss amortization in 2014 compared to 2013 due to pension plan amendments adopted during 2013. Other expenses, including compensation expense, were in aggregate lower in 2013 relative to 2012 due to active expense management, the impact of the mid-year 2013 pension plan amendments, and expense reductions associated with reinsurance agreements entered into during 2013. See Note 9 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion of our employee benefit plans. Our income tax for 2014 was 21.6 percent of income before income tax, compared to 28.8 percent and 28.4 percent in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax credits for tax credit partnerships and foreign earnings taxed at lower rates than the U.S. statutory rate. Our overall rate for 2014 was favorably impacted because a larger proportion of our 2014 earnings was derived from our foreign operations and taxed at that lower rate due to the long-term care reserve charge which is taxed at the higher U.S. rate. Our income tax for 2013 and 2012 includes reductions of $6.3 million and $9.3 million, respectively, to reflect the impact of the decrease in the U.K. corporation tax rate changes on our net deferred tax liability related to our U.K. operations. Our 2012 income tax also includes a release of an $11.0 million tax liability related to unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 7 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further information on our income tax. Further discussion of operating results for each of our segments and major product lines is included in "Segment Operating Results" herein in Item 7. 51 Consolidated Sales Results Shown below are sales results for our three principal operating business segments. (in millions) Year Ended December 31 2014 % Change 2013 % Change 2012 Unum US $ 902.1 21.0 % $ 745.6 (2.0 )% $ 760.5 Unum UK 51.9 7.2 % 48.4 (18.7 )% 59.5 Colonial Life $ 410.1 11.6 % $ 367.6 1.6 % $ 361.9 Sales shown in the preceding chart generally represent the annualized premium income on new sales which we expect to receive and report as premium income during the next 12 months following or beginning in the initial quarter in which the sale is reported, depending on the effective date of the new sale. Sales do not correspond to premium income reported as revenue in accordance with GAAP. This is because new annualized sales premiums reflect current sales performance and what we expect to recognize as premium income over a 12 month period, while premium income reported in our financial statements is reported on an "as earned" basis rather than an annualized basis and also includes renewals and persistency of in-force policies written in prior years as well as current new sales. Sales, persistency of the existing block of business, employment and salary growth, and the effectiveness of a renewal program are indicators of growth in premium income. Trends in new sales, as well as existing market share, also indicate the potential for growth in our respective markets and the level of market acceptance of price changes and new product offerings. Sales results may fluctuate significantly due to case size and timing of sales submissions. See "Segment Results" as follows for a discussion of sales by segment. 52 Segment Results Our reporting segments are comprised of the following: Unum US, Unum UK, Colonial Life, Closed Block, and Corporate. Financial information for each of our reporting segments is as follows. Unum US Segment The Unum US segment includes group long-term and short-term disability insurance, group life and accidental death and dismemberment products, and supplemental and voluntary lines of business, which are comprised of individual disability and voluntary benefits products. Unum US Operating Results Shown below are financial results for the Unum US segment. In the sections following, financial results and key ratios are also presented for the major lines of business within the segment.

Net investment income declined in 2014 relative to 2013 due to a decrease in the level of invested assets and a decline in yield. Other income is comprised primarily of fees from administrative services products, which declined slightly in 2014 relative to 2013. Also included in other income for 2013 is a gain of $4.0 million on the purchase and retirement of the debt issued by Tailwind Holdings. Risk results were favorable in 2014 compared to 2013 due primarily to favorable claim recovery experience, partially offset by slightly higher claim incidence rates and a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate which we implemented during the fourth quarter of 2014 for group long-term disability new claim incurrals. The deferral of acquisition costs was higher in 2014 relative to the prior year due to an increase in deferrable expenses related to sales growth. The amortization of acquisition costs increased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to growth in the level of the deferred asset. The other expense ratio for 2014 was higher compared to 2013 due to an increase in other expenses driven by technology and other growth-related investments, a higher level of allocated retirement-related costs, and higher acquisition-related expenses resulting from the increased level of sales. 54 Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2012 Premium income increased slightly in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to growth from rate increases, partially offset by a decline in persistency in the group long-term disability product line. We believe the weak pace of economic growth, low levels of employment growth, and competitive environment hampered our premium income growth in 2013, including growth from existing customers. Net investment income declined in 2013 relative to 2012 due to decreases in the level of invested assets, lower miscellaneous income, and a decrease in the yield on invested assets. Other income increased slightly in 2013 compared to 2012 due to the gain of $4.0 million on the purchase and retirement of the debt issued by Tailwind Holdings, partially offset by a decrease in fees from administrative services products. Risk results were favorable in 2013 compared to 2012 due to favorable claim incidence rates and continued strong claim recovery experience. These results were partially offset by the 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate which we implemented during the third quarter of 2012 for group long-term disability new claim incurrals. The deferral and amortization of acquisition costs were both higher in 2013 relative to 2012 due to an increase in deferrable expenses and the resulting continued growth in the level of the deferred asset. The other expense ratio for 2013 was lower compared to 2012 as we continued to focus on operating effectiveness and expense management relative to our premium income level. 55 Unum US Group Life and Accidental Death and Dismemberment Operating Results Shown below are financial results and key performance indicators for Unum US group life and accidental death and dismemberment.

Net investment income was lower in 2014 relative to the prior year due to a decrease in the yield on invested assets and lower miscellaneous income, partially offset by an increase in the level of invested assets. Risk results were unfavorable in 2014 compared to the prior year due to the net favorable impact of the 2013 reserve adjustments for group life waiver of premium benefits and unclaimed death benefits. Excluding these two reserve adjustments, risk results were slightly favorable in 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower claim incidence rates, partially offset by a higher average claim size. 56 The deferral of acquisition costs was higher in 2014 relative to the prior year due to sales growth. The amortization of acquisition costs increased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to growth in the level of the deferred asset. The other expense ratio in 2014 was consistent with the prior year as the increase in premium income more than offset expense increases driven by technology and other growth-related investments, a higher level of allocated retirement-related costs, and higher acquisition-related expenses resulting from the increased level of sales. Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2012 Premium income increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to growth in the block of business which resulted from sales and premium rate increases, partially offset by a decline in persistency. Net investment income was lower in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to a decrease in the yield on invested assets, partially offset by an increase in the level of invested assets. Risk results were favorable in 2013 compared to 2012 as a result of the 2013 reserve reduction for group life waiver of premium benefits, partially offset by the reserve increase for unclaimed death benefits. Excluding these two reserve adjustments, risk results were favorable in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to more favorable experience related to the group life waiver of premium benefits. The deferral and amortization of acquisition costs were both higher in 2013 relative to the prior year due to an increase in deferrable expenses and the resulting continued growth in the level of the deferred asset. The other expense ratio in 2013 was consistent with 2012. 57 Unum US Supplemental and Voluntary Operating Results Shown below are financial results and key performance indicators for Unum US supplemental and voluntary product lines.

Net investment income was lower in 2014 relative to 2013 due to decrease in yield on invested assets and lower miscellaneous income, partially offset by an increase in the level of invested assets. Risk results for the individual disability product line were slightly less favorable during 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower claim recoveries and higher claim incidence rates. Risk results for voluntary benefits were favorable compared to 2013 due to the 2013 reserve increase for unclaimed death benefits. Excluding this reserve increase, risk results were favorable due to improved claim experience in the disability and life product lines. 58 Commissions and deferral of acquisition costs were higher in 2014 relative to 2013 due primarily to higher sales. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs was higher in 2014 compared to the prior year due to growth in the level of the deferred asset. The other expense ratio for 2014 increased compared to 2013 due to an increase in other expenses driven by technology and other growth-related investments, a higher level of allocated retirement-related costs, and higher acquisition-related expenses resulting from the increased level of sales. The individual disability product line had goodwill of approximately $187.5 million at December 31, 2014, none of which is currently believed to be at risk for future impairment. Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2012 Premium income was generally consistent in 2013 compared to 2012, with growth in voluntary benefits offset by a decrease in the individual disability product line due to a reinsurance contract entered into during the second quarter of 2013 to cede a small block of individual disability business. Persistency for both individual disability and voluntary benefits declined relative to 2012 due to a higher level of policy terminations in the early part of 2013. Net investment income was higher in 2013 compared to 2012 due to an increase in the level of invested assets, an increase in miscellaneous income, partially offset by a decline in the yield on invested assets. Risk results for the individual disability product line were favorable during 2013 compared to 2012 due to higher claim recoveries and the impact of a release of active life reserves related to the termination of a large in-force policy in 2013. Risk results for voluntary benefits were unfavorable compared to 2012 as a result of the 2013 reserve increase for unclaimed death benefits. Excluding this reserve increase, risk results for voluntary benefits were slightly favorable in 2013 compared to 2012 due to favorable experience in the life and critical illness product lines. Commissions were lower in 2013 relative to 2012 due primarily to amounts ceded under the individual disability reinsurance contract previously discussed. The deferral of acquisition costs was generally consistent in 2013 compared to 2012. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs was higher in 2013 compared to 2012 due to a less favorable year-over-year impact from the prospective unlocking for expected future experience relative to assumptions for our interest-sensitive voluntary life products as well as a higher level of policy terminations relative to assumptions for certain issue years within certain of our product lines. The other expense ratio in 2013 was higher than 2012 due primarily to lower premium income resulting from the reinsurance contract entered into during 2013 in our individual disability product line as well as higher expenses associated with our voluntary benefits products. 59 Sales (in millions of dollars) Year Ended December 31 2014 % Change 2013 % Change 2012 Sales by Product Group Disability and Group Life and AD&D Group Long-term Disability $ 223.6 29.0 % $ 173.3 (4.9 )% $ 182.2 Group Short-term Disability 118.8 16.6 101.9 4.6 97.4 Group Life and AD&D 264.8 32.8 199.4 (3.9 ) 207.5 Subtotal 607.2 27.9 474.6 (2.6 ) 487.1 Supplemental and Voluntary Individual Disability 56.8 8.8 52.2 (8.4 ) 57.0 Voluntary Benefits 238.1 8.8 218.8 1.1 216.4 Subtotal 294.9 8.8 271.0 (0.9 ) 273.4 Total Sales $ 902.1 21.0 $ 745.6 (2.0 ) $ 760.5 Sales by Market Sector Group Disability and Group Life and AD&D Core Market (< 2,000 lives) $ 401.7 23.8 % $ 324.4 (3.1 )% $ 334.9 Large Case Market 205.5 36.8 150.2 (1.3 ) 152.2 Subtotal 607.2 27.9 474.6 (2.6 ) 487.1 Supplemental and Voluntary 294.9 8.8 271.0 (0.9 ) 273.4 Total Sales $ 902.1 21.0 $ 745.6 (2.0 ) $ 760.5 Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2013 Sales of our group products increased in 2014 relative to 2013 in both the core and large case market segments for new and existing customer accounts. The sales mix in the group market sector for 2014 was approximately 66 percent core market and 34 percent large case market, generally consistent with the level of 2013. Sales in our individual disability line of business, which are primarily concentrated in the multi-life market, increased in 2014 due to a favorable mix of sales in the core and large case market segments. Sales of voluntary benefits were higher in 2014 compared to 2013, with increases in both core and large case market sales. We attribute a portion of our 2014 sales growth relative to 2013 to the distraction which occurred in the marketplace during 2013 as a result of healthcare reform implementation, which we believe negatively impacted our core market sales for our group and voluntary benefits products throughout 2013. Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2012 Sales in our group core and large case market segments declined in 2013 relative to 2012. In both markets, sales to existing accounts increased in 2013 but this increase was more than offset by a decrease in new account sales. The decline in new sales in our group core market was driven by fewer sales opportunities in the small-size employer market segment during 2013, which we believe may have been temporarily attributable to healthcare reform as well as the uncertain economic and political environment. We believe the decline in new sales in our large case market was partially due to our disciplined and opportunistic approach to sales growth. The sales mix in our group market sector in 2013 was approximately 68 percent core market and 32 percent large case market, generally consistent with the prior year. Sales in our individual disability line of business were lower in 2013 compared to 2012 due to lower sales growth from existing customers. Sales of voluntary benefits were higher in 2013 compared to 2012, with an increase in core market sales partially offset by a decrease in large case market sales. 60 Segment Outlook During 2015, we expect continued strong growth momentum, with continued strong persistency and sales growth within our existing client relationships. We believe we will achieve year-over-year growth in premium income, with additional improvement in our premium and sales growth rates if the overall economic recovery further accelerates and market pricing adequately reflects the impact of a low interest rate environment. Our net investment income may be impacted, either favorably or unfavorably, by fluctuations in miscellaneous investment income. The low interest rate environment and tighter credit spreads continue to place pressure on our profit margins by impacting net investment income yields and claim reserve discount rates. As part of our continued pricing discipline and our reserving strategy, we continuously monitor emerging interest rate experience and adjust our pricing and reserve discount rates, as appropriate. We expect a stable risk environment for our group disability product line in 2015, with the impact of the lower claim reserve discount rate offset by premium rate increases we place in the market, resulting in a benefit ratio for full year 2015 that is generally consistent with the level of 2014. Our amortization of deferred acquisition costs may be unfavorably impacted, particularly in our supplemental and voluntary product line, by higher than expected policy terminations. We believe future profit margin improvement is achievable, driven primarily by our continued product mix shift, expense efficiencies, and consistent operating effectiveness. Certain risks and uncertainties are inherent in the disability insurance business. Components of claims experience, such as incidence and recovery rates, may be worse than we expect. Disability claim incidence and claim recovery rates may be influenced by, among other factors, the rate of unemployment and consumer confidence. Within the group disability market, pricing and renewal actions can be taken to react to higher claim rates or lower discount rates, but these actions take time to implement, and there is a risk that the market will not sustain increased prices. In addition, changes in economic and external conditions may not manifest themselves in claims experience for an extended period of time. Unfavorable economic conditions may lead to a higher rate of claim incidence, lower levels of claim recoveries, or lower claim discount rates. Claim incidence levels may fluctuate due to the normal volatility that occurs in group disability business or may be related to economic conditions. We continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly. We remain confident in our strategy of providing consumers with valuable financial protection benefits, broadening our employer client relationships, and building collaborative partnerships with complementary product manufacturers, technology firms, and distributors. Our continued investment in our franchise includes active client management and a differentiated integrated experience across our product lines. There are significant growth opportunities in each of our markets and within our existing client base, and we continue to invest in the people, processes, and technologies that will allow us to enhance our ability to grow the market over the long term. Underpinning our strategy is our continued commitment to risk management discipline, talent development, and our core values. 61 Unum UK Segment The Unum UK segment includes insurance for group long-term disability, group life, and supplemental lines of business which include individual disability and critical illness.

Unum UK's premium income, net investment income, claims, and expenses are received or paid in pounds, and we hold pound-denominated assets to support Unum UK's pound-denominated policy reserves and liabilities. We translate Unum UK's pound-denominated financial statement items into dollars for our consolidated financial reporting. We translate income statement items using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate balance sheet items using the exchange rate at the end of the period. We report unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheets. Fluctuations in the pound to dollar exchange rate have an effect on Unum UK's reported financial results and our consolidated financial results. In periods when the pound strengthens relative to the preceding period, translating pounds into dollars increases current period results relative to the prior period. In periods when the pound weakens, translating pounds into dollars decreases current period results relative to the prior period.

Partially offsetting these increases were large case policy terminations in our group life and supplemental product lines. Net investment income declined in 2014 compared to 2013 due primarily to lower yields on invested assets. We also reported lower income from inflation index-linked bonds which we invest in to support the claim reserves associated with certain of our group policies that provide for inflation-linked increases in benefits. Group long-term disability and group life risk results were favorable in 2014 compared to 2013 due primarily to lower claim incidence rates. Supplemental risk results were favorable in 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower claim incidence rates for the group critical illness product line. 63 Commissions were higher in 2014 compared to 2013 due primarily to the increased retention level in our group life reinsurance program. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs was lower in 2014 compared to the prior year due primarily to a decrease in the level of the deferred asset. The other expense ratio was higher in 2014 compared to the prior year due primarily to an increase in operational investments in our business and a lower comparative expense ratio in 2013 as a result of expense allowances related to the reinsurance agreements in our group life product line. Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2012 Premium income was lower in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to reinsurance agreements we entered into effective January 1, 2013 to cede an additional portion of our group life business. The reinsurance agreements significantly decreased premium income and benefit payments for group life during 2013 and also reduced volatility in this line of business. Premium income in 2013 was also unfavorably impacted by continued pressure on persistency resulting from the initiation of premium rate increases, partially offset by an increase in premium income as a result of rate increases in existing customer accounts. Net investment income declined in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to a decrease in the yield on invested assets, lower levels of invested assets, and lower income from inflation index-linked bonds. Group long-term disability risk results were unfavorable in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to lower claim recoveries. Group life risk results were favorable in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to lower mortality rates on the retained business. Supplemental risk results were favorable in 2013 compared to the prior year due to lower claim incidence rates for the group critical illness product line. Commissions and deferral of acquisition costs were lower in 2013 compared to 2012 due to expenses ceded under the group life reinsurance agreements and a lower level of sales in 2013. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs and the other expense ratio were generally consistent in 2013 compared to the prior year. 64 Sales (in millions of dollars and pounds) Year Ended December 31 2014 % Change 2013 % Change 2012 Sales by Product Group Long-term Disability $ 57.4 13.7 % $ 50.5 (1.4 )% $ 51.2 Group Life 23.8 11.2 21.4 (43.7 ) 38.0 Supplemental 3.9 3.9 (20.4 ) 4.9 Total Sales $ 85.1 12.3 $ 75.8 (19.4 ) $ 94.1 Sales by Market Sector Group Long-term Disability and Group Life Core Market (< 500 lives) $ 42.5 9.3 % $ 38.9 0.5 % $ 38.7 Large Case Market 38.7 17.3 33.0 (34.7 ) 50.5 Subtotal 81.2 12.9 71.9 (19.4 ) 89.2 Supplemental 3.9 3.9 (20.4 ) 4.9 Total Sales $ 85.1 12.3 $ 75.8 (19.4 ) $ 94.1 Sales by Product Group Long-term Disability 35.1 9.0 % 32.2 (0.3 )% 32.3 Group Life 14.4 5.1 13.7 (43.2 ) 24.1 Supplemental 2.4 (4.0 ) 2.5 (19.4 ) 3.1 Total Sales 51.9 7.2 48.4 (18.7 ) 59.5 Sales by Market Sector Group Long-term Disability and Group Life Core Market (< 500 lives) 25.8 3.6 % 24.9 2.0 % 24.4 Large Case Market 23.7 12.9 21.0 (34.4 ) 32.0 Subtotal 49.5 7.8 45.9 (18.6 ) 56.4 Supplemental 2.4 (4.0 ) 2.5 (19.4 ) 3.1 Total Sales 51.9 7.2 48.4 (18.7 ) 59.5 Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2013 Sales in group long-term disability increased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to higher sales in the large case market, with an increase in sales to new customers partially offset by lower sales to existing customers. In the group long-term disability core market, or employee groups with fewer than 500 lives, sales declined in 2014 relative to the prior year. Group life sales within the core market segment were higher in 2014 compared to 2013 for both new and existing customers. Group life sales in the large case market declined in 2014 relative to the prior year due to decreased sales to existing customers, partially offset by higher sales to new customers. Supplemental sales were lower in 2014 compared to 2013 due primarily to lower sales in our group critical illness product line. Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2012 Sales in group long-term disability in 2013 were consistent with 2012, with higher new account sales and an increase in core market sales offset by a decrease in sales to existing customers and a decline in sales in the large case market. Group life sales were lower in 2013 compared to 2012 as a result of declines in new account sales in both the core and large case markets, which more than offset higher sales to existing customers. The decrease in group life sales was due in part to pricing discipline and the initiation of rate increases on new business. Also impacting the comparability of group life sales relative to 2012 was the discontinuance of new sales of certain of our group life product lines beginning in the third quarter of 2012. Supplemental sales were lower in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to lower sales in our individual disability product line. 65 Segment Outlook Our primary focus during 2015 will be a continuance of building on the key capabilities that we believe will enable us to deliver future growth. We expect to continue to improve our profitability through our shift in business mix, premium rate increases, an increased focus on new to market sales, and continued pursuit of efficiency opportunities. We expect the low interest rate environment to continue to contribute to a dampening of overall earnings growth, and unfavorable economic conditions may lead to a higher rate of claim incidence, lower levels of claim recoveries, or lower claim discount rates. We are also preparing for Solvency II, a new European Union capital regime that will become effective January 1, 2016, the adoption of which will likely result in an increase in supervisory and disclosure requirements and could also result in increased capital requirements. We continue to work with regulatory authorities in the U.K. to agree on appropriate capital requirements for our U.K. business under Solvency II. We continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly. In our group life business, the completion of our near-term actions regarding rate increases, reinsurance, and the discontinuance of certain product lines have reduced volatility and contributed to improvement in our overall profit margin. We are now looking at opportunities for disciplined growth in this market segment. In our group long-term disability business, we remain committed to driving growth in the U.K. market. We will continue to follow a disciplined approach to new sales activity in the competitive pricing environment. We do, however, see genuine opportunities to grow the group long-term disability market in the U.K. through establishing new relationships with employers, deepening the level of coverage with our existing corporate clients, and through new offerings such as a sick-pay product and an updated offering of our group critical illness product. We anticipate returning to more normal levels of premium growth as our rate increases continue to be placed in the market and as we continue to increase sales to new and existing customers. We have seen some positive results in terms of new to market sales and increased coverage in existing cases. We believe the outlook for higher levels of employment, increases in corporate payrolls, and expansion of benefit spending is beginning to improve and will positively impact our sales and operating results, but a sustained low interest rate environment may dampen our profitability. In addition, we continue to focus on new market opportunities by raising awareness of the need for income protection. Expanding group long-term disability market penetration remains a significant opportunity and priority. 66 Colonial Life Segment The Colonial Life segment includes insurance for accident, sickness, and disability products, life products, and cancer and critical illness products issued primarily by Colonial Life & Accident Insurance Company and marketed to employees at the workplace through an independent contractor agency sales force and brokers. Operating Results Shown below are financial results and key performance indicators for the Colonial Life segment. (in millions of dollars, except ratios) Year Ended December 31 2014 % Change 2013 % Change 2012 Operating Revenue Premium Income Accident, Sickness, and Disability $ 759.8 2.9 % $ 738.7 2.0 % $ 724.5 Life 231.8 4.8 221.1 5.4 209.7 Cancer and Critical Illness 282.1 3.6 272.4 4.6 260.3 Total Premium Income 1,273.7 3.4 1,232.2 3.2 1,194.5 Net Investment Income 146.7 0.9 145.4 4.9 138.6 Other Income 0.1 (50.0 ) 0.2 (33.3 ) 0.3 Total 1,420.5 3.1 1,377.8 3.3 1,333.4 Benefits and Expenses Benefits and Change in Reserves for Future Benefits 660.6 (1.0 ) 667.0 6.3 627.3 Commissions 262.3 3.9 252.5 (0.8 ) 254.5 Deferral of Acquisition Costs (220.8 ) 7.7 (205.0 ) (0.6 ) (206.3 ) Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs 180.2 3.4 174.2 4.6 166.5 Other Expenses 238.0 6.1 224.3 3.3 217.1 Total 1,120.3 0.7 1,113.0 5.1 1,059.1 Income Before Income Tax and Net Realized Investment Gains and Losses 300.2 13.4 264.8 (3.5 ) 274.3 Unclaimed Death Benefits (UDB) Reserve Increase 20.1 Operating Income $ 300.2 5.4 $ 284.9 3.9 $ 274.3 Operating Ratios (% of Premium Income): Benefit Ratio 51.9 % 54.1 % 52.5 % Benefit Ratio Excluding the UDB Reserve Increase 52.5 % Other Expense Ratio 18.7 % 18.2 % 18.2 % Income Ratio 23.6 % 21.5 % 23.0 % Operating Income Ratio 23.6 % 23.1 % 23.0 % Persistency: Accident, Sickness, and Disability 75.5 % 75.2 % 75.7 % Life 85.2 % 85.2 % 85.7 % Cancer and Critical Illness 83.5 % 83.1 % 84.5 % Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2013 Premium income increased in 2014 relative to 2013 due to sales and continued strong persistency. Net investment income was higher in 2014 relative to the prior year due to an increase in the level of invested assets, partially offset by a decrease in yield on invested assets and lower miscellaneous income. 67 Favorable risk results in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily reflect improved claim experience in the cancer and critical illness product line. This was partially offset by less favorable experience in the accident, sickness, and disability product line due to a higher average claim size and in the life product line due to less favorable mortality experience. The release of active life reserves on terminations of older cases in the accident, sickness, and disability and cancer and critical illness product lines also favorably impacted 2014 relative to 2013. Commissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were higher in 2014 relative to 2013 due to sales growth. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs was higher in 2014 compared to the prior year due primarily to continued growth in the level of the deferred asset. The other expense ratio was higher in 2014 compared to 2013 due primarily to continued investment in our business, higher sales compensation, and a higher level of allocated retirement-related costs. Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2012 Premium income increased in 2013 relative to 2012 due to continued growth in the block of business as a result of sales and continued strong persistency. Net investment income increased in 2013 due to an increase in the level of invested assets and higher miscellaneous income, partially offset by a decrease in the yield on invested assets. Our reported risk results for 2013 were less favorable than in 2012 as a result of the reserve increase for unclaimed death benefits. Excluding this reserve increase, the benefit ratio of 52.5 percent was consistent with the level of 2012, with favorable risk results in the life product line, due to improved mortality experience, offsetting less favorable risk results in the accident, sickness, and disability and cancer and critical illness product lines that resulted from an increased level of incurred claims. Commissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were generally consistent in 2013 compared to 2012. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs was higher in 2013 compared to 2012 due to continued growth in the level of the deferred asset as well as higher amortization resulting from the prospective unlocking for expected future experience relative to assumptions for our interest-sensitive life products. The increase in other expenses in 2013 compared to 2012 was commensurate with the growth in premium income. Sales (in millions of dollars) Year Ended December 31 2014 % Change 2013 % Change 2012 Sales by Product Accident, Sickness, and Disability $ 260.7 9.4 % $ 238.2 2.2 % $ 233.0 Life 78.8 15.7 68.1 1.2 67.3 Cancer and Critical Illness 70.6 15.2 61.3 (0.5 ) 61.6 Total Sales $ 410.1 11.6 $ 367.6 1.6 $ 361.9 Sales by Market Sector Commercial Core Market (< 1,000 lives) $ 275.6 12.0 % $ 246.0 (0.9 )% $ 248.3 Large Case Market 53.2 8.6 49.0 19.8 40.9 Subtotal 328.8 11.5 295.0 2.0 289.2 Public Sector 81.3 12.0 72.6 (0.1 ) 72.7 Total Sales $ 410.1 11.6 $ 367.6 1.6 $ 361.9 Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2013 Sales were higher in 2014 compared to 2013 due to growth in both new and existing customer account sales and across all market segments. Commercial market sales increased in 2014, with higher sales in both the core commercial market, which we define as accounts with fewer than 1,000 lives, and in the large case commercial market. The growth in our core commercial market sales for 2014 was primarily attributable to new account sales, although we also experienced favorable growth in existing account sales. The growth in the large case commercial market was primarily attributable to higher sales to existing accounts. Public sector sales for 2014 increased due primarily to new account sales. The number of new accounts increased 13.4 percent in 2014 compared to 2013, and the average new case size increased 5.8 percent. 68 Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2012 Sales were slightly higher in 2013 than 2012, with growth in existing account sales in all market segments. This growth was partially offset by a slight decrease in new account sales, with the decline primarily occurring in the core commercial market. Although large case commercial market sales were significantly higher than 2012, our new business pricing was within our guidelines as we continued our disciplined yet opportunistic approach to sales growth in this market. We believe the 2013 decrease in core commercial market sales, particularly in the small employer segment, was partially attributable to healthcare reform as well as the uncertain economic and political environment. The number of new accounts decreased 18.2 percent in 2013 compared to 2012, while the average new case size increased 20.0 percent. Segment Outlook We expect to see continued favorable sales and premium growth trends in 2015. Volatility in net investment income is likely to continue as a result of fluctuations in miscellaneous investment income. We expect our annual benefit ratio for 2015 to be generally consistent with the level of 2014. While we expect the low interest rate environment to continue to pressure our profit margins, we believe our underlying profitability will remain strong. Proper execution of our growth strategy should deliver sales and premium growth that are in line with long-term expectations. Unfavorable U.S. economic conditions and the increasing competition in the voluntary market are seen as external risks to achievement of our business plans. We continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly. We believe our success will be driven primarily by execution in the core commercial and public sector segments and through expansion of the overall market. We believe the current market environment offers considerable opportunities to meet the emerging needs of employers, brokers, and consumers. We intend to continue to focus on growth, the customer experience, productivity, and talent development. Achieving our 2015 growth objectives will be supported by a continued focus on third-party connectivity, enrollment solutions, service capabilities, and operational excellence. 69 Closed Block Segment The Closed Block segment consists of individual disability, group and individual long-term care, and other insurance products no longer actively marketed. The individual disability line of business in this segment generally consists of policies we sold prior to the mid-1990s and entirely discontinued selling in 2004, other than update features contractually allowable on existing policies. We discontinued offering individual long-term care in 2009 and group long-term care in 2012. Other insurance products include group pension, individual life and corporate-owned life insurance, reinsurance pools and management operations, and other miscellaneous product lines. Operating Results Shown below are financial results and key performance indicators for the Closed Block segment. (in millions of dollars, except ratios) Year Ended December 31 2014 % Change 2013 % Change 2012 Operating Revenue Premium Income Individual Disability $ 624.8 (9.1 )% $ 687.5 (6.6 )% $ 736.4 Long-term Care 630.9 630.6 (0.2 ) 631.9 All Other 0.9 28.6 0.7 (68.2 ) 2.2 Total Premium Income 1,256.6 (4.7 ) 1,318.8 (3.8 ) 1,370.5 Net Investment Income 1,284.1 0.9 1,272.3 3.4 1,230.5 Other Income 91.8 (2.2 ) 93.9 (6.2 ) 100.1 Total 2,632.5 (2.0 ) 2,685.0 (0.6 ) 2,701.1 Benefits and Expenses Benefits and Change in Reserves for Future Benefits 2,931.1 27.8 2,293.0 (0.9 ) 2,314.9 Commissions 101.5 (10.8 ) 113.8 1.1 112.6 Interest and Debt Expense 7.3 (13.1 ) 8.4 (19.2 ) 10.4 Other Expenses 168.2 4.9 160.4 (4.4 ) 167.7 Total 3,208.1 24.6 2,575.6 (1.2 ) 2,605.6 Income (Loss) Before Income Tax and Net Realized Investment Gains and Losses (575.6 ) (626.1 ) 109.4 14.6 95.5 Long-term Care Reserve Increase 698.2 Operating Income $ 122.6 12.1 $ 109.4 14.6 $ 95.5 Interest Adjusted Loss Ratios: Individual Disability 83.6 % 82.6 % 83.0 % Long-term Care 196.6 % 89.6 % 90.1 % Long-term Care Excluding the Reserve Increase 85.9 % Operating Ratios (% of Premium Income): Other Expense Ratio 13.4 % 12.2 % 12.2 % Income (Loss) Ratio (45.8 )% 8.3 % 7.0 % Operating Income Ratio 9.8 % 8.3 % 7.0 % Persistency: Individual Disability 91.3 % 91.8 % 92.5 % Long-term Care 95.4 % 95.5 % 95.8 % 70 Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2013 Total premium income decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to expected policy terminations and maturities. The premium decrease resulting from persistency trends in the long-term care line of business was partially offset by the favorable impact of premium rate increases on certain of these policies. We continue to file requests with various state insurance departments for premium rate increases on certain of our individual and group long-term care policies. The rate increases reflect current interest rates and claim experience, higher expected future claims, longevity, persistency, and other factors related to pricing long-term care coverage. In states for which a rate increase is submitted and approved, customers are also given options for coverage changes or other approaches that might fit their current financial and insurance needs. Net investment income was higher in 2014 relative to 2013 due to increased invested asset levels and higher miscellaneous income, partially offset by a decrease in yield on invested assets. Other income, which includes the underlying results of certain blocks of individual disability reinsured business and the net investment income of portfolios held by those ceding companies to support the block we have reinsured, was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower investment income from the investment portfolios held by the ceding companies. Individual disability risk results for 2014 were unfavorable relative to 2013 due primarily to higher claim incidence rates. Long-term care risk results were unfavorable in 2014 relative to the prior year due to the reserve charge, as previously discussed. Excluding this charge, long-term care risk results were favorable compared to 2013 due to lower claim incidence rates. Commissions decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to a lower level of accrued commissions in 2014 as well as the expected run-off of these blocks of business. Interest and debt expense in 2014 was lower than 2013 due to principal repayments on the outstanding debt issued by Northwind Holdings, LLC (Northwind Holdings) and a decrease in the floating rate of interest. The other expense ratio was higher compared to 2013 due to lower premium income and an increase in expenses attributable to our long-term care product line. Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2012 Total premium income decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to expected policy terminations and maturities, partially offset by the favorable impact of premium rate increases on certain of our long-term care policies as well as the issuance of group long-term care certificates on in-force cases. Net investment income was higher in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to higher invested asset levels, partially offset by a decrease in the yield on invested assets. Other income was lower in 2013 compared to 2012 due in part to lower investment income in the portfolios held by the ceding companies to which we have ceded certain blocks of individual disability business. Individual disability risk results for 2013 were slightly favorable compared to 2012 due primarily to lower claim incidence rates. Long-term care risk results were slightly favorable in 2013 compared to 2012 due to more favorable development in active life reserves. Interest and debt expense in 2013 was lower than 2012 due to principal repayments on the outstanding debt issued by Northwind Holdings and a decrease in the floating rate of interest. The other expense ratio was consistent in 2013 compared to 2012. 71 Segment Outlook We intend to continue our focus on operational effectiveness, rate increases, enhancement of our experience analysis tools, and capital management. We expect operating revenue to decline over time as these closed blocks of business wind down, although we anticipate additional premium income associated with long-term care rate increases. We also expect a small amount of group long-term care certificates may continue to be issued where we are required to do so under the terms of existing group policies. We will likely experience volatility in net investment income due to fluctuations of miscellaneous investment income. We continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly. We expect the low interest rate environment and the tightening of credit spreads to continue to place pressure on our earnings and reserve levels. Profitability of our long-tailed products is affected by claims experience related to mortality and morbidity, investment returns, premium rate increases, and persistency. We believe that the interest adjusted loss ratios for the individual disability and long-term care lines of business will be relatively flat over the long term, but these product lines may continue to experience quarterly volatility, particularly in the near term for our long-term care product lines as our claim block matures. Claim resolution rates, which measure the resolution of claims from recovery, deaths, settlements, and benefit expirations, are very sensitive to operational and external factors and can be volatile. Our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period. It is possible that variability in any of our reserve assumptions, including, but not limited to, interest rates, mortality, morbidity, premium rate increases, and persistency, could result in a material impact on our reserve levels, including adjustments to reserves established under loss recognition. 72 Corporate Segment The Corporate segment includes investment income on corporate assets not specifically allocated to a line of business, interest expense on corporate debt other than non-recourse debt, and certain other corporate income and expense not allocated to a line of business. Operating Results (in millions of dollars) Year Ended December 31 2014 % Change 2013 % Change 2012 Operating Revenue Net Investment Income $ 5.3 N.M. $ (3.7 ) N.M. $ 23.0 Other Income 5.0 (35.1 ) 7.7 175.0 2.8 Total 10.3 157.5 4.0 (84.5 ) 25.8 Interest and Other Expenses 157.9 7.1 147.5 9.8 134.3 Operating Loss Including Costs Related to Early Retirement of Debt (147.6 ) (2.9 ) (143.5 ) (32.3 ) (108.5 ) Costs Related to Early Retirement of Debt 13.2 Operating Loss $ (134.4 ) 6.3 $ (143.5 ) (32.3 ) $ (108.5 ) N.M. = not a meaningful percentage Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2013 Net investment income increased in 2014 relative to 2013 due to higher levels of invested assets, partially offset by a decrease in yield on invested assets. Also impacting the year over year comparison for all years presented is the negative impact on reported net investment income attributable to the amortization of tax credit partnerships, the amounts of which are generally offset in income tax expense by a lower income tax rate due to the tax benefits recognized as a result of these investments. An accounting guidance update which is effective January 1, 2015 permits us to account for tax credit partnerships using proportional amortization and allows us to recognize that amortization as a component of income tax expense rather than as negative net investment income. See Note 1 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for discussion of this update. Other income declined in 2014 relative to the prior year due primarily to the recognition of income in 2013 related to a settlement of an appeal to the IRS for tax years 2005 to 2006. Interest and other expenses were higher in 2014 compared to 2013 due to $13.2 million of costs related to the 2014 retirement of a portion of debt and due to increased interest expense on debt, partially offset by a higher level of retirement-related costs allocated from Corporate to our other segments. Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2012 Net investment income was lower in 2013 compared to 2012 due to a decrease in the yield on invested assets, a decrease in reported investment income attributable to tax credit partnerships, and lower short-term interest rates. Other income was higher in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to the IRS settlement. Interest and other expenses were higher in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to an increase in interest expense on debt and a higher level of expense accruals in 2013 relative to the prior year. 73 Segment Outlook We are currently holding capital at our insurance subsidiaries and holding companies at levels that exceed our long-term requirements, and we expect to continue to generate excess capital on an annual basis through our statutory earnings. While we intend to maintain our disciplined approach to risk management, we believe we are well positioned with substantial flexibility to preserve our capital strength and at the same time explore opportunities to deploy the excess capital that is generated. Investments Overview Our investment portfolio is well diversified by type of investment and industry sector. We have established an investment strategy that we believe will provide for adequate cash flows from operations and allow us to hold our securities through periods where significant decreases in fair value occur. We believe our emphasis on risk management in our investment portfolio, including credit and interest rate management, has positioned us well and generally reduced the volatility in our results. Below is a summary of our formal investment policy, including the overall quality and diversification objectives: The majority of investments are in high quality publicly traded securities to ensure the desired liquidity and preserve the capital value of our portfolios. The long-term nature of our insurance liabilities also allows us to invest in less liquid investments to obtain superior returns. A maximum of 10 percent of the total investment portfolio may be invested in below-investment-grade securities, 2 percent in equity securities, 3 percent in tax credit partnerships, 35 percent in private placements, and 10 percent in commercial mortgage loans. The remaining assets can be held in publicly traded investment-grade corporate securities, mortgage/asset backed securities, bank loans, government and government agency securities, and municipal securities. We intend to manage the risk of losses due to changes in interest rates by matching asset duration with liabilities, in the aggregate. The weighted average credit quality rating of the portfolio should be Baa1 or higher. The maximum investment per issuer group is limited based on internal limits reviewed by the risk and finance committee of Unum Group's board of directors and approved by the boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries and is more restrictive than the five percent limit generally allowed by the state insurance departments which regulate the type of investments our insurance subsidiaries are allowed to own. These internal limits are as follows: Rating Internal Limit ($ in millions) AAA/AA $ 200 A 175 BBB+ 150 BBB 125 BBB- 90 BB+ 75 BB 60 BB- 50 B+ 30 B/B- 20 CCC 10 The portfolio is to be diversified across industry classification and geographic lines. Derivative instruments may be used to replicate permitted asset classes, hedge interest rate risk, credit risk, and foreign currency risk, and match liability duration and cash flows consistent with the plan reviewed by the risk and finance committee of Unum Group's board of directors and approved by the boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries. Asset mix guidelines and limits are established by us, reviewed by the risk and finance committee of Unum Group's board of directors, and approved by the boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries. 74 The allocation of assets and the selection and timing of the acquisition and disposition of investments are subject to ratification, on a weekly basis, by an investment subcommittee appointed by the boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries. These actions are also reviewed by the risk and finance committee of Unum Group's board of directors on a quarterly basis. We review these investment policies and guidelines annually, or more frequently if deemed necessary, and recommend adjustments, as appropriate. Any revisions or exceptions are reviewed by the risk and finance committee of Unum Group's board of directors and must be approved by the boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries. See "Critical Accounting Estimates" contained in this Item 7 for further discussion of our valuation of investments. Fixed Maturity Securities The fair values and associated unrealized gains and losses of our fixed maturity securities portfolio, by industry classification, are as follows: Fixed Maturity Securities - By Industry Classification As of December 31, 2014 (in millions of dollars) Classification Fair Value Net Unrealized Gain Fair Value of Fixed Maturity Securities with Gross Unrealized Loss Gross Unrealized Loss Fair Value of Fixed Maturity Securities with Gross Unrealized Gain Gross Unrealized Gain Basic Industry $ 2,666.8 $ 244.0 $ 366.4 $ 29.1 $ 2,300.4 $ 273.1 Capital Goods 3,946.5 523.0 113.8 4.1 3,832.7 527.1 Communications 3,110.4 502.5 106.4 3.0 3,004.0 505.5 Consumer Cyclical 1,284.9 172.6 24.7 0.4 1,260.2 173.0 Consumer Non-Cyclical 5,961.6 814.2 486.2 12.7 5,475.4 826.9 Energy 6,117.3 690.4 952.5 68.9 5,164.8 759.3 Financial Institutions 3,389.0 396.4 3,389.0 396.4 Mortgage/Asset-Backed 2,431.8 206.9 29.9 0.1 2,401.9 207.0 Sovereigns 1,307.4 206.3 1,307.4 206.3 Technology 1,211.8 93.5 282.1 3.6 929.7 97.1 Transportation 1,676.9 269.8 63.5 0.4 1,613.4 270.2 U.S. Government Agencies and Municipalities 3,360.0 631.5 51.0 1.6 3,309.0 633.1 Public Utilities 8,550.6 1,504.5 63.3 0.9 8,487.3 1,505.4 Redeemable Preferred Stocks 49.9 5.9 49.9 5.9 Total $ 45,064.9 $ 6,261.5 $ 2,539.8 $ 124.8 $ 42,525.1 $ 6,386.3 Our investment portfolio has exposure to companies whose businesses are negatively impacted by lower oil and natural gas prices. These include exploration and production companies, refineries, midstream and pipeline companies, and oilfield service businesses. The recent sharp drop in the price of oil is putting pressure on the earnings and cash flows of some of these businesses. The midstream and pipeline subsector represents our largest exposure within the energy sector. Demand for products in this subsector tends to be more correlated to product volume sales as opposed to the commodity price. We have very little exposure to the oilfield service subsector where demand for products is highly correlated with oil and gas prices. The degree to which a business is affected by oil and gas prices can vary greatly depending on, among other things, its energy subsector, exposure to different types of oil and gas within a subsector, geographic locations, cost structure flexibility, capital structure, and hedging policies. The majority of our energy sector holdings are investment-grade fixed maturity securities. We perform stress testing on all energy-related investments in our portfolios, using different oil and gas price scenarios, and we continue to closely monitor this situation. Currently, we expect downward ratings pressure on some of our securities, but we do not expect material losses in our energy sector investments. The following two tables show the length of time our investment-grade and below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities had been in a gross unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2014 and at the end of the prior four quarters. The relationships of the current fair value to amortized cost are not necessarily indicative of the fair value to amortized cost relationships for the 75 securities throughout the entire time that the securities have been in an unrealized loss position nor are they necessarily indicative of the relationships after December 31, 2014 . The decrease in the unrealized loss on investment-grade fixed maturity securities during 2014 was due primarily to a decrease in U.S. Treasury rates which occurred during the period. The increase in the unrealized loss on below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities during 2014 was due primarily to an increase in credit spreads in certain industries or sectors. We held no fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2014 with a gross unrealized loss of $10.0 million or greater.

The company has a high debt-to-equity ratio, and its projected liquidity has recently decreased significantly as a result of the declines in oil and natural gas prices. We believe the 76 company will need to sell non-core assets to maintain liquidity and to build and develop its core assets. This process will be more difficult if the low oil price environment persists for an extended period of time. At the time of the impairment loss, these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than 90 days but less than 180 days. We had no individual realized investment losses of $10.0 million or greater from other-than-temporary impairments during 2013 or 2012. We had no individual realized investment losses of $10.0 million or greater from the sale of fixed maturity securities during 2014 or 2013. During 2012, we recognized a loss of $11.2 million on the sale of securities issued by a large U.S. department store chain. In 2011, the company's management was replaced by a new team of executives that embarked on a radically different retailing strategy. While the company had ample liquidity and sizable value in real estate assets, initial operating results under this new strategy had been significantly below market expectations, and there was uncertainty as to whether this new strategy would be successful. Because of this, we had concerns that liquidity could be compromised over an extended period of time. At the time of disposition, these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than three years. At December 31, 2014 , we had minimal exposure to investments for which the payment of interest and principal is guaranteed under a financial guaranty insurance policy, and the securities in aggregate have a weighted average credit rating of investment-grade absent the guaranty insurance policy. At December 31, 2014 , we held $191.1 million fair value ($169.7 million amortized cost) of perpetual debentures, or "hybrid" securities, that generally have no fixed maturity date. Interest on these securities due on any payment date may be deferred by the issuer. The interest payments are generally deferrable only to the extent that the issuer has suspended dividends or other distributions or payments to any of its shareholders or any other perpetual debt instrument. At December 31, 2014 , our mortgage/asset-backed securities had an average life of 4.85 years, effective duration of 4.14 years, and a weighted average credit rating of Aaa. The mortgage/asset-backed securities are valued on a monthly basis using valuations supplied by the brokerage firms that are dealers in these securities as well as independent pricing services. One of the risks involved in investing in mortgage/asset-backed securities is the uncertainty of the timing of cash flows from the underlying loans due to prepayment of principal with the possibility of reinvesting the funds in a lower interest rate environment. We use models which incorporate economic variables and possible future interest rate scenarios to predict future prepayment rates. The timing of prepayment cash flows may also cause volatility in our recognition of investment income. We recognize investment income on these securities using a constant effective yield based on projected prepayments of the underlying loans and the estimated economic life of the securities. Actual prepayment experience is reviewed periodically, and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between prepayments originally projected and the actual prepayments received and currently projected. The effective yield is recalculated on a retrospective basis, and the adjustment is reflected in net investment income. We have no exposure to subprime mortgages, "Alt-A" loans, or collateralized debt obligations in our investment portfolios. We have not invested in mortgage-backed derivatives, such as interest-only, principal-only, or residuals, where market values can be highly volatile relative to changes in interest rates. The credit quality of our mortgage-backed securities portfolio has not been negatively impacted by the issues in the market concerning subprime mortgage loans. The change in value of our mortgage-backed securities portfolio has moved in line with that of prime agency-backed mortgage-backed securities. As of December 31, 2014 , the amortized cost and fair value of our below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities was $3,454.2 million and $3,525.2 million , respectively. Below-investment-grade securities are inherently more risky than investment-grade securities since the risk of default by the issuer, by definition and as exhibited by bond rating, is higher. Also, the secondary market for certain below-investment-grade issues can be highly illiquid. Additional downgrades may occur, but we do not anticipate any liquidity problems resulting from our investments in below-investment-grade securities, nor do we expect these investments to adversely affect our ability to hold our other investments to maturity. Our investments in issuers in foreign countries are chosen for specific portfolio management purposes, including asset and liability management and portfolio diversification across geographic lines and sectors to minimize non-market risks. In our approach to investing in fixed maturity securities, specific investments within approved countries and industry sectors are evaluated for their market position and specific strengths and potential weaknesses. For each security, we consider the political, legal, and financial environment of the sovereign entity in which an issuer is domiciled and operates. The country of domicile is based on consideration of the issuer's headquarters, in addition to location of the assets and the country in which the majority of sales and earnings are derived. We do not have exposure to foreign currency risk, as the cash flows from these investments are either denominated in currencies or hedged into currencies to match the related liabilities. We continually evaluate our foreign investment risk exposure. Our monitoring is heightened for investments in certain countries due to our concerns over the current economic and political environments as well as the banking crisis, and we believe these investments are more vulnerable to potential credit problems. At December 31, 2014, we had minimal exposure in those countries and had no direct exposure to financial institutions of those countries. 77 Mortgage Loans Our mortgage loan po rtfolio was $1,856.6 million and $1,815.1 million on an amortized cost basis at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Our mortgage loan portfolio is comprised entirely of commercial mortgage loans. We believe our mortgage loan portfolio is well diversified geographically and among property types. The incidence of problem mortgage loans and foreclosure activity continues to be low. Due to conservative underwriting, we expect the level of problem loans to remain low relative to the industry. We held one mortgage loan at December 31, 2014 and 2013 that was considered impaired and was carried at the estimated net realizable value of $13.1 million, net of a valuation allowance of $1.5 million. Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage reinvestment, duration, foreign currency, and credit risks. Historically, we have utilized current and forward interest rate swaps and options on forward interest rate swaps and U.S. Treasury rates, current and forward currency swaps, forward treasury locks, currency forward contracts, forward contracts on specific fixed income securities, and credit default swaps. Our current credit exposure on derivatives, which is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position, including accrued interest receivable less collateral held, was $13.6 million at December 31, 2014 . We held $15.4 million of cash collateral from our counterparties at December 31, 2014 . The carrying value of fixed maturity securities posted as collateral to our counterparties was $67.0 million at December 31, 2014 . We had no cash collateral posted to our counterparties at December 31, 2014 . We believe that our credit risk is mitigated by our use of multiple counterparties, all of which have a median credit rating of A3 or better, and by our use of cross-collateralization agreements. Other Our exposure to non-current investments, defined as foreclosed real estate and invested assets which are delinquent as to interest and/or principal payments, totaled $40.4 million and $39.9 million on a fair value basis at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. See Notes 3 and 4 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion of our investments and our derivative financial instruments. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our liquidity requirements are met primarily by cash flows provided from operations, principally in our insurance subsidiaries. Premium and investment income, as well as maturities and sales of invested assets, provide the primary sources of cash. Debt and/or securities offerings provide additional sources of liquidity. Cash is applied to the payment of policy benefits, costs of acquiring new business (principally commissions), operating expenses, and taxes, as well as purchases of new investments. We have established an investment strategy that we believe will provide for adequate cash flows from operations. We attempt to match our asset cash flows and durations with expected liability cash flows and durations to meet the funding requirements of our business. However, deterioration in the credit market may delay our ability to sell our positions in certain of our fixed maturity securities in a timely manner and adversely impact the price we receive for such securities, which may negatively impact our cash flows. Furthermore, if we experience defaults on securities held in the investment portfolios of our insurance subsidiaries, this will negatively impact statutory capital, which could reduce our insurance subsidiaries' capacity to pay dividends to our holding companies. A reduction in dividends to our holding companies could force us to seek external financing to avoid impairing our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders or meet our debt and other payment obligations. As requirements of Dodd-Frank continue to take effect in 2015 and in subsequent years, to the extent that we enter into derivatives that are subject to centralized exchanges and cleared through a regulated clearinghouse, we may be subject to stricter collateral requirements which could have an adverse effect on our overall liquidity. 78 Our policy benefits are primarily in the form of claim payments, and we have minimal exposure to the policy withdrawal risk associated with deposit products such as individual life policies or annuities. A decrease in demand for our insurance products or an increase in the incidence of new claims or the duration of existing claims could negatively impact our cash flows from operations. However, our historical pattern of benefits paid to revenues is consistent, even during cycles of economic downturns, which serves to minimize liquidity risk. Cash equivalents and marketable securities held at Unum Group and our intermediate holding companies are a significant source of liquidity for us and were approximately $575 million and $514 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The change was driven primarily by increases from dividends from subsidiaries and our debt issuance in March, less decreases resulting from debt repayments and repurchases of our common stock. The December 31, 2014 balance, of which approximately $176 million was held in certain of our foreign subsidiaries in the U.K., was comprised primarily of commercial paper, fixed maturity securities with a current average maturity of 1.8 years, and various money-market funds. No significant restrictions exist on our ability to use or access these funds. We currently have no intent, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate funds from our foreign subsidiaries in the U.K. We believe we hold domestic resources sufficient to fund our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. If we repatriate additional funds from our subsidiaries in the U.K., the amounts repatriated would be subject to repatriation tax effects which generally equal the difference in the U.S. tax rate and the U.K. tax rate. As part of our capital deployment strategy, we have in recent years repurchased shares of Unum Group's common stock, as authorized by our board of directors. Our current share repurchase program was approved by our board of directors in December 2013 and authorizes the repurchase of up to $750 million of common stock through June 2015, with the pace of repurchase activity to depend upon various factors such as the level of available cash, alternative uses for cash, and our stock price. The dollar value of shares remaining under the current repurchase program was approximately $430 million at December 31, 2014. During 2014, we repurchased 8.7 million shares at a cost of approximately $301 million. Cash Available from Subsidiaries Unum Group and certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries depend on payments from subsidiaries to pay dividends to stockholders, to pay debt obligations, and/or to pay expenses. These payments by our insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries may take the form of dividends, operating and investment management fees, and/or interest payments on loans from the parent to a subsidiary. Restrictions under applicable state insurance laws limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to a parent company from its insurance subsidiaries in any 12-month period without prior approval by regulatory authorities. For life insurance companies domiciled in the U.S., that limitation generally equals, depending on the state of domicile, either ten percent of an insurer's statutory surplus with respect to policyholders as of the preceding year end or the statutory net gain from operations, excluding realized investment gains and losses, of the preceding year. The payment of dividends to a parent company from a life insurance subsidiary is generally further limited to the amount of unassigned funds. Certain of our domestic insurance subsidiaries cede blocks of business to Northwind Reinsurance Company (Northwind Re), Tailwind Reinsurance Company (Tailwind Re), and Fairwind Insurance Company (Fairwind), all of which are affiliated captive reinsurance subsidiaries domiciled in the United States with Unum Group as the ultimate parent. The ability of Northwind Re, Tailwind Re, and Fairwind to pay dividends to their respective parent companies will depend on their satisfaction of applicable regulatory requirements and on the performance of the business reinsured by Northwind Re, Tailwind Re, and Fairwind. The ability of Unum Group and certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries to continue to receive dividends from their insurance subsidiaries also depends on additional factors such as RBC ratios and capital adequacy and/or solvency requirements, funding growth objectives at an affiliate level, and maintaining appropriate capital adequacy ratios to support desired ratings. Unum Group's RBC ratio for its traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries, calculated on a weighted average basis using the NAIC Company Action Level formula, was in excess of 400 percent at December 31, 2014, and generally consistent with the prior year. The capital adequacy and/or individual RBC ratios for each of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries, including our captive reinsurers, is above the range that would require state regulatory action. Unum Group and/or certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries may also receive dividends from our U.K. subsidiaries, the payment of which may be subject to applicable insurance company regulations and capital guidance in the U.K. Our European holding company and its subsidiaries, including Unum Limited, will be impacted by new capital requirements and risk management standards under Solvency II, which is expected to be adopted January 1, 2016. Solvency II proposals, which are expected to be finalized during the first quarter of 2015, contain amended requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers. The impact of Solvency II on our U.K. subsidiaries cannot be fully determined at this time, but the 79 adoption of Solvency II will likely result in an increase in supervisory and disclosure requirements and could also result in increased capital requirements. The payment of dividends to the parent company from our subsidiaries also requires the approval of the individual subsidiary's board of directors. The amount available during 2014 for the payment of ordinary dividends from Unum Group's traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries, which excludes our captive reinsurers, was $591.0 million, of which $564.0 million was declared and paid. The amount available during 2014 from Unum Limited was 187.8 million, of which 60.0 million was declared and paid to one of our U.K. holding companies. During 2014, Tailwind Re and Northwind Re paid dividends of $12.8 million and $41.3 million to Tailwind Holdings and Northwind Holdings, respectively. Fairwind paid no dividends during 2014. During 2015, we intend to maintain a level of capital in our U.S. and U.K. insurance subsidiaries above the applicable capital adequacy requirements and minimum solvency margins. Although we may not utilize the entire amount of available dividends, based on applicable restrictions under current law, approximately $605 million is available, without prior approval by regulatory authorities, during 2015 for the payment of dividends from our traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries, which excludes our captive reinsurers. Approximately 167 million is available for the payment of dividends from Unum Limited during 2015, subject to regulatory approval. Insurance regulatory restrictions do not limit the amount of dividends available for distribution from non-insurance subsidiaries except where the non-insurance subsidiaries are held directly or indirectly by an insurance subsidiary and only indirectly by Unum Group. Funding for Employee Benefit Plans We made contributions of approximately $65.1 million and 3.1 million to our U.S. and U.K. defined contribution plans, respectively, in 2014. We expect to make contributions of approximately $68.9 million and 4.6 million during 2015. We contribute to our U.K. defined benefit pension plan sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement under U.K. legislation and accordingly made required contributions of 1.4 million to our U.K. defined benefit pension plan during 2014. We do not expect to make contributions in 2015 to our U.K. defined benefit pension plan. We made no contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan during 2014, nor do we expect to make any contributions during 2015. We have met all minimum pension funding requirements set forth by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. We have estimated our future funding requirements under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and under applicable U.K. law, and do not believe that any future funding requirements will cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity. See Note 9 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion of our employee benefit plans. Debt There are no significant financial covenants associated with any of our outstanding debt obligations. We continually monitor our compliance with our debt covenants and remain in compliance. We have not observed any current trends that would cause a breach of any debt covenants. Purchases and Retirement of Debt In 2014, we purchased and retired $145.0 million principal of our outstanding 6.85% notes, including a make-whole amount of $13.2 million, for a total cost of $158.2 million. In 2013, we purchased and retired the outstanding principal of $62.5 million on the floating rate, senior secured non-recourse notes issued by Tailwind Holdings, resulting in a before-tax gain of $4.0 million. During 2012 , Tailwind Holdings made principal payments of $10.0 million. Northwind Holdings made principal payments on its floating rate, senior secured notes of $41.6 million in 2014 and $60.0 million in both 2013 and 2012. 80 Issuance of Debt In 2014, we issued $350.0 million of unsecured 10-year senior notes in a public offering. These notes, due 2024, bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.00% and are payable semi-annually. The notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. In 2012, we issued $250.0 million of unsecured senior notes in a public offering. These notes, due 2042, bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.75% and are payable semi-annually. The notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. Credit Facility In 2013, we entered into a five-year, $400 million unsecured revolving credit facility. Under the terms of the agreement, we may request that the credit facility be increased up to $600 million. Borrowings under the credit facility are for general corporate uses and are subject to financial covenants, negative covenants, and events of default that are customary. The credit facility provides for borrowing at an interest rate based either on the prime rate or LIBOR. In addition, the credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit subject to certain terms and limitations. At December 31, 2014, letters of credit totaling $2.1 million had been issued from the credit facility, but there was no borrowed amount outstanding. Our credit facility's financial covenants contain provisions regarding our leverage and net worth. We do not anticipate any violation of these covenants. However, if economic conditions worsen and we incur unexpected losses, we could violate certain of the financial covenants imposed by the credit facility and lose access to available funds or lines of credit through the facility. While maintenance of the unsecured, revolving credit facility provides a valuable source of contingent liquidity, we believe operating cash flows are sufficient to support our short-term liquidity needs. Shelf Registration We filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2014 to issue various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depository shares, stock purchase contracts, units and warrants, or preferred securities of wholly-owned finance trusts. The shelf registration enables us to raise funds from the offering of any securities covered by the shelf registration as well as any combination thereof, subject to market conditions and our capital needs. See Note 8 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for additional information on our debt. 81 Commitments The following table summarizes contractual obligations and our reinsurance recoverable by period as of December 31, 2014 : (in millions of dollars) Total In 1 Year or Less After 1 Year up to 3 Years After 3 Years up to 5 Years After 5 Years Payments Due Short-term Debt $ 161.0 $ 161.0 $ $ $ Long-term Debt 4,321.8 136.1 597.9 412.8 3,175.0 Policyholder Liabilities 43,358.3 4,685.3 6,864.5 5,394.8 26,413.7 Pension and OPEB 725.7 19.5 38.2 37.3 630.7 Miscellaneous Liabilities 687.8 613.6 18.0 11.8 44.4 Operating Leases 227.1 40.2 75.6 35.7 75.6 Purchase Obligations 256.7 254.6 2.1 Total $ 49,738.4 $ 5,910.3 $ 7,596.3 $ 5,892.4 $ 30,339.4 Receipts Due Reinsurance Recoverable $ 7,704.9 $ 348.9 $ 605.5 $ 615.3 $ 6,135.2 Short-term and long-term debt includes contractual principal and interest payments and therefore exceeds the amount shown in the consolidated balance sheets. Policyholder liability maturities and the related reinsurance recoverable represent the projected payout of the current in-force policyholder liabilities and the expected cash inflows from reinsurers for liabilities ceded and therefore incorporate uncertainties as to the timing and amount of claim payments. We utilize extensive liability modeling to project future cash flows from the in-force business. The primary assumptions used to project future cash flows are claim incidence rates for mortality and morbidity, claim resolution rates, persistency rates, and interest rates. These cash flows are discounted to determine the current value of the projected claim payments. The timing and amount of payments on policyholder liabilities may vary significantly from the projections above. Pensions and OPEB commitments represent the expected benefit payments related to our U.S. non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as it is our policy to pay those benefits, as incurred, from our general assets. Our funding policy for our U.S. qualified defined benefit and our U.K. defined benefit pension plans is to make only contributions necessary to meet minimum funding requirements under U.S. and U.K. legislation. We do not currently expect to make any contributions to either of these plans and therefore have not included amounts in the preceding chart. However, to the extent contributions are required, we will make the necessary contributions to these plans. Miscellaneous liabilities include commissions due and accrued, deferred compensation liabilities, state premium taxes payable, amounts due to reinsurance companies, obligations to return unrestricted cash collateral to our securities lending and derivatives counterparties, legally binding commitments to fund investments, and various other liabilities that represent contractual obligations. Obligations where the timing of the payment is uncertain are included in the one year or less category. See "Critical Accounting Estimates" contained in this Item 7 and Notes 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 14 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for additional information on our various commitments and obligations. 82 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Operating leases include noncancelable obligations on certain office space, equipment, and software. Purchase obligations include non-binding commitments of $238.4 million to fund certain of our investments. These are included in the preceding table based on the expiration date of the commitments. The funds are due upon satisfaction of contractual notice from appropriate external parties and may or may not be funded. Also included are obligations with outside parties for computer data processing services, software maintenance agreements, and consulting services. The aggregate obligation remaining under these agreements was $ 16.8 million at December 31, 2014 . As part of our regular investing strategy, we receive collateral from unaffiliated third parties through transactions which include both securities lending and also short-term agreements to purchase securities with the agreement to resell them at a later specified date. For both types of transactions, we require that a minimum of 102 percent of the fair value of the securities loaned or securities purchased under repurchase agreements be maintained as collateral. Generally, cash is received as collateral under these agreements. In the event that securities are received as collateral, we are not permitted to sell or re-post them. We also post our fixed maturity securities as collateral to unaffiliated third parties through transactions including both securities lending and also short-term agreements to sell securities with the agreement to repurchase them at a later specified date. See "Transfers of Financial Assets" as follows for further discussion. To help limit the credit exposure of derivatives, we enter into master netting agreements with our counterparties whereby contracts in a gain position can be offset against contracts in a loss position. We also typically enter into bilateral, cross-collateralization agreements with our counterparties to help limit the credit exposure of the derivatives. These agreements require the counterparty in a loss position to submit acceptable collateral with the other counterparty in the event the net loss position meets or exceeds an agreed upon amount. Our current credit exposure on derivatives, which is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position, including accrued interest receivable less collateral held, was $ 13.6 million at December 31, 2014 . We held cash collateral from our counterparties of $ 15.4 million at December 31, 2014 and had posted fixed maturity securities with a carrying value of $ 67.0 million as collateral to our counterparties. See Notes 3, 4, and 14 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for additional information. Transfers of Financial Assets Our investment policy permits us to lend fixed maturity securities to unaffiliated financial institutions in short-term securities lending agreements, which increase our investment income with minimal risk. We account for all of our securities lending agreements and repurchase agreements as secured borrowings. We had $58.4 million of securities lending agreements outstanding which were collateralized by cash at December 31, 2014 and were reported as other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The cash received as collateral was reinvested in short-term investments. The average balance during the year ended December 31, 2014 was $65.5 million, and the maximum amount outstanding at any month end was $94.0 million. In addition, at December 31, 2014 , we had $128.5 million of off-balance sheet securities lending agreements which were collateralized by securities that we were neither permitted to sell nor control. The average balance of these off-balance sheet transactions during the year ended December 31, 2014 was $116.5 million, and the maximum amount outstanding at any month end was $153.6 million. We had no repurchase agreements outstanding at December 31, 2014 . The average balance during the year ended December 31, 2014 was $1.6 million, and the maximum amount outstanding at any month end was $12.8 million. Our use of repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements can fluctuate during any given period and will depend on our liquidity position, the availability of long-term investments that meet our purchasing criteria, and our general business needs. During 2014, we were approved for membership of the Federal Home Loan Bank System (FHLB). As a member, we obtain access to low-cost funding and also receive dividends based on our stock ownership. Membership requires that we purchase a minimum amount of FHLB common stock based on a percentage of our total assets. Additional common stock purchases are required based upon the amount of funds borrowed from the FHLB. We will be required to post mortgage-related assets, U.S. Treasury securities, or other acceptable forms of collateral for any borrowings we make from the FHLB. As of December 31, 2014 we had not funded any FHLB common stock purchases or obtained any advances from the FHLB. Our initial common stock membership purchase will be funded in the first quarter of 2015. See Note 3 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for additional information. 83 Consolidated Cash Flows (in millions of dollars) Year Ended December 31 2014 2013 2012 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 1,223.6 $ 1,031.5 $ 1,379.6 Net Cash Used by Investing Activities (886.6 ) (419.2 ) (969.9 ) Net Cash Used by Financing Activities (328.6 ) (595.5 ) (449.0 ) Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Bank Deposits $ 8.4 $ 16.8 $ (39.3 ) Operating Cash Flows Operating cash flows are primarily attributable to the receipt of premium and investment income, offset by payments of claims, commissions, expenses, and income taxes. Premium income growth is dependent not only on new sales, but on policy renewals and growth of existing business, renewal price increases, and persistency. Investment income growth is dependent on the growth in the underlying assets supporting our insurance reserves and capital and on the earned yield. The level of commissions and operating expenses is attributable to the level of sales and the first year acquisition expenses associated with new business as well as the maintenance of existing business. The level of paid claims is affected partially by the growth and aging of the block of business and also by the general economy, as previously discussed in the operating results by segment. The variance in the change in insurance reserves and liabilities to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows for 2014 compared to the prior two years was due primarily to the 2014 reserve increase for our long-term care line of business. Investing Cash Flows Investing cash inflows consist primarily of the proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments. Investing cash outflows consist primarily of payments for purchases of investments. Our investment strategy is to match the cash flows and durations of our assets with the cash flows and durations of our liabilities to meet the funding requirements of our business. When market opportunities arise we may sell selected securities and reinvest the proceeds to improve the yield and credit quality of our portfolio, as was the case during 2013 when we sold lower yielding fixed maturity securities to take advantage of the higher interest rate environment by reinvesting the proceeds into higher yielding mortgage-backed and corporate securities with a higher credit quality. We may at times also sell selected securities and reinvest the proceeds to improve the duration matching of our assets and liabilities and/or re-balance our portfolio. As a result, sales before maturity may vary from period to period. The sale and purchase of short-term investments is influenced by our securities lending program and by the amount of cash which is at times held in short-term investments to facilitate the availability of cash to fund the purchase of appropriate long-term investments and/or to fund our capital deployment program. See Notes 3 and 4 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further information. Financing Cash Flows Financing cash flows consist primarily of borrowings and repayments of debt, issuance or repurchase of common stock, and dividends paid to stockholders. During 2014, we retired $145.0 million principal of our outstanding 6.85% notes, including a make-whole amount of $13.2 million, for a total cash outflow of $158.2 million.

During 2013, we purchased and retired the outstanding principal of $62.5 million on our floating rate, senior secured non-recourse notes issued by Tailwind Holdings for $56.2 million. During 2012, we made principal payments of $10.0 million on the Tailwind Holdings notes.

See "Debt" contained in this Item 7, and Notes 8 and 10 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further information. Ratings AM Best, Fitch, Moody's, and S&P are among the third parties that assign issuer credit ratings to Unum Group and financial strength ratings to our insurance subsidiaries. We compete based in part on the financial strength ratings provided by rating agencies. A downgrade of our financial strength ratings can be expected to adversely affect us and could potentially, among other things, adversely affect our relationships with distributors of our products and services and retention of our sales force, negatively impact persistency and new sales, particularly large case group sales and individual sales, and generally adversely affect our ability to compete. A downgrade in the issuer credit rating assigned to Unum Group can be expected to adversely affect our cost of capital or our ability to raise additional capital. The table below reflects the outlook as well as the issuer credit ratings for Unum Group and the financial strength ratings for each of our traditional insurance subsidiaries as of the date of this filing.

A significant component of our communications involves our annual review meeting with each of the four agencies. We hold other meetings throughout the year regarding our business, including, but not limited to, quarterly updates. On December 16, 2014, Fitch affirmed its A rating of our domestic insurance subsidiaries and affirmed the BBB issuer credit rating for Unum Group following our 2015 Outlook Meeting held that day during which we discussed our expected long-term care reserve charge. On December 19, 2014, AM Best also affirmed its A rating of our primary domestic insurance subsidiaries and affirmed the senior debt rating of Unum Group at bbb. There have been no changes in any of the rating agencies' outlook statements or ratings during 2014 or 2015 prior to the date of this filing. 85 Agency ratings are not directed toward the holders of our securities and are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities. Each rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be regarded as an independent assessment, not conditional on any other rating. Given the dynamic nature of the ratings process, changes by these or other rating agencies may or may not occur in the near-term. Based on our ongoing dialogue with the rating agencies concerning our insurance risk profile, our financial flexibility, our operating performance, and the quality of our investment portfolio, we do not expect any negative actions from any of the four rating agencies related to either Unum Group's current issuer credit ratings or the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries. However, in the event that we are unable to meet the rating agency specific guideline values to maintain our current ratings, including but not limited to maintenance of our capital management metrics at the threshold values stated and maintenance of our financial flexibility and operational consistency, we could be placed on a negative credit watch, with a potential for a downgrade to both our issuer credit ratings and our financial strength ratings. See "Ratings" contained herein in Item 1 and "Risk Factors" contained herein in Item 1A for further discussion. 86
