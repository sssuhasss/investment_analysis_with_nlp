Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (in millions) General During 2006, the Company continued to strengthen its financial performance through the implementation of the Company strategic plan and the expansion of its national platform in routine testing. This plan continues to provide growth opportunities for the Company by building a leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies primarily through internal development efforts, acquisitions and technology licensing activities. The Company continues to have strong relationships with national managed care organizations such as Aetna, Cigna, Humana, UnitedHealthcare, and Wellpoint. These relationships were a major driver of volume growth this year is a result of managed care relationships. On October 3, 2006, the Company announced that it has entered into a new, ten-year agreement with UnitedHealthcare Insurance Company (UnitedHealthcare), effective January 1, 2007. Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company became UnitedHealthcare exclusive national laboratory, offering a comprehensive suite of services, and will also work with other regional and local laboratory providers to selectively develop, implement and manage for UnitedHealthcare a series of laboratory networks in selected regions across the United States. As part of this network development and oversight process, the Company assumed responsibility for managing the Oxford Health Plans laboratory network located in the greater New York metropolitan region effective January 1, 2007. Also effective January 1, 2007, the Company became the exclusive national capitated UnitedHealthcare laboratory provider for the HMO benefit plans of PacifiCare of Colorado, Neighborhood Health Partnership in Florida, and Mid Atlantic Medical Services, L.L.C. (MAMSI) in Maryland and Virginia, and will remain the exclusive provider for HMO benefit plans for PacifiCare of Arizona. Over a period of several years, the Company will continue to perform more of UnitedHealthcare testing. During the first three years of the ten-year agreement, the Company has committed to reimburse UnitedHealthcare up to $200 for transition costs related to developing an expanded network in the Oxford, MAMSI and Neighborhood Health Partnership markets, as well as in California and Colorado. Over the term of the agreement, the Company expects to realize additional revenues in excess of $3 billion from UnitedHealthcare and associated business. In anticipation of the additional volume from this agreement, as of January 1, 2007, the Company has opened over four hundred patient access points and hired over twelve hundred employees, including phlebotomists, couriers, laboratory technicians and sales people. In addition, the company has invested approximately $16.0 in capital projects relating to the United Healthcare contract. Seasonality The majority of the Company testing volume is dependent on patient visits to doctor offices and other providers of health care. Volume of testing generally declines during the year-end holiday periods and other major holidays. In addition, volume declines due to inclement weather may reduce net revenues and cash flows. Therefore, comparison of the results of successive quarters may not accurately reflect trends or results for the full year. (36) Results of Operations Years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 Net Sales Years Ended December 31, % Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 Net Sales Routine Testing $ 2,347 .6 $ 2,197 .8 $ 2,118 .3 6.8% 3.8% Genomic and Esoteric 1,243 .2 1,129 .8 966 .5 10.0% 16.9% Total $ 3,590 .8 $ 3,327 .6 $ 3,084 .8 7.9% 7.9% Number of Accessions Years Ended December 31, % Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 Volume Routine Testing 76 .7 74 .8 75 .3 2.6% (0.7% ) Genomic and Esoteric 18 .8 17 .3 15 .8 8.6% 9.5% Total 95 .5 92 .1 91 .1 3.7% 1.1% Price Per Accession(PPA) Years Ended December 31, % Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 Price Routine Testing $ 30 .60 $ 29 .38 $ 28 .12 4.1% 4.5% Genomic and Esoteric $ 66 .14 $ 65 .26 $ 61 .18 1.3% 6.7% Total $ 37 .59 $ 36 .12 $ 33 .86 4.1% 6.7% The increase in net sales for the three years ended December 31, 2006 has been driven primarily by the Company continued shift in test mix to higher priced genomic and esoteric tests and the impact of acquisitions. As a percentage of total net sales, genomic and esoteric tests have increased during the three year period ended December 31, 2006 from 31.3% in 2004 to 34.6% in 2006. The acquisitions of US Labs and Esoterix in 2005 have helped to build on the Company leadership position in the genomic and esoteric market. In addition to a shift in test mix, net sales were positively impacted in 2006 by improved pricing and volume in routine testing. Cost of Sales Years Ended December 31, % Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 Cost of Sales $ 2,061 .4 $ 1,937 .3 $ 1,795 .5 6.4% 7.9% Cost of sales as a % of sales 57.4% 58.2% 58.2% Cost of sales, which includes primarily laboratory and distribution costs, has increased over the three year period ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased volume in genomic and esoteric testing and the impact of acquisitions. In addition, the Company incurred approximately $14 in costs in the fourth quarter of 2006 to add to its patient service delivery capabilities in preparation for its new contract with UnitedHealthcare. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales has remained relatively stable during 2004 and 2005, but has declined during 2006, as the Company has leveraged volume and price growth over its laboratory infrastructure. Labor and testing supplies comprise over 75% of the Company cost of sales. (37) Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Years Ended December 31, % Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 779 .1 $ 703 .9 $ 649 .1 10.7% 8.4% SG&A as a % of sales 21.7% 21.2% 21.0% Total selling, general and administrative expenses as percentage of sales have increased slightly over the three year period ended December 31, 2006. The Company has reduced its bad debt expense rate over the three year period from 6.3% in 2004 to 4.8% in 2006. The decrease in the bad debt expense rate is the result of improved billing and collection performance. Other SG&A expenses remained relatively flat in 2004 and increased significantly in 2005 as the Company began the integration of the Esoterix and US LABS acquisitions. Other SG&A expenses increased in 2006 due to the Company adoption of SFAS 123(R) during the first quarter of 2006, which required the Company to record compensation expense of $23.3 related to its stock option and stock purchase plans. During the second half of fiscal year 2006, the Company recorded charges of approximately $12.4, primarily related to the acceleration of the recognition of stock compensation due to the announced retirement of the Company Chief Executive Officer, which was effective December 31, 2006. Amortization of intangibles and other assets Years Ended December 31, % Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 Amortization of intangibles and other assets $ 52 .2 $ 51 .4 $ 42 .7 1.6% 20.4% Amortization of intangibles and other assets is driven primarily by the impact of acquisitions and licensed technology. The increase during 2005 was driven primarily by the impact of the Esoterix and US LABS acquisitions. Investment Loss Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Investment loss $ -- $ (3.1 ) $ -- During the second quarter of 2005, the Company recorded an investment loss of $3.1, related to a write-off of the value of warrants to purchase common stock of Exact Sciences Corporation ( Exact ), which were obtained as part of the Company licensing agreement for Exact PreGen Plus technology in 2002. The original term of the warrants expired in June 2005. Restructuring and other special charges Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Restructuring and other special charges $ 1.0 $ 16.9 $ (0.9 ) During the third quarter of 2006, the Company recorded net restructuring charges of $1.0 relating to certain expense-reduction initiatives undertaken across the Company corporate and divisional operations. During the third and fourth quarters of 2005, the Company began to implement its plan related to the integration of Esoterix and US LABS operations into the Company service delivery network. The plan (38) is directed at reducing redundant facilities, while maintaining the goal of providing excellent customer service. In connection with the integration plan, the Company recorded $11.9 of costs associated with the execution of the plan. The majority of these integration costs related to employee severance and contractual obligations associated with leased facilities and equipment. Of this amount, $10.1 related to employee severance benefits for approximately 700 employees, with the remainder primarily related to contractual obligations associated with leased facilities. Employee groups affected as a result of this plan included those involved in the collection and testing of specimens, as well as administrative and other support functions. During 2005, the Company also recorded a special charge of $5.0 related to forgiveness of amounts owed by patients and clients as well as other costs associated with the areas of the Gulf Coast severely impacted by hurricanes Katrina and Rita. During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recorded certain adjustments to previously recorded restructuring charges due to changes in estimates, resulting in a credit of approximately of $0.9 million. Interest expense Years Ended December 31, % Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 Interest expense $ 47 .8 $ 34 .4 $ 36 .1 39.0% (4.7% ) The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 was driven by the issuance of the 5 5/8% senior notes due 2015 in December 2005. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 is primarily the result of the completion of amortization of deferred fees associated with the zero coupon-subordinated notes in 2004. Income from joint venture partnerships Years Ended December 31, % Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 Income from joint venture partnerships $ 66 .7 $ 58 .3 $ 51 .3 14.4% 13.6% Income from investments in joint venture partnerships represents the Company ownership share in joint venture partnerships acquired as part of the Dynacare acquisition on July 25, 2002. The increase in income from these investments is driven by improvement in operational performance and favorable exchange rates. A significant portion of this income is derived from investments in Ontario and Alberta, Canada, and is earned in Canadian dollars. Income tax expense Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Income tax expense $ 289 .3 $ 254 .5 $ 252 .3 Income tax expense as a % of income before tax 40.1% 39.7% 41.0% The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 was favorably impacted by a deduction for certain dividends received in 2005. (39) Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position The Company strong cash-generating capability and financial condition provide ready access to capital markets. The Company principal source of liquidity is operating cash flow. This cash-generating capability is one of the Company fundamental strengths and provides substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating, investing and financing needs. In addition, the Company has revolving credit facilities that are further discussed in Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating Activities In 2006, the Company operations provided $632.3 of cash, reflecting the Company solid business results. The growth in the Company cash flow from operations primarily resulted from improved earnings. The Company continued to focus on efforts to increase cash collections from all payers, as well as on-going improvements to the claim submission processes. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company made contributions to its defined pension plan in the amounts of $0.0, $8.0 and $60.3, respectively. The Company does not expect to contribute to its defined benefit pension plan during 2007 and is not legally required to do so. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of the Company pension and postretirement plans. Investing Activities Capital expenditures were $115.9, $93.6 and $95.0 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company expects capital expenditures of approximately $130 to $170 in 2007, including anticipated capital expenditures related to the UnitedHealthcare contract. The Company will continue to make important investments in information technology connectivity between its customers and financial systems. Such expenditures are expected to be funded by cash flow from operations as well as borrowings under the Company revolving credit facilities as needed. The Company has invested a total of $13.9 over the past three years in new testing technologies and had $51.0 net book value of capitalized patents, licenses and technology at December 31, 2006. While the Company continues to believe its strategy of entering into licensing and technology distribution agreements with the developers of leading-edge technologies will provide future growth in revenues, there are certain risks associated with these investments. These risks include, but are not limited to, the risk that the licensed technology will not gain broad acceptance in the marketplace; or that insurance companies, managed care organizations, or Medicare and Medicaid will not approve reimbursement for these tests at a level commensurate with the costs of running the tests. Any or all of these circumstances could result in impairment in the value of the related capitalized licensing costs. Financing Activities During 2006, the Company repurchased $435.1 of stock representing 6.7 million shares. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had outstanding authorizations from the Board of Directors to purchase approximately $350.2 of Company common stock. On September 22, 2006, the Company announced that it had commenced an exchange offer related to its zero-coupon subordinated notes due 2021. In the exchange offer, the Company offered to exchange a new series of zero-coupon convertible subordinated notes due September 11, 2021 (the New Notes ) and an exchange fee of $2.50 per $1,000 aggregate principal amount at maturity for all of the outstanding zero-coupon subordinated notes due 2021 (the Old Notes ). The purpose of the exchange offer was to exchange the Old Notes for the New Notes with certain different terms, including the addition of a net share settlement feature. The net share settlement feature will require the Company to satisfy its obligation due upon conversion to holders of the New Notes in cash for a portion of the conversion obligation equal to the accreted principal of the New Notes and in shares for the remainder of the conversion value. In addition, the New Notes provide that the Company will eliminate its option to issue shares in lieu of paying cash if and when the Company repurchases the New Notes at the option of holders. (40) On October 23, 2006, the exchange offer expired. Following settlement of the exchange, $741.2 in aggregate principal amount at maturity of the New Notes and $2.6 in aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Old Notes were outstanding. Credit Ratings The Company debt ratings of Baa3 from Moody and BBB from Standard and Poor contribute to our ability to access capital markets. Contractual Cash Obligations Payments Due by Period Total 2007 2008- 2009 2010- 2011 2012 and thereafter Capital lease obligations $ 0.6 $ 0.6 $ -- $ -- $ -- Operating lease obligations 287.3 78.8 104.2 55.8 48.5 Contingent future licensing payments (a) 55.9 3.8 19.3 12.6 20.2 Minimum royalty payments 28.9 6.5 12.6 6.2 3.6 Minimum purchase obligations 20.0 10.0 10.0 -- -- Zero coupon-subordinated notes (b) 554.4 554.4 -- -- -- Scheduled interest payments on Senior Notes 251.7 33.3 66.6 66.6 85.2 Long-term debt 603.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 600.0 Total contractual cash obligations(c)(d) $ 1,801.8 $ 688.4 $ 213.7 $ 142.2 $ 757.5 (a) Contingent future licensing payments will be made if certain events take place, such as the launch of a specific test, the transfer of certain technology, and when specified revenue milestones are met. (b) Holders of the zero coupon-subordinated notes may require the Company to purchase in cash all or a portion of their notes on September 11, 2011 at $819.54 per note. Should the holders put the notes to the Company on that date, the Company believes that it will be able to satisfy this contingent obligation with cash on hand, borrowings on the revolving credit facility, and additional financing if necessary. As announced by the Company on January 9, 2007, holders of the zero coupon-subordinated notes may choose to convert their notes subject to terms as defined in the note agreement. See Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Company zero coupon-subordinated notes. (c) The table does not include obligations under the Company pension and postretirement benefit plans, which are included in Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Benefits under the Company postretirement medical plan are made when claims are submitted for payment, the timing of which are not practicable to estimate. (d) The table does not include the Company contingent obligation to reimburse up to $200.0 in transitional costs during the first three years of the UnitedHealthcare contract. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have transactions or relationships with special purpose entities, and the Company does not have any off balance sheet financing other than normal operating leases. Other Commercial Commitments At December 31, 2006, the Company provided letters of credit aggregating approximately $111.7, primarily in connection with certain insurance programs and contractual guarantees on obligations under the Company new contract with UnitedHealthcare. The UnitedHealthcare contract requires that the Company provide a $50.0 letter of credit, as security for the Company contingent obligation to reimburse up to $200.0 in transitional costs during the first three years of the contract. Letters of credit (41) provided by the Company are secured by the Company senior credit facilities and are renewed annually, around mid-year. At December 31, 2006, the Company was named as guarantor on approximately $6.4 of equipment leases. These leases were entered into by a joint venture that the Company owns a fifty percent interest in and have a five year term. Based on current and projected levels of operations, coupled with availability under its senior credit facilities, the Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet both its short-term and long-term cash needs. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 ( FIN 48 ), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109". FIN 48 clarifies how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose uncertain tax positions. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, interest and penalties, accounting for interim periods, and transition. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and the Company is adopting the interpretation effective January 1, 2007. The cumulative effect of applying FIN 48 is to be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. Based on our evaluation as of December 31, 2006, the Company does not believe that FIN 48 will have a material impact on our financial statements.. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 Fair Value Measurements ( SFAS 157 ). SFAS 157 provides a new single authoritative definition of fair value and provides enhanced guidance for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities and requires additional disclosures related to the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 is effective for the Company as of January 1, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, of SFAS 157 on its consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( SFAS 159 ). SFAS 159 permits all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entity first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, of SFAS 159 on its consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Company critical accounting policies arise in conjunction with the following: Revenue recognition and allowances for doubtful accounts Pension expense Accruals for self insurance reserves Income taxes Revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts Revenue is recognized for services rendered when test results are reported to the ordering physician and the testing process is complete. The Company sales are generally billed to three types of payers clients, patients and third parties, such as managed care companies, Medicare and Medicaid. For clients, sales are recorded on a fee-for-service basis at the Company client list price, less any negotiated discount. Patient sales are recorded at the Company patient fee schedule, net of any discounts negotiated with physicians on behalf of their patients. The Company bills third party payers in two ways (42) fee-for-service and capitated agreements. Fee-for-service third party payers are billed at the Company patient fee schedule amount, and third party revenue is recorded net of contractual discounts. These discounts are recorded at the transaction level at the time of sale based on a fee schedule that is maintained for each third party payer. The majority of the Company third party sales are recorded using an actual or contracted fee schedule at the time of sale. For the remaining third party sales, estimated fee schedules are maintained for each payer. Adjustments to the estimated payment amounts are recorded at the time of final collection and settlement of each transaction as an adjustment to revenue. These adjustments are not material to the Company results of operations in any period presented. The Company periodically adjusts these estimated fee schedules based upon historical payment trends. Under capitated agreements with managed care companies, the Company recognizes revenue based on a negotiated monthly contractual rate for each member of the managed care plan regardless of the number or costs of services performed. The Company has a formal process to estimate and review the collectibility of its receivables based on the period of time they have been outstanding. Bad debt expense is recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales considered necessary to maintain the allowance for doubtful accounts at an appropriate level. The Company process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for doubtful accounts involves judgment, and considers such factors as the age of the underlying receivables, historical and projected collection experience, and other external factors that could affect the collectibility of its receivables. Accounts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the Company write off policy (e.g. when they are deemed to be uncollectible). In the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance, accounts are progressively reserved based on the historical timing of cash collections relative to their respective aging categories within the Company receivables. These collection and reserve processes, along with the close monitoring of the billing process, help reduce the risks of material revisions to reserve estimates resulting from adverse changes in collection or reimbursement experience. The following table presents the percentage of the Company net accounts receivable outstanding by aging category at December 31, 2006 and 2005: Days Outstanding 2006 2005 0 - 30 44.9% 43.6% 31 - 61 19.3% 22.3% 61 - 91 11.2% 10.1% 91 - 120 7.3% 7.3% 121 - 150 5.2% 4.6% 151 - 180 3.6% 3.6% 181 - 270 6.6% 6.6% 271 - 360 1.6% 1.4% Over 360 0.3% 0.5% Pension Expense Substantially all employees of the Company are covered by a defined benefit retirement plan (the Company Plan ). The benefits to be paid under the Company Plan are based on years of credited service and compensation earned while an employee of LabCorp. The Company also has nonqualified supplemental retirement plan which covers its senior management group and provides for additional benefits, due in part to limitations on benefits and pay imposed on the Company Plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The Company net pension cost is developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates and expected return on plan assets, which are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each year. The Company is required to consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in making these assumptions. Changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. The key assumptions used in accounting for the defined benefit retirement plans were a 6.0% discount rate and an 8.5% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets as of December 31, 2006. (43) Discount Rate The Company works with its independent actuary to develop a discount rate assumption used to value the benefit obligations of its retirement plans. The Company follows paragraph 186 of Financial Accounting Standard 106 in developing this rate. The Company actuary obtains information on high-quality corporate (AA rating or higher) bonds from a nationally recognized credit rating agency. These bonds are then reviewed and outliers are discarded. The results of the actuary discount rate analysis are then reviewed by the Company and a final decision on the discount rate assumption is made by the Company. A one percentage point reduction in the discount rate would have resulted in an increase in 2006 pension expense of $4.0 million. Return on Plan Assets In establishing its expected return on plan assets assumption, the Company reviews its asset allocation and develops return assumptions based on different asset classes adjusting for plan operating expenses. Actual asset over/under performance compared to expected returns will respectively decrease/increase unrecognized loss. The change in the unrecognized loss will change amortization cost in upcoming periods. A one percentage point increase in the expected return on plan assets would have resulted in a decrease in 2006 pension expense of $2.5 million. Current year net pension cost excluding the impact of the $0.7 million non-recurring CEO retirement charge was $14.7 million, an increase of $4.7 million from 2005. Our actuaries have estimated that 2007 net pension cost will be approximately $14.7 million. Further information on our defined benefit retirement plan is provided in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. Accruals for Self-insurance Reserves Accruals for self-insurance reserves (including workers compensation, auto and employee medical) are determined based on historical payment trends and claims history, along with current and estimated future economic conditions. The Company is self-insured for professional liability claims arising in the normal course of business, generally related to the testing and reporting of laboratory test results. The Company records an accrual for known and incurred but not reported claims based on an actuarial assessment of the accrual driven by frequency and amounts of claims, which is performed at least annually. While management believes these estimates are reasonable and consistent, they are by their very nature, estimates of amounts that will depend on future events. Accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates. The Company Audit Committee periodically reviews the Company significant accounting policies. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method. Under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. (44) FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The Company has made in this report, and from time to time may otherwise make in its public filings, press releases and discussions by Company management, forward-looking statements concerning the Company operations, performance and financial condition, as well as its strategic objectives.
