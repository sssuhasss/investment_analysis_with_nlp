ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) The following discussion provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Newmont Mining Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, Newmont or the Company ). References to A$ refer to Australian currency, CDN$ to Canadian currency, NZD$ to New Zealand currency, IDR to Indonesian currency and $ to United States currency. This discussion addresses matters we consider important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the three years ended December 31, 2007, as well as our future results. It consists of the following subsections: Overview, which provides a brief summary of our consolidated results and financial position and the primary factors affecting those results, as well as a summary of our expectations for 2008; Accounting Developments, which provides a discussion of recent changes to our accounting policies that have affected our consolidated results and financial position; Critical Accounting Policies, which provides an analysis of the accounting policies we consider critical because of their effect on the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and/or expenses in our consolidated financial statements and/or because they require difficult, subjective or complex judgments by our management; Consolidated Financial Results, which includes a discussion of our consolidated financial results for the last three years; Results of Consolidated Operations, which sets forth an analysis of the operating results for the last three years; Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Developments, which summarizes recently published authoritative accounting guidance, how it might apply to us and how it might affect our future results; and Liquidity and Capital Resources, which contains a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, investing activities and financing activities, contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements. This item should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report. Overview Newmont is one of the world largest gold producers and is the only gold company included in the S&P 500 Index, Fortune 500 and in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index-World. We are also engaged in the exploration for and acquisition of gold properties. We have significant assets or operations in the United States, Australia, Peru, Indonesia, Canada, Bolivia, New Zealand, Ghana and Mexico. We face key risks associated with our business. One of the most significant risks is fluctuation in the prices of gold and copper, which are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. Other challenges we face include capital and production cost increases and social and environmental issues. Operating costs at our mines are subject to variation due to a number of factors, such as changing ore grades, metallurgy, revisions to mine plans and changes in accounting principles. At foreign locations, such costs are also influenced by currency fluctuations that may affect our U.S. dollar operating costs. In addition, we must continually replace reserves depleted through production by expanding known ore bodies, by acquisition or by locating new deposits in order to maintain production levels over the long term. 37 Table of Contents Summary of Consolidated Financial and Operating Performance The table below highlights key financial and operating results: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Revenues $ 5,526 $ 4,882 $ 4,265 (Loss) income from continuing operations $ (963 ) $ 563 $ 278 Net (loss) income $ (1,886 ) $ 791 $ 322 Net (loss) income per common share, basic: (Loss) income from continuing operations $ (2.13 ) $ 1.25 $ 0.62 Net (loss) income $ (4.17 ) $ 1.76 $ 0.72 Consolidated gold ounces sold (thousands) (1) 6,184 7,186 8,237 Consolidated copper pounds sold (millions) 428 435 573 Average price received, net (2) Gold (per ounce) $ 697 $ 594 $ 437 Copper (per pound) $ 2.86 $ 1.54 $ 1.17 Costs applicable to sales (3) Gold (per ounce) $ 406 $ 303 $ 235 Copper (per pound) $ 1.10 $ 0.71 $ 0.53 (1) Includes incremental start-up ounces of 6, 100 and 22 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. (2) After treatment and refining charges and excluding settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts. (3) Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization, loss on settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts and Midas redevelopment. Consolidated Financial Performance Gold revenues increased in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to higher gold prices, partially offset by lower gold sales volume. Gold sales decreased to 6.2 million ounces in 2007 from 7.2 million ounces in 2006, primarily due to decreased throughput and lower grade ores processed at Yanacocha and Nevada, partially offset by a full year of operations at Ahafo in 2007. Copper revenues increased in 2007 from 2006 due to an increase in the average realized price as the final deliveries were made under the copper collar contracts in February 2007 (see Results of Consolidated Operations below). The gold price increases over the last few years were partially offset by higher production costs and fewer gold ounces sold. During the same period, we have seen significant increases in the costs of labor, fuel, power and other bulk consumables. In addition, our financial and operating results were impacted by the following (pre-tax): Gain on the sale of the royalty portfolio ($905) included in (Loss) income from discontinued operations ; Gain on the Zarafshan settlement ($77) compared to a loss on expropriation ($101 in 2006) included in (Loss) income from discontinued operations ; Merchant Banking goodwill impairment ($1,665) included in (Loss) income from discontinued operations ; Exploration goodwill impairment ($1,122); and Loss on the settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts ($531). 38 Table of Contents Acquisition of Miramar On October 9, 2007, the Company announced the proposed acquisition of Miramar Mining Corporation ( Miramar ) and offered to acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Miramar for C$6.25 in cash. On December 27, 2007, 155 million common shares of Miramar had been validly deposited to Newmont offer. Newmont took up, accepted and paid for such shares, representing approximately 70% of the common shares of Miramar which, in addition to the 18 million shares previously owned by the Company, brought the Company interest in Miramar to approximately 78%. Miramar is a Canadian company that controls the Hope Bay project, a large undeveloped gold project in Nunavut, Canada. The Hope Bay Project is consistent with the Company strategic focus on exploration and project development and was acquired with the intention of adding higher grade ore reserves and developing a new core gold mining district in a AAA-rated country. In January 2008, Newmont acquired approximately 40 million additional common shares of Miramar at a price of C$6.25 per common share, bringing its interest in Miramar to 96%. This successfully completed the offer to acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Miramar. Newmont has mailed a notice of compulsory acquisition pursuant to the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) to acquire all the remaining common shares of Miramar that were not acquired pursuant to the offer. Liquidity The Company financial position was as follows: December 31, 2007 2006 Total debt $ 2,938 $ 1,911 Total stockholders equity $ 7,548 $ 9,337 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,231 $ 1,166 Marketable securities $ 1,500 $ 1,353 During 2007 our debt and liquidity positions were affected by the following: Proceeds from the issuance of debt of $3,008, offset by $2,036 in repayments; Convertible note hedge transaction including the purchase of call options for $366, partially offset by issuance of warrants of $248; Net cash provided from continuing operations of $525 after settlement of the price-capped forward sales contracts of $578 and settlement of pre-acquisition tax contingency of Normandy of $276; Net proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations of $1,197 and net proceeds from the Zarafshan settlement of $77; Acquisition of approximately 70% of Miramar for $991 less cash received from the purchase of $38; Capital expenditures of $1,670; Dividends paid to common shareholders of $181; and Dividends paid to minority interests of $270. Looking Forward Certain key factors will affect our future financial and operating results. These include, but are not limited to, the following: Fluctuations in gold prices and, to a lesser extent, copper prices; We expect 2008 consolidated gold sales of approximately 5.9 to 6.4 million ounces, primarily as a result of lower production from Australia and Batu Hijau; 39 Table of Contents Costs applicable to sales per ounce for 2008 are expected to be approximately $425 to $450 per ounce as the impact of industry-wide cost pressures are expected to be compounded by slightly lower gold production; We expect 2008 consolidated copper sales of approximately 345 to 365 million pounds at Costs applicable to sales of approximately $1.30 to $1.40 per pound as mining shifts from the high grade bottom of the pit into a lower grade mine sequence during 2008 and 2009; We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $1,800 to $2,000 in 2008, with approximately 50% in Australia/New Zealand, 25% in Nevada and the remaining 25% invested at other locations. Approximately $900 to $1,000 of the 2008 capital budget is allocated to sustaining investments, with the remaining $900 to $1,000 allocated to project development initiatives, including completion of the Boddington project in Australia, the power plant in Nevada and the Yanacocha gold mill in Peru; We expect 2008 exploration expenditures of approximately $220 to $230 and 2008 advanced projects, research and development expenditures of approximately $120 to $180; The construction of the Boddington project, the 200 megawatt coal-fired power plant in Nevada and the gold mill at Yanacocha, as well as potential future investments in the Hope Bay project in Canada, the Akyem project in Ghana and the Conga project in Peru will require significant funds for capital expenditures. At current gold and copper prices, new sources of capital will be needed to meet the funding requirements of these investments, fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends. Our ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices and our operational performance, among other factors. In the event of lower gold and copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or new funding limitations, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends could be significantly constrained; and Our full-year 2008 expectations, particularly with respect to sales volumes and costs applicable to sales per ounce or pound, may differ significantly from actual quarter and full year results due to variations in: ore grades and hardness, metal recoveries, waste removed, commodity input prices, foreign currencies and gold and copper sales prices (as impacting royalty and labor costs). Accounting Developments Income Taxes The Company operates in numerous countries around the world and accordingly is subject to, and pays, annual income taxes under the various income tax regimes in the countries in which it operates. Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, and others are defined by the general corporate income tax laws of the country. The Company has historically filed, and continues to file, all required income tax returns and to pay the taxes reasonably determined to be due. The tax rules and regulations in many countries are highly complex and subject to interpretation. From time to time the Company is subject to a review of its historic income tax filings and in connection with such reviews, disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation or application of certain rules to the Company business conducted within the country involved. The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, ( FIN48 ) an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes on January 1, 2007. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting and reporting for uncertainties in the application of the income tax laws to the Company operations. The interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. The cumulative effects of applying this interpretation have been recorded as a decrease in retained earnings of $108, an increase of $5 in goodwill, an increase of $4 in minority interest, a decrease in net deferred tax assets of $37 (primarily, as a result of utilization of foreign tax credits and net 40 Table of Contents operating losses as part of the FIN 48 measurement process, offset, in part, by the impact of the interaction of the Alternative Minimum Tax rules) and an increase of $72 in the net liability for unrecognized income tax benefits. Pensions As of December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) ( FAS 158 ). FAS 158 required employers that sponsor one or more defined benefit plans to (i) recognize the funded status of a benefit plan in its statement of financial position, (ii) recognize the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, (iii) measure the defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer fiscal year-end statement of financial position, and (iv) disclose in the notes to the financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition asset or obligation. The impact of adopting FAS 158 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2006 was as follows: Before Application of FAS 158 Adjustment After Application of FAS 158 Other long-term assets $ 193 $ (15 ) $ 178 Total assets $ 15,616 $ (15 ) $ 15,601 Employee pension and other benefits $ 229 $ 27 $ 256 Deferred income taxes $ 649 $ (14 ) $ 635 Accumulated other comprehensive income $ 700 $ (27 ) $ 673 Total stockholders equity $ 9,364 $ (27 ) $ 9,337 Stock Based Compensation On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment ( FAS 123(R) ). The Company adopted FAS 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method. Under this method, compensation cost recognized in 2006 included: a) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of FAS 123, and b) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of FAS 123(R). As a result of adopting FAS 123(R), the Company Loss from continuing operations and Net loss for 2007 was $11 ($0.02 per share) higher and Income from continuing operations and Net income for 2006 was $19 ($0.04 per share) lower, respectively, than if we had continued to account for share-based compensation under APB 25 as we did prior to January 1, 2006. Prior to the adoption of FAS 123(R), cash retained as a result of tax deductions relating to stock-based compensation was included in operating cash flows, along with other tax cash flows. FAS 123(R) requires tax benefits relating to the deductibility of increases in the equity instruments issued under share-based compensation arrangements that are not included in Costs applicable to sales ( excess tax benefits ) to be presented in the Statement of Cash Flows as financing cash inflows. The benefit realized for tax deductions from option exercises totaled $3 and $6 in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Deferred Stripping Costs On January 1, 2006 the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-06 ( EITF 04-06 ), Accounting for Stripping Costs Incurred during Production in the Mining Industry. EITF 04-06 addresses the accounting for stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine and refers to these costs as variable production costs that should be included as a component of inventory to be recognized in Costs applicable to 41 Table of Contents sales in the same period as the revenue from the sale of inventory. As a result, capitalization of post-production stripping costs is appropriate only to the extent product inventory exists at the end of a reporting period. The guidance required the recognition of a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption, with no charge to earnings in the period of adoption for prior periods. The cumulative effect adjustment reduced retained earnings by $81 (net of tax and minority interests) and eliminated the $71 net deferred stripping asset from the balance sheet in 2006. Adoption of EITF 04-06 had no impact on the Company cash position or net cash from operations. Critical Accounting Policies Listed below are the accounting policies that the Company believes are critical to its financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported . Carrying Value of Goodwill As of December 31, 2007, the carrying value of goodwill was approximately $186. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Goodwill was assigned to various mine site reporting units in the Australia/New Zealand Segment. Our approach to allocating goodwill was to identify those reporting units that we believed had contributed to such excess purchase price. We then performed valuations to measure the incremental increases in the fair values of such reporting units that were attributable to the acquisitions, and that were not already captured in the fair values assigned to such units identifiable net assets. We evaluate, on at least an annual basis, the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether current events and circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may no longer be recoverable. To accomplish this, we compare the estimated fair values of the reporting units to their carrying amounts. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value at the time of the evaluation, we would compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount and any shortfall would be charged to earnings. Assumptions underlying fair value estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties. Mine Site Goodwill The assignment of goodwill to mine site reporting units was based on synergies that have been incorporated into our operations and business plans over time. The amount of goodwill assigned to each segment or reporting unit was based on discounted cash flow analyses that assumed risk-adjusted discount rates over the remaining lives of the applicable mining operations. We believe that triggering events with respect to the goodwill assigned to mine site reporting units could include, but are not limited to: (i) a significant decrease in our long-term gold and copper price assumptions; (ii) a decrease in reserves; (iii) a significant reduction in the estimated fair value of mine site exploration potential; and (iv) any event that might otherwise adversely affect mine site production levels or costs. We performed our annual impairment test of mine site goodwill as of December 31, 2007 and determined that the fair value of each mine site reporting unit was in excess of the relevant carrying value as of December 31, 2007. For more information on the discounted cash flows used to value mine site reporting units, see Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets, below. Exploration Segment Goodwill The Exploration Segment is responsible for all activities, whether near-mine or greenfield, associated with the Company efforts to discover new mineralized material that could ultimately advance into proven and probable reserves. As discussed in greater detail below, when performing its Exploration Segment goodwill impairment testing, the Company uses historic additions to proven and probable reserves as an indication of the expected future performance of the Exploration Segment. 42 Table of Contents The Exploration Segment valuation model attributes all cash flows expected to be derived from future greenfield exploration discoveries, to the Exploration Segment. The valuation model includes management best estimates of future reserve additions from exploration activities and all revenues and costs associated with their discovery, development and production. Historical proven and probable reserve additions, excluding acquisitions, are used as an indicator of the Exploration Segment ability to discover additional reserves in the future. Actual reserve additions may vary significantly from year to year due to the time required to advance a deposit from initial discovery to proven and probable reserves and based on the timing of when proven and probable reserves can be reported under the Securities and Exchange Commission Industry Guide 7. We performed our annual impairment test of the Exploration Segment goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2007. Based on the Exploration Segment historic additions to proven and probable reserves and management best estimates of future reserve additions from exploration activities and all revenues and costs associated with their discovery, development and production, the Exploration Segment estimated fair value was negligible. The decreased value attributable to the Exploration Segment resulted primarily from (i) a significantly lower assumed annual reserve growth rate (from 4% to 3%), (ii) a significant change in the financial markets resulting in a significant increase in the discount rate (from 8% to 10%), and (iii) an increase in finding costs due to a combination of increased spending and reduced exploration success. Based on the negligible valuation, the Exploration Segment goodwill was impaired and the full $1,122 of goodwill was recorded as a non-cash write-down of goodwill as of December 31, 2007. Merchant Banking Goodwill During June 2007, Newmont Board of Directors approved a plan to cease Merchant Banking activities. Merchant Banking previously provided advisory services to assist in managing the Company portfolio of operating and property interests. Merchant Banking was also engaged in developing value optimization strategies for operating and non-operating assets, business development activities, merger and acquisition analysis and negotiations, monetizing inactive exploration properties, capitalizing on proprietary technology and know-how and acting as an internal resource for other corporate groups to improve and maximize business outcomes. As a result of the Board approval of management plan to cease Merchant Banking activities, the Company recorded a $1,665 non-cash charge to impair the goodwill associated with the Merchant Banking Segment during the second quarter of 2007. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and depreciated using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to depreciate such costs over the estimated future lives of such facilities or equipment. These lives do not exceed the estimated mine life based on proven and probable reserves as the useful lives of these assets are considered to be limited to the life of the relevant mine. During the second quarter of 2007, the Company revised its estimate of haul truck lives prospectively to ten years based on experience. The impact of the change in estimate was a reduction of Depreciation, depletion and amortization which decreased the Company Loss from continuing operations and Net loss by $13 ($0.03 per share) in 2007. Costs incurred to develop new properties are capitalized as incurred, where it has been determined that the property can be economically developed based on the existence of proven and probable reserves. At our surface mines, these costs include costs to further delineate the ore body and remove overburden to initially expose the ore body. At our underground mines, these costs include the cost of building access ways, shaft sinking and access, lateral development, drift development, ramps and infrastructure development. All such costs are amortized using the units-of-production ( UOP ) method over the estimated life of the ore body based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves. 43 Table of Contents Major development costs incurred after the commencement of production are amortized using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves. To the extent that such costs benefit the entire ore body, they are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of the entire ore body. Costs incurred to access specific ore blocks on areas that only provide benefit over the life of that block or area are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of that specific ore block or area. The calculation of the UOP rate of amortization, and therefore the annual amortization charge to operations, could be materially impacted to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on proven and probable reserves. This would generally occur to the extent that there were significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in determining reserves. These factors could include: (i) an expansion of proven and probable reserves through exploration activities; (ii) differences between estimated and actual costs of production, due to differences in grade, metal recovery rates and foreign currency exchange rates; and (iii) differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of reserves. If reserves decreased significantly, amortization charged to operations would increase; conversely, if reserves increased significantly, amortization charged to operations would decrease. Such changes in reserves could similarly impact the useful lives of assets depreciated on a straight-line basis, where those lives are limited to the life of the mine, which in turn is limited to the life of the proven and probable reserves. The expected useful lives used in depreciation, depletion and amortization calculations are determined based on applicable facts and circumstances, as described above. Significant judgment is involved in the determination of useful lives, and no assurance can be given that actual useful lives will not differ significantly from the useful lives assumed for the purpose of depreciation, depletion and amortization calculations. Carrying Value of Stockpiles Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing. Stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile, the number of contained ounces based on assay data, and the estimated recovery percentage based on the expected processing method. Stockpile tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. Stockpiles are valued based on mining costs incurred up to the point of stockpiling the ore, including applicable depreciation, depletion and amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are added to a stockpile based on current mining costs and removed at the average cost per recoverable ounce of gold or pound of copper in the stockpile. Stockpiles are reduced as material is removed and processed further. The adoption of EITF 04-06 resulted in the allocation of deferred and advanced stripping costs to stockpiles and the value of our stockpiles decreased from $532 as of December 31, 2005 to $515 as of January 1, 2006. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, our stockpiles had a total carrying value of $732 and $742, respectively. Costs that are incurred in or benefit from the productive process are accumulated as stockpiles. We record stockpiles at the lower of average cost or net realizable value ( NRV ), and carrying values are evaluated at least quarterly. NRV represents the estimated future sales price of the product based on prevailing and long-term metals prices, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. The primary factors that influence the need to record write-downs of stockpiles include short-term and long-term metals prices and costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy, materials and supplies, as well as realized ore grades and actual production levels. If short-term and long-term metals prices decrease, the value of the stockpiles decreases, and it may be necessary to record a write-down of stockpiles to NRV. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, write-downs of stockpiles to NRV totaled $14, $2 and $9, respectively. Cost allocation to stockpiles and the NRV measurement involves the use of estimates and assumptions unique to each mining operation regarding current and future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors. A high degree of judgment is involved in determining such assumptions and estimates and no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. 44 Table of Contents Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets We review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An asset impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset, including goodwill, if any. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows. Future cash flows are estimated based on estimated quantities of recoverable minerals, expected gold and other commodity prices (considering current and historical prices, price trends and related factors), production levels and costs of production, capital and reclamation costs, all based on life-of-mine plans. The significant assumptions in determining the future discounted cash flows for each mine site reporting unit as of December 31, 2007, apart from production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, included a long-term gold price of $700 per ounce, a long-term copper price of $2.25 per pound and an Australian dollar exchange rate of A$1.25 per $1.00. Existing proven and probable reserves and value beyond proven and probable reserves, including mineralization other than proven and probable reserves and other material that is not part of the measured, indicated or inferred resource base, are included when determining the fair value of mine site reporting units at acquisition and, subsequently, in determining whether the assets are impaired. The term recoverable minerals refers to the estimated amount of gold or other commodities that will be obtained after taking into account losses during ore processing and treatment. Estimates of recoverable minerals from such exploration stage mineral interests are risk adjusted based on management relative confidence in such materials. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups. As discussed above under Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization, various factors could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted production schedules from proven and probable reserves. Additionally, production, capital and reclamation costs could differ from the assumptions used in the cash flow models used to assess impairment. The ability to achieve the estimated quantities of recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests involves further risks in addition to those factors applicable to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have been identified, due to the lower level of confidence that the identified mineralized material could ultimately be mined economically. Assets classified as other mine-related exploration potential and greenfields exploration potential have the highest level of risk that the carrying value of the asset can be ultimately realized, due to the still lower level of geological confidence and economic modeling. Derivative Instruments With the exception of the Call Spread Transactions (as described below in Note 20), all financial instruments that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value. Changes in the fair market value of derivatives recorded on the balance sheet are recorded in the statements of consolidated (loss) income, except for the effective portion of the change in fair market value of derivatives that are designated as a cash flow hedge and qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. Our portfolio of derivatives includes various complex instruments. Management applies significant judgment in estimating the fair value of instruments that are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding commodity prices, market volatilities, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Variations in these factors could materially affect amounts credited or charged to earnings to reflect the changes in fair market value of derivatives. In addition, certain derivative contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, whereby the effective portion of changes in fair market value of these instruments are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income and will be recognized in the statements of consolidated operations when the underlying production designated as the hedged item impacts earnings. All derivative contracts qualifying for hedge accounting are designated against the applicable portion of future foreign currency expenditures or future production from proven and probable reserves, where management believes the forecasted transaction is probable of occurring. To the extent that management determines that such future foreign expenditures or production are no longer probable of occurring, gains and losses deferred in 45 Table of Contents Accumulated other comprehensive income would be reclassified to the statements of consolidated (loss) income immediately. Reclamation and Remediation Obligations (Asset Retirement Obligations) Reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation and remediation costs. The asset retirement obligation is based on when the spending for an existing environmental disturbance will occur. We review, on at least an annual basis, the asset retirement obligation at each mine site in accordance with FASB FAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Future remediation costs for inactive mines are accrued based on management best estimate at the end of each period of the costs expected to be incurred. Such cost estimates include, where applicable, ongoing care, water treatment, maintenance and monitoring costs. Changes in estimates at inactive mines are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required. Any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to earnings for reclamation and remediation. Income and Mining Taxes We recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. Refer above under Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets for a discussion of the factors that could cause future cash flows to differ from estimates. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to realize deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate could limit our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets recorded at the reporting date. The Company operation involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. As of January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, ( FIN 48 ), an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, guidance to record these liabilities (refer to Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Company estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. 46 Table of Contents Consolidated Financial Results Sales - gold, net for 2007 increased $94 compared to 2006 due to a $103 per ounce increase in the average realized price after treatment and refining charges partially offset by 908,000 fewer ounces sold. Sales gold, net for 2006 increased $618 compared to 2005 due to a $157 per ounce increase in the average realized price after treatment and refining charges partially offset by 1,129,000 fewer ounces sold. The following analysis summarizes the change in consolidated gold sales revenue: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Consolidated gold sales: Gross $ 4,332 $ 4,241 $ 3,619 Less: Treatment and refining charges (27 ) (30 ) (26 ) Net $ 4,305 $ 4,211 $ 3,593 Consolidated gold ounces sold (thousands) Gross 6,184 7,186 8,237 Less: Incremental start-up sales (6 ) (100 ) (22 ) Net 6,178 7,086 8,215 Average realized gold price per ounce: Before treatment and refining charges $ 701 $ 599 $ 441 After treatment and refining charges $ 697 $ 594 $ 437 The change in consolidated gold sales is due to: 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Reduction in consolidated ounces sold $ (544 ) $ (506 ) Increase in average realized gold price 635 1,128 Decrease (increase) in treatment and refining charges 3 (4 ) $ 94 $ 618 Sales - copper, net increased in 2007 compared to 2006 due to higher realized prices as the final deliveries were made under the copper collar contracts in February 2007, partially offset by lower production. In 2006, copper sales were unchanged compared to 2005 as lower sales volumes were offset by higher realized prices. In addition, in 2006 a loss of $56 was included in Other income, net for the ineffective portion of copper hedges. For a complete discussion regarding variations in copper volumes, see Results of Consolidated Operations below. The following analysis reflects the changes in consolidated copper sales: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Consolidated copper sales: Gross before derivative contracts $ 1,409 $ 1,333 $ 953 Hedging losses (1 ) (633 ) (258 ) Provisional pricing mark-to-market (34 ) 165 138 Gross after derivative contracts 1,374 865 833 Less: Treatment and refining charges (153 ) (194 ) (161 ) Net $ 1,221 $ 671 $ 672 Consolidated copper pounds sold (millions) 428 435 573 Average realized price per pound: Gross before derivative contracts $ 3.30 $ 3.07 $ 1.66 Hedging losses (1.46 ) (0.45 ) Provisional pricing mark-to-market (0.09 ) 0.38 0.24 Gross after derivative contracts 3.21 1.99 1.45 Less: Treatment and refining charges (0.35 ) (0.45 ) (0.28 ) Net $ 2.86 $ 1.54 $ 1.17 47 Table of Contents The change in consolidated copper sales is due to: 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Decrease in consolidated pounds sold $ (15 ) $ (201 ) Increase in average realized copper price 524 233 Decrease (increase) in treatment and refining charges 41 (33 ) $ 550 $ (1 ) The following is a summary of consolidated gold and copper sales, net: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Gold Nevada, USA $ 1,616 $ 1,441 $ 1,053 Yanacocha, Peru 1,093 1,543 1,490 Australia/New Zealand: Tanami, Australia 305 250 221 Kalgoorlie, Australia 224 198 183 Jundee, Australia 214 190 154 Waihi, New Zealand 66 71 73 809 709 631 Batu Hijau, Indonesia 351 264 318 Ahafo, Ghana 306 124 Other Operations: Kori Kollo, Bolivia 60 77 44 La Herradura, Mexico 61 48 36 Golden Giant, Canada 8 35 73 129 160 153 Corporate 1 (30 ) (52 ) $ 4,305 $ 4,211 $ 3,593 Copper Batu Hijau, Indonesia $ 1,221 $ 671 $ 672 Costs applicable to sales - gold increased in 2007 compared to 2006 due to increased labor and diesel costs, the strengthening of the Australian dollar, a full year of operations at Ahafo in Ghana and Phoenix and Leeville in Nevada and higher waste removal costs at Batu Hijau. The increase in 2006 from 2005 resulted primarily from higher labor and input commodity prices and higher waste removal costs at Yanacocha and Batu Hijau, as well as increased operating costs from the start-up of Phoenix and Leeville in Nevada and Ahafo in Ghana. Costs applicable to sales - copper increased in 2007 from 2006 mainly due to higher waste removal costs at Batu Hijau. We have seen significant increases in the costs of labor, fuel, power and other consumables during these periods for both gold and copper. For a complete discussion regarding variations in operations, see Results of Consolidated Operations below. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased in 2007 from 2006 due to a full year of operations at Phoenix and Leeville in Nevada and Ahafo in Ghana. Depreciation, depletion and amortization remained at the same level in 2006 from 2005, as capital spending increases from the start-up of Phoenix and Leeville in Nevada and Ahafo in Ghana and capital expenditures at other operations were offset by lower production at Yanacocha and Batu Hijau. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense fluctuates as capital expenditures increase or decrease and as production levels increase or decrease due to the use of the units-of production amortization 48 Table of Contents method. For a complete discussion, see Results of Consolidated Operations , below. We expect Depreciation, depletion and amortization to increase to approximately $725 to $775 in 2008. The following is a summary of Costs applicable to sales and Depreciation, depletion and amortization by operation: Costs Applicable to Sales Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 Gold Nevada, USA $ 1,036 $ 980 $ 807 $ 220 $ 180 $ 124 Yanacocha, Peru 540 498 487 160 172 205 Australia/New Zealand: Tanami, Australia 187 155 162 37 30 33 Kalgoorlie, Australia 196 163 144 24 25 17 Jundee, Australia 143 113 115 26 26 27 Waihi, New Zealand 47 27 29 22 10 16 573 458 450 109 91 93 Batu Hijau, Indonesia 120 91 109 25 20 34 Ahafo, Ghana 177 60 43 19 Other Operations: Kori Kollo, Bolivia 30 27 16 10 9 4 La Herradura, Mexico 29 19 15 7 8 5 Golden Giant, Canada 2 13 48 1 11 61 59 79 17 18 20 2,507 2,146 1,932 574 500 476 Copper Batu Hijau, Indonesia 471 308 303 96 66 87 Other Exploration 1 3 4 Australia/New Zealand 3 3 3 Ahafo, Ghana 1 Other Operations 1 2 Corporate and Other 21 16 16 25 23 26 $ 2,978 $ 2,454 $ 2,235 $ 695 $ 589 $ 589 49 Table of Contents Deferred stripping. The net deferred stripping amounts included in Costs applicable to sales by operation were as follows for the year ended December 31, 2005: Gold Nevada, USA $ (47 ) Australia/New Zealand: Kalgoorlie, Australia (9 ) Waihi, New Zealand 2 (7 ) Other Operations: La Herradura, Mexico (3 ) $ (57 ) Copper Batu Hijau, Indonesia $ 1 See Accounting Developments, above. The Loss on settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts of $531 in 2007 resulted from the elimination of the entire 1.85 million ounces of forward sales contracts that would have impacted results in 2008 and beyond. Midas redevelopment of $11 in 2007 resulted from activities undertaken, during suspended operations, to regain entry into the mine in order to resume commercial production following the accident that occurred on June 19, 2007. Exploration period-to-period increases reflect increased exploration and related activity in response to higher gold prices and increased drilling, labor and consumable costs. Advanced projects, research and development costs represent spending on advanced projects, feasibility studies and drilling at Phoenix, Akyem, Ahafo and Conga. We expect Exploration to be approximately $220 to $230 and Advanced projects, research and development to be approximately $120 to $180 in 2008. General and administrative expense increased in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to increased professional fees and consulting costs. The increase in 2006 from 2005 was primarily due to $12 of stock option expense. General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was 2.6% in 2007, compared to 2.8% in both 2006 and 2005. We expect General and administrative expenses to be approximately $140 to $150 in 2008. Write-down of goodwill was $1,122, $nil and $41 for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The 2007 impairment was related to the Exploration segment. In 2007, annual testing for impairment pursuant to FAS No. 142 resulted in a goodwill impairment charge for the Exploration Segment of $1,122. The impairment resulted primarily from (i) a significantly lower assumed annual reserve growth rate (from 4% to 3%), (ii) a significant change in the financial markets resulting in an increase in the discount rate (from 8% to 10%), and (iii) an increase in finding costs due to a combination of increased spending and reduced exploration success. The 2005 impairment was related to the Nevada segment resulting from anticipated increased future operating and capital costs. Write-down of investments totaled $46 in 2007, primarily related to the impairment of investments in Shore Gold Inc. and Gabriel Resources Ltd. Write-down of long-lived and other assets totaled $4, $3 and $41 for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The 2007 write-down was primarily related to tenements in Australia. The 2006 write-down was primarily related to equipment. The 2005 write-down was primarily related to the Martabe exploration project in Indonesia and exploration tenements in Australia. 50 Table of Contents For a discussion of our policy for assessing the carrying value of goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment, see Critical Accounting Policies, above. Other expense, net includes the following: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Reclamation and remediation $ 29 $ 47 $ 38 Pension settlement loss 17 4 Buyat Bay settlement and other 12 22 56 Western Australia power plant 11 1 (3 ) World Gold Council dues 11 13 14 Peruvian royalty 10 22 Choropampa legal costs 9 5 4 Reclamation accretion 8 3 Australian office relocation 6 5 PTNNT divestiture 3 Yanacocha leach pad repairs 1 10 Peruvian workers participation reserve 15 Other 31 16 13 $ 148 $ 159 $ 126 The 2007 expense includes changes in environmental obligations estimates at former mines, pension settlement losses related to senior management retirements, World Gold Council dues and costs at the Western Australia power plant. The 2006 expense primarily includes changes in environmental obligation estimates at former mines, legal and other costs incurred in regards to pollution allegations at Minahasa and at Yanacocha, the Peruvian royalty, costs associated with leach pad repairs and Peruvian worker participation reserves. Beginning in 2006 Yanacocha recorded a charge to Other expense, net related to an agreement with the Peruvian government to provide for a negotiated royalty payment during high metal prices for community improvements. The negotiated royalty is based on 3.75% of Yanacocha net income beginning January 1, 2006 for a period of up to five years. The 2005 expense included legal and other costs incurred in regards to pollution allegations at Minahasa, changes in environmental obligation estimates at former mines, costs incurred to stabilize material and repair damage to roads and utility lines for a waste dump slide in Nevada and a pension settlement loss. Other income, net is summarized as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Interest income $ 50 $ 67 $ 59 Canadian Oil Sands Trust income 47 30 10 Foreign currency exchange gains 25 5 8 Gain on sale of property, plant and equipment 9 12 11 Gain (loss) on ineffective portion of derivative investments, net (Note 14) 4 (60 ) 2 Income from development projects, net 3 19 Loss (gain) on sale of other assets, net (1 ) 6 6 Loss on early extinguishment of debt (40 ) Other 7 14 10 $ 144 $ 53 $ 106 51 Table of Contents Interest income decreased in 2007 from 2006 due to lower investment yields. Interest income increased in 2006 from 2005 due to increased funds invested and higher investment yields. Income from developing projects includes gold and copper sales, net of incremental operating costs incurred, from operations prior to commercial production. Income in 2007 is from the Bob Star project in Nevada and income in 2006 is from the Leeville and Phoenix operations also in Nevada. Foreign currency exchange gains in 2007 resulted from the strengthening of the Canadian and Australian dollars compared to the U.S. dollar. The Canadian dollar exchange rate increased by approximately 19% from December 31, 2006 while the Australian dollar exchange rate increased by approximately 11%. On September 27, 2006, we settled our remaining obligations under the prepaid forward gold sales contract and forward gold purchase contract for which we were required to deliver 17,951 ounces of gold in December 2006 and 179,062 ounces of gold in June 2007. This settlement resulted in cash payments of $96, and included a $48 reduction to the current portion of long-term debt and a $40 pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt. The loss on ineffective portion of derivative instruments includes a loss of $56 in 2006 for the ineffective portion of the copper collar instruments designated as cash flow hedges. Other losses relate to the ineffective portion of legacy gold puts held in Australia. Interest expense, net of capitalized interest was $105, $97 and $97 for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Capitalized interest totaled $50, $57 and $39 in each year, respectively. Interest costs increased in 2007 due to the issuance of the $1,150 convertible senior notes in July 2007 and the $200 bond issuance at Yanacocha in July 2006. These increases were offset by capitalized interest due to construction of Leeville, Phoenix and the power plant in Nevada, the Ahafo project in Ghana and the Boddington project in Australia. Capitalized interest has decreased in 2007 from 2006 due to the completion of the Leeville, Phoenix and Ahafo projects. We expect Interest expense, net of capitalized interest to be approximately $110 to $115 in 2008. Income tax expense was $200 in 2007, compared to $326 and $270 in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The effective tax rates were (57%), 26%, and 29% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Without the $1,122 goodwill impairment charge in 2007 (which is not deductible for tax purposes and for which no related income tax benefit can be claimed), the effective tax rate for 2007 would have been 26%. The factors that most significantly impact our effective tax rate are percentage depletion and resource allowances, the rate differential related to foreign earnings indefinitely invested, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets, foreign earnings net of foreign tax credits, earnings attributable to minority interests in subsidiaries and affiliated companies, foreign currency translation gains and losses, impacts of the analysis of income taxes payable and U.S. book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, goodwill impairment and the impact of certain specific transactions. Most of these factors are sensitive to the average realized price of gold and other metals. Percentage depletion allowances (tax deductions for depletion that may exceed our tax basis in our mineral reserves) are available to us under the income tax laws of the United States for operations conducted in the United States or through branches and partnerships owned by U.S. subsidiaries included in our consolidated United States income tax return. The deductions are highly sensitive to the price of gold and other minerals produced by the Company. For 2006 and prior years, similar types of deductions were available for mining operations in Canada. The tax benefits from percentage depletion and resource allowances were $70, $77 and $43 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily is due to a decrease in production at certain non-US mine sites. We operate in various countries around the world that have tax laws, tax incentives and tax rates that are significantly different than those of the United States. Many of these differences combine to move our overall effective tax rate higher or lower than the United States statutory rate depending on the mix of income relative to income earned in the United States. The effect of these differences is shown in Note 8 to the Consolidated 52 Table of Contents Financial Statements as either a foreign rate differential or the effect of foreign earnings, net of credits. Differences in tax rates and other foreign income tax law variations make our ability to fully utilize all of our available foreign income tax credits on a year-by-year basis highly dependent on the price of the gold and copper produced by the Company and the costs of production, since lower prices or higher costs can result in our having insufficient sources of taxable income in the United States to utilize all available foreign tax credits. Such credits have limited carry back and carry forward periods and can only be used to reduce the United States income tax imposed on our foreign earnings included in our annual United States consolidated income tax return. The effects of foreign earnings, net of allowable credits, were an increase of income tax expense of $10, $7 and $13, in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The effect of different income tax rates in countries where earnings are indefinitely reinvested contributed to an increase in our income tax expense of $7 and $70 in 2007 and 2006, respectively, and decreased tax expense in 2005 by $6. The tax effect of changes in local country tax laws, as shown in our effective tax reconciliation in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, resulted in a net tax benefit of $2, $71 and $24 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The net tax benefit in 2007 is primarily related to a decrease in Canadian federal and provincial statutory tax rates and a decrease in New Zealand tax rates. The net tax benefit in 2006 is primarily related to adopting the U.S. dollar as our functional currency for Australian tax reporting purposes and a decrease in the Canadian federal and provincial statutory tax rates. The net tax benefit in 2005 is primarily related to a change in Australian tax law regarding our ability to file consolidated income tax returns. The need to record valuation allowances related to our deferred tax assets (primarily attributable to net operating losses and tax credits) is principally dependent on the following factors: (i) the extent to which the net operating losses and tax credits can be carried back and yield a tax benefit; (ii) our long-term estimate of future average realized minerals prices; and (iii) the degree to which many of the tax laws and income tax agreements imposed upon us and our subsidiaries around the world tend to create significant tax deductions early in the mining process. These up-front deductions can give rise to net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards in circumstances where future sources of taxable income may not coincide with available carry forward periods even after taking into account all available tax planning strategies. Furthermore, certain liabilities, accrued for financial reporting purposes, may not be deductible for tax purposes until such liabilities are actually funded which could happen after mining operations have ceased, when sufficient sources of taxable income may not be available. Changes to valuation allowances decreased income tax expense by $17 and $3 in 2007 and 2006, respectively, and increased income tax expense by $39 in 2005. The change in 2007 primarily is due to the realization of capital gains in Australia. We consolidate certain subsidiaries of which we do not own 100% of the outstanding equity. However, for tax purposes, we are only responsible for the income taxes on the portion of the taxable earnings attributable to our ownership interest of each consolidated entity. Such minority interests contributed $4, $15 and $15 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, as reductions in our income tax expense. Our tax expense was not affected in 2007 and decreased by $1 and $14 in 2006 and 2005 respectively due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In 2005, these amounts primarily relate to the Australian tax effect of realized and unrealized translation gains attributable to United States dollar-denominated assets and liabilities and the gold derivatives positions at Newmont Australia Limited whose functional currency is the United States dollar. Because we intend to indefinitely reinvest earnings from Newmont Australia Limited, no offsetting United States deferred income tax effect can be recorded. Had the $1,122 write-off of goodwill in 2007, which is non-deductible for tax purposes, been deductible, our tax expense would have decreased by $393. During 2006 we completed a reconciliation of our U.S. book and tax basis assets and liabilities as well as a detailed analysis of our income taxes payable. This exercise identified differences of $27, which was recognized as a tax benefit in 2006. 53 Table of Contents Based on the uncertainty and inherent unpredictability of the factors influencing our effective tax rate and the sensitivity of such factors to gold and other metals prices as discussed above, the effective tax rate is expected to be volatile in future periods. The effective tax rate is expected to be between 30% and 34% in 2008. Minority interest in income of subsidiaries was as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Batu Hijau $ 299 $ 103 $ 119 Yanacocha 108 256 256 Other 3 4 5 $ 410 $ 363 $ 380 Minority interest in income of subsidiaries increased in 2007 from 2006 as a result of increased earnings at Batu Hijau and a $25 charge in 2007 related to the repayment of the carried interest loan at Batu Hijau, partially offset by decreased earnings at Yanacocha (see Results of Consolidated Operations, Batu Hijau Operations and Yanacocha Operations). The 2006 decrease from 2005 resulted from lower production and earnings at Batu Hijau (see Results of Consolidated Operations, Batu Hijau Operations). Equity (loss) income of affiliates was as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 European Gold Refineries $ 6 $ 3 $ 6 AGR Matthey Joint Venture 1 1 (2 ) Regis Resources NL (8 ) (2 ) $ (1 ) $ 2 $ 4 (Loss) income from discontinued operations was as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Sales - gold, net $ 119 $ 157 $ 171 Sales - base metals, net 38 $ 119 $ 157 $ 209 Income (loss) from operations: Royalty portfolio $ 123 $ 67 $ 121 Pajingo 8 12 1 Zarafshan 6 18 Holloway (27 ) Golden Grove (5 ) 131 85 108 Gain on sale of operations: Zarafshan 77 Pajingo 8 Holloway 13 Golden Grove 6 85 13 6 Gain on sale of royalty assets 905 Gain on sale of Alberta oil sands project 266 Gain on sale of Martabe 30 Loss from impairment (1,665 ) (101 ) (42 ) Pre-tax (loss) income (544 ) 293 72 Income tax expense (379 ) (65 ) (28 ) (Loss) income from discontinued operations $ (923 ) $ 228 $ 44 54 Table of Contents During June 2007, Newmont Board of Directors approved a plan to cease Merchant Banking activities. The Company decided to dispose of its royalty portfolio and a portion of its existing equity investments and will not make further investments in equity securities that do not support its core gold mining business. Newmont and the new Franco-Nevada Corporation ( new Franco-Nevada ) entered into an agreement under which new Franco-Nevada acquired certain mineral interests and oil and gas interests for cash consideration of $1,187. The transaction closed in December 2007 resulting in a $905 pre-tax gain. In 2006, the Company received net cash proceeds of $271 for the Alberta oil sands project resulting in a $266 pre-tax gain. The Company received $42 net cash proceeds and approximately 43 million Agincourt shares valued at $37 for the Martabe project, resulting in a $30 pre-tax gain in 2006. During 2007, we recognized a $1,665 non-cash charge to impair goodwill associated with the Merchant Banking segment. In 2006, we recorded a pre-tax impairment loss of $101 as a result of the Uzbekistan government expropriation of the Zarafshan operation. In 2005, we recorded a $42 pre-tax write-down of long-lived assets at the Golden Grove copper-zinc operation in Australia. The Company income tax expense attributable to discontinued operations differed from the amounts computed by applying the United States statutory corporate income tax rate primarily due to the goodwill impairment that was nondeductible for tax, the benefit from percentage depletion and a decrease in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets. Other comprehensive income, net of tax in 2007 included a $113 gain in value of marketable securities, $33 related to a pension liability adjustment, and a gain of $138 on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies. Other comprehensive income, net of tax in 2006 included a $272 gain in value of marketable securities, $47 for unrealized gains on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and $17 related to a pension liability adjustment, offset by a loss of $14 on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies. Other comprehensive income, net of tax in 2005 included a $282 gain in value of marketable equity securities and a $26 gain on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, offset by losses of $18 related to a minimum pension liability adjustment and $59 for unrealized losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges.

(3) Consolidated gold ounces or copper pounds sold includes minority interests share. (4) Economic interest decreased to 45% from 52.875% on May 25, 2007. 55 Table of Contents Consolidated gold ounces sold decreased in 2007 from 2006 due to: lower production at Nevada due to lower ore grades; lower production at Yanacocha due to lower ore grade and tons placed on the leach pads; partially offset by a full year of operations at Ahafo (Ghana) and Leeville and Phoenix (Nevada); and higher ore grades processed at Batu Hijau. Consolidated gold ounces sold decreased in 2006 from 2005 due to: decreased sales at Yanacocha and Batu Hijau due to lower grade ores and lower throughput at Batu Hijau; the completion of operations at Lone Tree (Nevada) and Golden Giant (Other); partially offset by the start-up of operations at Ahafo (Ghana) and Leeville and Phoenix (Nevada). Consolidated copper pounds sold decreased in 2007 from 2006 due to an increase in concentrate inventory at year-end due to the timing of shipments. Consolidated copper pounds sold decreased in 2006 from 2005 due to the processing of lower grade ore (0.55% vs. 0.69%) and lower mill throughput due to mine plan changes and harder material. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated gold ounce sold increased in 2007 compared to 2006 due to increased labor and diesel costs, the strengthening of the Australian dollar which increased Costs applicable to sales by approximately $8 per ounce, a full year of operations at Ahafo in Ghana and Phoenix and Leeville in Nevada and higher waste removal costs at Batu Hijau. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated gold ounce sold increased in 2006 from 2005, primarily due to the decrease in production at Yanacocha and increased operating costs at all sites. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated copper pound increased from year-to-year due to increased operating costs. We expect 2008 consolidated gold sales of approximately 5.9 to 6.4 million ounces, primarily as a result of lower production from Australia and Batu Hijau. Costs applicable to sales per ounce for 2008 are expected to be approximately $425 to $450 per ounce as the impact of industry-wide cost pressures are expected to be compounded by slightly lower gold grades and production. We expect 2008 consolidated copper sales of approximately 345 to 365 million pounds at Costs applicable to sales of approximately $1.30 to $1.40 per pound as mining shifts from the high grade bottom of the pit into a lower grade mine sequence during 2008 and 2009. Nevada Operations Gold Ounces Sold (1) Costs Applicable to Sales (2) Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands) ($ per ounce) ($ per ounce) Year ended December 31, 2,341 2,534 2,444 $ 444 $ 403 $ 333 $ 94 $ 74 $ 51 (1) Includes incremental start-up ounces of 6, 100, and 22 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. (2) Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization and loss on settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts and Midas redevelopment. Gold ounces sold in Nevada decreased due to the milling of lower grade ore, completion of mining at Lone Tree and the temporary suspension of mining operations at Midas, partially offset by a full year of operations at Phoenix and Leeville. Open pit ore mined increased to 42.6 million tons in 2007, up from 38.4 million tons in 56 Table of Contents 2006 and underground ore production increased to 1.9 million tons in 2007 from 1.7 million tons in 2006 due to a full year of operations at Phoenix and Leeville. Ore milled increased to 25.5 million tons from 17.9 million tons in 2006, while mill ore grade decreased 23% with the processing of lower grade ore from Phoenix. Ore placed on leach pads decreased 37% in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily as a result of mine sequencing at Gold Quarry and Twin Creeks and the completion of mining at Lone Tree in 2006. Processing at the Lone Tree mill continued in 2007 with ore hauled from Twin Creeks. Nevada Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased in 2007 compared to 2006 as lower production, higher cost production from Phoenix, the suspension of lower cost mining operations at Midas and increased labor, diesel and commodity costs were partially offset by lower surface mining costs. Surface mining costs were lower due to completion of mining at Lone Tree in 2006 and work on capital projects at Carlin, partially offset by a full year of mining at Phoenix. Depreciation, depletion and amortization per ounce increased 27% from 2006 as a result of a full year of Phoenix and Leeville operation. Gold ounces sold increased in 2006 from 2005, due to the commencement of commercial operations at Phoenix and Leeville in the fourth quarter of 2006 and increased access to open pit ore at the Twin Creeks layback, partially offset by lower production from Lone Tree. The Phoenix and Leeville projects commenced commercial operations in October 2006. Leeville and Phoenix produced 243,700 ounces in 2006, including 100,300 incremental start-up ounces included in Other income, net . Gold production at Lone Tree declined as mining was completed in 2006. Overall, mill ore grade decreased 17% and mill throughput increased 16% as a result of the start-up of the lower grade Phoenix operation. Heap leach production was slightly higher than 2005 due to a 9% increase in average grade of ore placed on the leach pads. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to increased labor, diesel, power, cyanide and other commodity prices, higher underground contract service costs. Costs applicable to sales were also impacted by the change in accounting for open pit waste removal costs. In 2005, $47 of mining costs was deferred which reduced Costs applicable to sales by $20 per ounce. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased as a result of placing new equipment and facilities in operation. Our Midas operations in Nevada were suspended by order of the Mine Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) after a fatal accident in June 2007. On October 11, 2007, MSHA lifted the restrictive order that had required Midas to halt mining activities. As a result, mining activities have ramped-up, and we expect Midas to return to historic production levels by early 2008. MSHA investigation of the accident is continuing. The related Midas redevelopment costs were $11, and are not included in the cost per ounce amounts above. The focus at Phoenix during the fourth quarter of 2007 was continued progress on optimization projects. The scope of the in-fill drill program has been increased from 183 to 222 planned drill holes because actual drilling costs have remained lower than originally budgeted. Approximately 80% of the planned drill footage was complete as of December 31, 2007. Continued progress and favorable results were realized through the implementation of continuous improvement projects, with an emphasis on human resources, equipment productivity and cost reduction. Mill capacity utilization continued to improve with nearly 1 million tons processed in each month of the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to almost 900,000 tons each month in the third quarter of 2007. Additionally, the new crusher remains on schedule for start-up by mid-2008 and was approximately 42% complete at the end of the fourth quarter. Phoenix produced 181,400 ounces at Costs applicable to sales of $729 per ounce in 2007. The Company continues to expect a final optimization plan for Phoenix around mid-2008. Consolidated gold sales are expected to remain stable in 2008 at approximately 2.2 to 2.4 million ounces. Higher production from Phoenix, Leeville and Twin Creeks is expected to be offset by lower grade surface ore at Carlin. Higher mill throughput and mill recoveries are expected to be offset by lower than planned mill grades and leach recoveries in 2008. Costs applicable to sales are expected to decrease in 2008 to approximately $400 to $430 per ounce. Ongoing labor and energy cost pressures are expected to be offset by reduced electricity charges as a result of generating power for approximately half the year from our newly built coal-fired power plant, reduced contracted services and other expenses, as well as lower anticipated maintenance costs associated with a newer mining fleet. 57 Table of Contents Construction of a 200-megawatt coal-fired power plant is approximately 96% complete as of December 31, 2007. Capital costs for the power plant are expected to be between $620 and $640 and completion is targeted for mid-2008. Non-governmental organizations have brought a series of actions relating to the Nevada operations, as described in more detail in Note 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. While we believe that the legal actions are without merit, unfavorable outcomes could result in additional conditions being imposed on our operations, and such conditions could have a material adverse effect on Nevada results of operations or financial position. Yanacocha Operations Gold Ounces Sold (1) Costs Applicable to Sales (2) Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands) ($ per ounce) ($ per ounce) Year ended December 31, 1,565 2,572 3,327 $ 345 $ 193 $ 147 $ 103 $ 67 $ 62 (1) Consolidated gold ounces sold includes minority interests share (51.35% Newmont owned). (2) Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization and loss on settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts. Consolidated gold production and sale ounces at Yanacocha decreased, as expected, in 2007 compared to 2006 due to fewer ore tons and lower grade ore placed on the leach pads. Ore mined decreased to 98.6 million tons in 2007 from 115.8 million tons in 2006. Ore grade decreased by 27% in 2007 compared to 2006 due to mine sequencing. The proportion of waste mined increased from 0.9 to 1.1 waste tons per ton of ore in 2007 compared to 2006 as expected in the mine plan. Costs applicable to sales increased $152 per ounce in 2007 primarily due to lower production, which impacted unit costs by approximately $125 per ounce, as well as increased labor, diesel, mine maintenance and other costs, partially offset by lower royalties and workers participation costs. Gold ounces sold decreased in 2006 from 2005, primarily due to a decrease in ore tons mined and placed on the leach pads, as anticipated in the mine plan. The proportion of waste tons mined increased from 0.50 waste tons per ton of ore in 2005 to 0.9 waste tons per ton of ore in 2006. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to the decrease in production, increased consumption and prices of diesel, cyanide, lime and other commodities and higher worker participation bonuses and royalties due to increased gold prices, partially offset by increased silver by-product credits. Consolidated gold sales are expected to increase in 2008 to approximately 1.7 to 1.8 million ounces, primarily as a result of completion of the gold mill partially offset by lower leach pad production. Costs applicable to sales at Yanacocha are expected to increase in 2008 to approximately $370 to $390 per ounce, primarily due to a change in the mine sequencing resulting in increased stripping, higher labor costs and royalty payments. Construction of the gold mill at Yanacocha was approximately 97% complete at December 31, 2007. Progress on the gold mill continues as expected, with capital costs expected to be between $250 and $270 and commercial production anticipated in the first half of 2008. In 2007 and 2006, Yanacocha recorded $10 and $22 to Other expense, net , respectively, related to an agreement with the Peruvian government to provide for a royalty payment for community improvements during current high metal prices. The negotiated royalty is based on 3.75% of Yanacocha net income beginning January 1, 2006 for a period of up to five years. 58 Table of Contents On May 31, 2007, the Company signed a new Collective Agreement with the union for the next three years, expiring on February 28, 2010. Australia/New Zealand Operations Gold Ounces Sold Costs Applicable to Sales (1) Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands) ($ per ounce) ($ per ounce) Tanami 439 418 494 $ 425 $ 370 $ 328 $ 85 $ 72 $ 67 Kalgoorlie (50% owned) 323 332 410 605 490 352 74 76 42 Jundee 298 306 342 480 369 335 88 85 80 Waihi 93 120 163 502 223 177 226 83 97 Total/Weighted-Average 1,153 1,176 1,409 $ 496 $ 389 $ 319 $ 94 $ 78 $ 66 (1) Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization and loss on settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts. Australia/New Zealand gold ounces sold decreased slightly in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of lower production at Kalgoorlie, Jundee and Waihi, partially offset by increased inventory sales. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to the strengthening of the Australian and New Zealand dollar, which increased Costs applicable to sales by approximately $40 per ounce, increased royalties due to the higher gold price and increased diesel, electricity and labor costs. Australia/New Zealand operations gold ounces sold decreased in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to lower production resulting from fewer ore tons mined and lower mill throughput. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased in 2006 from 2005 primarily due to the decrease in ounces sold and increased commodity costs partially offset by depreciation of the Australian and New Zealand dollars compared to the U.S. dollar. The favorable foreign exchange movements decreased Australia/New Zealand Costs applicable to sales in 2006 from 2005 by $5 per ounce. Costs applicable to sales were also impacted by the change in accounting for open pit waste removal costs. In 2005, $7 of mining costs was deferred which reduced Costs applicable to sales by $5 per ounce. Consolidated gold sales are expected to decline in 2008 to approximately 1.05 to 1.10 million ounces, primarily as a result of lower ore grades, mainly at Tanami, and reduced inventory sales, partially offset by higher mill throughput at Waihi. Costs applicable to sales are expected to increase to approximately $585 to $625 per ounce in 2008, primarily as a result of lower planned production, anticipated strengthening of the Australian dollar and higher anticipated consumables and labor costs. Tanami, Australia . Gold ounces sold increased in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of increased inventory sales. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to the strengthening of the Australian dollar, which increased Costs applicable to sales by approximately $29 per ounce, increased underground mining and milling costs due to being in a deeper part of the mine which results in increased backfill activity and fuel and labor costs, partially offset by decreased royalties. Gold ounces sold decreased in 2006 from 2005, primarily due to a 23% decline in mill throughput resulting from the completion of processing Groundrush stockpiles, partially offset by higher ore grade from the Granites. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to lower gold production and increased royalties due to the higher gold price. Kalgoorlie, Australia . Gold ounces sold decreased in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of a 13% decrease in ore grade milled, partially offset by an increase in inventory sales. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to the strengthening of the Australian dollar, which increased Costs applicable to sales by 59 Table of Contents approximately $51 per ounce, decreased production and higher mining costs. Mining costs were higher primarily due to sound abatement costs and increased contract maintenance, drilling rates, fuel and tire usage costs. Gold ounces sold decreased in 2006 from 2005, due to lower mill throughput (harder ore), a decrease in mill ore grade and a decrease in roaster throughput resulting from a higher sulfur to gold ratio and adverse weather conditions. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to lower production and increased labor, diesel and contract services. Milling costs also increased due to mill maintenance costs and higher grinding costs due to the harder ore. Costs applicable to sales were also impacted by the change in accounting for open pit waste removal costs. In 2005, $9 of mining costs was deferred which reduced Costs applicable to sales by $23 per ounce. Jundee, Australia . Gold ounces sold decreased in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of lower production, partially offset by increased inventory sales. Mill throughput decreased by 26% due to the consolidation of milling operations into one plant, partially offset by 28% higher mill ore grade. Open pit mining concluded in the fourth quarter of 2007. Underground mining operations will continue in 2008. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to the strengthening of the Australian dollar, which increased Costs applicable to sales by approximately $42 per ounce, lower production, and higher underground mining and electricity generation costs. Gold ounces sold decreased in 2006 from 2005, due to a 4% decrease in tons milled and a 6% decrease in mill ore grade. The decrease in tons milled was attributable to severe weather conditions, flooding and an extended mill shutdown in the first half of the year. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to lower gold production and higher maintenance costs, partially offset by reduced mining activity. Waihi, New Zealand . Gold ounces sold decreased in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of the transition to mining the Martha open pit south layback and Favona underground in 2007. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of the strengthening of the New Zealand dollar which increased Costs applicable to sales by approximately $51 per ounce and lower production. Gold ounces sold decreased in 2006 from 2005, primarily due to a 4% decrease in mill ore grade and a 20% decrease in mill throughput due to reduced open pit mining activity and the commencement of Favona ore treatment which requires finer grinding. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to the decrease in gold production. Development of the Boddington project was approximately 62% complete at December 31, 2007, with mill start-up still expected in late 2008 or early 2009. The Company completed a definitive estimate to update the Company share of Boddington capital costs, which are now expected to be between $1,400 and $1,600, up from $900 to $1,100, including the adverse impact of the strengthening Australian dollar exchange rate. In 2007, the Company commenced a hedging program to reduce the variability of the Australian denominated capital expenditures related to Boddington. As of December 31, 2007, we have hedged 32% of our forecasted Australian denominated capital expenditures in 2008. Batu Hijau Operations Gold Ounces or Copper Pounds Sold Costs Applicable to Sales (1) Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 Gold (ounces in thousands) ($ per ounce) ($ per ounce) Batu Hijau (2)(3) 494 435 720 $ 243 $ 209 $ 152 $ 50 $ 46 $ 47 Copper (pounds in millions) ($ per pound) ($ per pound) Batu Hijau (2)(3) 428 435 573 $ 1.10 $ 0.71 $ 0.53 $ 0.22 $ 0.15 $ 0.15 (1) Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization, loss on settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts. (2) Consolidated gold ounces or copper pounds sold includes minority interests share. (3) Economic interest decreased to 45% from 52.875% on May 25, 2007. 60 Table of Contents Consolidated copper sales decreased slightly in 2007 from 2006, due to increased year-end concentrate inventories, partially offset by 7% higher production. Consolidated gold sales increased in 2007 from 2006 due to 22% higher production, partially offset by increased year-end concentrate inventories. Increased mill throughput from an improved grinding circuit control system was offset by extended mill downtime in the fourth quarter of 2007 to repair a damaged mill motor. Copper production increased due to a 9% increase in ore grade, partially offset by slightly lower recoveries. Gold production increased due to a 17% increase in ore grade and a 3% increase in recovery. Concentrate inventories increased due to the timing of shipments. Costs applicable to sales per pound of copper and per ounce of gold increased in 2007, compared to 2006 due to the significant processing of ore from stockpiles and higher proportion of waste tons mined. The ratio of waste tons to ore tons increased from 1.3 in 2006 to 7.3 in 2007. In 2007, most of the mining occurred with Phase 5 waste stripping to prepare this phase for future production, while 2006 mining occurred substantially in Phase 4 ore. Costs applicable to sales also increased due to higher labor and maintenance costs and regional taxes. The average realized net copper price increased to $2.86 per pound in 2007 from $1.54 per pound in 2006, as the final copper hedge contract deliveries were made in February 2007. Batu Hijau revised its mine plan in 2006 to address geotechnical instability of the operation east pit wall and harder than modeled ore. Production was impacted by lower grades due to the mining sequence, as well as lower mill throughput due to processing harder ore. Copper and gold sales decreased in 2006 from 2005 as a result of 20% lower copper and 34% lower gold ore grades, and 6% lower mill throughput. Total tons mined were 30% higher in 2006 from 2005 primarily due to the addition of new mining equipment, shorter hauling distance and increased shovel productivity. Costs applicable to sales per pound of copper and per ounce of gold increased due to lower production, the expansion of the mining fleet and increased diesel, tire, labor and process maintenance costs, partially offset by an increased allocation of costs to stockpile inventories. Short-term stockpiles were built in 2006 for processing in 2007. Consolidated sales are expected to decrease in 2008 to approximately 325,000 to 365,000 ounces of gold and approximately 345 to 365 million pounds of copper as a result of mine plan sequencing that will lead to additional Phase 5 waste stripping compared to 2007. Consolidated gold and copper sales are expected to be impacted by lower grades and throughput and lower copper recoveries. Costs applicable to sales are expected to increase in 2008 to approximately $285 to $325 per ounce of gold and approximately $1.30 to $1.40 per pound of copper. Increasing operating costs are expected to result primarily from higher waste removal costs, as well as rising fuel, energy and consumables prices. We have a 45% ownership interest in the Batu Hijau mine, held through a partnership ( NTP ) with an affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation of Japan. We have a 56.25% interest in NTP and the Sumitomo affiliate holds the remaining 43.75%. NTP in turn owns 80% of P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara ( PTNNT ), the Indonesian subsidiary that owns Batu Hijau. We identified NTP as a Variable Interest Entity as a result of certain capital structures and contracted relationships and have fully consolidated Batu Hijau in the consolidated financial statements since January 1, 2004. The remaining 20% interest in PTNNT is owned by P.T. Pukuafa Indah ( PTPI ), an unrelated Indonesian company. Because PTPI interest was a carried interest, and because PTPI had been advanced a loan by NTP, we reported a 52.875% economic interest in Batu Hijau, which reflected our actual economic interest in the mine until such time as the loan was fully repaid (including accrued interest). On May 25, 2007, PTPI fully repaid the loan (including accrued interest) from NTP. As a result of the repayment, our economic interest in Batu Hijau was reduced from 52.875% to 45% and a net charge of $25 (after-tax) was recorded against Minority interest expense in the second quarter of 2007. Under the Contract of Work, beginning in 2005 and continuing through 2010, a portion of PTNNT shares must be offered for sale, first, to the Indonesian government or, second, to Indonesian nationals, equal to the difference between the following percentages and the percentage of shares already owned by the Indonesian government or Indonesian nationals (if such number is positive): 23% by March 31, 2006; 30% by March 31, 2007; 37% by March 31, 2008, 44% by March 31, 2009; and 51% by March 31, 2010. The price at which such 61 Table of Contents interest must be offered for sale to the Indonesian parties is the highest of the then-current replacement cost, the price at which shares would be accepted for listing on the Jakarta Stock Exchange, or the fair market value of such interest as a going concern, as agreed with the Indonesian government. Pursuant to this provision, it is possible that the ownership interest of the Newmont/Sumitomo partnership in PTNNT, owner of Batu Hijau, could be reduced to 49%. PTPI has owned and continues to own a 20% interest in PTNNT, and therefore the Newmont/Sumitomo partnership was required to offer a 3% interest for sale in 2006 and an additional 7% interest in 2007. A further 7% interest will be offered for sale in March 2008. In accordance with the Contract of Work, an offer to sell a 3% interest was made to the government of Indonesia in 2006 and an offer for an additional 7% interest was made in 2007. While the central government declined to participate in the offer, local governments in the area in which the Batu Hijau mine is located have expressed interest in acquiring shares, as have various Indonesian nationals. In January 2008, the Newmont/Sumitomo partnership agreed to sell, under a carried interest arrangement, 2% of PTNNT shares to Kabupaten Sumbawa, one of the local governments, subject to satisfaction of closing conditions. On February 11, 2008, PTNNT received notification from the Department of Energy and Mineral Resources (DEMR) alleging that PTNNT is in breach of its divestiture requirements under the Contract of Work and threatening to issue a notice to terminate the Contract of Work if PTNNT does not agree to divest the 2006 and 2007 shares, in accordance with the direction of the DEMR, by February 22, 2008. Newmont and Sumitomo believe there is no basis under the Contract of Work for this notification and no grounds for terminating the Contract of Work, and are currently evaluating possible responses to the February 11, 2008 default notice, including filing for international arbitration as provided for under the Contract of Work. Newmont and Sumitomo are in discussions with officials of the Government of Indonesia to attempt to clarify or resolve this issue. The Company has been in discussions to renew its forest use permit (called a pinjam pakai) for over two years. This permit is a key requirement to continue to efficiently operate the Batu Hijau mine. The permit renewal has not been received and in the event it is not received by May 2008, it could have an adverse impact on operating and financial results. Representatives of the Indonesian government, including the Ministry of Forestry, have assured us that the permit will be issued in due course. For more information on the results of the Batu Hijau operations, see Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Ahafo Operations Gold Ounces Sold Costs Applicable to Sales (1) Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands) ($ per ounce) ($ per ounce) Year ended December 31, 446 202 $ 396 $ 297 $ $ 96 $ 94 $ ( 1 ) Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization and loss on settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts. Gold ounces sold at Ahafo increased in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of a full year of production in 2007. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to higher mining and milling costs. Mining costs increased primarily due to higher waste stripping in the Apensu pit, higher fuel, pit dewatering and maintenance costs. Milling costs increased due to higher electricity and maintenance costs. Costs applicable to sales in 2006 also benefited from the capitalization of pre-production costs. During 2007, better than expected ore grades and mill recovery rates were realized, which resulted in higher than expected production at Ahafo. Mill ore grades were higher than expected due to ore control improvement programs implemented during the year. Increased mill recoveries were a result of higher than expected yields from the transitional ore mined at the Apensu deposit. 62 Table of Contents Consolidated gold sales are expected to increase to approximately 495,000 to 530,000 ounces in 2008 mainly due to the processing of higher grade material. Costs applicable to sales of approximately $485 to $520 per ounce is expected for 2008. The expected increase is mainly due to higher fuel, power, contract services and consumable costs. During 2007, Newmont and other gold companies with production in Ghana, formed a consortium to import power generation equipment and constructed an 80 mega-watt power plant. The plant was completed during the fourth quarter of 2007 and is being commissioned. As a result of the mining industry initiative to install the power plant, the Ghanaian government has agreed, if required to curtail power consumption as a result of power shortages, to distribute power proportionately between participating mines and other industrial and commercial customers.

(2) Consolidated gold ounces sold includes minority interests share. Gold ounces sold at Other Operations decreased in 2007 from 2006, primarily due to the completion of operations at Golden Giant and lower production from Kori Kollo. Gold production from Kori Kollo decreased due to the timing of flows from the leach pads. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased in 2007 from 2006, primarily due to lower production and higher waste removal costs at La Herradura and the completion of operations at Golden Giant. Gold ounces sold at Other Operations decreased in 2006 from 2005, primarily due to the wind-up of operations at Golden Giant. Mining operations at Golden Giant were completed in December 2005 with remnant mining and milling production continuing into 2006. Costs applicable to sales decreased primarily due to the processing of lower cost remnant production from Golden Giant offset by higher waste removal costs at Kori Kollo and La Herradura. In 2005, $3 mining costs were deferred, reducing Costs applicable to sales by $31 per ounce at La Herradura. Consolidated gold sales for Other Operations in 2008 are expected to be approximately 200,000 to 220,000 ounces at Costs applicable to sales of approximately $340 to $360 per ounce. Exploration Exploration expense was $177, $166 and $143 for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Exploration expense in 2007 reflects higher funding of exploration and related activities in response to higher gold prices and increased drilling, labor and consumable costs. We anticipate spending between $220 and $230 on exploration activities in 2008, with the increases primarily related to inflation in drilling costs and exploration at our newly acquired Hope Bay property. During 2007, we added 0.8 million equity gold ounces to proven and probable reserves, with 8.2 million equity gold ounces of depletion and divestitures. Reserve additions from exploration of 3.5 million equity ounces were primarily due to further extension drilling at Boddington, Jundee and Tanami in Australia (2.6 million equity ounces), with the remaining additions from several open pit and underground sites in Nevada as well as La 63 Table of Contents Herradura in Mexico. Gold reserves were revised down by 3.4 million equity ounces, primarily due to increasing operating and capital costs at Ahafo in Ghana (2.4 million equity ounces), and geotechnical and metallurgical changes, as well as higher operating costs at Nevada (0.8 million equity ounces). The impact of the change in gold price assumption on reserve additions was 0.7 million equity ounces. Exploration activities during 2006 succeeded in converting significant new reserves at Carlin open pits (2.3 million equity gold ounces), Boddington (1.4 million equity gold ounces), Twin Creeks (1.1 million equity gold ounces), Ahafo (0.7 million equity gold ounces), La Herradura (0.7 million equity gold ounces), and Kalgoorlie (0.6 million equity gold ounces). Exploration activities during 2005 primarily focused on the conversion of significant new reserves at the Carlin open pits (1.9 million equity gold ounces), the Conga district in Peru (1.6 million equity gold ounces), and the two Ghana projects (Ahafo 1.6 million equity gold ounces, Akyem 1.1 million equity gold ounces). Newmont added a total of 9.4 million equity gold ounces to proven and probable reserves in 2005. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates In addition to its domestic operations in the United States, we have operations in Australia, New Zealand, Peru, Indonesia, Ghana, Canada, Bolivia and other foreign locations. Our operations sell their production based on U.S. dollar metal prices. Fluctuations in local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar can increase or decrease profit margins and Costs applicable to sales to the extent costs are paid in local currency at foreign operations. Such fluctuations have not had a material impact on our revenue since gold and copper are sold throughout the world principally in U.S. dollars. Approximately 28%, 33% and 37% of our Costs applicable to sales were paid in local currencies in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our Costs applicable to sales are most significantly impacted by variations in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate. However, variations in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate historically have been strongly correlated to variations in the U.S. dollar gold price over the long-term. Increases or decreases in costs at Australian locations due to exchange rate changes have therefore tended to be mitigated by changes in sales reported in U.S. dollars at Australian locations. No assurance, however, can be given that the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate will continue to be strongly correlated to the U.S. dollar gold price in the future. Variations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar at our foreign mining operations increased Costs applicable to sales $51 in 2007 from 2006, primarily in Australia, and decreased Costs applicable to sales $1 in 2006 from 2005 primarily at Indonesia, partially offset by Australia. In 2007, we implemented derivative programs to hedge up to 75% of our future forecasted Australian dollar denominated operating and capital expenditures to reduce the variability in our Australian dollar denominated expenditures. As of December 31, 2007, we have hedged 23%, 18% and 11% of our forecasted Australian denominated operating costs in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. We have also hedged 32% of our forecasted Australian denominated capital expenditures in 2008. Foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar have not had a material impact on our determination of proven and probable reserves in the past. However, if a sustained weakening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Australian dollar, and/or to other foreign currencies that impact our cost structure, were not mitigated by offsetting increases in the U.S. dollar gold price or by other factors, the amount of proven and probable reserves in the applicable foreign country could be reduced as certain proven and probable reserves may no longer be economic. The extent of any such reduction would be dependent on a variety of factors including the length of time of any such weakening of the U.S. dollar, and management long-term view of the applicable exchange rate. Future reductions of proven and probable reserves would primarily result in reduced gold or copper sales and increased depreciation, depletion and amortization and, depending on the level of reduction, could also result in impairments of property, plant and mine development, mineral interests and/or goodwill. 64 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Developments In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 141(R), Business Combinations , which amends SFAS No. 141, and provides revised guidance for recognizing and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. It also provides disclosure requirements to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009 and is to be applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this statement on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements- an amendment of ARB No. 51 which establishes accounting and reporting standards pertaining to ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent ownership interest, and the valuation of any retained noncontrolling equity investment when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS No. 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS No. 160 is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this statement on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2007, the FASB published Proposed FSP No. APB 14-a, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion. The proposed FSP applies to convertible debt instruments that, by their stated terms, may be settled in cash (or other assets) upon conversion, including partial cash settlement, unless the embedded conversion option is required to be separately accounted for as a derivative under SFAS 133. Convertible debt instruments within the scope of the proposed FSP are not addressed by the existing APB 14. The proposed FSP would require that the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments within the scope of the proposed FSP shall be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects the entity nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. This will require an allocation of the convertible debt proceeds between the liability component and the embedded conversion option (i.e., the equity component). The difference between the principal amount of the debt and the amount of the proceeds allocated to the liability component would be reported as a debt discount and subsequently amortized to earnings over the instrument expected life using the effective interest method. If the proposed FSP were to be adopted, we estimate that approximately $300 of debt discount would be recorded and the effective interest rate on our 2014 and 2017 convertible senior notes (see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) would increase by approximately 5 percentage points to 6.25% and 6.625%, respectively, for the non-cash amortization of the debt discount. In June 2007, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 06-11, Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment Awards. EITF Issue No. 06-11 requires that the tax benefit related to dividend and dividend equivalents paid on equity-classifed nonvested shares and nonvested share units, which are expected to vest, be recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital. EITF Issue No. 06-11 is to be applied prospectively for tax benefits on dividends declared in our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this statement will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( FAS 159 ). FAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value, with the objective of improving financial reporting by mitigating volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. The provisions of FAS 159 are effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2008. We do not expect the adoption of FAS 159 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 65 Table of Contents In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ( FAS 157 ). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of FAS 157 are effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2008. We do not expect the adoption of FAS 157 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Net cash provided from continuing operations was $525, $1,129 and $1,169 for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and was significantly impacted by the following key factors: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Consolidated gold ounces sold (in thousands) (1) 6,184 7,186 8,237 Average price received per ounce of gold (2) $ 697 $ 594 $ 437 Costs applicable to sales per ounce of gold sold (3) $ 406 $ 303 $ 235 Consolidated copper pounds sold (in millions) 428 435 573 Average price received per pound of copper (2) $ 2.86 $ 1.54 $ 1.17 Costs applicable to sales per pound of copper sold (3) $ 1.10 $ 0.71 $ 0.53 (1) Includes incremental start-up ounces of 6, 100 and 22 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. (2) After treatment and refining charges and excluding settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts. (3) Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization, loss on settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts and Midas redevelopment. Net cash provided from continuing operations decreased 53% compared to 2006. Cash flow provided from operations during 2007 was negatively impacted by the $578 settlement of the price-capped forward sales contracts, $276 settlement of pre-acquisition Australia income taxes of Normandy, $174 related to the final settlement of copper collar contracts, fewer gold ounces and copper pounds sold and higher operating costs, partially offset by higher realized gold and copper prices, as discussed above in Consolidated Financial Results . We are currently planning to contribute $48 to our retirement benefit programs in 2008 which will negatively impact Net cash provided by operating activities . For additional discussion see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations was $2,467, $1,142 and $1,310 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Additions to property, plant and mine development were $1,670, $1,537 and $1,204 for continuing operations in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 66 Table of Contents Additions to property, plant and mine development were: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Nevada, USA $ 588 $ 705 $ 479 Yanacocha, Peru 253 269 225 Australia/New Zealand: Jundee, Australia 41 23 25 Tanami, Australia 41 31 19 Kalgoorlie, Australia 5 14 12 Waihi, New Zealand 39 28 11 Boddington, Australia 466 93 5 Other, Australia 5 3 14 597 192 86 Batu Hijau, Indonesia 74 106 65 Ghana, West Africa: Ahafo, Ghana 114 177 258 Akyem, Ghana 20 57 18 134 234 276 Other Operations: Kori Kollo, Bolivia 3 1 22 La Herradura, Mexico 10 10 2 13 11 24 Corporate and Other 11 20 49 $ 1,670 $ 1,537 $ 1,204 Capital expenditures in Nevada during 2007 included $280 for the power plant and $160 for mine equipment replacement.

Capital expenditures in Australia/New Zealand included $466 for construction of the Boddington project, $63 for underground mine development and $27 for tailings dams construction. Batu Hijau capital expenditures included $38 for mine equipment purchases and $17 for mine dewatering. Capital expenditures at Ahafo included $14 for power generation facilities, $21 for a cyanide recovery circuit, $28 for mine equipment purchases and $12 for infrastructure and land. Capital expenditures in Nevada during 2006 included $239 for the power plant, $160 for surface mining equipment, $104 for the development of the Leeville underground mine, $87 for the development of the Phoenix project, and $54 for tailings dams and leach pads. Yanacocha capital expenditures included $113 for development and leach pad expansions, $44 for the gold mill project, $43 for mine maintenance and services, and $11 for the Conga project. Australian capital expenditures included $93 for Boddington development and $71 for mine development. Expenditures at Batu Hijau included $67 for the purchase of additional mining equipment and $20 for process improvements and replacement of the tailings line. Capital expenditures at Ahafo included $117 for project completion and $24 for mining equipment. Akyem expenditures were primarily for the engineering and procurement expenditures for process facilities and other pre-construction activities. Corporate expenditures primarily included information technology systems. Capital expenditures in Nevada during 2005 included $73 for the development of the Leeville underground mine, $43 for the power plant and $226 for the development of the Phoenix project. Yanacocha capital expenditures included $73 for development and leach pad expansions at La Quinua and process facilities, $12 for environmental projects, $30 for mining equipment and $17 for the Conga project. Kori Kollo expenditures reflect investment in new leach pads. Australian capital expenditures included $54 for mine development and $22 for 67 Table of Contents facilities. Expenditures at Batu Hijau included $36 for the purchase of additional mining equipment and $6 for tailings line replacement. Capital expenditures at Ahafo were primarily for the engineering, procurement and construction of the mine and process facilities. Corporate expenditures primarily included information technology systems and land. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, $19, $21 and $25 of drilling and related costs were capitalized and included in mine development costs, respectively. These capitalized costs included $11 at Australia, $4 at Nevada, $2 at La Herradura, and $1 at Ahafo and Yanacocha for 2007; $10 at Australia, $7 at Nevada, $3 at Ghana, and $1 at Yanacocha and Batu in 2006; and $11 at Nevada, $5 at Australia, $4 at Yanacocha and Ghana, and $1 at Batu in 2005. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, $16, $48 and $4 of pre-stripping costs were capitalized and included in mine development costs, respectively. Pre-stripping costs included the Bob Star mine in Nevada in 2007; the Phoenix mine in Nevada, the Chaquicocha mine at Yanacocha, and the Subika and Apensu mines at Ahafo in 2006; and the Phoenix mine and Chaquicocha mine in 2005. We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $1,800 to $2,000 in 2008, with approximately 50% in Australia/New Zealand, 25% in Nevada and the remaining 25% invested at other locations. Approximately $900 to $1,000 of the 2008 capital budget is allocated to sustaining investments, with the remaining $900 to $1,000 allocated to project development initiatives, including completion of the Boddington project in Australia, the power plant in Nevada and the Yanacocha gold mill in Peru; Investments in marketable debt and equity securities, net. We had net proceeds of $2 and $774 in 2007 and 2006, respectively, and net investments of $1 in 2005, from auction rate marketable debt securities. We generally account for these investments as short-term available-for-sale marketable debt securities. The auction rate marketable debt securities in which the Company has invested has not traded in an active market since mid-August 2007 and there are currently no market quotations available. The underlying assets for these investments continue to be rated AAA by Standard and Poor s. As of December 31, 2007, the Company reclassified approximately $7 of such securities (with accumulated unrealized losses of approximately $2 based on indicative bids) to long-term marketable debt securities as a result of current auction market conditions and the Company expectation of holding such investments for a period longer than one year. In connection with our acquisition of Miramar Mining Corporation, the Company acquired Canadian third party asset-backed commercial paper ( ABCP ) with an estimated value of $31 as of December 31, 2007. The ABCP the Company acquired, which has been classified as long-term marketable debt securities, has not traded in an active market since mid-August 2007 and there are currently no market quotations available. The ABCP continues to be rated R1 (High, Under Review with Developing Implications) by Dominion Bond Rating Service. The valuation technique used by the Company to estimate the fair value of its investment in ABCP incorporated probability weighted discounted cash flows considering the best available public information regarding market conditions and resulted in a discount of approximately 20% from the instruments face value. During 2007, the Company purchased marketable equity securities of Gabriel Resources for $27 and other marketable equity securities for $9. During 2006, the Company purchased marketable equity securities of Gabriel Resources for $17 and Queenstake Resources for $10. Newmont also reinvested dividends from Canadian Oil Sands Trust for $26. During 2005, the Company purchased marketable equity securities of Shore Gold, Gabriel Resources, Miramar and Miramar warrants for approximately $87, $31, $27 and $10, respectively. Acquisitions. As of December 2007, we had acquired approximately 155 million common shares of Miramar Mining Corporation ( Miramar ) for total consideration of $991 less cash received from the acquisition of $38 for a net payment of $953. These shares combined with Newmont 18.5 million common shares previously owned represents approximately 78% of the outstanding shares of Miramar. Miramar owns the Hope Bay Project, a large undeveloped gold project in Nunavut, Canada. In January 2008, we acquired approximately 40 million additional common shares of Miramar, bringing our interest in Miramar to 96%. In September 2006, we acquired a 40% interest in Shore Gold Inc. Fort a la Corne diamond Joint Venture in Saskatchewan, Canada for $152. 68 Table of Contents In March 2006, we acquired Newcrest Mining Limited 22.22% interest in the Boddington project, bringing our interest in the project to 66.67%, for total consideration of $173. Development of the Boddington project in Western Australia with AngloGold Ashanti Limited was also announced in the first quarter 2006. Construction of the Boddington project is expected to cost Newmont approximately $1,400 to $1,600, with initial production expected in late 2008 or early 2009. The project has a current estimated mine life of more than 20 years, with our share of annual production expected to be approximately 685,000 ounces for the first five years and average approximately 500,000 ounces over the remaining life of the project. In January 2006, we acquired the remaining 15% interest in the Akyem project in Ghana, bringing our interest to 100%. In September 2006, we deferred further development of the Akyem project pending completion of permitting, resolution of country-wide power shortages and further engineering optimization. In 2007, we continued development studies on Akyem, and a development decision is expected in 2008. Financing Activities Net cash provided from (used in) financing activities of continuing operations was $465 in 2007, compared to $(333) and $39 in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Proceeds from debt, net. During July 2007, we completed a private offering of $1,150 convertible senior notes due 2014 and 2017, each in the amount of $575. The 2014 notes, maturing on July 15, 2014, pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 1.25% per annum, and the 2017 notes, maturing on July 15, 2017, pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 1.625% per annum. The notes will be convertible, at the holder option, equivalent to a conversion price of $46.21 per share of common stock. Upon conversion, the principle amount and all accrued interest will be repaid in cash and any conversion premium will be settled in shares of our common stock or, at our election, cash or any combination of cash and shares of our common stock. We do not have an option to redeem the notes prior to their applicable stated maturity date. The net proceeds from the offering, after expenses, were approximately $1,126. In connection with the convertible senior notes offering, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions ( Call Spread Transactions ). These transactions included the purchase of call options and the sale of warrants. The purchased call options cover, in the aggregate and subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, 24,887,956 shares of the Company common stock, par value $1.60 per share. We sold warrants to purchase, in the aggregate and subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, 24,887,956 shares of common stock at a price of $60.27 per share. In most cases, the warrants may not be exercised prior to the maturity of the notes. As a result of the call option and warrant transactions, the conversion price of $46.21 was effectively increased to $60.27. The aggregate cost to the Company of the purchased call options was $366, partially offset by $248 that we received from the sale of the warrants. During 2007, we borrowed and repaid $1,877 on our revolving credit facility and borrowed $7 at Kori Kollo. In July 2006, Yanacocha issued $100 of bonds in the Peruvian capital markets under a $200 bond program approved by the Peruvian securities regulatory authority. The bonds are comprised of $42 of floating interest rate bonds bearing interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.4375%; and $58 of fixed rate bonds bearing interest at 7.0%. The bonds have a four year grace repayment period and amortize quarterly over six years. The bonds are uncollateralized and are non-recourse to Newmont. Funds generated from the bond issuance were used by Yanacocha primarily for capital expenditures. In May 2006, Yanacocha entered into an uncollateralized $100 bank financing with a syndicate of Peruvian commercial banks. Quarterly repayments began May 2007 with final maturity May 2014. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.875%. The loan is non-recourse to Newmont. Proceeds received during 2005 were primarily from the issuance of 30-year 5 7/8% notes for net proceeds of $582 during March 2005. The proceeds were used to fund capital investments, including a 200 megawatt power plant in Nevada, and for general corporate purposes. 69 Table of Contents Repayment of debt . During 2007, we made debt repayments of $2,036 (including $1,877 on the revolving credit facility, $21 related to the sale-leaseback of the refractory ore treatment plant, classified as a capital lease, $11 on the Yanacocha credit facility, $4 on Australia capital leases, and $123 related to Batu Hijau). Scheduled minimum debt repayments are $255 in 2008, $138 in 2009, $143 in 2010, $322 in 2011, $135 in 2012 and $1,945 thereafter. We expect to be able to fund maturities of our debt from Net cash provided by operating activities and existing cash balances . Dividends paid to minority interests. We also paid dividends of $270, $264 and $186 to minority interests during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Dividends paid to common stockholders. We paid annual dividends of $0.40 per common share during 2007, 2006 and 2005. Additionally, Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, paid annual dividends of CDN$0.43, CDN$0.46 and CDN$0.49 during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. On February 20, 2008, we declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share, payable March 28, 2008 to holders of record at the close of business on March 7, 2008. The total paid to common stockholders was $181, $180 and $179 for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Proceeds from stock issuance. We received proceeds of $51, $78 and $43 during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options. Early extinguishment of prepaid forward sales obligation. In September 2006, we settled our remaining obligations under the prepaid forward gold sales contract and forward gold purchase contract for which we were required to deliver 17,951 ounces of gold in December 2006 and 179,062 ounces of gold in June 2007. This settlement resulted in cash payments of approximately $96 and a $48 reduction to the current portion of long-term debt. Discontinued Operations Net operating cash provided from discontinued operations was $138 in 2007, compared to $96 and $74 in 2006 and 2005, respectively, as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Royalty portfolio $ 90 $ 74 $ 48 Pajingo 48 34 26 Zarafshan 10 10 Holloway (22 ) (14 ) Golden Grove 4 $ 138 $ 96 $ 74 Net cash provided from investing activities of discontinued operations was $1,318, $285 and $178 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash provided from investing activities of discontinued operations in 2007 included $1,187 from the sale of the royalty portfolio, $10 from the sale of the Pajingo operation, $77 net proceeds on the settlement of the Zarafshan-Newmont Joint Venture dispute, and $90 from the sale of marketable equity securities and cost investments offset by $4 investments in marketable equity securities and cost investments and additions to property, plant and mine development of $6. Cash provided from investing activities of discontinued operations in 2006 included $271 proceeds from the sale of the Alberta Oil Sands project, $42 on the sale of the Martabe project, $40 on the sale of the Holloway 70 Table of Contents operation, $9 from the sale of the 49% interest in Regis Resources NL and $8 proceeds from the sale of marketable equity securities offset by $12 investments in marketable securities and cost investments and additions to property, plant and mine development of $20. Cash provided from investing activities of discontinued operations in 2005 included $147 from the sale of Golden Grove, $31 from the sale of the Mezcala gold deposit and $213 from the sale of marketable equity securities offset by $11 investments in marketable securities and cost investments and additions to property, plant and mine development of $47. Net cash used in financing activities of discontinued operations was $nil, $7 and $1 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, all from the repayment of debt at Zarafshan. Corporate Revolving Credit Facilities The Company has an uncollateralized $2,000 revolving credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks, which matures in April 2012. The facility contains a letter of credit sub-facility. Interest rates and facility fees vary based on the credit ratings of the Company senior, uncollateralized, long-term debt. Borrowings under the facilities bear interest at an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 0.28% or the lead bank prime interest rate. Facility fees accrue at an annual rate of 0.07% of the aggregate commitments. The Company also pays a utilization fee of 0.05% on the amount of revolving credit loans and letters of credit outstanding under the facility for each day on which the sum of such loans and letters of credit exceed 50% of the commitments under the facility. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the facility fees were 0.07% and 0.09% of the commitment, respectively. There was $440 and $321 outstanding under the letter of credit sub-facility as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. As of December 31, 2007 we had $2,000 of the credit facility borrowings available. Debt Covenants The 5 7 / 8 % notes, Newmont Australia 7 5 / 8 % notes, 8 5 / 8 % debentures, and sale-leaseback of the refractory ore treatment plant debt facilities contain various common public debt covenants and default provisions including payment defaults, limitation on liens, limitation on sales and leaseback agreements and merger restrictions. In addition to the covenants noted above, the corporate revolving credit facility contains a financial ratio covenant requiring the Company to maintain a net debt (total debt net of cash, cash equivalents and auction rate securities) to total capitalization ratio of less than or equal to 62.5%. Furthermore, the corporate revolving credit facility contains covenants limiting the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, certain change of control provisions and a negative pledge on certain assets. Certain of our project debt facilities contain debt covenants and default provisions including limitations on dividends subject to certain debt service cover ratios, limitations on sales of assets, negative pledges on certain assets, restricted payments to partners, change of control provisions and limitations of additional permitted debt. As of December 31, 2007, the Company and its related entities were in compliance with all debt covenants and default provisions. Shelf Registration Statement In October 2007, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 which enables the Company to issue an indeterminate number or amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, guarantees of debt securities and warrants from time to time at indeterminate prices. It also included the resale of an indeterminate amount of common stock, preferred stock and debt securities from time to time upon exercise of warrants or conversion of convertible securities. 71 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007 are summarized as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Debt (1) $ 3,859 $ 324 $ 732 $ 242 $ 2,561 Capital lease obligations (1) 332 47 133 107 45 Remediation and reclamation obligations (2) 1,110 79 191 81 759 Employee-related benefits (3) 213 61 94 37 21 FIN 48 liability and interest (4) 171 171 Operating leases 31 5 14 4 8 Minimum royalty payments 135 11 52 28 44 Purchase obligations (5) 271 199 40 13 19 Other (6) 429 138 240 46 5 $ 6,551 $ 864 $ 1,496 $ 558 $ 3,633 (1) Amounts represent principal ($2,938) and estimated interest payments ($1,252) assuming no early extinguishment. (2) Mining operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Pursuant to environmental regulations, we are required to close our operations and reclaim and remediate the lands that operations have disturbed. The estimated undiscounted cash outflows of these remediation and reclamation obligations are reflected here. For more information regarding remediation and reclamation liabilities, see Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Contractual obligations for Employee-related benefits include severance, workers participation, pension funding and other benefit plans. Pension plan funding beyond 2012 cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions and actuarial assumptions and are not included. (4) As of December 31, 2007, the Company FIN 48 liability and FIN 48 net interest payable were $134 and $37, respectively. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of FIN 48 liability and interest payments beyond 2008 due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions. (5) Purchase obligations are not recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations represent contractual obligations for purchase of power, materials and supplies, consumables, inventories and capital projects. (6) Other contractual obligations that are not reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements include labor and service contracts. Payments related to derivative contracts cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have the following off-balance sheet arrangements: operating leases as disclosed in the above table and $662 of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees (see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). There is also an undrawn contingent sponsor support line of credit to Batu Hijau of $65, of which Newmont pro rata share is $37. Batu Hijau has sales agreements to sell copper concentrates as follows (in thousands of tons) 679 in 2008; 697 in 2009; 834 in 2010, 730 in 2011, 725 in 2012 and 659 thereafter. For information regarding these copper sales agreements, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk-Hedging, Provisional Copper and Gold Sales, below. 72 Table of Contents Future Cash Flows We anticipate that significant capital expenditures in 2008 through 2009 (see Investing Activities, above), funding of exploration and advanced projects, debt repayments and dividends to both common shareholders and minority interests could lead to Net cash used in investing activities and Net cash used in financing activities exceeding Net cash provided by operating activities . We believe that financing required to execute all of these investments will be available over the time period required from Net cash provided by operating activities, cash, marketable equity securities or other sources of funds, including our revolving credit facility, project financing and financing alternatives available in the broader capital markets. For information on the Company long-term debt, capital lease obligations and operating leases, see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash flows are expected to be impacted by variations in the realized spot price of gold and copper. For information on the sensitivity of Newmont Net cash provided by operating activities to metal prices, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Cash flows are also expected to be impacted by variations in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar, particularly with respect to the Australian and Canadian dollars. Accordingly, in 2007, Newmont has entered into derivative instruments to reduce the volatility of Costs applicable to sales in Australia/New Zealand. For information concerning the sensitivity of the Company Costs applicable to sales to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, see Results of Consolidated Operations, Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, above. For information on the sensitivity of Newmont Net cash provided from operating activities to foreign currency exchange rates, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Based on our production profile as of December 31, 2007, we expect that consolidated gold ounces sold will be between 5.9 and 6.4 million ounces in 2008. We do not anticipate that reasonably expected variations in gold or copper sales alone will influence our ability to pay our debt and other obligations in 2008. Environmental Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. We conduct our operations so as to protect the public health and environment and believe our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. We have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. Estimated future reclamation costs are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, $569 and $513, respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to currently producing mineral properties, of which $57 is classified as current liabilities expected to be spent in 2008. In addition, we are involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various sites involved. We believe that the related environmental obligations associated with these sites are similar in nature with respect to the development of remediation plans, their risk profile and the compliance required to meet general environmental standards. Based upon our best estimate of our liability for these matters, $125 and $85 were accrued for such obligations as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Depending upon the ultimate resolution of these matters, we believe that it is reasonably possible that the liability for these matters could be as much as 61% greater or 18% lower than the amount accrued as of December 31, 2007. The amounts accrued for these matters are reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances available at the time. Changes in estimates are charged to Other expense, net in the period estimates are revised. We spent $13, $12 and $14 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, for environmental obligations related to former, primarily historic, mining activities, and have classified $14 as a current liability expected to be spent in 2008. Expenditures for 2007, 2006 and 2005 related primarily to legacy Normandy properties in Australia, the McCoy/Cove property in Nevada and the Dawn mill site near Ford, Washington. 73 Table of Contents Included in capital expenditures were $90, $124 and $35 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, to comply with environmental regulations. Ongoing costs to comply with environmental regulations have not been a significant component of Costs applicable to sales . Included in Other long-term assets is $28 of restricted cash that is legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations related to Hope Bay and former Miramar operations. For more information on the Company reclamation and remediation liabilities, see Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
