ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) The following discussion provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Newmont Mining Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, Newmont, the Company, our and we ). We use certain non-GAAP financial performance measures in our MD&A. For a detailed description of each of the non-GAAP measures used in this MD&A, please see the discussion under Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures beginning on page 84. References to A$ refer to Australian currency, C$ to Canadian currency and NZ$ to New Zealand currency. This item should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report. Overview Newmont is one of the world largest gold producers and is the only gold company included in the S&P 500 Index and the Fortune 500, and has been included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index-World for six consecutive years. We are also engaged in the exploration for and acquisition of gold and gold/copper properties. We have significant operations and/or assets in the United States, Australia, Peru, Indonesia, Ghana, Mexico and New Zealand. Our vision is to be the most valued and respected mining company through industry leading performance. 2012 highlights are included below and discussed further in Results of Consolidated Operations . 2012 Operating highlights. Sales of $9,868; Consolidated gold production of approximately 5.6 million ounces (5.0 million attributable ounces) at Costs applicable to sales of $677 per ounce; Consolidated copper production of approximately 224 million pounds (143 million attributable pounds) at Costs applicable to sales of $2.34 per pound; Gold operating margin (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 84) of $985 per ounce; Net income attributable to Newmont stockholders of $3.65 per share, Adjusted net income (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 84) of $3.73 per share; and Gold and copper reserves of 99.2 million ounces and 9,510 million pounds, respectively at December 31, 2012. Advancing our project pipeline. We manage our wider project portfolio to maintain flexibility to address the development risks associated with our projects including permitting, local community and government support, engineering and procurement availability, technical issues, escalating costs and other associated risks that could adversely impact the timing and costs of certain opportunities. Our opportunities in the Execution phase of development comprise a significant part of the Company growth strategy and include Akyem in Ghana, Phoenix Copper Leach in Nevada and Conga in Peru, as described further below. 51 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION Emigrant, Nevada. Construction is complete and commercial production was achieved on August 30, 2012. Gold production is expected to be 80,000 to 90,000 ounces per year at Costs applicable to sales of $500 to $600 per ounce for the first five years. Total capital costs were $102. Akyem, Ghana . Construction activities continue to progress on schedule and on budget. First production is expected in late 2013 with a three to six month ramp-up expected to commercial production. Gold production is expected to be 350,000 to 450,000 ounces per year at Costs applicable to sales of $500 to $650 per ounce for the first five years of the mine operating life of approximately 16 years (based on current gold reserves). Capital costs are estimated at $850 to $1,100, of which $688 have been incurred at December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2012, we reported 7.4 million ounces of gold reserves at Akyem. Phoenix Copper Leach, Nevada . The Board of Directors authorized full funding for the Phoenix Copper Leach project in April 2012. Copper production is expected to be approximately 20 million pounds per year for the first five years of production at Costs applicable to sales of $1.75 to $2.00 per pound. First production is expected in the second half of 2013. Capital costs are expected to be $170 to $215, of which $79 have been incurred at December 31, 2012. Conga, Peru . Due to local political and community protests, construction and development activities at the Conga project were largely suspended in November 2011. The results of the Peruvian Central Government initiated Environmental Impact Assessment ( EIA ) independent review were announced on April 20, 2012 and confirmed our initial EIA met Peruvian and International standards. The review made recommendations to provide additional water capacity and social funds, which we have largely accepted. We announced our decision to move the project forward on a water first approach on June 22, 2012. Spending on the project will be reduced in 2013 to approximately $250 to $300, focusing on building water reservoirs, completing the last engineering activities, and accepting delivery of the main equipment purchases. Total property, plant and mine development was $1,480 at December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2012 we reported 6.5 million attributable ounces of gold reserves and 1,690 million attributable pounds of copper reserves at Conga. Construction of Conga and the implementation of the independent EIA review recommendations will continue provided it can be done in a safe manner with risk-adjusted returns that justify future investment. Should we be unable to continue with the current development plan at Conga, we may reprioritize and reallocate capital to development alternatives in Nevada, Australia, Ghana and Indonesia which may result in a potential accounting impairment. See Item1A, Risk Factors, above for a description of political risks related to the project development. Tanami Shaft, Australia. We have decided to defer further development work on the Tanami Shaft Project, as we focus on (i) improving the execution and delivery at the existing operation, and (ii) we better understand the impact of the nearer surface underground Auron discovery on the overall life-of-mine plan. We expect to reassess the restart date of the Tanami Shaft Project in 2015. We continue to advance earlier stage development assets through our project pipeline in our four operating regions. The exploration, construction and operation of these earlier stage development assets may require significant funding if they go into execution. Two of these projects are described further below: Merian, Suriname . Positive feasibility study work for the Merian project began in the third quarter of 2011 and was completed in 2012, increasing our equity interest in the joint venture with Alcoa to 80%. We continue to finalize the mineral agreement with the government of Suriname, expected in the first half of 2013. The development of the Merian project will allow Newmont to pursue a new district with upside potential and the opportunity to grow and extend the operating life of the South American region. First production is targeted for 2015 with initial estimated gold production (on a 100% basis) of 350,000 to 450,000 ounces per year. At December 31, 2012, we reported 2.9 million attributable ounces of gold reserves at Merian. 52 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION Long Canyon, Nevada . During 2012, the project entered the selection and confirmation stage as we further develop our understanding of Long Canyon and the district. We have submitted the Plan-of-Operations to the Bureau of Land Management in support of our Environmental Impact Statement ( EIS ). We continue to make progress on the exploration program. A total of 85 kilometers of drilling was completed in 2012 and we anticipate an additional 65 kilometers to be drilled in 2013. Our intention is to bring the project into production in 2017. Summary of Consolidated Financial and Operating Performance Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Sales $ 9,868 $ 10,358 $ 9,540 Income from continuing operations $ 2,194 $ 1,108 $ 3,144 Net income $ 2,118 $ 972 $ 3,116 Net income attributable to Newmont stockholders $ 1,809 $ 366 $ 2,277 Per common share, basic Income from continuing operations $ 3.80 $ 1.02 $ 4.69 Net income $ 3.65 $ 0.74 $ 4.63 Adjusted net income (1) $ 1,850 $ 2,170 $ 1,893 Adjusted net income per share (1) $ 3.73 $ 4.39 $ 3.85 Gold ounces produced (thousands) Consolidated 5,583 5,873 6,418 Attributable (2) 4,977 5,166 5,370 Copper pounds produced (millions) Consolidated 224 338 577 Attributable 143 197 314 Gold ounces sold (thousands) Consolidated 5,466 5,820 6,296 Attributable 4,871 5,104 5,274 Copper pounds sold (millions) Consolidated 229 356 539 Attributable 145 203 292 Average price realized, net Gold (per ounce) $ 1,662 $ 1,562 $ 1,222 Copper (per pound) $ 3.43 $ 3.54 $ 3.43 Costs applicable to sales (3) Gold (per ounce) $ 677 $ 591 $ 485 Copper (per pound) $ 2.34 $ 1.26 $ 0.80 Operating margin (1) Gold (per ounce) $ 985 $ 971 $ 737 Copper (per pound) $ 1.09 $ 2.28 $ 2.63 (1) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 84. (2) Includes 53, 64 and 21 thousand ounces in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, from our interest in La Zanja and 31, 17 and 5 thousand ounces in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, from our interest in Duketon. (3) Excludes Amortization and Reclamation and remediation . 53 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION Consolidated Financial Performance Sales decreased 5% in 2012 compared to 2011 due to lower consolidated gold ounces and copper pounds sold, partially offset by a higher average realized gold price. The average realized gold price increased 6% to $1,662 per ounce in 2012 from $1,562 per ounce in 2011. The average realized copper price, including $22 unfavorable mark to market adjustments on provisionally priced copper sales, decreased (3)% to $3.43 per pound in 2012 compared to $3.54 per pound in 2011. Gold ounces sold decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 due to lower production in Asia Pacific, primarily Batu Hijau, partially offset by higher production at Yanacocha. Copper pounds sold decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 due to lower production at Batu Hijau, partially offset by higher production at Boddington. Costs applicable to sales increased 9% in 2012 compared to 2011 due to higher waste mining activities, higher milling and royalty costs, higher diesel prices and a stronger Australian dollar. Liquidity Our financial position was as follows: At December 31, 2012 2011 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,561 $ 1,760 Debt $ 6,298 $ 4,313 Net Debt $ 4,737 $ 2,553 Investments $ 1,532 $ 1,566 Newmont stockholders equity $ 13,773 $ 12,896 During 2012, our debt and liquidity positions were affected by the following: Net cash provided from continuing operations of $2,388; Capital expenditures of $3,210; Income and mining taxes paid of $1,261; Proceeds from debt of $1,376,net of repayments and payment conversion premium on debt; and Dividends paid to common shareholders of $695. Looking Forward We will continue to focus on operational and project excellence in 2013 to deliver on our plans and advance our project pipeline, resulting in the following expectations for 2013: Attributable gold production of approximately 4.8 to 5.1 million ounces at Costs applicable to sales per consolidated ounce sold of approximately $675 to $750; Attributable copper production of approximately 150 to 170 million pounds at Costs applicable to sales per consolidated copper pound sold of approximately $2.25 to $2.50; Consolidated capital expenditures of approximately $2,400 to $2,600, with approximately 40% allocated to development capital, including at the Akyem project, Ahafo Mill Expansion, the Conga project and other expansion projects in Nevada and at La Herradura, with the remaining 60% expected to be spent on sustaining capital; All-in sustaining costs of approximately $1,100 to $1,200 per gold ounce of production. All-in sustaining cost is a non-GAAP metric defined by the Company as the sum of costs applicable 54 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION to sales, copper sales credits, G&A, exploration expense, advanced projects and R&D, other expense, and sustaining capital. All-in sustaining cost per ounce is calculated by dividing all-in sustaining cost by the estimated consolidated ounces sold; Our investment priorities include completing construction of Akyem in 2013, finishing the Phase 6 stripping campaign at Batu Hijau during 2013 and 2014, and identifying the best path forward for Conga in Peru. We expect capital expenditures to decrease from 2012 to 2013 by approximately 20%, as declining capital commitments for Conga, Akyem and Tanami are partially offset by increasing development capital for the Ahafo Mill Expansion in Ghana as well as the Phoenix Copper Leach and the proposed Turf/Leeville Vent Shaft development in Nevada. Additional capital investment is also possible at the Merian project in Suriname in 2013 pending the outcome of further dialogue with the government and additional project evaluation. Certain key factors will affect our future financial and operating results. These include, but are not limited to, the following: Our 2013 expectations, particularly with respect to production volumes, Costs applicable to sales per ounce or pound and All-in sustaining costs per ounce may differ significantly from actual quarter and full year results due to variations in mine planning and sequencing, ore grades and hardness, metal recoveries, waste removal, commodity input prices and foreign currency exchange rates; and Future investments in Akyem, Ahafo North, and the Ahafo Mill Expansion in Ghana, Conga in Peru, Long Canyon in Nevada, and Merian in Suriname will require significant funding. Our operating cash flow may become insufficient to meet the funding requirements of these investments, fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends. Our ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices and our operational performance, among other factors. In the event of lower gold and copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or new funding limitations, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends could be significantly constrained. Accounting Developments For a discussion of Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies Listed below are the accounting policies that we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported. Amortization Expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to amortize such costs over the estimated future lives of such facilities or equipment and their components. These lives do not exceed the estimated mine life based on proven and probable reserves as the useful lives of these assets are considered to be limited to the life of the relevant mine. Costs incurred to develop new properties are capitalized as incurred where it has been determined that the property can be economically developed based on the existence of proven and probable 55 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION reserves. At our surface mines, these costs include costs to further delineate the ore body and remove overburden to initially expose the ore body. At our underground mines, these costs include the cost of building access ways, shaft sinking and access, lateral development, drift development, ramps and infrastructure development. All such costs are amortized using the units-of-production ( UOP ) method over the estimated life of the ore body based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves. Major development costs incurred after the commencement of production are amortized using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves. To the extent that such costs benefit the entire ore body, they are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of the entire ore body. Costs incurred to access specific ore blocks or areas that only provide benefit over the life of that block or area are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of that specific ore block or area. The calculation of the UOP rate of amortization, and therefore the annual amortization charge to operations, could be materially impacted to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on proven and probable reserves. This would generally occur to the extent that there were significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in determining reserves. These changes could include: (i) an expansion of proven and probable reserves through exploration activities; (ii) differences between estimated and actual costs of production, due to differences in grade, metal recovery rates and foreign currency exchange rates; and (iii) differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of reserves. If reserves decreased significantly, amortization charged to operations would increase; conversely, if reserves increased significantly, amortization charged to operations would decrease. Such changes in reserves could similarly impact the useful lives of assets depreciated on a straight-line basis, where those lives are limited to the life of the mine, which in turn is limited to the life of the proven and probable reserves. The expected useful lives used in amortization calculations are determined based on applicable facts and circumstances, as described above. Significant judgment is involved in the determination of useful lives, and no assurance can be given that actual useful lives will not differ significantly from the useful lives assumed for the purpose of amortization calculations. Carrying Value of Stockpiles Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing. Mine sequencing may result in mining material at a faster rate than can be processed. We generally process the highest ore grade material first to maximize metal production; however, a blend of stockpiled material may be processed to balance hardness and/or metallurgy in order to maximize throughput and recovery. Processing of lower grade stockpiled ore may continue after mining operations are completed. Sulfide ore stockpiles are subject to oxidation over time which can reduce expected future recoveries. Stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile, the number of contained ounces or pounds (based on assay data), and the estimated metallurgical recovery rates (based on the expected processing method). Stockpile ore tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. Costs are added to stockpiles based on current mining costs, including applicable overhead and amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are removed at each stockpile average cost per recoverable ounce of gold or pound of copper as material is processed. 56 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION The following is a summary of our ore stockpiles: At December 31, At December 31, 2012 2011 2012 2011 ($ in millions) ($ per ounce) Gold Nevada $ 568 $ 414 $ 184 $ 152 Yanacocha 120 108 219 166 Boddington 373 345 493 467 Other Australia/New Zealand 173 161 172 338 Batu Hijau 258 185 457 287 Ahafo 235 173 340 314 Akyem 3 49 Total $ 1,730 $ 1,386 $ 259 $ 239 At December 31, At December 31, 2012 2011 2012 2011 ($ in millions) ($ per pound) Copper Boddington $ 101 $ 90 $ 1.15 $ 1.09 Batu Hijau 1,285 934 1.07 0.67 Total $ 1,386 $ 1,024 $ 1.07 $ 0.69 We record stockpiles at the lower of average cost or net realizable value ( NRV ), and carrying values are evaluated at least quarterly. NRV represents the estimated future sales price based on short-term and long-term metals prices, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. The primary factors that influence the need to record write-downs of stockpiles include short-term and long-term metals prices and costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy, materials and supplies, as well as realized ore grades and recovery rates. The significant assumptions in determining the stockpile NRV for each mine site reporting unit at December 31, 2012 included production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, a long-term gold price of $1,500 per ounce, a long-term copper price of $3.50 per pound and a U.S. to Australian dollar exchange rate of $1.00 per A$1.00. If short-term and long-term metals prices decrease, the value of the stockpiles decrease, and it may be necessary to record a write-down of stockpiles to NRV. The NRV measurement involves the use of estimates and assumptions unique to each mining operation regarding current and future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors. A high degree of judgment is involved in determining such assumptions and estimates and no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. 57 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION The following is a summary of the historical stockpile cost and estimated future processing costs by region: At December 31, 2012 ($ per ounce) Historical Costs Estimated Future Processing Costs Total Estimated Production Costs Gold Nevada $ 184 $ 975 $ 1,159 Yanacocha 219 210 429 Boddington 493 931 1,424 Other Australia/New Zealand 172 1,300 1,472 Batu Hijau 457 983 1,440 Ahafo 340 726 1,066 Akyem 49 653 702 Weighted Average $ 259 $ 929 $ 1,188 At December 31, 2012 ($ per pound) Historical Costs Estimated Future Processing Costs Total Estimated Production Costs Copper Boddington $ 1.15 $ 2.18 $ 3.32 Batu Hijau 1.07 2.29 3.36 Weighted Average $ 1.07 $ 2.27 $ 3.34 Carrying Value of Ore on Leach Pads Ore on leach pads represent ore that has been mined and placed on leach pads where a weak cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold. Costs are added to ore on leach pads based on current mining costs, including applicable amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are removed from ore on leach pads as ounces are recovered based on the average cost per estimated recoverable ounce of gold on the leach pad. Estimates of recoverable gold on the leach pads are calculated from the quantities of ore placed on the leach pads (measured tons added to the leach pads), the grade of ore placed on the leach pads (based on assay data) and a recovery percentage (based on ore type). In general, leach pads recover between 50% and 95% of the recoverable ounces in the first year of leaching, declining each year thereafter until the leaching process is complete. Although the quantities of recoverable gold placed on the leach pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on pads to the quantities of gold actually recovered (metallurgical balancing), the nature of the leaching process inherently limits the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. As a result, the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and estimates are refined based on actual results over time. Historically, our operating results have not been materially impacted by variations between the estimated and actual recoverable quantities of gold on our leach pads. Variations between actual and estimated quantities resulting from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in write-downs to NRV are accounted for on a prospective basis. The significant assumptions in determining the NRV for each mine site reporting unit at December 31, 2012 apart from production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation included 58 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION a long-term gold price of $1,500 per ounce. If short-term and long-term gold prices decrease, the value of the ore on leach pads decrease, and it may be necessary to record a write-down of ore on leach pads to NRV. The following is a summary of our ore on leach pads: At December 31, At December 31, 2012 2011 2012 2011 ($ in millions) ($ per ounce) Gold Nevada $ 131 $ 122 $ 368 $ 389 La Herradura 57 6 846 535 Yanacocha 378 404 973 730 Total $ 566 $ 532 $ 697 $ 606 The following is a summary of our ore on leach pad historical cost and estimated future processing costs by region: At December 31, 2012 ($ per ounce) Historical Costs Estimated Future Processing Costs Total Estimated Production Costs Gold Nevada $ 368 $ 244 $ 612 La Herradura 846 50 897 Yanacocha 973 292 1,265 Weighted Average $ 697 $ 249 $ 946 Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets We review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Asset impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset, including goodwill, if any. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows. Future cash flows are estimated based on estimated quantities of recoverable minerals, expected gold and other commodity prices (considering current and historical prices, trends and related factors), production levels, operating costs, capital requirements and reclamation costs, all based on life-of-mine plans. The significant assumptions in determining the future cash flows for each mine site reporting unit at December 31, 2012 apart from production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, included a long-term gold price of $1,500 per ounce, a long-term copper price of $3.50 per pound and U.S. to Australian dollar exchange rate of $1.00 per A$1.00. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, we recorded impairments of $52, $2,084, and $6, respectively, to reduce the carrying value of property, plant and mine development as part of Write-down of property, plant and mine development. Existing proven and probable reserves and value beyond proven and probable reserves, including mineralization other than proven and probable reserves are included when determining the fair value of mine site reporting units at acquisition and, subsequently, in determining whether the assets are impaired. The term recoverable minerals refers to the estimated amount of gold or other commodities that will be obtained after taking into account losses during ore processing and treatment. Estimates of 59 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION recoverable minerals from such exploration stage mineral interests are risk adjusted based on management relative confidence in such materials. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups. As discussed above under Amortization, various factors could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted production schedules from proven and probable reserves. Additionally, production, capital and reclamation costs could differ from the assumptions used in the cash flow models used to assess impairment. The ability to achieve the estimated quantities of recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests involves further risks in addition to those factors applicable to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have been identified, due to the lower level of confidence that the identified mineralized material could ultimately be mined economically. Assets classified as exploration potential have the highest level of risk that the carrying value of the asset can be ultimately realized, due to the still lower level of geological confidence and economic modeling. Derivative Instruments With the exception of the Call Spread Transactions (as described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), all financial instruments that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in the statements of consolidated income, except for the effective portion of the change in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges. Management applies judgment in estimating the fair value of instruments that are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding commodity prices, market volatilities, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Variations in these factors could materially affect amounts credited or charged to earnings to reflect the changes in fair value of derivatives. Certain derivative contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, whereby the effective portion of changes in fair value of these instruments are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income and will be recognized in the statements of consolidated income when the underlying transaction designated as the hedged item impacts earnings. The derivative contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges are designated against foreign currency expenditures, diesel purchases, or future debt interest payments where management believes the forecasted transaction is probable of occurring. To the extent that management determines that the forecasted transactions are no longer probable of occurring, gains and losses deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income would be reclassified to the statements of consolidated income immediately. Reclamation and Remediation Obligations Reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation and remediation costs. Reclamation obligations are based on when the spending for an existing environmental disturbance will occur. We review, on at least an annual basis, the reclamation obligation at each mine. Reclamation obligations for inactive mines are accrued based on management best estimate of the costs expected to be incurred at a site. Such cost estimates include, where applicable, ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs. Changes in estimates at inactive mines are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and 60 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required. Any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to earnings for reclamation and remediation. Income and Mining Taxes We recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. Refer above to Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets for a discussion of the factors that could cause future cash flows to differ from estimates. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to realize deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate could limit our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets recorded at the reporting date. Our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If an estimate of tax liabilities proves to be greater than the ultimate assessment, a tax benefit would result. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in Income and mining tax expense . Consolidated Financial Results Gold Sales decreased $13 in 2012 compared to 2011 due to 354,000 fewer ounces sold, offset by a $100 per ounce increase in the average net realized price. Gold Sales increased $1,404 in 2011 compared to 2010 due to a $340 per ounce increase in the average net realized price, partially offset by 476,000 fewer ounces sold.

The increase in 2011 compared to 2010 was due to higher mining and milling costs, partially offset by lower sales volumes, higher silver by-product credits and a build-up of inventories and stockpiles. Costs applicable to sales for copper increased in 2012 from 2011 due to continued waste mining at Batu Hijau and higher milling costs at Boddington, coupled with the higher allocation of costs to copper. The increase in 2011 from 2010 was due to higher waste mining costs at Batu Hijau. For a complete discussion regarding variations in operations, see Results of Consolidated Operations below. Amortization expense decreased in 2012 from 2011 due to lower production, partially offset by additional investments in mine development and equipment and higher asset retirement costs. Amortization expense increased in 2011 from 2010 due to a full year of Boddington production, additional equipment purchases and higher capitalized mine development. Amortization expense fluctuates as capital expenditures increase or decrease and as production levels increase or decrease due to the use of the units-of-production amortization method for mineral interests and mine development. For a complete discussion, see Results of Consolidated Operations , below. We expect Amortization expense to be approximately $1,050 to $1,100 in 2013. 64 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION The following is a summary of Costs applicable to sales and Amortization by operation: Costs Applicable to Sales Amortization Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 2010 Gold North America: Nevada $ 1,098 $ 1,039 $ 974 $ 230 $ 277 $ 271 La Herradura 132 110 73 21 20 19 1,230 1,149 1,047 251 297 290 South America: Yanacocha 669 711 630 254 234 162 Asia Pacific: Boddington 623 470 400 159 122 113 Batu Hijau 71 164 155 12 35 42 Other Australia/New Zealand 796 681 585 142 135 108 1,490 1,315 1,140 313 292 263 Africa: Ahafo 314 265 237 75 76 78 3,703 3,440 3,054 893 899 793 Copper Asia Pacific: Batu Hijau 385 332 337 76 71 90 Boddington 150 118 93 34 28 25 535 450 430 110 99 115 Other Other North America 14 14 Other Asia Pacific 4 3 2 Corporate and other 25 21 21 29 38 37 $ 4,238 $ 3,890 $ 3,484 $ 1,032 $ 1,036 $ 945 Exploration expense increased to $356 in 2012 from $350 in 2011 due to additional near mine expenditures in South America, Asia Pacific and Africa, mostly offset by the elimination of exploration at Hope Bay. Exploration expense increased in 2011 from $218 in 2010 due to additional near mine expenditures in all regions, with the largest increases at Nevada, Yanacocha, Ahafo, Jundee and Tanami and increased regional expenditures at Long Canyon and Hope Bay. We expect Exploration expense to decrease to approximately $250 to $300 in 2013, focused primarily on Carlin underground and Long Canyon in Nevada, La Herradura in Mexico and Jundee in Australia. During 2012, we added 5.5 million ounces to proven and probable reserves, with 6.2 million ounces of depletion. Reserve additions were primarily due to conversion of mineralized material at the Merian project in Suriname (1.8 million ounces), Carlin underground, (1.7 million ounces) and La Herradura (0.6 million ounces) with the remaining additions coming from open pit and underground sources in all regions (1.4 million ounces). The estimated impact of the change in gold price assumption on these reserve additions was an increase of 1.5 million ounces. 65 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION During 2011, we added 11.6 million ounces to proven and probable reserves, with 6.3 million ounces of depletion. Reserve additions were primarily due to conversion of mineralized material at Ahafo (2.7 million ounces), Carlin open pit, (2.3 million ounces), Phoenix (1.5 million ounces), Carlin underground (1.2 million ounces), Kalgoorlie (1.0 million ounces) and Tanami (0.7 million ounces) with the remaining additions coming from open pit and underground sources in in all regions (2.2 million ounces). The estimated impact of the change in gold price assumption on these reserve additions was an increase of 3.3 million ounces. During 2010, we added 8.2 million ounces to proven and probable reserves, with 6.5 million ounces of depletion. Reserve additions were primarily due to conversion of mineralized material at Leeville (1.8 million ounces), Ahafo (1.5 million ounces), Twin Creeks (1.4 million ounces), Phoenix (0.8 million ounces), La Herradura (0.7 million ounces) and Tanami (0.7 million ounces) with most of the remaining additions coming from open pit and underground sources in the United States, Australia and South America (1.8 million ounces). Gold reserves were revised down by 0.5 million ounces at Akyem in Ghana, primarily due to new mining assumptions and higher cutoff grades. The estimated impact of the change in gold price assumption on these reserve additions was an increase of 1.7 million ounces. Advanced projects, research and development expense includes development project management costs, feasibility studies and certain drilling costs. Advanced projects, research and development expense decreased 7% in 2012 compared to 2011 due to placing Hope Bay on care and maintenance, partially offset by a focus on Merian in Suriname, Long Canyon in Nevada, Chaquicocha underground at Yanacocha, Elang in Indonesia and Ahafo mill expansion in Africa. We expect Advanced projects, research and development expense to be approximately $350 to $400 in 2013, focused primarily on Long Canyon in Nevada, Elang in Indonesia, and Subika expansion in Africa.

General and administrative expense increased in 2011 compared to $178 in 2010 due to higher benefit and compensation costs and higher consulting fees. General and administrative expense as a percentage of Sales was 2.1% in 2012, compared to 1.9% and 1.9% in 2011 and 2010, respectively. We expect General and administrative expense to be approximately $200 to $250 in 2013. Write-down of property, plant and mine development totaled $52, $2,084 and $6 for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The 2012 write-down is primarily due to an impairment of the FALC JV diamond project as well as miscellaneous asset impairments at Conga, Australia and Batu Hijau. The write-down in 2011 was primarily related to the Hope Bay project. We placed the Hope Bay project on care and maintenance after evaluating existing development options in our project pipeline. On January 28, 2013 we signed a definitive acquisition agreement with TMAC Resources, Inc. for the sale of 100% of the Hope Bay project. The transaction is subject to certain conditions and the receipt of all required regulatory and third party approvals. The 2010 write-down was primarily related to asset impairments in Nevada. Other expense, net was $449, $265 and $261 for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in 2012 over 2011 is due to Hope Bay care and maintenance costs, restructuring charges and higher expenses for regional administration and community development, partially offset by the Indonesian value added tax settlement and Fronteer acquisition costs in 2011. The increase in 2011 over 2010 is due to Fronteer acquisition costs, an impairment of inventory at Hope Bay and higher regional administration costs, partially offset by lower community development costs. Other income, net was $278, $12 and $109 for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in 2012 over 2011 is due to lower other-than-temporary impairment charges for marketable equity securities, the sale of non-core assets, a reduction of an allowance for loan receivable, higher income from development projects, a gain on derivative ineffectiveness and higher Canadian Oil Sands dividends, partially offset by a lower gain on sale of investments. The decrease in 2011 over 2010 is due to other-than-temporary impairment charges for marketable securities primarily acquired with the Fronteer acquisition in 2011, lower Canadian Oil Sands dividends as well as the sale of non-core assets in 2010, partially offset by the gain on the sale of investments, higher income from developing projects and lower foreign exchange losses. Interest expense, net was $249, $244 and $279 for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Capitalized interest totaled $107, $52 and $21 in each year, respectively. Interest expense, net increased in 2012 compared to 2011 due to the issuance of the 2022 and 2042 Senior Notes, partially offset by the repayment of the 2012 Convertible Senior Notes and the increase in capitalized interest due to higher development project expenditures. Interest expense, net decreased in 2011 from 2010 due to the increase in capitalized interest for the advancement of our Conga and Akyem projects. We expect Interest expense, net to be approximately $200 to $250 in 2013. Income and mining tax expense was $869, $713 and $856 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The effective tax rates were 28%, 39% and 21% in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The lower tax rate in 2012 when compared to 2011 is primarily due to the 2011 impairment related to the Hope Bay project and the impact it had on the realizability of our Canadian deferred tax assets. Without the write-down on the Hope Bay project, the 2011 annual effective tax rate would have been 30%. The higher tax rate in 2011 when compared to 2010 is due to the aforementioned impairment and the significant tax benefit recognized in 2010 as a result of check the box elections made with respect to certain of our non-US subsidiaries. As a result of the elections, the subsidiaries are treated as flow-through entities for US federal income tax purposes. The restructuring resulted in the recording of a deferred tax asset, calculated as the difference between fair market valuations of the subsidiaries compared to the underlying financial statement basis in the assets. 67 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION The factors that most significantly impacted our effective tax rates for the three periods are percentage depletion, changes in estimates of reserves for income tax uncertainties, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets, mining taxes and the impact of certain specific transactions. Many of these factors are sensitive to the average realized price of gold and other metals. For a complete discussion, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2011, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service issued a Technical Advice Memorandum ( TAM ) to the Company regarding the U.S. income tax treatment of the Price Capped Forward Sales Contracts settled in cash in 2007. The TAM provides guidance which is unfavorable to the Company. The Company is vigorously defending its positions through all processes available to it and believes it should prevail. Based on the uncertainty and inherent unpredictability of the factors influencing our effective tax rate and the sensitivity of such factors to gold and other metals prices as discussed above, the effective tax rate is expected to be volatile in future periods. The effective tax rate is expected to be between 30% and 32% in 2013. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Yanacocha $ 305 $ 326 $ 292 Batu Hijau (2 ) 287 549 Other 6 (7 ) (2 ) $ 309 $ 606 $ 839 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased in 2012 from 2011 as a result of decreased earnings at Batu Hijau and Yanacocha. The 2011 decrease over 2010 was a result of decreased earnings at Batu Hijau, partially offset by higher earnings at Yanacocha and the required March 2010 partial divestiture of shares in Batu Hijau. Equity income (loss) of affiliates was as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Minera La Zanja S.R.L. (46.9%) $ 18 $ 52 $ 10 Euronimba Ltd. (43.5%) (69 ) (41 ) (10 ) AGR Matthey Joint Venture 3 $ (51 ) $ 11 $ 3 We have a 46.94% interest in Minera La Zanja, S.R.L. ( La Zanja ), near the city of Cajamarca, Peru. The remaining interest is held by Compa ia de Minas Buenaventura, S.A.A. ( Buenaventura ). Newmont received dividends of $19 during 2012 from its interest in La Zanja. We have a 43.50% interest in Euronimba Ltd. ( Euronimba ), with the remaining interests held by BHP Billiton (43.50%) and Areva (13%). Euronimba owns 95% of the Nimba iron ore project located in the Republic of Guinea, which is in the early stages of development. The AGR Matthey Joint Venture ( AGR ), a gold refinery in which Newmont held a 40% interest, was dissolved on March 30, 2010. Loss from discontinued operations include Holloway Mining Company, which owned the Holt-McDermott property ( Holt property ) that was sold to St. Andrew Goldfields Ltd. ( St. Andrew ) in 2006. In 2009, the Superior Court issued a decision finding Newmont Canada Corporation ( Newmont 68 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION Canada ) liable for a sliding scale royalty on production from the Holt property, which Newmont Canada appealed. In 2010, we recognized a $28 charge, net of tax benefits of $12, related to these legal claims. In 2011, the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the Superior Court ruling resulting in an additional $136 charge, net of tax benefits of $7. In 2012, we recognized a $76 charge, net of tax benefits of $4, reflecting the impact of higher gold prices on our estimated future royalty liability. Other comprehensive loss, net of tax was $161 in 2012 and included non-cash adjustments for a $164 net loss in value of marketable securities primarily related to Canadian Oil Sands Trust and Gabriel Resources Ltd., partially offset by gains related to Regis Resources Ltd., a $14 net gain on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, a $51 net loss related to pension and other post-retirement benefit adjustments as a result of utilizing a lower discount rate, and a $40 net gain on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges due mainly to foreign currency hedge gains. Other comprehensive income, net of tax was $456 in 2011 and included non-cash adjustments for a $195 net loss in value of marketable securities primarily related to Canadian Oil Sands Trust and Gabriel Resources Ltd., a $8 net gain on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, a $60 net loss related to pension and other post-retirement benefit adjustments primarily as a result of utilizing a lower discount rate and lower than expected return on plan assets, and a $209 net loss on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges due mainly to a loss on forward starting swap contracts partially offset by foreign currency hedge gains. Other comprehensive income, net of tax was $484 in 2010 and included non-cash adjustments for a $269 net gain in value of marketable securities primarily related to Gabriel Resources Ltd. and Regis Resources Ltd., a $98 net gain on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, a $13 net loss related to pension and other post-retirement benefit adjustments primarily as a result of utilizing a lower discount rate, and a $130 net gain on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges due mainly to foreign currency hedge gains.

Consolidated copper pounds produced decreased 34% due to continued Phase 6 waste mining at Batu Hijau, partially offset by higher throughput at Boddington. Attributable gold ounces produced decreased 4% due to lower production from Batu Hijau, Tanami, and Waihi, partially offset by higher production from South America. Lower attributable copper pounds produced also resulted from lower production at Batu Hijau. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated gold ounce sold increased 15% due to lower production from Batu Hijau, Tanami, and Waihi, higher royalty and waste mining costs, partially offset by lower co-product allocation of costs to gold. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated copper pound sold increased 86% due to lower production from Batu Hijau, higher waste mining at Batu Hijau, higher mill maintenance costs at Boddington, coupled with higher co-product allocation of costs to copper. 2011 compared to 2010 Consolidated gold ounces produced decreased 8% due to: lower production from South America due to lower leach placement at Yanacocha from changes in mine sequencing; and lower production from Asia Pacific due to higher waste stripping in Phase 6 at Batu Hijau, resulting in processing lower grade stockpiled material; partially offset by higher production from North America due to a full year of Soledad-Dipolos production at La Herradura in 2011; and higher production from Africa due to a full year of production from the Amoma pit at Ahafo. Consolidated copper pounds produced decreased 41% due to higher waste stripping in Phase 6 at Batu Hijau resulting in processing lower grade stockpiled material, partially offset by higher grade and throughput at Boddington. Attributable gold ounces produced decreased 4% due to lower production from Batu Hijau and Yanacocha, partially offset by higher production from La Herradura. Lower attributable copper pounds produced also resulted from lower production at Batu Hijau. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated gold ounce sold increased 22% due to lower production from Batu Hijau and Yanacocha, higher royalty and waste mining costs, higher co-product allocation of costs to gold and a stronger Australian dollar, partially offset by higher silver and copper by-product 70 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION credits. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated copper pound sold increased 58% due to lower production from Batu Hijau, higher waste mining at Batu Hijau and higher mill maintenance costs at Boddington, partially offset by lower co-product allocation of costs to copper. We expect 2013 attributable gold production of approximately 4.8 to 5.1 million ounces, primarily due to lower production at Batu Hijau as it continues to process lower grade stockpiled ore during Phase 6 stripping and lower production at Yanacocha, partially offset by new production at Akyem expected in late 2013. Consolidated Costs applicable to sales per ounce for 2013 are expected to be approximately $675 to $750 due to lower production at Batu Hijau and Yanacocha combined with higher expected costs for energy, labor and contracted services. All-in sustaining cost (sum of costs applicable to sales, copper credits, G&A, exploration expense, advanced projects and R&D, other expense, and sustaining capital) is expected to be $1,100 to $1,200 per ounce. We expect 2013 attributable copper production of approximately 150 to 170 million pounds at consolidated Costs applicable to sales per pound of approximately $2.25 to $2.50 due to lower production at Batu Hijau.

Gold ounces produced increased slightly due to higher throughput at Mill 6, Juniper Mill, and the Twin Creeks Autoclave as well as new production from Emigrant, partially offset by lower grade at Phoenix and lower throughput and grade at Midas. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 6% due to higher commodity and contractor costs and higher royalties. Amortization per ounce decreased 16% due to higher production and longer reserve life. La Herradura, Mexico. Gold ounces produced were unchanged due to new production at Noche Buena, offset by timing of leach recoveries. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 18% due to higher waste tons mined, higher commodity prices and lower by-product credits. Amortization per ounce increased 6% due to additional equipment purchases and the start of Noche Buena production. 2011 compared to 2010 Nevada, USA. Gold ounces produced increased slightly due to the commencement of underground mining at Exodus and Pete Bajo in 2011, higher Gold Quarry production in 2011 after resolution of previous geotechnical issues and higher underground production at Leeville, partially offset by lower production from the Chukar underground mine. Total surface ore tons mined were 75% higher primarily due to completing the remediation of the slope failure at Gold Quarry. Ore placed on leach pads increased 84% to 8.3 million tons due to higher leach ore tons mined from Lantern as well as re-leaching of ore at Lone Tree. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 7% due to higher 71 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION surface mining and milling costs and higher royalties, partially offset by higher silver and copper by-product credits. Amortization per ounce increased 2% due to equipment additions and higher underground development costs. La Herradura, Mexico. Gold ounces produced increased 22% due to higher leach placement and additional mining equipment at Herradura and Soledad-Dipolos. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 25% due to higher waste tons mined and higher employee profit sharing costs, partially offset by higher production and silver by-product credits.

Gold and copper production decreased 1% and increased 3%, respectively, essentially in line with 2011. Costs applicable to sales increased 29% per ounce and 13% per pound, respectively, due to a higher strip ratio, higher mill maintenance costs, and the impact of the carbon tax, which took effect in July 2012. Amortization per ounce and per pound were impacted by lower gold production and higher capitalized costs. Batu Hijau, Indonesia . Copper and gold production decreased 42% and 78%, respectively, due to lower grade and recovery as a result of processing primarily lower grade stockpiled material. Waste tons mined increased 26% as Phase 6 waste removal continues as planned. The Company expects to process lower grade stockpiled ore until Phase 6 ore becomes the primary mill feed in 2014. Costs applicable to sales increased 113% per pound and 125% per ounce, respectively, due to lower production, partially offset by lower royalties. Amortization increased 92% per pound and 75% per ounce, respectively, due to lower production. Other Australia/New Zealand.

Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 32% due to lower production and higher mining costs. Amortization per ounce increased 19% due to lower production. 73 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION 2011 compared to 2010 Boddington, Australia . Gold and copper production increased 2% and 20%, respectively, due to higher mill throughput and higher copper grade, partially offset by lower recoveries and lower gold grade. Costs applicable to sales increased 16% per ounce and 9% per pound, respectively, due to higher mining and mill maintenance costs, higher royalty costs and a stronger Australian dollar, net of hedging gains, partially offset by higher production and higher silver by-product credits. Changes in Australia exchange rates increased Costs applicable to sales per ounce by $33 and per pound by $0.08. Costs applicable to sales and Amortization per ounce and per pound were also impacted by a higher allocation of costs to gold. Batu Hijau, Indonesia . Copper and gold production decreased 48% and 57%, respectively, due to lower throughput, grade and recovery as a result of processing more stockpiled material, compared to a higher proportion of high grade Phase 5 ore in 2010, and mill down time from motor replacements during the second and third quarters of 2011. Waste tons mined increased 135% as Phase 6 waste removal continues as planned. The Company expects to process primarily stockpiled ore until Phase 6 ore becomes the primary mill feed in 2014. Costs applicable to sales increased 61% per pound and 101% per ounce due to lower production, higher waste mining and higher labor. Amortization increased 26% per pound and 62% per ounce due to equipment additions and lower production. Costs applicable to sales and Amortization per pound and per ounce were also impacted by a higher allocation of costs to gold. Other Australia/New Zealand. Gold production decreased 4% due to lower throughput at Tanami and lower grade at Waihi. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 22% due to lower production, higher mining and milling costs and a stronger Australian dollar, net of hedging gains. Changes in Australia and New Zealand exchange rates increased Costs applicable to sales per ounce by $26.

Beginning in 2013, our Asia Pacific region will be split into two regions, Australia/NewZealand and Indonesia. The Australia/NewZealand region will include Boddington and Other Australia/NewZealand while the Indonesia region will include Batu Hijau. Gold production for Australia/NewZealand is expected to be approximately 1.6 to 1.7 million ounces attributable to Newmont in 2013 at higher consolidated Cost applicable to sales per ounce of $900 to $1,000, primarily due to lower production at Other Australia/NewZealand and higher labor and commodity costs. We expect copper production for the Australia/NewZealand region of approximately 70 to 80 million pounds attributable to Newmont at consolidated Costs applicable to sales per pound of approximately $2.45 to $2.65 in 2013. Gold production for Indonesia is expected to be approximately 20,000 to 30,000 ounces attributable to Newmont in 2013 at higher consolidated Costs applicable to sales per ounce of approximately $900 to $1,000 in 2013, primarily due to lower production at Batu Hijau and higher labor and commodity costs. We expect copper production for Indonesia of approximately 75 to 90 million pounds attributable to Newmont at consolidated Costs applicable to sales per pound of approximately $2.20 to $2.40 in 2013.

Gold ounces produced decreased 1% due to lower throughput and lower grade, largely offset by a drawdown of in-circuit inventory. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 26% due to higher labor, commodity and royalty costs. Amortization per ounce increased 3% due to lower ounces sold. 2011 compared to 2010 Ahafo, Ghana. Gold ounces produced increased 4% due to higher throughput and recovery. Ore tons mined increased 28% from a full year of production at Amoma. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 5% due to higher labor, commodity and royalty costs, partially offset by higher production. Amortization per ounce decreased 9% due to higher production. Gold production for the Africa operations is expected to increase in 2013 to approximately 625,000 to 675,000 ounces due to the new production from Akyem. Costs applicable to sales per ounce of approximately $525 to $575 are expected for 2013. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Foreign currency exchange rates can increase or decrease profit margins and Costs applicable to sales to the extent costs are paid in foreign currencies. Such fluctuations have not had a material impact on our revenue since gold and copper are sold throughout the world principally in U.S. dollars. Approximately 51%, 43% and 36% of our Costs applicable to sales were paid in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our Costs applicable to sales are most significantly impacted by variations in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate. Variations in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate historically have been strongly correlated to variations in the U.S. dollar gold price over the long-term. Changes in costs at Australian locations due to exchange rate changes have therefore tended to be mitigated by changes in sales reported in U.S. dollars at Australian locations. No assurance, however, can be given that the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate will continue to be strongly correlated to the U.S. dollar gold price in the future. Variations in foreign currency exchange rates increased Costs applicable to sales per ounce $4, net of hedging, in 2012 compared to 2011, and increased Costs applicable to sales per ounce $9, net of hedging, in 2011 from 2010, primarily due to movements in the Australian dollar. We hedge a portion of our forecasted Australian dollar denominated operating expenditures. At December 31, 2012, we have hedged 76%, 61%, 41%, 24% and 7% of our forecasted Australian denominated operating costs in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively, at an average rate of 0.94, 0.92, 0.91, 0.91 and 0.91, respectively. Foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on our determination of proven and probable reserves. However, if a sustained weakening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Australian dollar, and/or to other foreign currencies that impact our cost structure, were not mitigated by offsetting increases in the U.S. dollar gold price or by other factors, the amount of proven and probable reserves in the applicable foreign country could be reduced as certain proven and probable reserves may no longer be economic. The extent of any such reduction would be dependent on a variety of factors including the length of time of any such weakening of the U.S. dollar, and management long-term view of the applicable exchange rate. Future reductions of proven and probable reserves would primarily result in reduced gold or copper sales and increased amortization and, depending on the level of reduction, could also result in impairments of property, plant and mine development, mineral interests and/or goodwill. 75 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Provided from Operations Net cash provided from continuing operations was $2,388, $3,591 and $3,180 for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and was impacted by the following key factors: Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Consolidated gold ounces sold (in thousands) 5,466 5,820 6,296 Average price realized per ounce of gold, net $ 1,662 $ 1,562 $ 1,222 Costs applicable to sales per ounce of gold (1) (677 ) (591 ) (485 ) Operating margin per ounce of gold (2) $ 985 $ 971 $ 737 Consolidated copper pounds sold (in millions) 229 356 539 Average price realized per pound of copper, net $ 3.43 $ 3.54 $ 3.43 Costs applicable to sales per pound of copper (1) (2.34 ) (1.26 ) (0.80 ) Operating margin per pound of copper (2) $ 1.09 $ 2.28 $ 2.63 (1) Excludes Amortization and Reclamation and remediation . (2) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 84. Net cash provided from continuing operations was $2,388 in 2012, a decrease of $1,203 from 2011 due to lower production at Batu Hijau and a net increase in working capital of $762, primarily inventories, and lower Sales and higher Costs applicable to sales. Cash flow provided from operations during 2011 was $3,591, an increase of $411 from 2010 due to higher realized gold prices resulting in an increase in gold operating margin and a lower increase in working capital of $443 (trade receivables, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities); partially offset by higher Costs applicable to sales resulting in a decrease in copper operating margin and lower gold and copper sales volumes as discussed above in Consolidated Financial Results. The increase was also partially offset by higher investments in advanced projects of $157 and exploration of $132 and higher current income and mining tax expense of $148. We are currently planning to contribute $80 to our retirement benefit programs in 2013. 76 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $3,264 in 2012 compared to $5,067 and $1,419 in 2011 and 2010, respectively, for the reasons explained below.

In March 2010, NTPBV completed the sale of 7% of shares in PTNNT to a third party buyer. This transaction reduced our ownership interest in PTNNT to 31.5%. Cash proceeds from the sale was $229 with our 56.25% share being $129 and the remaining balances paid to our NTPBV partner. Acquisition of noncontrolling interests. In June 2010, PTPI, an unrelated noncontrolling shareholder of PTNNT, completed the sale of a 2.2% interest in PTNNT to PTIMI. To enable the transaction to proceed, we released our rights to the dividends payable on this 2.2% interest and released our security interest in the associated shares. We agreed to advance certain funds to PTIMI to enable it to purchase the 2.2% interest in exchange for (i) a pledge of their share of PTNNT, (ii) an assignment of dividends payable on the shares, net of withholding tax, and (iii) a commitment to support the application of Newmont standards to the operation of the Batu Hijau mine. The funds that we advanced to PTIMI and which it paid to PTPI for the shares were used by PTPI to reduce its outstanding loan balance with us. Upon completion of this transaction, PTPI requested and was allowed to make additional draw-downs under our agreement with PTPI. In December 2012, we advanced certain funds to PTPI in accordance with the loan agreement. Our economic interest in PTPI and PTIMI combined 20% ownership interest in PTNNT remains at 17% and did not change as a result of these transactions. Dividends paid to noncontrolling interests. We paid dividends of $3, $117 and $462 to noncontrolling interests during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

We paid annual dividends of $1.40, $1.00 and $0.50 per common share during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Additionally, Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, paid annual dividends of C$1.40, C$1.00 and C$0.52 during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. On February 20, 2013, we declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.425 per share, payable March 28, 2013 to holders of record at the close of business on March 13, 2013. Total dividends paid to common stockholders were $695, $494 and $246 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Discontinued Operations Net operating cash used in discontinued operations was $16 in 2012, compared to $7 and $13 in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Discontinued operations in 2012 and 2011 relate to payments on the Holt property royalty. The 2010 amounts related to the Kori Kollo operation in Bolivia which was sold in 2009. Corporate Revolving Credit Facility Effective May 20, 2011, the Company entered into a new uncollateralized $2,500 revolving credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks. This new revolving credit facility replaced the existing revolving credit facility which was cancelled upon the effectiveness of the new facility. The new facility provides for borrowings in U.S. dollars and contains a letter of credit sub-facility. The new facility originally matured in May 2016. Facility fees vary based on the credit ratings of the Company senior, uncollateralized, long-term debt. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a market based rate plus a margin determined by the Company credit rating. In May 2012, the Company Corporate Revolving Credit Facility was amended to increase the capacity to $3,000 and extend the facility one year to 2017. At December 31, 2012, we had $0 borrowings outstanding under the facility. There was $394 and $244 outstanding in letters of credit at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. 80 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION Subsidiary Financings PTNNT Revolving Credit Facility Effective May 27, 2011, PTNNT entered into a $600 reducing revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks. This facility provides for borrowings in U.S. dollars and matures in March 2017. The facility is non-recourse to Newmont and certain assets of PTNNT are pledged as collateral. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 4.00%. Commitment fees currently accrue on the daily average unused amount of the commitment of each lender at an annual rate of 2.00%. A one-time arrangement fee and other debt issuance costs, net of amortization, of $18 related to the facility were capitalized and will be amortized over the term of the debt. There were $180 in borrowings outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2012. Debt Covenants The Company senior notes contain various covenants and default provisions including payment defaults, limitation on liens, limitation on sales and leaseback agreements and merger restrictions. The Ahafo project facility contains a financial ratio covenant requiring the Company to maintain a net debt (total debt net of cash and cash equivalents) to EBITDA (earnings before interest expense, income and mining taxes, depreciation and amortization) ratio of less than or equal to 4.0 and a net debt to total capitalization ratio of less than or equal to 62.5%. The corporate revolving credit facility contains a financial ratio covenant requiring the Company to maintain a net debt (total debt net of cash and cash equivalents) to total capitalization ratio of less than or equal to 62.5% in addition to the covenants noted above. Furthermore, the corporate revolving credit facility contains covenants limiting the sale of all or substantially all of the Company assets, certain change of control provisions and a negative pledge on certain assets. The PTNNT revolving credit facility requires PTNNT to maintain certain financial ratios and to comply with certain terms and conditions with regards to its mine plan, contract of work, dividends, financing activities, leasing, investments and other matters. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company and its related entities were in compliance with all debt covenants and provisions related to potential defaults. Shelf Registration Statement In September 2012, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ) a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 which enables the Company to issue an indeterminate number or amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, guarantees of debt securities and warrants from time to time at indeterminate prices. It also included the resale of an indeterminate amount of common stock, preferred stock and debt securities from time to time upon exercise of warrants or conversion of convertible securities. 81 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations at December 31, 2012 are summarized as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 4 - 5 Years More than 5 Years Debt (1) $ 11,290 $ 280 $ 1,360 $ 1,169 $ 8,481 Capital lease obligations (2) 5 1 2 1 1 Reclamation and remediation obligations (3) 2,284 93 277 185 1,729 Employee-related benefits (4) 684 98 179 104 303 Uncertain income tax liabilities and interest (5) 65 65 Operating leases 69 10 30 17 12 Minimum royalty payments 527 60 113 75 279 Purchase obligations (6) 1,046 548 154 76 268 Other (7) 964 322 339 100 203 $ 16,934 $ 1,412 $ 2,454 $ 1,727 $ 11,341 (1) Amounts represent principal of $6,294 and estimated interest payments of $4,996, assuming no early extinguishment. (2) Amounts represent principal of $4 and estimated interest payments of $1. (3) Mining operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Pursuant to environmental regulations, we are required to close our operations and reclaim and remediate the lands that operations have disturbed. The estimated undiscounted cash outflows of these reclamation and remediation obligations are reflected here. For more information regarding reclamation and remediation liabilities, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (4) Contractual obligations for Employee-related benefits include severance, workers participation, pension and other benefit plans. Pension plan benefit payments beyond 2017 cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions and actuarial assumptions and are not included. (5) We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of our uncertain income tax liabilities and interest payments beyond 2013 due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions. (6) Purchase obligations are not recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations represent contractual obligations for purchase of power, materials and supplies, consumables, inventories and capital projects. (7) Other includes accrued Boddington contingent consideration of $41, the accrued Holt royalty of $240 and other obligations which are not reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements including labor and service contracts. Payments related to derivative contracts cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have the following off-balance sheet arrangements: operating leases (as disclosed in the above table) and $1,755 of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees (see Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 82 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION We also have sales agreements to sell copper and gold concentrates at market prices as follows (in thousands of tons): 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter Batu Hijau 402 527 Boddington 198 187 154 154 154 99 Nevada 50 48 41 71 650 762 195 225 154 99 For information regarding these copper sales agreements, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Hedging, Provisional Copper and Gold Sales, below. Other Liquidity Matters At December 31, 2012, the Company had $1,561 in cash and cash equivalents, of which $1,198 was held in foreign subsidiaries and is primarily held in U.S. dollar denominated accounts with the remainder in foreign currencies readily convertible to U.S. dollars. At December 31, 2012, $431 of the consolidated cash and cash equivalents was attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily related to our Indonesian and Peruvian operations which is being held to fund those operations. At December 31, 2012, $315 in consolidated cash and cash equivalents ($184 attributable to Newmont) was held at certain foreign subsidiaries that, if repatriated may be subject to withholding taxes, which would generate foreign tax credits in the U.S. As a result, we expect that there would be minimal U.S. tax liability upon repatriation of these amounts after considering available foreign tax credits. All other amounts represent earnings that are taxed in the U.S. on a current basis due to being held in U.S. subsidiaries or non-U.S. subsidiaries that are flow-through entities for U.S. tax purposes. We believe that our liquidity and capital resources are adequate to fund our operations and corporate activities. Future Cash Flows We anticipate significant future capital expenditures, funding of exploration and advanced projects, debt repayments and dividends to both common shareholders and noncontrolling interests will impact Net cash used in investing activities and Net cash used in financing activities and may exceed Net cash provided by operations . Our ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices as well as our operational performance, current cash flow and debt position, among other factors. We may determine that it is necessary or appropriate to issue additional equity or other securities, defer projects or sell assets. Additional financing may not be available when needed or, if available, the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and, if raised by offering equity securities, may involve substantial dilution to existing stockholders. In the event of lower gold and copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or new funding limitations, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business activities, retire or service all outstanding debt and pay dividends could be significantly constrained. For information on our long-term debt, capital lease obligations and operating leases, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash flows are expected to be impacted by variations in the realized prices of gold and copper. For information on the sensitivity of our Net cash provided by operations to metal prices, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Metal Prices. Cash flows are also expected to be impacted by variations in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar, particularly with respect to the Australian dollar. Accordingly, we have entered into derivative instruments to reduce the volatility of Costs applicable to sales in Asia Pacific. For information concerning the sensitivity of our Costs applicable to sales to changes in foreign 83 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION currency exchange rates, see Results of Consolidated Operations, Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, above. For information on the sensitivity of our Net cash provided from operations to foreign currency exchange rates, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Foreign Currency. Net cash provided from operations will also be impacted in 2013 as a result of planned contributions of $80 for our post-retirement benefit programs. Based on expected attributable production of between 4.8 and 5.1 million ounces of gold and between 150 and 170 million pounds of copper in 2013, we do not anticipate reasonably expected variations in our production profile alone to influence our ability to pay our debt and other obligations in 2013. Environmental Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. We have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, $1,341 and $1,070, respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to currently, recently producing or developmental stage mineral properties, of which $62 is classified as a current liability. For more information on the Company reclamation and remediation liabilities, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we are involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former mining activities. Based upon our best estimate of our liability for these matters, $198 and $170 were accrued for such obligations at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We spent $39, $15 and $23 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, for environmental obligations related to former, primarily historic, mining activities, and have classified $20 as a current liability. Expenditures for 2012 related primarily to the Con mine in Canada which was acquired as part of the Miramar acquisition, the San Luis property in Colorado, the Mt. Leyshon property in Australia, which is a legacy Normandy site, and Resurrection, a mine site in Leadville, Colorado. Expenditures for 2011 related primarily to the Con mine, the Mt. Leyshon property in Australia, and the Dawn mill site in Washington State. Expenditures for 2010 related primarily to the Con mine in Canada, the Mt. Leyshon property in Australia, the Dawn mill site and Resurrection. For more information on the Company obligations associated with former mining activities, see Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Included in capital expenditures were $207, $172 and $118 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, to comply with environmental regulations. Ongoing costs to comply with environmental regulations have not been a significant component of Costs applicable to sales . Forward-Looking Statements The foregoing discussion and analysis, as well as certain information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby. See the discussion in Forward-Looking Statements in Item 1, Business. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 84 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION Adjusted net income Management of the Company uses Adjusted net income to evaluate the Company operating performance, and for planning and forecasting future business operations. The Company believes the use of Adjusted net income allows investors and analysts to compare results of the continuing operations of the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries relating to the production and sale of minerals to similar operating results of other mining companies, by excluding exceptional or unusual items. Management determination of the components of Adjusted net income are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts. Net income attributable to Newmont stockholders is reconciled to Adjusted net income as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Net income attributable to Newmont stockholders $ 1,809 $ 366 $ 2,277 Loss from discontinued operations 76 136 28 Restructuring and other 26 Boddington contingent consideration 8 1 1 Acquisition costs 18 PTNNT community contribution 13 Income tax benefit from internal restructuring (59 ) (65 ) (391 ) Impairments/asset sales, net (10 ) 1,714 (35 ) Adjusted net income $ 1,850 $ 2,170 $ 1,893 Adjusted net income per share, basic $ 3.73 $ 4.39 $ 3.85 Adjusted net income per share, diluted $ 3.71 $ 4.31 $ 3.79 Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are calculated by dividing the costs applicable to sales of gold and copper by gold ounces or copper pounds sold, respectively. These measures are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented on both a consolidated and attributable to Newmont basis. Attributable costs applicable to sales are based on our economic interest in production from our mines. For operations where we hold less than a 100% economic share in the production, we exclude the share of gold or copper production attributable to the noncontrolling interest. We include attributable costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound to provide management, investors and analysts with information with which to compare our performance to other gold producers. Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound statistics are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. Net attributable costs applicable to sales per ounce measures the benefit of copper produced in conjunction with gold, as a credit against the cost of producing gold. A number of other gold producers present their costs net of the contribution from copper and other non-gold sales. We believe that including a measure on this basis provides management, investors and analysts with information with which to compare our performance to other gold producers, and to better assess the overall performance of our business. In addition, this measure provides information to enable investors and analysts to understand the importance of non-gold revenues to our cost structure. 85 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION The following tables reconcile these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

These measures are calculated by subtracting the costs applicable to sales per ounce of gold and per pound of copper from the average realized gold price per ounce and copper price per pound, respectively. These measures are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented on a consolidated basis. Operating margin per ounce/pound statistics are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently.
