See ("Forward Looking Statements" and "PART II ITEM 7A. - QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS"). Our Business Overview We develop, market, sell and distribute, in the main, a wide range of branded beverages. The majority of our beverages fall within the growing "alternative" beverage category. The principal brand names under which our beverages are marketed are Hansen's(R), Monster Energy(R), Blue Sky(R), Junior Juice(R), Lost(R), Rumba(TM) and Joker Mad Energy(TM). We own all of our above-listed brand names other than Lost(R) which we produce, market, sell and distribute under an exclusive licensing arrangement with Lost International LLC. Our company principally generates revenues, income and cash flows by developing, producing, marketing, selling and distributing finished beverage products. We generally sell these products to retailers as well as distributors. We incur significant marketing expenditures to support our brands including advertising costs, athlete and event sponsorship fees and special promotional events. We focus on developing brand awareness and trial through sampling both in stores and at events. Retailers and distributors receive rebates, promotions, point of sale materials, merchandise displays and coolers. We also use in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials and racks, prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, and sponsorship of, and endorsements from selected public and extreme sports figures, events and causes. Consumers receive coupons, discounts and promotional incentives. These marketing expenditures help to enhance distribution and availability of our products as well as awareness and increase consumer preference for our brands. Greater distribution and availability, awareness and preference promotes long term growth. During 2005, we continued to expand our existing product lines and further develop our markets. In particular, we continue to focus on developing and marketing beverages that fall within the category generally described as the "alternative" beverage category, with particular emphasis on energy type drinks. We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation such as making Hansen's(R) products visually distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different, better and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores and we will continue to reevaluate the same from time to time. A substantial portion of our sales are derived from "energy drinks", particularly our Monster Energy(R) brand energy drinks. Any decrease in sales of our energy drinks, particularly our Monster Energy(R) brand energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. Competitive pressure in the "energy drink" category could adversely affect our operating results. (See "PART I ITEM 1A. - RISK FACTORS") 28 <PAGE> We again achieved record sales in 2005. The increase in gross and net sales in 2005 was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy(R) drinks, which were introduced in April 2002, including our low carbohydrate ("lo-carb") Monster Energy(R) drinks, which were introduced in 2003, our Monster Energy(R) Assault(TM) energy drinks which were introduced in September 2004, sales of Monster Energy(R) Khaos(TM) energy drinks, which were introduced in August 2005, increased sales by volume of Lost(R) energy drinks which were introduced in January 2004, and to a lesser extent, to sales of Joker Mad Energy(TM) drinks which were introduced in January 2005, as well as increased sales by volume of apple juice and juice blends, children's multi-vitamin juice drinks and Rumba(TM) energy juice, which was introduced in December 2004. The increase in gross and net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of Hansen's(R) natural sodas, Hansen's(R) energy drinks, Energade(R), and Smoothies in cans. During the year ended December 31, 2005, sales shipped outside of California represented 62% of our aggregate gross sales, as compared to 56% of our aggregate gross sales for the comparable period in 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2005, sales to distributors outside the United States amounted to $5.6 million, as compared to $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, which was less than 2% of gross sales for each period respectively. Our customers are typically retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, drug, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, full service beverage distributors, health food distributors and food service customers. Sales to our various customer types for 2005 are reflected below. The allocations below reflect changes made by the Company to the categories historically reported. Retail Grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers 19% Club stores, drug & mass merchandisers 11% Full service distributors 65% Health food distributors 3% Other 2% In 2004, we introduced a carbonated Lost(R) Energy drink in 16-ounce cans, a carbonated Monster Energy(R) Assault(TM) drink in 16-ounce cans, a new line of Blue Sky(R) natural tea sodas in 12-ounce cans, Hansen's(R) energy drinks in 16-ounce cans, Rumba(TM) Energy Juice in 15.5-once cans and also introduced a new line of lo-carb smoothies in 11.5-ounce cans. In 2005, we introduced a carbonated Joker Mad Energy(TM) drink in 16-ounce cans (regular and lo-carb) a carbonated Monster Energy(R) Khaos(TM) energy drink in 16-ounce cans, Monster Energy(R) and Lo-Carb Monster Energy(R) in 24-ounce cans, Monster Energy(R), Lo-Carb Monster Energy(R) and Monster Energy(R) Assault(TM) drinks in 8.3-ounce cans, a new line of Blue Sky(R) natural sodas with real sugar, a new line of lite Blue Sky(R) natural sodas in 12-ounce cans, a new line of non-carbonated Blue Sky(R) isotonic sports drinks in 16-ounce PET plastic bottles, as well as new juice products and Fizzit(TM) which is a line of vitamin and mineral drink mixes in powdered form. Sales of our dual-branded 100% juice line named Juice Blast(R), which was launched in conjunction with Costco and is sold through Costco stores, were $4.0 million in 2005 as compared to $2.0 million in 2004. We have and will continue to introduce new flavors from time to time in an effort to ensure that the variety pack remains fresh and different for consumers and retain and if possible increase current distribution levels. 29 <PAGE> In September 2000, HBC, through its wholly owned subsidiary Blue Sky, acquired the Blue Sky(R) natural soda business. The Blue Sky(R) natural soda brand is the leading natural soda in the health food trade. Blue Sky offers natural sodas, premium natural sodas with added ingredients such as Ginseng and anti-oxidant vitamins, organic sodas and seltzer waters in 12-ounce cans and a Blue Energy(R) drink in 8.3-ounce cans and in 2004 introduced a new line of Blue Sky(R) natural tea sodas in 12-ounce cans. In 2005, we introduced a new line of Blue Sky Lite natural sodas, a new line of Blue Sky(R) natural sodas made with real sugar and a new line of non-carbonated Blue Sky(R) isotonic sports drinks. In May 2001, HBC, through its wholly owned subsidiary Junior Juice, acquired the Junior Juice(R) beverage business. The Junior Juice(R) product line is comprised of a line of 100% juices packed in 4.23-ounce aseptic packages and is targeted at toddlers. During 2005, we entered into several new distribution agreements for the sale of our products both within and outside the United States and substantially expanded our national sales force and marketing and support staff. As discussed under "PART I ITEM 1. - BUSINESS MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTION", we anticipate that we will continue building our national sales force in 2006 as well as our marketing and support staff to support and grow the sales of our products. In 2002, we introduced a Sparkling Cider 100% juice drink in a 1.5-liter Magnum glass bottle. However, due to limited reports of some bottles breaking in 2003, we promptly recalled the product. We are pursuing a claim for the costs and losses incurred by us. We will reevaluate relaunching this product once certain production issues are resolved to our satisfaction and a suitable co-packer has been identified. During 2004, we concluded exclusive contracts with the State of California, Department of Health Services Women, Infant and Children Supplemental Nutrition Branch, to supply 100% Apple juice and 100% blended juice in 64-ounce PET plastic bottles. The contracts commenced on July 12, 2004. (See "PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTION"). We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors. Value Drivers of our Business We believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following: * Profitable Growth - We believe natural, better for you brands properly supported by marketing and innovation, targeted to a broad consumer base-drive profitable growth. We continue to broaden our family of brands. In particular, we are expanding and growing our specialty beverages and energy drinks to provide more alternatives to consumers. We are focused on maintaining or increasing profit margins. We believe that tailored brand, package, price and channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to accelerating profitable growth. * Cost Management - The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on supplies and cost reduction. One key area of focus, for example, is to decrease raw material costs, co-packing fees and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net operating revenues. Another key area of focus is the reduction in inventory levels. However, due to the expansion in the number of our products as well as increased sales levels in 2005, overall inventory levels increased. During 2005, the costs primarily of PET plastic bottles and aluminum cans, as well as the costs of high fructose corn syrup and sucrose and certain packaging and freight costs also increased. 30 <PAGE> * Efficient Capital Structure - Our capital structure is intended to optimize our costs of capital. We believe our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds at low effective cost and overall low costs of borrowing provide a competitive advantage. We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when properly implemented, will result in (1) maintaining and/or improving our gross profit margin; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) optimizing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations. Gross and net operating revenues, gross profits, operating income, and net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. In 2005, gross operating revenues totaled $415.4 million, an 85.4% increase over 2004. Net operating revenues totaled $348.9 million, an increase of 93.5% over 2004. Gross profit totaled $182.5 million in 2005, a 118.7% increase from 2004. Operating income was $103.4 million compared to $33.9 million for 2004. Net income was $62.8 million as compared to $20.4 million for 2004. Net income per diluted share was $2.59 as compared to net income per diluted share of $.86 in 2004. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2006 and beyond. See also "Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2004." In 2005, the Company had working capital of $107.1 million compared to $41.6 million as of December 31, 2004. In 2005, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $54.6 million as compared to $20.1 million in 2004. Principal uses of cash flows are purchases of inventory, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment and trademarks. Payment of our debt and accounts payable and income taxes payable are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds. (See also "PART II ITEM 7. - LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES"). Opportunities, Challenges and Risks Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the beverage industry and our company. Increase in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles represents a challenge. We recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and lo-carb beverages, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and waters and energy drinks. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality, health, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect companies that misjudge such preferences. 31 <PAGE> In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our companys future financial results include, but are not limited to: * maintenance of our brand images and product quality; * profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See also "PART I ITEM 1. - BUSINESS - COMPETITION and SALES AND MARKETING"); * restrictions on imports and sources of supply; duties or tariffs; changes in government regulations; * protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and the continuous pursuit of new and innovative trademarks for our expanding product lines; * limitations on available quantities of sucralose, a non-caloric sweetener that is used in many of our beverage products, during 2006, due to demand for such sweetener exceeding the supplier's production capacity, as well as limitations on available quantities of certain package containers such as the 24-ounce cap can and copacking availability; and * the imposition of additional restrictions. * (See also "PART I ITEM 1A. - RISK FACTORS") for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. We believe that the following opportunities exist for us: * growth potential for non-alcoholic beverage categories including energy drinks, carbonated soft drinks, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and water; * new product introductions intended to contribute to higher gross profits; * premium packages intended to generate strong revenue growth; * significant package, pricing and channel opportunities to maximize profitable growth; and * proper positioning to capture industry growth. 32 <PAGE> Results of Operations <TABLE> Percentage Change --------------------------- 2005 2004 2003 05 vs. 04 04 vs. 03 -------------------- ------------------- ------------------- ------------- ------------- <S> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C> Gross sales, net of discounts & returns * $ 415,417,282 $ 224,097,875 $ 135,655,087 85.4% 65.2% Less: Promotional and other allowances** 66,530,916 43,756,740 25,302,891 52.0% 72.9% -------------------- ------------------- ------------------- ------------- ------------- Net sales 348,886,366 180,341,135 110,352,196 93.5% 63.4% Cost of sales 166,343,118 96,874,750 66,577,168 71.7% 45.5% -------------------- ------------------- ------------------- ------------- ------------- Gross profit 182,543,248 83,466,385 43,775,028 118.7% 90.7% Gross profit margin 52.3% 46.3% 39.7% Operating Expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses 79,029,837 49,507,137 33,887,045 59.6% 46.1% Amortization of trademarks 70,102 73,046 61,888 (4.0%) 18.0% -------------------- ------------------- ------------------- ------------- ------------- Operating income 103,443,309 33,886,202 9,826,095 205.3% 244.9% Operating income as a percent of net sales 29.6% 18.8% 8.9% Net nonoperating income (expense) 1,351,272 51,995 (67,013) 2,498.8% (177.6%) -------------------- ------------------- ------------------- ------------- ------------- Income before provision for income taxes 104,794,581 33,938,197 9,759,082 208.8% 247.8% Provision for income taxes 42,018,605 13,551,393 3,828,678 210.1% 253.9% -------------------- ------------------- ------------------- ------------- ------------- Effective tax rate 40.1% 39.9% 39.2% Net income $ 62,775,976 $ 20,386,804 $ 5,930,404 207.9% 243.8% ==================== =================== =================== ============= ============= Net income as a percent of net sales 18.0% 11.3% 5.4% Net income per common share: Basic (See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements) $ 2.85 $ 0.96 $ 0.29 196.9% 231.0% Diluted (See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements) $ 2.59 $ 0.86 $ 0.28 201.2% 207.1% Case sales (in thousands) (in 192-ounce case equivalents) 48,214 29,760 20,421 62.0% 45.7% </TABLE> * Gross sales, although used internally by management as an indicator of operating performance, should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies as gross sales has been defined by the Company's internal reporting requirements. However, gross sales is used by management to monitor operating performance including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and overall Company performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. Management believes the presentation of gross sales allows a more comprehensive presentation of the Companys operating performance. Gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payment and allowances may be deducted from payments received from customers. 33 <PAGE> ** Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the disclosure thereof does not conform with GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, the presentation of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of the impact thereof on the determination of net sales and illustrates the spending levels incurred to secure such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of the marketing activities of the Company. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Gross Sales. For the year ended December 31, 2005, gross sales were $415.4 million, an increase of $191.3 million or 85.4% higher than gross sales of $224.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in gross sales is primarily attributable to increased sales of certain of our existing products and the introduction of new products as discussed below in "Net Sales". The percentage increase in gross sales was lower than the percentage increase in net sales due to a decrease in the promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales, which decreased from 19.5% for the year ended December 31, 2004 to 16.0% for the year ended December 31, 2005, although the actual amount of promotional and other allowances increased from $43.8 million to $66.5 million for the respective periods. Net Sales. For the year ended December 31, 2005, net sales were $ 348.9 million, an increase of $168.5 million or 93.5% higher than net sales of $180.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. We again achieved record sales in 2005. The increase in gross and net sales in 2005 was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy(R) drinks, which were introduced in April 2002, including our low carbohydrate ("lo-carb") Monster Energy(R) drinks, which were introduced in 2003, our Monster Energy(R) Assault(TM) energy drinks which were introduced in September 2004, sales of Monster Energy(R) Khaos(TM) energy drinks, which were introduced in August 2005, increased sales by volume of Lost(R) energy drinks which were introduced in January 2004, and to a lesser extent, to sales of Joker Mad Energy(TM) drinks which were introduced in January 2005, as well as increased sales by volume of apple juice and juice blends, and children's multi-vitamin juice drinks and Rumba(TM) which was introduced in December 2004. The increase in gross and net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of Hansen's Natural Sodas(R), Hansen's(R) energy drinks, Energade(R) and Smoothies in cans. Net sales case volumes (calculated on 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage equivalent basis) increased from 29.8 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2004 to 48.2 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of 18.4 million cases or 62.0%. The overall average net sales price per case also increased to $7.24 per case for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $6.06 for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 19.5%. The increase in the average net sales prices per case was due to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products as described below. Net sales for the DSD segment were $270.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of approximately $157.0 million or 138.8% higher than net sales of $113.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in net sales for the DSD segment was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy(R) drinks, which were introduced in April 2002, including our low carbohydrate ("lo-carb") Monster Energy(R) drinks, which were introduced in 2003, our Monster Energy(R) Assault(TM) energy drinks which were introduced in September 2004, sales of Monster Energy(R) Khaos(TM) energy drinks, which were introduced in August 2005, increased sales by volume of Lost energy drinks which were introduced in January 2004. The increase in net sales was also attributable, to a lesser extent, to sales of Joker Mad Energy(TM) drinks which were introduced in January 2005. The increase in net sales was partially offset by lower sales by volume of Hansen's(R) energy drinks and Energade(R). Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $78.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of approximately $11.3 million or 16.7% higher than net sales of $67.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in net sales for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of Hansen's(R) apple juice and juice blends, children's multi-vitamin juice drinks and RumbaTM energy juice, which was introduced in December 2004. The increase in net sales was partially offset by lower sales by volume of smoothies in cans and Hansen's(R) natural sodas. 34 <PAGE> Gross Profit. Gross profit was $182.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $99.1 million or 118.7% over the $83.5 million gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2004. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 52.3% for the year ended December 31, 2005 which was higher than gross profit as a percentage of net sales of 46.3% for the year ended December 31, 2004, due primarily to higher gross profit margins achieved on the increased sales of Monster Energy(R) and Lost(R) energy drinks. Although a greater percentage of our sales comprised products having higher gross margins than the prior year, the increase in profit margins was partially reduced by higher promotional payments and allowances to promote our products. Gross profit may not be comparable to those of other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales whereas others like Hansen's exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within another line item such as selling, general and administrative expenses. Distribution expenses, which include out-bound freight and warehousing expenses after manufacture, were $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and have been included in operating expenses. Total Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $79.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $29.5 million or 59.6% over total operating expenses of $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 22.6% for the year ended December 31, 2005, from 27.4% for the year ended December31,2004. The increase in total operating expenses was primarily attributable to increased selling, general and administrative expenses. The decrease in total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the comparatively lower increase in selling, general and administrative expenses than the increase in net sales. Selling. Selling expenses were $50.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $21.5 million or 73.7% over selling expenses of $29.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 14.6% for the year ended December 31, 2005 from 16.2% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in selling expenses was primarily attributable to increased distribution (freight) and storage expenses which increased by $9.7 million, increased expenditures for trade development activities and cooperative arrangements with our customers and distributors, which increased by $4.2 million, increased expenditures for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials, and premiums, which increased by $3.0 million, increased expenditures for sponsorships and endorsements which increased $1.7 million, increased expenditures for advertising which increased by $1.3 million, and increased expenditures for samples, which increased by $1.2 million. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses were $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $8.0 million or 39.4% over general and administrative expenses of $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 8.1% for the year ended December 31, 2005 from 11.3% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to payroll expenses which increased by $3.6 million, distributor termination payments which increased by $1.2 million and travel and entertainment expenses which increased by $682,000. Amortization of Trademarks. Amortization of trademarks was $70,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $3,000 from amortization of trademarks of $73,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in amortization of trademarks was due to a reduction in the balance of definite life trademarks. 35 <PAGE> Contribution Margin. Contribution margin represents net sales by segment less the cost of sales and operating expenses which can be directly attributed to segment net sales. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $112.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of approximately $71.8 million or 174.4% higher than contribution margin of $41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales of Monster Energy(R) brand energy drinks and Lost(R) energy drinks. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of approximately $2.4 million or 58.5% higher than contribution margin of $4.0 million for year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to increased sales of apple juice and juice blends. Operating Income. Operating income was $103.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The $69.6 million increase in operating income was primarily attributable to increased gross profits, which was partially offset by increased operating expenses. Net Nonoperating Income/(Expense). Net nonoperating income/(expense) was $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to net nonoperating income/(expense) of $52,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net nonoperating income/(expense) consists of interest income and interest and financing expense. The increase in interest income was primarily attributable to an increase in the cash balances in interest bearing accounts during the year ended December 31, 2005. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $1.4 million compared to interest income of $94,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004. Interest and financing expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $77,000 compared to $42,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in interest and financing expense was primarily attributable to an increase in capital leases entered into during 2005. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $42.0 million which was an increase of $28.4 million as compared to the provision for income taxes of $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in provision for income taxes was primarily attributable to the increase in operating income. The effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2005 was 40.1%, as compared to an effective tax rate of 39.9% for 2004. Net Income. Net income was $62.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, which was an increase of $42.4 million as compared to net income of $20.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to the $99.1 million increase in gross profit and an increase of net nonoperating income/(expense) of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 which was partially offset by increased operating expenses of $29.5 million and an increase in the provision for income taxes of $28.4 million. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2003 Gross Sales. For the year ended December 31, 2004, gross sales were $224.1 million, an increase of approximately $88.4 million or 65.2% higher than gross sales of $135.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of certain of our existing products as well as the introduction of new products as discussed below in "Net Sales". The percentage increase in gross sales was comparable to the percentage increase in net sales. The promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales increased slightly from 18.7% for the year ended December 31, 2003 to 19.5% for the year ended December 31, 2004 as well as the actual amount of promotional and other allowances, which increased from $25.3 million to $43.8 million for the respective periods. 36 <PAGE> Net Sales. For the year ended December 31, 2004, net sales were $180.3 million, an increase of approximately $70.0 million or 63.4% higher than net sales of $110.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in gross and net sales in 2004 was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of Monster Energy(R) drink, which was introduced in April 2002, including our low carbohydrate ("lo-carb") Monster Energy(R) drink which was introduced in 2003 and sales by volume of Lost energy drinks which were introduced at the beginning of 2004, as well as increased sales by volume of apple juice, juice blends, and Energade(R) energy sports drinks. Additionally, the increase in gross and net sales was attributable to the increased sales prices of and reduced allowances for smoothies in cans and natural sodas. The increase in gross and net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of Hansen's(R) energy drinks in 8.3-ounce cans, childrens multi-vitamin juice drinks, and teas, lemonades and cocktails. Net sales case volumes increased from 20.4 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2003 to 29.8 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 9.3 million cases or 45.7%. The overall average net sales price per case also increased to $6.06 per case for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $5.40 per case for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of 12.2%. The increase in the average net sales prices per case was due to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products. Net sales for the DSD segment were $113.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of approximately $63.6 million or 128.5% higher than net sales of $49.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in net sales for the DSD segment was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of Monster Energy(R) drink, which was introduced in April 2002, including our low carbohydrate ("lo-carb") Monster Energy(R) drink which was introduced in 2003 and sales by volume of Lost(R) energy drinks which were introduced at the beginning of 2004, as well as increased sales by volume of Energade(R) energy sports drinks. The increase in net sales for the DSD segment was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of Hansen's(R) energy drinks. Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $67.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of approximately $6.7 million or 11.0% higher than net sales of $60.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in net sales of the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of Hansen's(R) apple juice and juice blends. Additionally, the increase in net sales for the Warehouse segment was attributable to the increased sales prices of and reduced allowances for smoothies in cans and natural sodas. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of our childrens multi-vitamin juice drinks, and teas, lemonades and cocktails. Gross Profit. Gross profit was $83.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $39.7 million or 90.7% over the $43.8 million gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2003. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 46.3% for the year ended December 31, 2004 which was higher than gross profit as a percentage of net sales of 39.7% for the year ended December 31, 2003. Increases in gross sales volume contributed to an increase in gross profit while a change in the Companys product and customer mix and the related increase in the percentage of sales of higher margin products increased both gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales. This increase in profit margins was partially reduced by higher promotional payments and allowances to promote our products. Gross profit may not be comparable to those of other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within another line item such as selling, general and administrative expenses. Distribution expenses, which include out-bound freight and warehousing expenses after manufacture, were $12.4 million and $8.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively and have been included in operating expenses. 37 <PAGE> Total Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $15.6 million or 46.0% over total operating expenses of $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly to 27.5% for the year ended December 31, 2004, from 30.8% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in total operating expenses was primarily attributable to increased selling, general and administrative expenses. The decrease in total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the comparatively lower increase in selling, general and administrative expenses than the increase in net sales. Selling. Selling expenses were $29.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $9.1 million or 45.5% over selling expenses of $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 16.2% for the year ended December 31, 2004 from 18.2% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in selling expenses was primarily attributable to increased distribution (freight) and storage expenses after manufacture, which increased by $4.1 million, increased expenditures for trade development activities and cooperative arrangements with our customers and distributors, which increased by $2.1 million, and increased expenditures for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials, and premiums, which increased by $2.0 million General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses were $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $6.5 million or 47.0% over general and administrative expenses of $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2004 from 12.5% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to payroll expenses which increased by $3.3 million, professional services, consisting of legal, consulting and accounting services primarily related to the implementation and testing required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and legal services related to protecting trademarks which increased by $1.5 million, and travel and entertainment expenses which increased by $622,000. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of approximately $26.3 million or 176.6% higher than contribution margin of $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in contribution margin for the DSD division was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales of Monster Energy(R) brand energy drinks and Lost(R) energy drinks. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of approximately $1.6 million or 66.7% higher than contribution margin of $2.4 million for year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to increased sales of Hansen's(R) apple juice and juice blends. Amortization of Trademark License and Trademarks. Amortization of trademark license and trademarks was $73,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $11,000 over amortization of trademark license and trademarks of $62,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in amortization of trademark license and trademarks was due to the acquisition of trademarks during the year ended December 31, 2004. Operating Income. Operating income was $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $24.1 million. The increase in operating income and operating income as a percentage of net sales was attributable to higher gross profit as well as gross profit increasing at a higher rate than the increase in operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. Net Nonoperating Income/(Expense). Net nonoperating income was $52,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to net nonoperating expense of $67,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net nonoperating income/(expense) consists of interest income and interest and financing expense. The increase in interest income was primarily attributable to an increase in the cash invested in interest bearing accounts during the year ended December 31, 2004. Interest and financing expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $42,000 compared to $73,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease in interest and financing expense was primarily attributable to the decrease in outstanding loan balances and lower interest rates. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $94,000, compared to interest income of $6,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. 38 <PAGE> Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $13.6 million which was an increase of $9.7 million as compared to the provision for income taxes of $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in provision for income taxes was primarily attributable to the increase in operating income. The effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2004 was 39.9%, which was higher than the effective tax rate of 39.2% for 2003 due to the increase in the statutory federal income tax rate applicable to the Company's pre-tax income. Net Income. Net income was $20.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, which was an increase of $14.5 million as compared to net income of $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to the $39.7 million increase in gross profit and decrease in nonoperating expense and increase in nonoperating income of $119,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004 which was partially offset by increased operating expenses of $15.6 million and an increase in the provision for income taxes of $9.7 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows from operating activities - Net cash provided by operating activities was $54.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $20.1 million in the comparable period in 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned including adjustments for certain non-cash expenses. In 2005, cash provided by operating activities was reduced due to increases in accounts receivable which was attributable to increased sales volumes as well as increased sales to certain classes of customers who have different payment terms, increases in inventories required to meet increased sales levels and the increases in prepaid income taxes. Increases in inventory levels are the direct result of increases in purchasing, which contributed to the increased balances of accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment, acquisition of trademarks, payments of accounts payable and income taxes payable are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash. Cash flows from investing activities - Net cash provided by investing activities was $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $18.8 million in the comparable period in 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005, cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases, maturities and sales of short-term investments, and to a minor extent, the sale-leaseback of certain vans and promotional vehicles and the sale of certain property and equipment that was no longer operational. For both periods, cash used in investing activities included the acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of computer and office equipment used for sales and administrative activities, vans and promotional vehicles and other equipment to support the marketing and promotional activities of the Company and also for additions to trademark. Management expects that it will continue to use portion of its cash in excess of its requirements for operations, to purchase short-term investments and for other corporate purposes. Management, from time to time, considers the acquisition of capital equipment, particularly, specific items of production equipment required to produce certain of our products, storage racks, merchandise display racks, vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other promotional equipment and businesses compatible with the image of the Companys brands, as well as the introduction of new product lines. Cash flows from financing activities - Net cash used in financing activities was $113,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1.3 million in the comparable period in 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005, cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds received from the issuance of common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options which was partially offset by principal payments of long-term debt. The increase in payments on long-term debt as compared to the comparable period in 2004 related to lease payments made on vehicle leases entered into over the past year. 39 <PAGE> Debt and other obligations - HBC has a credit facility from Comerica Bank ("Comerica"), consisting of a revolving line of credit. Such revolving line of credit is secured by substantially all of HBCs assets, including accounts receivable, inventory, trademarks and certain equipment. In accordance with the provisions of the credit facility, HBC can borrow up to $7.8 million under its revolving line of credit. The revolving line of credit remains in full force and effect through June 1, 2007. Interest on borrowings under the line of credit is based on Comericas base (prime) rate minus up to 1.5% or varying LIBOR rates up to 180 days plus an additional percentage of up to 1.5%, depending upon certain financial ratios maintained by HBC. The Company had no outstanding borrowings on the line of credit at December 31, 2005. The terms of the Companys line of credit contain certain financial covenants including certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with its covenants at December 31, 2005. If any event of default shall occur for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary, Comerica may declare all or any portion outstanding on the line of credit immediately due and payable, exercise rights and remedies available to secured parties under the Uniform Commercial Code, institute legal proceedings to foreclose upon the lien and security interest granted or for the sale of any or all collateral. Noncancelable contractual obligations include our obligations under our agreement with the Las Vegas Monorail Company and other commitments. (See also PART II ITEM 8 - NOTE 8, COMMITMENTS & CONTINGENCIES). Purchase commitments include obligations made by the Company and its subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the manufacturing and packaging of our products. These obligations vary in terms. The following represents a summary of the Company's contractual obligations and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2005: <TABLE> Payments due by period - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Obligations Total Less than 1-3 3-5 More than 5 1 year years years years - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <S> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C> Noncancelable contracts $ 3,265,595 $ 2,870,595 $ 395,000 $ - $ - Long-Term Debt 109,864 109,864 Capital Lease 415,480 405,357 10,123 Operating Lease 5,110,157 1,289,343 3,154,166 666,648 Purchase Commitments 11,699,072 7,437,967 4,261,105 -------------- ------------- -------------- -------------- --------------- $ 20,600,168 $ 12,113,126 $ 7,820,394 $ 666,648 $ - ============== ============= ============== ============== =============== </TABLE> In addition to the above obligations, pursuant to a can supply agreement between the Company and Rexam Beverage Can Company ("Rexam") dated as of January 1, 2006, the Company has undertaken to purchase a minimum volume of 24-ounce resealable aluminum beverage cans over the four year period commencing from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2009. Should the Company fail to purchase the minimum volume, the Company will be obligated to reimburse Rexam for certain capital reimbursements on a pro rated basis. The Company's maximum liability under this agreement is $4.3 million subject to compliance by Rexam with a number of conditions under this agreement. 40 <PAGE> Management believes that cash available from operations, including cash resources and the revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, debt servicing, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as any purchases of capital assets or equipment for at least the next twelve months. Based on the Company's current plans, at this time the Company estimates that capital expenditures are likely to be less than $5 million through December 2006. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate. Accounting Policies and Pronouncements Critical Accounting Policies The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements including various allowances and reserves for accounts receivable and inventories, the estimated lives of long-lived assets and trademarks as well as claims and contingencies arising out of litigation or other transactions that occur in the normal course of business. The following summarize the most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices of the Company: Trademarks - Trademarks primarily represent the Companys exclusive ownership of the Hansen's(R) trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages and water and non-beverage products and the Monster Energy(R) trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of supplements and beverages. The Company also owns in its own right, a number of other trademarks in the United States as well as in a number of countries around the world. The Company also owns the Blue Sky(R) trademark, which was acquired in September 2000, and the Junior Juice(R) trademark, which was acquired in May 2001. During 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under the provisions on SFAS No. 142, the Company discontinued amortization on indefinite-lived trademarks while continuing to amortize remaining trademarks over one to 20 years. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we evaluate our trademarks annually for impairment or earlier if there is an indication of impairment. If there is an indication of impairment of identified intangible assets not subject to amortization, management compares the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized to write down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is less than the carrying amount. The fair value is calculated using the income approach. However, preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management's best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. Based on managements quarterly impairment analysis performed, the estimated fair values of trademarks exceeded the carrying value. Long-Lived Assets - Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment of property and equipment or amortizable intangible assets, then management prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated at the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management's estimates of the business risks. No impairments were identified during 2005, however, during 2004, management recognized an impairment to property and equipment as discussed in Note 1 of the attached financial statements. 41 <PAGE> Management believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of its long lived assets, including its trademarks, is a "critical accounting estimate" because: (1) it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to make assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as net income, could be material. Managements assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgment because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so. In estimating future revenues, we use internal budgets. Internal budgets are developed based on recent revenue data and future marketing plans for existing product lines and planned timing of future introductions of new products and their impact on our future cash flows. Revenue Recognition - The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or reasonably determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Management believes an adequate provision against net sales has been made for estimated returns, allowances and cash discounts based on the Company's historical experience. Net Sales - Net sales consist of sales recorded at the time the related products are shipped and the risk of ownership and title have passed, less allowances for returns, spoilage, discounts and promotional allowances recorded in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 01-9. Cost of Sales - Cost of sales consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of our products, co-packing fees, in-bound freight charges as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of the Company's finished products and certain quality control costs. Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, ingredients and packaging materials. Operating Expenses - Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport our products to our customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, expenses including advertising, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, material costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include general and administrative costs such as payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees, depreciation and other general and administrative costs. Distribution expenses, which include out-bound freight and warehousing expenses after manufacture, were $22.1 million, $12.4 million and $8.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 respectively. Advertising and Promotional Allowances - The Company accounts for advertising production costs by expensing such production costs the first time the related advertising takes place. In addition, the Company supports its customers with promotional allowances, a portion of which is utilized for marketing and indirect advertising by them. In certain instances, a portion of the promotional allowances payable to customers based on the levels of sales to such customers, promotion requirements or expected use of the allowances, are estimated by the Company. If the level of sales, promotion requirements or use of the allowances are different from such estimates, the promotional allowances could, to the extent based on estimates, require adjustments. The Company presents advertising and promotional allowances in accordance with the provisions of EITF No. 01-9. 42 <PAGE> Accounts Receivable - The Company evaluates the collectibility of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on the Companys recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. The Company regularly reviews its inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the Company's estimated forecast of product demand and/or its ability to sell the product(s) concerned and production requirements. Demand for the Company's products can fluctuate significantly. Factors which could affect demand for the Company's products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences, general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction in the rate of reorders placed by customers and/or continued weakening of economic conditions. Additionally, management's estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate, which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. Income Taxes - Current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year. A deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The Company considers future taxable income and ongoing, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of its deferred tax assets. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized, the Company will reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value, thereby decreasing net income. Evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on the Company's judgment. If the Company subsequently determined that the deferred tax assets, which had been written down, would be realized in the future, the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased, thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made. See Note 9 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Newly Issued Accounting Pronouncements Information regarding newly issued accounting pronouncements is contained in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2005, which note is incorporated herein by this reference. Sales The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. * Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A "unit case" means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings) or concentrate sold that will yield 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage. Unit case volume of the Company means number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of beverages directly or indirectly sold by the Company. Sales of food bars and cereals, which have been discontinued and are not material, are expressed in actual cases. The Company's quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. Because the primary historical market for Hansens products is California, which has a year-long temperate climate, the effect of seasonal fluctuations on quarterly results may have been mitigated; however, such fluctuations may be more pronounced as the distribution of Hansen's products expands outside of California. The Companys experience with its energy drink products, suggests that they are less seasonal than traditional beverages. As the percentage of the Companys sales that are represented by such products continues to increase, seasonal fluctuations will be further mitigated. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of the sales of its finished products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses.

Forward Looking Statements The Private Security Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the "Act") provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. Certain statements made in this report may constitute forward looking statements (within the meaning of Section 27.A of the Securities Act 1933, as amended, and Section 21.E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, adequacy of funds from operations and our existing credit facility, among other things. All statements which address operating performance, events or developments that management expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future including statements related to new products, volume growth, revenues, profitability, adequacy of funds from operations, and/or the Company's existing credit facility, earnings per share growth, statements expressing general optimism about future operating results and non historical information, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Act. Without limiting the foregoing, the words "believes", "thinks", "anticipates", "plans", "expects", and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. 44 <PAGE> Management cautions that these statements are qualified by their terms and/or important factors, many of which are outside our control, involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from the statements made including, but not limited to, those described in "PART I ITEM 1A. - RISK FACTORS" and other risks detailed from time to time in the Company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such factors are not exhaustive. Our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws.
