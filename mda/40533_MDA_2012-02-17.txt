ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For an overview of our business groups, including a discussion of products and services provided, see the Business discussion contained in Part I, Item 1, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT The nation engagement in combating threats to U.S. national security around the world, coupled with the need to equip and modernize U.S. military forces, drives Department of Defense (DoD) funding requirements. As a defense contractor, our financial performance is impacted by the allocation and prioritization of U.S. defense spending. Procurement and research and development (R&D) budgets, also known as investment accounts, provide the majority of our U.S. defense revenues. For fiscal year (FY) 2012, the DoD received funding of $531 billion, including approximately $177 billion for procurement and R&D. This funding was approximately $22 billion less than the President FY 2012 request due to the Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011. The BCA, which became law in August 2011, has two primary parts. The first mandates a $487 billion reduction to previously-planned defense spending over the next decade. The second part is a sequester mechanism that would impose an additional $500 billion of cuts on defense funding between FY 2013 and FY 2021 if the Congress does not identify a means to reduce the U.S. deficit by $1.2 trillion. As of February 17, 2012, the Congress has not identified these required savings. If the Congress does not identify the required reduction, defense spending would likely sustain further cuts. For FY 2013, the President has requested total defense funding of $525 billion, including $168 billion for investment accounts. In accordance with the first part of the BCA, the DoD five-year spending plan submitted with the FY 2013 funding request incorporates $259 billion of cuts when compared with the previous five-year plan. However, the spending plan does not include the impact of sequestration, the second part of the BCA. Despite these additional cuts, investment accounts are projected to display modest growth throughout the five-year period, with procurement funding for mature programs growing and R&D funding for development programs declining over the period. Budget expenditures lag congressional funding, with appropriated money generally awarded over several years. A series of continuing resolutions over the past year has resulted in a protracted customer acquisition cycle that negatively impacted the flow of contract awards, particularly in our shorter-cycle Information Systems and Technology business group. The threat of further defense spending cuts and the potential for a fourth-quarter 2012 continuing resolution due to budget approval delays may further impact contract awards. While the U.S. budget deficit will continue to influence government spending decisions, we expect defense funding requirements to continue to be driven by the following: support for the warfighter in the face of threats posed by an uncertain global security environment, including the DoD increased emphasis on the Asia-Pacific region; the number of troops deployed globally, coupled with the overall size of the U.S. military; the need to reset and replenish equipment and supplies damaged and consumed in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001; and the need to modernize defense infrastructure to address the evolving requirements of modern-day warfare. With these budget uncertainties, the long-term success of our U.S. defense business is enhanced by the relevance of our programs to the military funding priorities, the diversity of our programs and customers within the budget, our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs, our ability to evolve our products to address a fast-changing threat environment, and our proven track record of successful contract execution. In addition, the continuing tenuous geopolitical landscape requires governments around the world to fund weapons and equipment modernization programs, leading to diverse defense opportunities. We continue to pursue opportunities presented by international demand for military equipment and information technologies from our indigenous international operations and through exports from our U.S. businesses. While the revenue potential can be significant, international defense budgets are subject to unpredictable issues of contract award timing, changing priorities and overall spending pressures. As we broaden the customer base for our defense products around the world, we expect our international sales and exports to grow. In our Aerospace group, business-jet market conditions showed further improvement in 2011, particularly in the large-cabin market. The group benefitted from increased flying hours across the installed base, improved new-aircraft order interest and declining customer contract defaults. Continued investment in new aircraft products is expected to drive Aerospace long-term growth, particularly as the group remains on track to deliver its newest aircraft offerings, the G280 and the G650, in mid-2012. Similarly, we believe that General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 19 Table of Contents aircraft-service revenues provide the group diversified exposure to aftermarket sales fueled by continued growth in the global installed business-jet fleet. We are committed to creating shareholder value through innovative product development, disciplined program execution and continuous improvement initiatives. Our performance is measured in our sustained revenue growth, solid earnings and margins and efficient conversion of earnings into cash. Our record of excellent cash-flow conversion has enabled us to execute our operational strategy while providing us the flexibility to deploy our capital to further enhance shareholder returns through acquisitions, payment of dividends and share repurchases. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION We recognize the majority of our revenues using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. The following paragraphs explain how this method is applied in recognizing revenues and operating costs in the Aerospace and defense business groups. An understanding of these methods is important to the evaluation of our operating results. In the Aerospace group, sales contracts for new aircraft have two major phases: the manufacture of the green aircraft and the aircraft outfitting, which includes exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors. We record revenues on these contracts at two milestones: when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer, and when the customer accepts final delivery of the outfitted aircraft. Revenues in the Aerospace group other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) completions and service businesses are recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of the service. Changes in revenues result from the number and mix of new aircraft deliveries (green and outfitted), progress on aircraft completions and the level of service activity during the period. The majority of the group operating costs relate to new aircraft production for firm orders and consist of labor, material and overhead costs. The costs are accumulated in production lots and recognized as operating costs at green aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot. Thus, the level of operating costs reported in a given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered. To a much lesser extent, the level of operating costs is impacted by changes in the estimated average unit cost for a production lot. Operating costs in the Aerospace group other OEMs completions and services businesses are generally recognized as incurred. For new aircraft, operating earnings and margins in the Aerospace group are a function of the prices of our aircraft, our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft and the mix of aircraft deliveries between the higher-margin large-cabin and lower-margin mid-cabin aircraft. Additional factors affecting the group earnings and margins include the volume and profitability of completions and services work performed, the amount and type of pre-owned aircraft sold and the level of general and administrative (G&A) costs incurred by the group, which also include selling expenses and R&D costs. In the defense groups, revenue on long-term government contracts is recognized as work progresses, either as products are produced or as services are rendered. As a result, changes in revenues are discussed generally in terms of volume, typically measured by the level of activity on individual contracts. Year-over-year variances attributed to volume indicate increases or decreases in revenues due to changes in production or service levels and delivery schedules. Operating costs for the defense groups consist of labor, material, subcontractor and overhead costs and are generally recognized as incurred. Variances in costs recognized from period to period primarily reflect increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual contracts and, therefore, result largely from the same factors that drive variances in revenues. Operating earnings and margins in the defense groups are driven by changes in volume, performance or contract mix. Performance refers to changes in profitability during the period of performance based on revisions to estimates at completion on individual contracts. These revisions result from increases or decreases to the estimated contract value or the estimated costs required to complete the contract. Therefore, changes in costs incurred in the period do not necessarily impact profitability. It is only when total estimated costs at completion change that profitability may be impacted. Contract mix refers to changes in the volume of higher- vs. lower-margin work on individual contracts and when aggregated across the contract portfolio. On an individual contract, higher or lower margins can be inherent in the contract type (e.g., fixed-price/cost-reimbursable) or type of work (e.g., development/production).

Revenues increased in the Aerospace group, primarily driven by initial green deliveries of the new G650 aircraft. This increase was partially offset by lower revenues in the Information Systems and Technology group tactical communication systems business, specifically on ruggedized computing products. Operating earnings declined in 2011, resulting in a 50-basis-point decrease in margins. While operating margins were up in each of the defense businesses, operating margins decreased in the completions business for other OEMs in our Aerospace group. The decrease was caused by the impairment of an intangible asset and losses on narrow- and wide-body completions projects. Product Revenues and Operating Costs Year Ended December 31 2010 2011 Variance Revenues $ 21,723 $ 21,440 $ (283 ) (1.3 )% Operating costs 17,359 17,230 (129 ) (0.7 )% Product revenues were lower in 2011 compared with 2010. The decrease in product revenues consisted of the following: Tactical communication products $ (447) Ship construction (279) Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions 548 Other, net (105) Total decrease $ (283) In 2011, tactical communication products revenues decreased, particularly on ruggedized computing products, driven by order delays stemming from recent Congressional continuing resolutions and a protracted customer acquisition cycle. Revenues were also down on several ship construction programs, most significantly on the DDG-1000 and DDG-51 destroyer programs due to award delays and on the commercial product-carrier program, which was completed in 2010. Offsetting these decreases were higher aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions revenues due to initial green deliveries of the new G650 aircraft. Product operating costs were lower in 2011 compared with 2010. The decrease in product operating costs consisted of the following: Tactical communication products $ (425) Ship construction (299) Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions 654 Other, net (59) Total decrease $ (129) The primary driver of the changes in product operating costs in 2011 was volume. In addition, aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions operating costs increased in our other OEMs completions business due to $150 of cost growth and penalties associated with delivery delays on several narrow- and wide-body completions projects and a $111 impairment of the contract and program intangible asset. Service Revenues and Operating Costs Year Ended December 31 2010 2011 Variance Revenues $ 10,743 $ 11,237 $ 494 4.6 % Operating costs 9,198 9,591 393 4.3 % Service revenues increased in 2011 compared with 2010. The increase in service revenues consisted of the following: Information technology (IT) services $ 322 Aircraft services 181 Other, net (9) Total increase $ 494 In 2011, growth on IT support and modernization programs for the DoD and the intelligence community, coupled with the acquisition of Vangent, Inc., resulted in higher IT services revenues. The growing global installed base of business-jet aircraft and increased flying hours across the installed base resulted in higher aircraft services revenues. Service operating costs increased in 2011 compared with 2010. The increase in service operating costs consisted of the following: IT services $ 281 Aircraft services 172 Other, net (60) Total increase $ 393 Service operating costs increased in 2011 due primarily to increased activity levels. In addition, the acquisition of Vangent, Inc., resulted in higher IT services operating costs. General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 21 Table of Contents REVIEW OF 2009 VS. 2010 Year Ended December 31 2009 2010 Variance Revenues $ 31,981 $ 32,466 $ 485 1.5 % Operating costs and expenses 28,306 28,521 215 0.8 % Operating earnings 3,675 3,945 270 7.3 % Operating margin 11.5 % 12.2 % In 2010, our revenues and operating costs were up due to higher volume on aircraft services in our Aerospace group, U.S. Navy ship programs in our Marine Systems group and tactical communication systems and IT services in our Information Systems and Technology group, partially offset by lower U.S. military vehicle revenues in our Combat Systems group. Growth in operating earnings significantly outpaced revenue growth in 2010, resulting in a 70-basis-point increase in operating margins. While each of our business groups reported earnings growth, performance was particularly strong in the Aerospace and Combat Systems groups. Product Revenues and Operating Costs Year Ended December 31 2009 2010 Variance Revenues $ 21,977 $ 21,723 $ (254 ) (1.2 )% Operating costs 17,808 17,359 (449 ) (2.5 )% Product revenues decreased in 2010 compared with 2009. The decrease in product revenues consisted of the following: U.S. military vehicles $ (700) Tactical communication products 421 Other, net 25 Total decrease $ (254) In 2010, U.S. military vehicle product revenues decreased due to lower Mine-Resistant, Ambush-Protected (MRAP) vehicle production and reduced activity on vehicle development programs. The increase in tactical communication products was driven by higher volume on the Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T) program and several ruggedized computing products. Product operating costs were lower in 2010 compared with 2009. The decrease in product operating costs consisted of the following: U.S. military vehicles $ (695) Tactical communication products 369 Pre-owned aircraft (57) Other, net (66) Total decrease $ (449) The primary driver of the changes in product operating costs in 2010 was volume. In addition, pre-owned aircraft operating costs decreased due to $30 of write-downs on the carrying value of inventory in 2009. Service Revenues and Operating Costs Year Ended December 31 2009 2010 Variance Revenues $ 10,004 $ 10,743 $ 739 7.4 % Operating costs 8,544 9,198 654 7.7 % Service revenues increased in 2010 compared with 2009. The increase in service revenues consisted of the following: IT services $ 397 Ship engineering and repair 199 Aircraft services 139 Other, net 4 Total increase $ 739 In 2010, IT services revenues increased due to higher volume on IT support and modernization programs for the intelligence community. Ship engineering and repair revenues increased, primarily on the U.S. Navy next-generation ballistic-missile submarine (SSBN(X)) program. Recovery in the business-jet market resulted in growth in aircraft services activity in 2010. Service operating costs increased in 2010 compared with 2009. The increase in service operating costs consisted of the following: IT services $ 363 Ship engineering and repair 185 Aircraft services 101 Other, net 5 Total increase $ 654 The drivers of increased service operating costs in 2010 were primarily due to increased activity levels on IT, ship engineering and repair and aircraft services. OTHER INFORMATION G&A Expenses As a percentage of revenues, G&A expenses were 6.1 percent in 2009, 6 percent in 2010 and 6.2 percent in 2011. G&A expenses as a percentage of revenues increased slightly in 2011 primarily due to higher ongoing R&D efforts in our Aerospace group. We expect G&A in 2012 to be approximately 6 percent of revenues. 22 General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Interest Expense Net interest expense was $160 in 2009, $157 in 2010 and $141 in 2011. The decrease in 2011 was largely due to the repayment of fixed-rate notes of $700 in the third quarter of 2010 and $750 in the third quarter of 2011, partially offset by interest expense associated with the $1.5 billion of fixed-rate notes issued in July 2011. We expect full-year 2012 net interest expense to be approximately $155 to $160, subject to capital deployment activities during the year. Other Income In 2011, other income consisted primarily of a $38 pretax gain from the sale of the detection systems portion of the weapons systems business in our Combat Systems group, partially offset by $17 of transaction-related costs associated with our 2011 business acquisitions. For further discussion of acquisition and divestiture activity, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective Tax Rate Our effective tax rate was 31.5 percent in 2009, 30.7 percent in 2010 and 31.4 percent in 2011. The increase in 2011 was primarily due to lower income from international operations in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. We anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 32 percent in 2012, an increase from recent years largely due to the expiration of the R&D tax credit that Congress has not yet extended for 2012. For additional discussion of tax matters, see Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Discontinued Operations In 2010, we completed the sale of our nitrocellulose operation in Spain. The operating results of this business are presented as discontinued operations, net of income taxes, in 2009 and 2010. In 2011, we recognized a $13 loss, net of taxes, from the settlement of an environmental matter associated with a former operation of the company. We also increased our estimate of continued legal costs associated with the A-12 litigation as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court decision that extended the expected timeline associated with the litigation, resulting in a $13 loss, net of taxes. See Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the A-12 litigation, which has been ongoing since 1991. REVIEW OF BUSINESS GROUPS Following is a discussion of operating results and outlook for each of our business groups. For the Aerospace group, results are analyzed with respect to specific lines of products and services, consistent with how the group is managed. For the defense groups, the discussion is based on the types of products and services each group offers with a supplemental discussion of specific contracts and programs when significant to a group results. Additional information regarding our business groups can be found in Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements. AEROSPACE Review of 2010 vs. 2011 Year Ended December 31 2010 2011 Variance Revenues $ 5,299 $ 5,998 $ 699 13.2 % Operating earnings 860 729 (131 ) (15.2 )% Operating margin 16.2 % 12.2 % Gulfstream aircraft deliveries (in units): Green 99 107 8 8.1 % Outfitted 89 99 10 11.2 % The Aerospace group revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase consisted of the following: Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions $ 531 Aircraft services 198 Pre-owned aircraft (30) Total increase $ 699 Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions revenues include Gulfstream business-jet aircraft as well as completions of aircraft produced by other OEMs. Gulfstream aircraft manufacturing and outfitting revenues increased in 2011 due to additional large-cabin green and outfitted deliveries, primarily initial green deliveries of the first 12 G650 aircraft in the fourth quarter. Offsetting this increase were lower completions revenues as a result of manufacturing delays on narrow- and wide-body commercial aircraft contracts and continued lower volume in business-jet aircraft manufactured by other OEMs. Aircraft services revenues, which include maintenance and repair work, fixed-base operations and aircraft management services, increased 15 percent in 2011, reflecting the growing global installed base and increased flying hours of business-jet aircraft. Revenues from sales of pre-owned aircraft were down slightly from 2010, and the group ended 2011 with no pre-owned aircraft in inventory. The group operating earnings decreased in 2011. The decrease consisted of the following: Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions $ (43) Aircraft services Pre-owned aircraft 2 Selling, general and administrative/other (90) Total decrease $ (131) General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 23 Table of Contents Earnings from the manufacture and outfitting of Gulfstream aircraft increased approximately $240, or more than 20 percent, in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to initial green deliveries of the G650 aircraft. Earnings from other OEMs completions at Jet Aviation were down approximately $170 in 2011 primarily as a result of cost growth and penalties associated with delivery delays on several narrow- and wide-body completions projects, including $78 of contract losses in the fourth quarter. As a result of losses and lower revenues on other OEMs business-jet aircraft, we reviewed the related long-lived assets of the completions business in the fourth quarter of 2011 and recognized a $111 impairment charge on the contract and program intangible asset. We believe that major initiatives to reduce overhead and increase production efficiency undertaken by management beginning in 2011 will stabilize performance in the completions business in 2012. Despite the increase in revenues, aircraft services earnings were steady in 2011 due to competitive market pricing and an unfavorable mix of service work. Jet Aviation aircraft services earnings were also negatively impacted by the strength of the Swiss franc as compared to the broader market. The group operating earnings in 2011 were negatively impacted by higher R&D expenses and selling expenses associated with increased order activity. As a result of the factors discussed above, the group overall operating margins decreased 400 basis points in 2011 compared with 2010. The impact on the group operating margins from the impairment charge was 180 basis points. Review of 2009 vs. 2010 Year Ended December 31 2009 2010 Variance Revenues $ 5,171 $ 5,299 $ 128 2.5 % Operating earnings 707 860 153 21.6 % Operating margin 13.7 % 16.2 % Gulfstream aircraft deliveries (in units): Green 94 99 5 5.3 % Outfitted 110 89 (21 ) (19.1 )% The Aerospace group revenues increased in 2010 primarily due to steady growth in aircraft services activity throughout the year. Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions work remained consistent with 2009 levels, as an increase in manufacturing volume was offset by reduced completions. Revenues from sales of pre-owned aircraft were down slightly from 2009. The group operating earnings improved in 2010 compared with 2009 across the group portfolio. Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions earnings increased primarily due to higher volume. Pre-owned aircraft earnings were up due to improved pricing in the pre-owned market and the absence of write-downs of pre-owned aircraft inventory that occurred in 2009. Aircraft services earnings increased consistent with the higher volume. Operating earnings in 2010 were also favorably impacted by lower R&D expenditures. Overall, the group operating margins increased 250 basis points compared with 2009. 2012 Outlook We expect an increase of approximately 15 percent in the group revenues in 2012 compared with 2011. The increase is due to additional green deliveries and initial outfitted deliveries of the G650. We expect the Aerospace group margins to be approximately 15 percent, up from 2011 due to improved performance in our other OEMs completions business. COMBAT SYSTEMS Review of 2010 vs. 2011 Year Ended December 31 2010 2011 Variance Revenues $ 8,878 $ 8,827 $ (51 ) (0.6 )% Operating earnings 1,275 1,283 8 0.6 % Operating margin 14.4 % 14.5 % The Combat Systems group revenues were down slightly in 2011 compared with 2010. The decrease in the group revenues consisted of the following: U.S. military vehicles $ (188) Weapons systems and munitions 19 European military vehicles 118 Total decrease $ (51) In the group U.S. military vehicle business, volume was down due to less refurbishment and upgrade work for the Abrams main battle tank, fewer survivability enhancement kits for the Stryker wheeled combat vehicle and a decline in activity on the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) program as the system design and development neared completion. Increased volume on the group contracts to provide light armored vehicles (LAVs) for several international customers partially offset these decreases. Revenues were up slightly in the group weapons systems and munitions businesses. Increased sales of axles in the commercial and military markets were partially offset by the timing of munitions deliveries to the Canadian government and the sale of the detection systems business in the second quarter of 2011. Revenues in the group European military vehicles business increased in 2011 largely due to higher volume of Duro and EAGLE wheeled vehicles to a variety of European customers, including the Swiss and German governments. Offsetting this increase was lower activity on the group Pandur and Piranha vehicle contracts for various international customers. The group operating earnings and margins were up slightly in 2011, following a 130-basis-point margin improvement in 2010. The 10-basis-point increase in 2011 was primarily due to higher profitability on several major programs in our U.S. military vehicles business. 24 General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Review of 2009 vs. 2010 Year Ended December 31 2009 2010 Variance Revenues $ 9,645 $ 8,878 $ (767 ) (8.0 )% Operating earnings 1,262 1,275 13 1.0 % Operating margin 13.1 % 14.4 % In 2010, the Combat Systems group revenues decreased compared with 2009 due to reduced volume in the group U.S. and European military vehicles businesses. In the group U.S. military vehicles business, lower MRAP vehicle production and reduced engineering work, primarily related to the 2009 cancellation of the manned ground vehicle portion of the Future Combat Systems (FCS) program, represented the majority of the decline in revenues. Revenues in the group European military vehicles business decreased due to the ramp-down of the Leopard tank program for the Spanish government and lower activity on the group Pandur and Piranha contracts. Despite the decline in revenues, the Combat Systems group operating earnings increased slightly in 2010, resulting in a 130-basis-point increase in operating margins compared with 2009. Productivity improvements across the group, particularly in the U.S. military vehicles business, and a favorable contract mix that included reduced engineering and development work resulted in significant margin expansion. 2012 Outlook We expect the Combat Systems group revenues to decrease to approximately $8.5 billion in 2012. A reduction in our U.S. military vehicles business primarily due to lower volume on the Stryker and MRAP programs will be partially offset by growth in international vehicle contracts and revenues from the December 2011 acquisition of Force Protection, Inc. We expect the group operating margins to approximate 2011 in the low- to mid-14 percent range. MARINE SYSTEMS Review of 2010 vs. 2011 Year Ended December 31 2010 2011 Variance Revenues $ 6,677 $ 6,631 $ (46 ) (0.7 )% Operating earnings 674 691 17 2.5 % Operating margin 10.1 % 10.4 % The Marine Systems group revenues decreased in 2011 compared with 2010. The decrease in revenues consisted of the following: Navy ship construction $ (153) Other Navy ship design, engineering and repair 230 Commercial ship construction (123) Total decrease $ (46) The group U.S. Navy ship-construction programs include Virginia-class submarines, DDG-1000 and DDG-51 destroyers, and T-AKE combat-logistics and Mobile Landing Platform (MLP) auxiliary support ships. Revenues were down slightly in 2011 on the Virginia-class submarine program from timing of construction activity as we transitioned from the Block II to the Block III contract. In 2011, the group delivered the eighth boat while construction continued on the next six boats. Deliveries of the remaining 10 boats under contract are scheduled through 2018. In our surface combatant business, the group received an award for construction of the second and third ships in the DDG-1000 destroyer program in the third quarter of 2011. Due to a delay in the award, revenues were down on the program in 2011. Deliveries of the three DDG-1000 ships under contract are scheduled for 2014, 2015 and 2018. On the DDG-51 program, volume was also lower as the legacy multi-ship contract neared completion with the remaining destroyer scheduled for delivery in 2012. In the third quarter of 2011, in connection with the Navy restart of the DDG-51 program, the group was awarded a construction contract for a DDG-51 destroyer scheduled for delivery in 2016 and won a competitively awarded option for an additional destroyer. Volume increased on the MLP program in 2011 as the group commenced construction on the first ship of the three-ship program. The first ship is scheduled for delivery in 2013. In 2011, the group also received a construction contract for the second ship and long-lead funding for the third ship. Activity on the group T-AKE program was down in 2011 as the group delivered the 11 th and 12 th ships in the program. The final two ships are scheduled for completion in 2012. While Navy ship-construction revenues were down from 2010, revenues were up in 2011 on engineering and repair programs for the Navy. Volume increased in 2011 on the group engineering work associated with the SSBN(X). The group currently is performing initial concept studies, including design of a Common Missile Compartment for the U.S. Navy and the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom, and reactor-plant planning yard services. The group repair work increased in 2011 following significant growth in 2010, particularly on surface-ship repair programs. This growth was aided by the 2011 acquisition of Metro Machine Corp., a surface-ship repair operation located in Norfolk, Virginia. This addition, coupled with our existing capabilities, enables us to deliver maintenance and repair services to the Atlantic and Pacific fleets. In 2010, the group completed construction of a five-ship commercial product-carrier program, resulting in a decrease in commercial shipbuilding revenues in 2011. Given the success of this program, the age of Jones Act ships and other factors, we anticipate additional commercial shipbuilding opportunities. Despite the decrease in revenues, the Marine Systems group operating earnings were up in 2011 compared with 2010, resulting in a 30-basis-point increase in operating margins. On the T-AKE contract, a modification negotiated during the year and favorable cost performance resulted in revisions in contract estimates that contributed 70 basis points to the General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 25 Table of Contents group 2011 operating margin expansion. This operating margin growth was offset by the absence of commercial ship construction revenues and operating margin compression as we transition to several new shipbuilding contracts and lower-margin service and design work increases. Review of 2009 vs. 2010 Year Ended December 31 2009 2010 Variance Revenues $ 6,363 $ 6,677 $ 314 4.9 % Operating earnings 642 674 32 5.0 % Operating margin 10.1 % 10.1 % Revenues in the Marine Systems group were up in 2010 primarily due to increased activity on the Virginia-class program as the group continued to ramp toward construction of two submarines per year and higher volume on the group SSBN(X) engineering program. Lower activity on the DDG-51 and T-AKE programs and the completion of the five-ship commercial product-carrier program slightly offset other volume increases in the group in 2010. The Marine Systems group operating earnings increased in 2010 consistent with the increase in revenues as favorable performance on the T-AKE and commercial product-carrier programs offset a shift in program mix to new shipbuilding contracts and design work. 2012 Outlook We expect the Marine Systems group revenues in 2012 to decrease slightly from 2011 due to the timing of several ship-construction programs, with operating margins approximating 2011 in the low- to mid-10 percent range. INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY Review of 2010 vs. 2011 Year Ended December 31 2010 2011 Variance Revenues $ 11,612 $ 11,221 $ (391) (3.4 )% Operating earnings 1,219 1,200 (19) (1.6 )% Operating margin 10.5 % 10.7 % The Information Systems and Technology group revenues decreased in 2011 compared with 2010. The decrease in revenues consisted of the following: Tactical communication systems $ (623) Information technology (IT) services 339 Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) systems (107) Total decrease $ (391) Revenues in the tactical communication systems business were impacted unfavorably by recent continuing resolutions and a protracted customer acquisition cycle that slowed orders. This resulted in lower revenues in 2011 on ruggedized computing products, including the Common Hardware/Software III (CHS-3) program, and other products with shorter-term delivery timeframes. Additionally, revenues on the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Project (MHP) were down in 2011 as the group transitioned from production to the training and support phase of the program. Revenues were up in the group United Kingdom-based operation due to higher volume on the initial phase of the U.K. Ministry of Defence Specialist Vehicle (SV) program. In the IT services business, volume increased on the group support and modernization programs for the intelligence community and the Departments of Defense (DoD) and Homeland Security, including the St. Elizabeths campus, New Campus East, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and Mark Center infrastructure programs. Revenues also increased in this business as a result of the acquisition of Vangent, Inc., in the fourth quarter of 2011. Revenues were down in 2011 compared with 2010 in the group ISR business as a result of the sale of a satellite facility in 2010 and lower optical products volume. The Information Systems and Technology group operating earnings decreased in 2011, although at a lower rate than revenues, resulting in a 20-basis-point increase in margins compared with 2010. Higher margins in our tactical communication systems business were in part due to $95 of overhead reduction initiatives, but were largely offset by growth in our lower-margin IT services business. Review of 2009 vs. 2010 Year Ended December 31 2009 2010 Variance Revenues $ 10,802 $ 11,612 $ 810 7.5 % Operating earnings 1,151 1,219 68 5.9 % Operating margin 10.7 % 10.5 % The Information Systems and Technology group generated revenue growth in each of the group markets in 2010, with over 5 percent organic growth. Revenues increased on the WIN-T program and ruggedized computing products in the group tactical communication systems business. In the IT services business, higher volume on several IT support and modernization programs for the intelligence community accounted for the increase in revenues. The 2009 acquisition of Axsys Technologies, Inc., and growing levels of cyber security-related work contributed to the growth in the group ISR business. Operating earnings increased in 2010, although at a slightly lower rate than revenues, resulting in a modest decrease in operating margins compared with 2009. The reduction in operating margins resulted from a shift in the group contract mix to include a growing proportion of IT services work. 26 General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents 2012 Outlook We expect 2012 revenues in the Information Systems and Technology group to be consistent with 2011 as growth in the IT services business, driven by the acquisition of Vangent, Inc., is offset by continued revenue pressure in our tactical communication systems business. The group operating margins are expected to decline to the high-9 percent range due to the impact of continued revenue growth in our lower-margin IT services business. CORPORATE Corporate operating expenses totaled $87 in 2009, $83 in 2010 and $77 in 2011. Corporate results primarily consist of compensation expense for stock options. See Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our stock options. We expect 2012 Corporate operating expenses of approximately $80. BACKLOG AND ESTIMATED POTENTIAL CONTRACT VALUE Our total backlog, including funded and unfunded portions, was $57.4 billion at the end of 2011 compared with $59.6 billion at year-end 2010. Strong orders on major programs across our defense groups resulted in a book-to-bill ratio (orders divided by revenues) slightly higher than 2010, while our Aerospace group generated a book-to-bill ratio greater than one-to-one. Our backlog also increased nearly $1.8 billion due to our 2011 acquisitions. Our backlog does not include work awarded under unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts or unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts, which we refer to collectively as estimated potential contract value. Customers use IDIQ contracts for several reasons, including expanding the field of available contractors to maximize competition under a given program or when they have not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed. The estimated contract value includes multiple-award IDIQ contracts in which we are one of several companies competing for task orders as well as contracts where we have been designated as the sole-source supplier. We include our estimate of the remaining value we will receive under these arrangements. Contract options in our defense businesses represent agreements to perform additional work at the election of the customer. These options are negotiated in conjunction with a firm contract and provide the terms under which the customer may procure additional units or services at a future date. Contract options in the Aerospace group represent options to purchase new aircraft and long-term agreements with fleet customers. We recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order. On December 31, 2011, the estimated potential contract value associated with these IDIQ contracts and contract options was approximately $28 billion, up significantly from $21.8 billion at the end of 2010. This represents our estimate of the potential value we will receive. The actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower. The estimated potential contract value increased in 2011 in our Marine Systems and Information Systems and Technology groups largely due to the DDG-51 option and Common Hardware Systems-4 (CHS-4) IDIQ contract awards. The acquisition of Vangent, Inc., in 2011 also added approximately $1.2 billion to the Information Systems and Technology group estimated potential contract value. We expect to realize this value primarily over the next several years, reflecting continued demand for our products and services well into the future. AEROSPACE Aerospace funded backlog represents aircraft orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer. Funded backlog includes the group newest aircraft models, the G650 and the G280, which are expected to receive full type certification and enter service in mid-2012. Aerospace unfunded backlog consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services. The Aerospace group finished 2011 with a total backlog of $17.9 billion, up slightly from $17.8 billion at year-end 2010. In 2011, the group booked the highest number of orders for new aircraft since the introduction of the G650 in 2008. Customer defaults were down more than 15 percent from 2010. We balance aircraft production rates with customer demand to maximize profitability and level-load production over time. This has enabled us to maintain an 18- to 24-month period between customer order and delivery of legacy large-cabin aircraft, while the G650 has accumulated approximately five years of backlog prior to initial deliveries. Although we expect order activity to remain strong and customer defaults to remain at low levels, backlog will likely decrease over the next several years as we deliver on our G650 backlog and the time period between customer order and delivery of the aircraft normalizes. Over the past few years, the group customer base has become increasingly diverse in customer type and geographic region. Approximately two-thirds of the group year-end backlog is composed of private companies and individual buyers. While the installed base of aircraft is predominately in North America, international customers represent nearly 65 percent of the group backlog. Approximately 70 percent of the group orders in 2011 were from international customers, with significant growth in orders from the Asia-Pacific region. In 2011, Gulfstream received an $810 order from Minsheng General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 27 Table of Contents Financial Leasing, the Chinese financial leasing company of Minsheng Bank, for the purchase of 20 Gulfstream aircraft across the product portfolio over several years. In 2011, a fleet customer informed us of its intent not to purchase 40 large-cabin aircraft. We removed these aircraft from the group estimated potential contract value with no impact to annual scheduled deliveries. At year end, there were no options to purchase new aircraft or long-term agreements with fleet customers included in estimated potential contract value. DEFENSE GROUPS The total backlog for our defense groups represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts. The funded portion of the defense backlog includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the Congress and funded by the customer, as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments. While there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program, we have included in backlog only firm contracts we believe are likely to receive funding. Total backlog in our defense groups decreased 5 percent in 2011 to $39.5 billion at the end of the year, compared with $41.7 billion at the end of 2010. Over 70 percent of the decline during 2011 was in our Marine Systems group, which continued work on large, multi-year construction contracts awarded in prior periods. COMBAT SYSTEMS Combat Systems total backlog was $11.4 billion at the end of 2011, down slightly from $11.8 billion at year-end 2010. The group backlog primarily consists of long-term production contracts. The Army Stryker wheeled combat vehicle program represented $1.5 billion of the group backlog at year end with vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2014. The group received over $1.4 billion of Stryker orders in 2011, including awards for production of 292 double-V-hulled vehicles and 100 Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicles, and contractor logistics support and engineering services. The group backlog at year end included $1.1 billion for M1 Abrams main battle tank modernization and upgrade programs. In 2011, the group received awards totaling $380 for all Abrams-related programs. The group continued work on a multi-year contract awarded in 2008 to upgrade M1A1 Abrams tanks to the M1A2 System Enhancement Package (SEP) configuration. The group Abrams backlog at year end included $330 for the SEP program. Abrams backlog also includes $200 for Tank Urban Survivability Kits (TUSK), which increase the tank utility and crew survivability in urban warfare environments, and $310 for production of M1A1 Abrams tank kits for the Egyptian Land Forces under the Egyptian tank co-production program. The group backlog at year end also included $400 for the Technology Development phase of the Army Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program and $280 under the MRAP program, largely for upgrade kits for previously-delivered vehicles. The acquisition of Force Protection, Inc., in 2011 added $660 to the group backlog, including $200 for the Buffalo mine clearance vehicle and $185 for the smaller Ocelot light patrol vehicle. The Combat Systems group has several significant international military vehicle production contracts in backlog. The backlog at the end of the year included: $1.5 billion for LAVs under several foreign military sales (FMS) contracts; $915 for the upgrade and modernization of 550 LAV III combat vehicles for the Canadian Army; $470 for the production of Pizarro Advanced Infantry Fighting Vehicles scheduled for delivery to the Spanish Army through 2016; $425 for Pandur vehicles for several international customers; $315 for Merkava Armored Personnel Carrier (APC) hulls and material kit sets for the Israeli Ministry of Defense; $150 for the design, integration and production of seven prototypes under the U.K. Specialist Vehicle program, in addition to the integration work being performed by the Information Systems and Technology group; $85 for a contract with the German government to provide EAGLE IV wheeled military vehicles; and $75 from the Swiss government to provide Duro wheeled armored personnel vehicles. The Combat Systems group backlog at year end also included $2.7 billion in weapons systems and munitions programs. In 2011, the group received awards totaling $630 for axles in the military and commercial markets and $305 for the production of Hydra-70 rockets. The group also received awards worth $335 from the Canadian government to supply various calibers of ammunition and $190 from the Marine Corps for ammunition for the Expeditionary Fire Support System. Combat Systems backlog does not include $3.5 billion of estimated potential contract value associated with the group anticipated share of IDIQ contracts and unexercised options. The group estimated potential contract value decreased approximately 25 percent since year-end 2010 28 General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents largely due to funding under IDIQ contracts and options that were then transferred to backlog, including the Hydra-70 rocket program. MARINE SYSTEMS The Marine Systems group backlog consists of long-term submarine and ship construction programs, as well as numerous engineering and repair contracts. The group generally receives large contract awards that provide backlog for several years. For example, in 2008, the group received a $14 billion contract for the construction of eight Virginia-class submarines to be delivered through 2018, increasing backlog to an all-time high of $26.4 billion at the end of 2008. Consistent with this historical pattern, as the group has performed on these multi-year contracts, the backlog has decreased to $18.5 billion at year-end 2011 compared to $20.1 billion at the end of 2010. While backlog decreased in our submarine business, backlog increased in both of our surface shipyards from major contract awards in 2011. The Virginia-class submarine program was the company largest program in 2011 and is the largest contract in the group backlog. The group backlog at year end included $11 billion for ten Virginia-class submarines. As the prime contractor on the Virginia-class program, we report the entire backlog and revenues associated with the program but share the construction activity and the earnings with our teaming partner. Plans published by the Navy include a request for proposals in 2012 for nine submarines under a fourth block of the program. Navy destroyer programs represent another significant component of the group backlog. These include the Arleigh Burke-class DDG-51 and Zumwalt-class DDG-1000 destroyer programs. In 2011, the group received approximately $1.6 billion in orders under the DDG-1000 program, bringing the value in backlog to $1.8 billion for the construction of three ships, including two awarded in 2011, and continued engineering and support services. At year end, the backlog also included $620 for DDG-51 destroyers. The final destroyer under the Navy legacy multi-ship contract is scheduled for delivery in 2012. Additionally, in connection with the Navy restart of the DDG-51 program, the group was awarded in 2011 a construction contract for a DDG-51 destroyer and won a competitively awarded option for an additional destroyer. The Marine Systems group backlog at year end included $660 for the MLP program. In 2011, the group was awarded construction contracts for the first two ships in the program and long-lead funding for the third ship. The year-end backlog also included approximately $315 for the last two ships under the Navy T-AKE combat-logistics ship program and $160 for the group second ship under the Navy Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program, scheduled for delivery in 2012. In addition, the Marine Systems group backlog at year end included approximately $3.9 billion for engineering, repair, overhaul and other services. This includes $2.3 billion in design and engineering efforts for the SSBN(X). The group received several significant contract awards in 2011 totaling $645 to continue development work. Additionally, the acquisition of Metro Machine Corp. in 2011 added $485 to the group backlog for maintenance and repair services to be performed in Norfolk, Virginia. The group also received a $35 award in 2011 for the outfitting of the San Antonio-class amphibious assault dock ship (LPD) USS San Diego, with an option for work on two additional ships. INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY The Information Systems and Technology group total backlog was $9.6 billion at the end of 2011, down slightly from $9.8 billion at year-end 2010. Backlog was impacted in part by award delays stemming from recent continuing resolutions. The group backlog does not include approximately $22.4 billion of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of IDIQ contracts and unexercised options. In 2011, funding under IDIQ contracts and options contributed over $3.9 billion to the group backlog, or over 35 percent of the group orders. The estimated potential contract value in the Information Systems and Technology group increased nearly 50 percent from year-end 2010, most notably due to the $3.7 billion CHS-4 contract award and the acquisition of Vangent, Inc., that added $1.2 billion. When combined, the group backlog and estimated potential contract value increased by 28 percent over 2010 to $32 billion. General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 29 Table of Contents Unlike our other defense businesses, the Information Systems and Technology group backlog consists of thousands of contracts and has to be reconstituted each year with new program and task order awards. Nonetheless, there are several significant contracts that provide a solid foundation for the business. Programs for the U.K. Ministry of Defence comprised $670 of the group backlog at the end of 2011. Work continued in 2011 on the demonstration phase of the Ministry of Defence Specialist Vehicle program. In this phase, the group will manage the design, integration and production of seven prototype vehicles. Work and the backlog under the contract are shared with the Combat Systems group, including a significant portion of the future vehicle production effort. The group has successfully fielded the Bowman communications system, the secure digital voice and data communications system for the U.K. armed forces, and is now performing maintenance and long-term support and enhancement activities for the program. The group backlog at year-end 2011 included approximately $330 for the Army WIN-T program. Information Systems and Technology is the prime contractor on this battlefield communications network. In 2011, the group received approximately $370 of awards for WIN-T. The backlog does not include $795 of estimated potential contract value for the WIN-T program awarded under an IDIQ contract. The Information Systems and Technology group backlog at year end also included $150 for the CHS-3 program to provide commercial and ruggedized computers, network equipment and software to the U.S. armed forces and other U.S. federal agencies. In 2011, the group received $250 in orders under this program, bringing the total contract value to more than $2.6 billion. The group also received an IDIQ contract award for the next phase of the program, CHS-4. The group backlog at the end of 2011 included approximately $755 for a number of support and modernization programs for the intelligence community and the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security, including the St. Elizabeths campus, New Campus East, NETCENTS and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center infrastructure programs. In addition to these programs, the group received a number of significant contract awards in 2011, including the following: $95 for production and support of U.S. and U.K. Trident II submarine weapons systems. The contract has a maximum value of $225 if all options are exercised. $95 for the Warfighter Field Operations Customer Support (FOCUS) program to provide support for the Army live, virtual and constructive training operations. $90 from Austal USA for combat and seaframe control systems for the next LCS, bringing the value in backlog to $225. Options to provide these systems for eight additional ships will be recognized as orders as they are exercised. $65 under the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) program for development of the Navy next-generation tactical satellite communication system. $55 for the production of over 6,000 radios under the Army Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Handheld, Manpack and Small Form Fit (HMS) program. Information Systems and Technology was awarded several significant IDIQ contracts during 2011, including the following: An award from the Army for ruggedized computing equipment under the CHS-4 program. The program has a maximum potential value of $3.7 billion over ten years. An award from the U.S. Air Force under the Global Broadcast Service (GBS) program for the production of Transportable Ground Receive Suites (TGRS) and delivery of retrofit kits for previously delivered systems. The program has a maximum potential value of $900 over five years. One of two awards from AT&T for the installation of generators at approximately 7,000 cellular sites. The program has a maximum potential value of $1 billion between both awardees over four years. One of three awards from the Army to provide information systems engineering and IT support services to the Army Information Systems Engineering Command (ISEC). The program has a maximum potential value of close to $900 among awardees over five years. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We place a strong emphasis on cash flow generation. This focus has afforded us the financial flexibility to deploy our cash resources to generate shareholder value while preserving a strong balance sheet to position us for future opportunities. In 2011, cash flows from operations exceeded net earnings for the 13 th consecutive year. The $9.1 billion of cash generated by operating activities over the past three years was deployed to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures, repurchase our common stock, pay dividends and repay maturing debt. Our net debt, defined as debt less cash and equivalents and marketable securities, was $1 billion at year-end 2011, up by $655 from $378 at the end of 2010 largely due to the issuance of fixed-rate notes in 2011 and continued capital deployment activities. Our cash balances are invested primarily in time deposits from highly rated banks, commercial paper rated A1/P1 or higher and short-term repurchase agreements with direct obligations of the Spanish government as collateral. Our marketable securities balances are invested primarily in term deposits and high-quality corporate, municipal and U.S. government-sponsored debt securities. The marketable securities have an average duration of one year and an average credit rating of AA-. We have not incurred any material losses associated with these investments. On December 31, 2011, $635 of our cash was held by international operations and is therefore not immediately available to fund domestic operations unless the cash is repatriated. While we do not intend to do so, should this amount be repatriated, it would be subject to U.S. federal income tax but would generate partially offsetting foreign tax credits. 30 General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31 2009 2010 2011 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,855 $ 2,986 $ 3,238 Net cash used by investing activities (1,392 ) (408 ) (1,974 ) Net cash used by financing activities (806 ) (2,226 ) (1,201 ) Net cash used by discontinued operations (15 ) (2 ) (27 ) Net increase in cash and equivalents 642 350 36 Cash and equivalents at beginning of year 1,621 2,263 2,613 Cash and equivalents at end of year 2,263 2,613 2,649 Marketable securities 360 212 248 Short- and long-term debt (3,864 ) (3,203 ) (3,930 ) Net debt (a) $ (1,241 ) $ (378 ) $ (1,033 ) Debt-to-equity (b) 31.1 % 24.1 % 29.7 % Debt-to-capital (c) 23.7 % 19.4 % 22.9 % (a) Net debt is calculated as total debt less cash and equivalents and marketable securities. (b) Debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total equity. (c) Debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus total equity. We expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short- and long-term liquidity needs. We believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy. The following is a discussion of our major operating, investing and financing activities for each of the past three years, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. OPERATING ACTIVITIES We generated cash from operating activities of $2.9 billion in 2009, $3 billion in 2010 and $3.2 billion in 2011. In all three years, the operating cash flow was attributed primarily to net earnings. In 2011, operating cash flow also benefitted from customer deposits due upon receipt of provisional type certification of the G650. Cash from operating activities reflects contributions to our pension plans, which have grown in recent years from $300 in 2009 to $350 in 2011, with contributions of $500 expected in 2012. Termination of A-12 Program. As discussed further in Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements, litigation on the A-12 program termination has been ongoing since 1991. If, contrary to our expectations, the default termination ultimately is sustained and the government prevails on its recovery theories, we, along with The Boeing Company, could collectively be required to repay the U.S. government as much as $1.4 billion for progress payments received for the A-12 contract, plus interest, which was approximately $1.6 billion on December 31, 2011. If this were the outcome, we would owe half of the total, or approximately $1.5 billion pretax. Our after-tax cash obligation would be approximately $735. We believe we have sufficient resources, including access to capital markets, to pay such an obligation, if required. INVESTING ACTIVITIES We used $1.4 billion in 2009, $408 in 2010 and $2 billion in 2011 for investing activities. The primary uses of cash in investing activities were business acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities. Investing activities also include proceeds received from the sale of assets and marketable securities. Business Acquisitions. In 2009, we completed two acquisitions for $811. In 2010, we completed three acquisitions for $233. In 2011, we completed six acquisitions for $1.6 billion. We used cash on hand to fund these acquisitions. See Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of acquisition activity. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures were $385 in 2009, $370 in 2010 and $458 in 2011. The increase in 2011 compared with 2009 and 2010 is due largely to Gulfstream $500, seven-year Savannah, Georgia, facilities expansion project announced in 2010. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $600 in 2012, or 2 percent of anticipated revenues, as work on Gulfstream facilities project increases. Marketable Securities. As a result of lower market interest rates, we expanded our investment strategy several years ago to take advantage of the additional return generated by available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities. Net purchases of these securities were $235 in 2009 compared with net proceeds of $115 in 2010 and net purchases of $49 in 2011. Other, Net. Investing activities also included proceeds from the sale of a satellite facility in our Information Systems and Technology group in 2010 and the detection systems portion of the weapons systems business in the Combat Systems group in 2011. FINANCING ACTIVITIES We used $806 in 2009, $2.2 billion in 2010 and $1.2 billion in 2011 for financing activities. Our financing activities include issuances and repayments of debt, payment of dividends and repurchases of common stock. Net cash from financing activities also includes proceeds received from stock option exercises. Debt Proceeds, Net. In 2009, we issued $750 of two-year fixed-rate notes. In 2011, we issued $1.5 billion of fixed-rate notes in $500 increments due in January 2015, July 2016 and July 2021. We used the proceeds from these fixed-rate notes in part to repay the $750 of fixed-rate notes issued in 2009. In August 2010, we repaid $700 of fixed-rate notes. We have no material repayments of long-term debt expected until 2013. See Note J to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our debt obligations, including scheduled debt maturities. We ended 2011 with no commercial paper outstanding. We have $2 billion in bank credit facilities that remain available. These facilities provide backup liquidity to our commercial paper program. We also have an effective shelf registration on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 31 Table of Contents Dividends. Our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.47 per share on March 2, 2011, the 14 th consecutive annual increase. The board had previously approved a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share in March 2010 and $0.38 per share in March 2009. Share Repurchases. Our board of directors has historically supported management tactical repurchase of our shares, typically in repurchase authorizations of 10-million-share increments. We repurchased 3.6 million shares on the open market in 2009, 18.9 million shares in 2010 and 20 million shares in 2011. As a result, we reduced our shares outstanding by 4.2 percent in 2011 and nearly 8 percent since 2009. On October 5, 2011, with no shares remaining under a prior authorization, the board authorized management to repurchase up to 10 million shares, about 3 percent of our total shares outstanding. NON-GAAP MANAGEMENT METRICS We emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns. As described below, we use free cash flow and return on invested capital (ROIC) to measure our ability to efficiently convert net earnings into cash and earn a return on the deployment of that capital. Free Cash Flow. We define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors, because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our operations for purposes such as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends. We use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management. Over the past five years, we have generated free cash flow from operations in excess of our earnings from continuing operations during the period at an average 107 percent conversion rate. The following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Year Ended December 31 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,952 $ 3,124 $ 2,855 $ 2,986 $ 3,238 Capital expenditures (474 ) (490 ) (385 ) (370 ) (458 ) Free cash flow from operations $ 2,478 $ 2,634 $ 2,470 $ 2,616 $ 2,780 Cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations: Net cash provided by operating activities 142 % 126 % 119 % 114 % 127 % Free cash flow from operations 119 % 106 % 103 % 100 % 109 % Return on Invested Capital. We believe ROIC is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations. We use ROIC to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management. We define ROIC as net operating profit after taxes divided by the sum of the average debt and shareholders equity for the year. Net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus after-tax interest and amortization expense. Over the past five years, our ROIC has averaged 17.4 percent. ROIC is calculated as follows: Year Ended December 31 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Earnings from continuing operations $ 2,080 $ 2,478 $ 2,407 $ 2,628 $ 2,552 After-tax interest expense 89 91 117 116 106 After-tax amortization expense 99 100 149 155 163 Net operating profit after taxes $ 2,268 $ 2,669 $ 2,673 $ 2,899 $ 2,821 Average debt and equity $ 13,430 $ 14,390 $ 15,003 $ 16,587 $ 17,123 Return on invested capital 16.9 % 18.5 % 17.8 % 17.5 % 16.5 % 32 General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS On December 31, 2011, other than operating leases, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantees; retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities; derivative instruments indexed to our stock and classified in shareholders equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; or variable interests in entities that provide us with financing, liquidity, market-risk or credit-risk support or engage with us in leasing, hedging or research and development services.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including most pervasively those related to various assumptions and projections for our long-term contracts and programs. Other significant estimates include those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, workers compensation, warranty obligations, pre-owned aircraft inventory, and commitments and contingencies. We make our best estimates on historical and current experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates. We believe that our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented. We believe the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application: Revenue Recognition. We account for revenues and earnings using the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method, contract revenue and profit are recognized as work progresses, either as products are produced or as services are rendered. We determine progress using either input measures General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 33 Table of Contents (e.g., costs incurred) or output measures (e.g., contract milestones or units delivered), as appropriate to the circumstances. An input measure is used unless an output measure is identified that is reliably determinable and representative of progress toward completion. We estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and the total estimated costs of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract. If at any time the estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract, we recognize the loss in the quarter it is identified. We generally measure progress toward completion on contracts in our defense businesses based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion (input measure). For our contracts for the manufacture of business-jet aircraft we record revenue at two contractual milestones: when green aircraft are delivered to, and accepted by, the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft (output measure). We do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless (1) a contract has been executed with the customer and (2) the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract, as evidenced by the receipt of significant deposits from the customer and other factors. Accounting for long-term contracts and programs involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenues and costs. Contract estimates are based on various assumptions that utilize the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers, program and operations managers and finance and accounting personnel to project the outcome of future events. These events often span several years, including labor productivity and availability; the complexity of the work to be performed; the cost and availability of materials; the performance of subcontractors; and the availability and timing of funding from the customer. We include in our contract estimates claims against the customer for changes in specifications or other disputes when the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. In evaluating these criteria, we consider the contractual/legal basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim. We include award or incentive fees in the estimated contract value when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee. Estimates of award or incentive fees are based on historical award experience and anticipated performance. These estimates are based on our best judgment at the time. As a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts, we review our performance monthly and update our contract estimates at least annually and often quarterly as well as when required by specific events or circumstances. We recognize changes in estimated profit on contracts under the reallocation method. Under the reallocation method, the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term. We use this method because we believe the majority of factors that typically result in changes in estimates on our long-term contracts affect the period in which the change is identified and future periods. These changes generally reflect our current expectations as to future performance and, therefore, the reallocation method is the method that best matches our profits to the periods in which they are earned. Alternatively, most government contractors recognize the impact of a change in estimated profit immediately under the cumulative catch-up method. As a result, the impact on operating earnings in the period the change is identified is generally lower under the reallocation method as compared to the cumulative catch-up method. The net increase in our operating earnings from the quarterly impact of revisions in contract estimates totaled $350 in 2010 and $410 in 2011, reflecting favorable operational performance across our contract portfolio. Other than revisions discussed in the Aerospace and Marine Systems business groups results of operations, no revisions on any one contract were material. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Since 1995, we have acquired over 60 businesses at a total cost of approximately $22 billion, including six in 2011. In connection with these acquisitions, we have recognized $13.6 billion and $1.8 billion of goodwill and intangible assets, respectively. Goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit. The test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process that requires a significant level of estimation by management, particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units. These estimates require the use of judgment. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations. This requires numerous assumptions, including the timing of work embedded in our backlog, our performance and profitability under our contracts, our success in securing future business and the appropriate interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows. This discounted cash flow analysis is corroborated by top-down analyses, including a market assessment of our enterprise value. We have recorded no goodwill impairment to date nor do we anticipate any reasonably possible circumstances that would lead to impairment in the foreseeable future. The fair value of each of our reporting units on December 31, 2011, exceeded its carrying value under the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test. We review intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Impairment losses, where identified, are determined as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the long-lived asset. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of projected undiscounted cash flows. We recorded an impairment loss in 2011 related to our completions business as discussed in the Aerospace group results of operations. Commitments and Contingencies. We are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either from the ordinary course of our business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment. We record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is 34 General Dynamics Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable. The ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known. Deferred Contract Costs. Certain costs incurred in the performance of our government contracts are recorded under GAAP but are not allocable currently to contracts. Such costs include a portion of our estimated workers compensation obligations, other insurance-related assessments, pension and other post-retirement benefits, and environmental expenses. These costs will become allocable to contracts generally after they are paid. We have elected to defer (or inventory) these costs in contracts in process until they can be allocated to contracts. We expect to recover these costs through ongoing business, including existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts. Our business base includes numerous contracts for which we are the sole source or one of two suppliers on long-term defense programs. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs under our current and probable follow-on contracts. This assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs, the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity. These estimates are based on our best judgment. If the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected. Retirement Plans. Our defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on a series of assumptions and estimates. The key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected long-term rates of return on plan assets. We determine the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period. We determine the long-term rate of return on assets based on consideration of historical and forward-looking returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy. These estimates are based on our best judgment, including consideration of current and future market conditions. In the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted, pension and post-retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease. For the impact of hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for our commercial pension and post-retirement benefit plans, see Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As discussed under Deferred Contract Costs, our contractual arrangements with the U.S. government provide for the recovery of benefit costs for our government retirement plans. We have elected to defer recognition of the benefit costs that cannot currently be allocated to contracts to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses. Accordingly, the impact on the retirement benefit cost for these plans that results from annual changes in assumptions does not impact our earnings either positively or negatively.
