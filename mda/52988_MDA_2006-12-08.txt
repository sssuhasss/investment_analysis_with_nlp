Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The purpose of this Management Discussion and Analysis ( MD&A ) is to provide an overview of the Company financial condition and results of operations as well as an analysis of the factors that caused certain key elements of our financial statements to change from one year to the next. In this MD&A, we use certain terms and abbreviations that are defined as follows: APB Accounting Principles Board Backlog Backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us. Our policy with respect to O&M contracts, however, is to include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for one succeeding year, regardless of the remaining life of the contract. For national government programs (other than U.S. federal O&M contracts), our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award, whether funded or unfunded, and exclude option periods. SG&A expenses From the Consolidated Statements of Earnings; SG&A expenses means selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating profit From the Consolidated Statements of Earnings; operating profit means revenues, less direct costs of contracts and SG&A expenses. SFAS Statement of Financial Accounting Standards; an accounting standard adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ). Overview Net earnings in fiscal 2006 increased by 49.6% as compared to last year, and EPS (diluted) grew by 46.0%. We continued to see increased revenues from clients operating in many of the industry groups and markets we serve, but in particular, oil & gas and refining; chemicals and polymers; and pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. Also contributing to the increase in revenues was a 74.6% increase in pass-through costs. When we are responsible for subcontract labor or third-party materials and equipment, we reflect the costs of such items in both revenues and costs. Since pass-through costs (which are incurred primarily on projects requiring field services) typically do not have significant margins, it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in revenues without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit. Our cash balances increased by 81.0% during fiscal 2006. Cash and cash equivalents increased from $239.8 million at September 30, 2005 to $434.1 million at September 30, 2006. Our net cash (defined as cash and cash equivalents less bank debt) increased from $143.9 million at September 30, 2005 to $341.9 million at September 30, 2006. Additions to property and equipment used $54.0 million of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2006 as compared to $43.9 million last year. Our cash balances, combined with a borrowing capacity of $290.0 million under our long-term, unsecured revolving credit facility, provide sufficient capital resources for us to fund our on-going operations. Critical Accounting Policies In order to understand better the changes that may occur to key elements of our financial condition and operating results, a reader of this MD&A should endeavor to understand the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements. Page 25 Table of Contents The consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business entity performing long-term engineering and construction-type contracts requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect both the entity results of operations as well as the carrying values of its assets and liabilities. Although our significant accounting polices are described in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the following discussion is intended to describe those accounting policies most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Accounting for Contracts and Use of Joint Ventures In accounting for long-term engineering and construction-type contracts, we follow the provisions of the AICPA Statement of Position 81-1 Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts . In general, we recognize revenues at the time we provide services. Depending on the commercial terms of the contract, we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred, or using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion. This method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress. In making such estimates, judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule, the cost of materials and labor, and productivity; and the impact of change orders, liability claims, contract disputes, and achievement of contractual performance standards. Many of our engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee. In some of the markets we serve there is an increasing trend towards cost-reimbursable contracts with incentive-fee arrangements. In certain instances, we base our incentive fees on achievement of target completion dates, target costs, and/or other performance criteria. Failure to meet these targets or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or non-recoverable costs, which could exceed revenues recognized from the project. One such incentive-fee contract is with the DOE for the Fernald Closure Project. This contract provides for incentive fees based on schedule and cost. In addition, the terms of the contract stipulate that the incentive fees may not be fully billed to the DOE until the completion of the project, currently estimated to occur in fiscal 2007. At September 30, 2006 we had recognized $40.0 million of deferred fees relating to this contract-completion. We provide for contract losses in their entirety in the period they become known, without regard to the percentage of completion. The nature of our business sometimes results in clients, subcontractors or vendors presenting claims against us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur, or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible. Similarly, and in the normal course of business, we may present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible. In those situations where a claim against us may result in additional costs to the contract, we would include in the total estimated costs of the contract (and therefore, the estimated amount of margin to be earned under the contract) an estimate, based on all relevant facts and circumstances available, of the additional costs to be incurred. In those situations where we have incurred additional costs for which we believe the client is contractually responsible, we may present a claim to the client for such costs. In such situations, we include in revenues the amount of costs incurred, without profit, to the extent it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue, and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated. Costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in revenues using substantially the same criteria used for claims. Certain cost-reimbursable contracts with government customers as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment. In this situation, revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon Page 26 Table of Contents completion of the contracts. In those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs not allowable under the terms of the contract, we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly. As is common in the industry, we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures. For certain of these joint ventures (i.e., where we have an undivided interest in the assets and liabilities of the venture), we recognize our proportionate share of joint venture revenues, costs and operating profit in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For other investments in engineering and construction joint ventures, we use the equity method of accounting. Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and Others Effective October 1, 2005, we began accounting for stock issued to employees and outside directors under SFAS No. 123R Share-Based Payment. SFAS 123R supersedes APB 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and requires that we measure the value of services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The computed fair value is recognized as a non-cash cost over the period the employee provides services. We adopted SFAS 123R under the modified retrospective application method. Accordingly, we have adjusted our prior financial statements to include the amounts we reported previously in the pro forma disclosures made in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123 Stock-Based Compensation . We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to compute the grant date fair value of the award. The Black-Scholes model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions in order to compute the hypothetical, fair value of an option. Changes in these assumptions can cause drastically different values being assigned to a stock option. The value assigned to any stock options that may be awarded in the future as well as the related expense associated with any such awards will be dependent on the assumptions used. The following table compares the effects of SFAS 123R on net earnings and earnings per share for the years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 (in thousands, except per-share information): 2006 2005 2004 Earnings before taxes: As reported $ 305,287 $ 209,476 $ 178,710 Effect of SFAS 123R 15,100 26,583 19,714 Net earnings before the effects of SFAS 123R $ 320,387 $ 236,059 $ 198,424 Net earnings: As reported $ 196,883 $ 131,608 $ 115,574 Effect of SFAS 123R 9,767 19,412 13,401 Net earnings before the effects of SFAS 123R $ 206,650 $ 151,020 $ 128,975 Basic earnings per share: As reported $ 3.38 $ 2.31 $ 2.06 Effect of SFAS 123R 0.16 0.34 0.24 Basic earnings per share before the effects of SFAS 123R $ 3.54 $ 2.65 $ 2.30 Diluted earnings per share: As reported $ 3.27 $ 2.24 $ 2.01 Effect of SFAS 123R 0.16 0.33 0.24 Diluted earnings per share before the effects of SFAS 123R $ 3.43 $ 2.57 $ 2.25 Page 27 Table of Contents Accounting for Pension Plans In accounting for pension plans, we follow the provisions of SFAS No. 87 Employers Accounting for Pensions. SFAS 87 requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost, and the value of the plans assets and liabilities. These assumptions involve discount rates, investment returns, and projected salary increases, among others. We rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in valuing the financial position of the plans, and to provide advice regarding the actuarial assumptions used. The expected rates of return on plan assets for fiscal 2006 ranged from 5.0% to 9.0%; compared to a range of 6.0% to 9.0% last year. We believe this range of rates reflects the long-term returns expected on the plans assets, considering projected rates of inflation, the diversification of the plans assets, and the expected real rates of market returns. The discount rates used to compute plan liabilities were raised from a range of 4.0% to 5.5% in fiscal 2005 to a range of 4.75% to 6.25% in fiscal 2006. Changes in the actuarial assumptions may have a material affect on the plans assets and liabilities, and the associated pension expense. Management, together with our actuaries, monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in order to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used. During fiscal 2006 we reached an agreement with Stork N.V. regarding the plan assets and liabilities relating to our employees in the Netherlands who were participants of a multi-employer pension plan. Under the agreement, Stork N.V has assumed the pension obligations for our employees up to February 2001 (the date we acquired certain engineering and contracting businesses from Stork N.V.). A $41.8 million liability recorded previously in connection with the February 2001 business combination has been allocated to the various pension plans we acquired from Stork N.V. Accounting for Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes , and other, applicable authoritative pronouncements. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the normal course of business, we may engage in numerous transactions every day for which the ultimate tax outcome (including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in taxable income or deducted as an expense) is uncertain. Additionally, the tax returns we file are subject to audit and investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, most states in the United States, and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the United States. Our effective tax rate was 35.5% in fiscal 2006, 37.2% in fiscal 2005 and 35.3% in fiscal 2004. We routinely monitor the appropriateness of our worldwide tax rate, and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates. Insurance Matters, Litigation, Claims, and Contingencies In the normal course of business, we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation. Generally, such guarantees relate to project schedules and plant performance. Most of the litigation in which we are concerned involves the Company as a defendant in workers compensation, personal injury, environmental, employment/labor, professional liability, and other similar lawsuits. We maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations. However, we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles, limits, and retentions under our insurance programs. This situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured, or completely uninsured. In addition, as a contractor providing services to various agencies of the United States federal government, we are subject to many levels of audits, investigations, and claims by, or on behalf of, the U.S. federal government with respect to contract performance, pricing, costs, cost allocations, and procurement practices. In accordance with SFAS No. 5 Accounting for Contingencies , we record in our Consolidated Balance Sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such claims, guarantees, litigation, and audits and investigations. We rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in determining the level of reserves to establish for insurance-related claims that are known and have been asserted against us, and for insurance-related claims that are believed to have been incurred based on actuarial Page 28 Table of Contents analysis, but have not yet been reported to our claims administrators as of the respective balance sheet dates. We include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our consolidated results of operations. Testing Goodwill for Impairment In accordance with SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , the amount of goodwill carried in our Consolidated Balance Sheets is tested annually for possible impairment. In conducting the impairment test, we may apply, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142, various valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. The values resulting from the application of these valuation techniques are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of our reporting units to a willing third party. Since the adoption of SFAS 142 in fiscal 2002, we have not recorded any impairment loss associated with our goodwill. Foreign Currencies In general, our principal exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating the financial statements of our subsidiaries operating outside the United States, which are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, into the U.S. dollar. We follow the provisions of SFAS No. 52 Foreign Currency Translation in preparing our consolidated financial statements. We believe our exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because our various operations invoice clients and satisfy their financial obligations primarily in their respective local functional currencies. In situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currencies, we strive to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs, or when appropriate, enter into foreign currency hedges to limit our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Results of Operations General Our business focuses exclusively on providing technical, professional, and construction services to a large number of industrial, commercial, and governmental clients around the world. The services we provide generally fall into four broad categories: Project Services (which includes engineering, design, architectural, and similar services); Construction services (which includes traditional field construction services as well as modular construction activities); Operations and Maintenance services (which includes services performed in connection with operating large, complex facilities on behalf of clients as well as services involving process plant maintenance); and Process, Scientific, and Systems Consulting services (which includes services performed in connection with a wide variety of scientific testing, analysis, and consulting activities). The scope of services we can provide our clients, therefore, ranges from consulting and conceptual design services (which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project) to complete, single-responsibility, design-build-operate contracts. Page 29 Table of Contents The following table sets forth our revenues by type of service for each year ended September 30 (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Project Services $ 2,894,293 $ 2,469,879 $ 2,060,288 Construction 3,239,613 1,884,066 1,581,023 Operations and Maintenance 805,020 895,356 704,206 Process, Scientific, and Systems Consulting 482,344 385,700 248,718 $ 7,421,270 $ 5,635,001 $ 4,594,235 We focus our services on clients operating in certain industry groups and markets. We believe these industry groups and markets have sufficient common needs to permit cross-utilization of our resources. The following table sets forth our revenues by these industry groups and markets for each year ended September 30 (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Oil & Gas and Refining $ 2,802,591 $ 1,957,471 $ 1,270,468 National Government Programs 1,259,361 1,160,664 1,051,016 Chemicals and Polymers 1,124,254 737,872 559,733 Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology 678,989 514,836 713,566 Infrastructure 546,999 464,400 304,977 Buildings 395,190 462,147 354,742 Technology and Manufacturing 137,856 118,059 203,579 Pulp and Paper 102,371 63,562 42,339 Other 373,659 155,990 93,815 $ 7,421,270 $ 5,635,001 $ 4,594,235 Other includes projects for clients operating in food and consumer products, and basic resources (such as mining, minerals, and fertilizers) industry groups and markets. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 We recorded net earnings of $196.9 million, or $3.27 per diluted share, for fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, compared to net earnings of $131.6 million, or $2.24 per diluted share for fiscal 2005. Total revenues for fiscal 2006 increased by $1.8 billion, or 31.7%, to $7.4 billion, compared to total revenues of $5.6 billion for fiscal 2005. Revenues increased among most of the industry groups and markets we serve, lead by a 52.4% increase in revenues from clients operating in the chemicals and polymers markets, and a 43.2% increase in revenues from clients operating in the oil & gas and refining industries. The increase in revenues from clients operating in the chemicals and polymers markets was driven by demand by a number of our clients to increase capacity. The increase in revenues from our clients operating in the oil & gas and refining industries was due primarily to new and continuing projects reconfiguring existing refineries in order to increase production and address the effects of changing crude inputs from lighter crudes to heavier crudes that contain slightly higher levels of sulfur. Although we continued to perform on contracts relating to various clean fuels programs during fiscal 2006, we saw that spending levels for these programs started to wane. Also contributing to the increase in revenues were new awards in the upstream area of this market relating to oil sands extraction projects. Also contributing to the increase in revenues was a $1,145.2 million increase in pass-through costs. When we are responsible for subcontract labor or Page 30 Table of Contents third-party materials and equipment, we reflect the costs of such items in both revenues and costs. The level of pass-through costs included in revenues and costs will vary between reporting periods depending principally on the amount of procurement that clients choose to do themselves as opposed to using our services as well as on the normal winding down of field services activities on construction and O&M projects. As a percentage of revenues, direct costs of contracts were 87.4% for fiscal 2006, compared to 85.7% for fiscal 2005. The percentage relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided. The increase in direct costs of contracts as a percentage of revenues was due to the increase in pass-through costs combined with slightly lower fees from our engineering services, off-set in part by slightly higher fees from field services. Since pass-through costs (which are incurred primarily on projects requiring field services) typically do not generate significant margins, it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in revenues without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit. We were successful in keeping SG&A growth in-line with our increased business activity during fiscal 2006. SG&A expenses during fiscal 2006 increased by $41.3 million, or 7.0%, to $632.7 million, compared to $591.4 million during fiscal 2005. Contributing to the increase in SG&A expenses was increased professional technical services activity and the effects of foreign currency translation. SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue decreased from 10.5% in fiscal 2005 to 8.5% in fiscal 2006. SG&A expense as a percentage of gross margin decreased from 73.3% in fiscal 2005 to 67.7% in fiscal 2006. Contributing to the decrease in these relationships is the result of increased field services activity, which generally requires less SG&A expense to support. Operating profit for fiscal 2006 increased by $86.7 million, or 40.3%, to $301.6 million, compared to $214.9 million during fiscal 2005. The increase in operating profit during fiscal 2006 as compared to last year was due to the overall increase in business activity. As a percentage of revenues, operating profit was 4.1% for fiscal 2006 compared to 3.8% in fiscal 2005. Notwithstanding the increase in the direct costs of contracts as a percentage of revenue, the Company was able to increase its operating profit by limiting the increase in SG&A expenses. Interest income increased by $10.9 million to $15.2 million during fiscal 2006, compared to $4.3 million of interest income during fiscal 2005. Included in interest income for fiscal 2006 is $3.3 million relating to the favorable settlement of a matter with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ). The balance of the increase in interest income was a result of higher cash balances on deposit during fiscal 2006 as compared to last year. Interest expense increased by $1.0 million to $7.5 million during fiscal 2006, compared to $6.5 million of interest expense during fiscal 2005. The increase in interest expense is due primarily to higher levels of borrowing by our operations outside the U.S. (in support of the growth in business) combined with slightly higher interest rates. We recorded income tax expense of $108.4 million during fiscal 2006, compared to $77.9 million during fiscal 2005. Our overall effective tax rate was 35.5% during fiscal 2006 compared to 37.2% last year. The overall effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was impacted by the favorable settlement of a matter with the IRS, off-set in part by provisions recorded for certain other income tax exposures. The net effect of the IRS settlement and the other income tax exposures was a net reduction to the Company income tax expense of $1.5 million. Impacting the overall effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 was certain stock-based compensation expense amounts relating to the Company employee stock purchase plans where no tax benefit was available to the Company. In the normal course of our business, we may engage in numerous transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome (including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in income or deducted as an expense) is uncertain. Page 31 Table of Contents Additionally, we file income, franchise, gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions. Our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, most states in the United States, and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the United States. We continually monitor the appropriateness of the rate, and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 We recorded net earnings of $131.6 million, or $2.24 per diluted share, for fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, compared to net earnings of $115.6 million, or $2.01 per diluted share for fiscal 2004. Total revenues for fiscal 2005 increased by $1.0 billion, or 22.7%, to $5.6 billion, compared to total revenues of $4.6 billion for fiscal 2004. Revenues increased among most of the industry groups and markets we serve, lead by a 54.1% increase in revenues from clients operating in the oil & gas and refining industries, and a 52.3% increase in revenues from clients operating in the infrastructure market. The increase in revenues from our clients operating in the oil & gas and refining industries was due primarily to continuing projects we re executing in the area of clean fuels, combined with new awards of projects assisting refiners improve and enhance capacity. Also contributing to the increase in revenues were new awards in the upstream area of this market relating to oil sands extraction projects. The increase in revenues from clients operating in the infrastructure market was due primarily to the inclusion of the Babtie Group for all of fiscal 2005. The Babtie Group contributed approximately $324.1 million of revenue during fiscal 2005, compared to approximately $54.0 million during fiscal 2004 (the Babtie Group was acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004). Also contributing to the increase in revenues was a $369.8 million increase in pass-through costs. As a percentage of revenues, direct costs of contracts were 85.7% for fiscal 2005, compared to 85.5% for fiscal 2004. The increase in direct costs of contracts as a percentage of revenues was due to the increase in pass-through costs, off-set in part by the inclusion of the Babtie Group for all of fiscal 2005 (whose revenues are weighted towards project services). SG&A expenses during fiscal 2005 increased by $105.3 million, or 21.7%, to $591.4 million, compared to $486.1 million during fiscal 2004. Contributing to the increase in SG&A expenses during fiscal 2005 was the inclusion of the Babtie Group for the entire year. The Babtie Group contributed approximately $89.6 million of SG&A expenses during fiscal 2005, versus approximately $13.5 million of SG&A expenses during fiscal 2004. The balance of the increase was due primarily to the effects of foreign currency translation, and higher spending in support of our professional technical services activities. Operating profit for fiscal 2005 increased by $36.3 million, or 20.4%, to $214.9 million, compared to $178.6 million during fiscal 2004. The increase in operating profit during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was due to the overall increase in business activity. As a percentage of revenues, operating profit was 3.8% for fiscal 2005 compared to 3.9% for fiscal 2004. In spite of the significant increase in pass-through costs, the Company was able to maintain its level of operating profit by limiting the increase in SG&A expenses. Interest income increased by $1.3 million to $4.3 million during fiscal 2005, compared to $3.1 million of interest income during fiscal 2004. The increase in interest income was due primarily to higher cash balances on deposit during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. Interest expense increased by $2.9 million to $6.5 million during fiscal 2005, compared to $3.6 million of interest expense during fiscal 2004. The increase in interest expense reflects the effects of the debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of the Babtie Group being outstanding for all of fiscal 2005, versus only a portion of fiscal 2004. Page 32 Table of Contents We recorded income tax expense of $77.9 million during fiscal 2005, compared to $63.1 million during fiscal 2004. Our overall effective tax rate was 37.2% for fiscal 2005 and 35.3% for fiscal 2004. The overall effective tax rates in 2005 and 2004 were impacted by certain stock based compensation expense amounts relating to the Company employee stock purchase plans where no tax benefit was available to the Company. Also affecting the increase in our overall tax rate during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was the effects of the non-deductibility for tax purposes of the amortization of intangible assets we acquired in connection with the Babtie Group, combined with a shift in earnings among our non-U.S. operations. Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth certain information about our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2006 (in thousands): Payments Due by Fiscal Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More than 5 Years Bank debt $ 92,147 $ 14,474 $ $ 77,673 $ Operating leases (a) 430,114 89,617 143,718 87,741 109,038 Obligations under defined benefit pension plans (b) 193,964 32,700 69,377 75,037 16,850 Obligations under nonqualified deferred compensation plans (c) 64,563 6,174 13,099 14,168 31,122 Purchase obligations (d) 767,788 767,788 Total $ 1,548,576 $ 910,753 $ 226,194 $ 254,619 $ 157,010 (a) Assumes the Company will make end of lease term residual value guarantee payments (included in the more than 5 years column) with respect to the lease of two office buildings in Houston, Texas. (b) Assumes that future contributions will be consistent with amounts projected to be contributed in fiscal 2007, allowing for certain growth based on rates of inflation and salary increases, but limited to the amount recorded as of September 30, 2006. Actual contributions will depend on a variety of factors, including amounts required by local laws and regulations, and other funding requirements. (c) Assumes that future payments will be consistent with amounts paid in fiscal 2006, allowing for certain growth. Due to the nonqualified nature of the plans, and the fact that benefits are based in part on years of service, the payments included in the schedule were limited to the amount recorded as of September 30, 2006. (d) Represents those liabilities estimated to be under firm contractual commitments as of September 30, 2006. Backlog The following table summarizes our backlog at September 30, 2006, 2005, and 2004 (in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Technical professional services $ 5,153.4 $ 4,329.0 $ 3,989.0 Field services 4,624.3 4,314.0 3,463.5 Total $ 9,777.7 $ 8,643.0 $ 7,452.5 Because the entire value of contracts is added to backlog as soon as the contracts are awarded to us (rather than adding the contracts to backlog gradually over time), and many of our contracts require Page 33 Table of Contents us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters (and sometimes over fiscal years), we evaluate our backlog on a year-over-year basis, rather than on a sequential, quarter-over-quarter basis. Our backlog at September 30, 2006 increased by $1.1 billion, or 13.1%, to $9.8 billion from $8.6 billion at September 30, 2005. The increase in backlog during fiscal 2006 was attributable primarily to new awards from clients operating within the oil & gas and the chemical and polymer industry groups and markets. In accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the discretion of the client. However, we have not experienced cancellations that have had a material effect on the reported backlog amounts. In a situation where a client terminates a contract, we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination and, in certain instances, we may be entitled to allowable termination and cancellation costs. While management uses all information available to it to determine backlog, our backlog at any given time is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein. Total backlog at September 30, 2006 included approximately $2.2 billion, or 22.3% of total backlog, relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the U.S. federal government and its agencies. This compares to approximately $2.2 billion, or 25.3% of total backlog, and $2.3 billion, or 30.2% of total backlog, of U.S. federal backlog at September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Most of our federal contracts require that services be provided beyond one year. In general, these contracts must be funded annually (i.e., the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the U.S. Congress to the procuring agency, and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts). Subject to the factors discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors , above, we estimate that approximately $6.4 billion, or 65.1% of total backlog at September 30, 2006 will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year. Effects of Inflation Refer to Item 1A Risk Factors , above. Liquidity and Capital Resources We finance our operations primarily through cash provided by operations. At September 30, 2006, our principal source of liquidity consisted of $434.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $212.3 million of available capacity under our $290.0 million unsecured, revolving credit facility discussed below. During fiscal 2006, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $194.2 million, to $434.1 million. This compares to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $139.8 million during fiscal 2005, and a decrease of $26.1 million during fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2006, we experienced net cash inflows from operating activities and financing activities of $223.5 million and $48.3 million, respectively. These inflows were offset in part by net cash outflows from investing activities and the effect of exchange rate changes of $67.6 million and $10.1 million, respectively. Our operations provided net cash of $223.5 million during fiscal 2006. This compares to net cash inflows of $150.3 million and $86.8 million during fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $73.2 million increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was due primarily to a $65.3 million increase in net earnings, a $10.4 million increase relating to the timing of cash receipts and payments within our working capital accounts, a $7.5 million change in deferred income taxes, and an increase of $1.9 million in depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and improvements Page 34 Table of Contents (a non-cash expense). These increases in cash flows from operations were offset in part by a decrease in certain non-cash items including a $10.7 million decrease in stock-based compensation and a $0.8 million change in the excess tax benefits relating to stock based compensation. We used $67.6 million of cash and cash equivalents for investing activities during fiscal 2006; virtually unchanged from the $68.3 million of cash and cash equivalents used last year. Although $27.1 million less cash was used during fiscal 2006 relating to miscellaneous, non-current assets as compared to last year, this reduction was almost entirely off-set by a $10.1 million increase in purchases of property and equipment and an $11.0 million increase in cash used to acquire businesses. We used $203.1 million of cash and cash equivalents for investing activities during fiscal 2004; approximately $135 million more than the amount used during either fiscal 2006 or 2005. The higher amount of cash and cash equivalents used for investing activities during fiscal 2004 was due primarily to cash used in connection with the acquisition of the Babtie Group. Our financing activities resulted in net cash inflows of $48.3 million during fiscal 2006. This compares to net cash inflows of $60.7 million and $92.3 million during fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $12.4 million decrease in cash flows from financing activities during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was due primarily to a $29.9 million increase in repayments, net of borrowings, under our long-term credit facilities, combined with a $7.7 million decrease in proceeds from issuances of common stock through our stock option and stock purchase plans. This reduction in cash inflows was partially offset by changes in other deferred liability accounts of $21.9 million (relating primarily to accrued pension liabilities) and an increase in short term borrowings, net of repayments, of $2.5 million. We believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations and service our debt for the foreseeable future. We had $434.1 million in cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2006, compared to $239.8 million at September 30, 2005. Our consolidated working capital position at September 30, 2006 was $776.8 million, compared to $552.3 million at September 30, 2005. We have a long-term, unsecured revolving credit facility providing up to $290.0 million of debt capacity, under which only $77.7 million was utilized at September 30, 2006 in the form of direct borrowings. We believe that the capacity, terms and conditions of our long-term revolving credit facility is adequate for our working capital and general business requirements. We also had, at September 30, 2006, $36.0 million of borrowing capacity available to us through committed, short-term credit facilities. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 . FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, on an entity tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition; classification; interest and penalties; accounting in interim periods; disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 (fiscal 2008 for the Company). We are currently evaluating whether FIN 48 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Pension and Other Postretirement Plans-an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132R . SFAS 158 requires companies to (i) recognize the funded statuses of their single-employer, defined benefit postretirement plans as assets or liabilities in their balance sheets; (ii) recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses that arise during the period being reported but are not recognized as a component of periodic benefit cost under existing accounting rules; and Page 35 Table of Contents (iii) measure defined benefit pension plan assets and obligations as of the date of the sponsor balance sheet. We are required to initially recognize the funded statuses of our defined benefit postretirement plans and to provide the required disclosures as of the end of our first fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006 (i.e., September 30, 2007). The provisions SFAS 158 relating to the change in measurement date of the assets and obligations of our defined benefit pension plans is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008 (i.e., September 30, 2009 for us). We are currently evaluating whether SFAS 158 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
