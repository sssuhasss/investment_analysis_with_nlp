Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and results of operations together with our present financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes, as well as the selected historical consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this annual report. Statements in our discussion may be forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. We caution that a number of factors could cause future production, revenue and expenses to differ materially from our expectations. Overview We are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, development, exploitation and exploration of producing oil and natural gas properties. Our conventional operations are primarily focused in the Permian Basin of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. We have also acquired significant acreage positions in unconventional emerging resource plays located in the Permian Basin of Southeast New Mexico, the Central Basin Platform and the Western Delaware Basin of West Texas, the Williston Basin in North Dakota and the Arkoma Basin in Arkansas, where we intend to apply horizontal drilling, advanced fracture stimulation and enhanced recovery technologies. Crude oil comprised 59% of our 546.0 Bcfe of estimated net proved reserves as of December 31, 2007, and 60% of our 30.1 Bcfe of production for the year ended December 31, 2007. We seek to operate the wells in which we own an interest, and we operated wells that accounted for 90% of our PV-10 and 50% of our 2,067 wells as of December 31, 2007. By controlling operations, we are able to more effectively manage the cost and timing of exploration and development of our properties, including the drilling and stimulation methods used. Factors that Significantly Affect Our Results Our revenue, cash flow from operations and future growth depend substantially on factors beyond our control, such as economic, political and regulatory developments and competition from other sources of energy. Oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile and may fluctuate widely in the future. Sustained periods of low prices for oil or natural gas could materially and adversely affect our financial position, our results of operations, the quantities of oil and gas that we can economically produce and our ability to access capital. We use commodity derivative contracts covering a portion of our expected future oil and natural gas production to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity price. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Commodity Derivatives and Hedging for a discussion of our commodity derivatives, hedging and hedge positions. 32 Table of Contents Like all businesses engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, we face the challenge of natural production declines. As initial reservoir pressures are depleted, oil and natural gas production from a given well decreases. Thus, an oil and natural gas exploration and production company depletes part of its asset base with each unit of oil or natural gas it produces. We attempt to overcome this natural decline by drilling to find additional reserves and acquiring more reserves than we produce and by implementing secondary recovery techniques. Our future growth will depend on our ability to enhance production levels from our existing reserves and to continue to add reserves in excess of production. We will maintain our focus on costs necessary to produce our reserves as well as the costs necessary to add reserves through drilling and acquisitions. Our ability to make capital expenditures to increase production from our existing reserves and to add reserves through drilling is dependent on our capital resources and can be limited by many factors, including our ability to access capital in a cost-effective manner and to timely obtain drilling permits and regulatory approvals. Items Impacting Comparability of Our Financial Results Our historical results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable, either from period to period or going forward, for the reasons described below. Combination Transaction On February 24, 2006, we entered into a combination agreement in which we agreed to purchase certain oil and gas properties owned by the Chase Group and combine them with substantially all of the outstanding equity interests of Concho Equity Holdings Corp. to form our company. The initial closing of the transactions contemplated by the combination agreement occurred on February 27, 2006. As a result of the initial closing of the combination transaction, the members of the Chase Group that sold their working interests to us at the initial closing of the combination transaction received 34,683,315 shares of our common stock and approximately $400 million in cash, and the former shareholders of Concho Equity Holdings Corp. that were a party to the combination agreement received 23,767,691 shares of our common stock. In addition, certain options held by our employees to purchase preferred and common stock of Concho Equity Holdings Corp. were converted into options to purchase 2,349,113 shares of our common stock. The executive officers of Concho Equity Holdings Corp. became the executive officers of our company in connection with the initial closing of the combination transaction. We have accounted for the combination transaction as a reorganization of our company, such that Concho Equity Holdings Corp. is now our wholly owned subsidiary, and a simultaneous acquisition by our company of the assets contributed by the Chase Group. We agreed in the combination agreement to offer to acquire additional interests in the Chase Group Properties from persons associated with the Chase Group. In May 2006, we acquired certain of such interests from ten of such persons in exchange for an aggregate consideration of 111,323 shares of our common stock and $8.9 million in cash. In April 2007, we acquired the remainder of such interests from an additional nine persons for 54,230 shares of our common stock and $256,000 in cash. Terms concerning the exchange of such interests for shares of our common stock were the same as the terms in the combination agreement. In addition, because certain employee stockholders of Concho Equity Holdings Corp. were not confirmed to have been accredited investors at the time of the combination transaction, their 254,621 units, consisting of one preferred and one-half of a common share of Concho Equity Holdings Corp., could not be immediately exchanged for our common shares. On April 16, 2007, these remaining shares of Concho Equity Holdings Corp. were exchanged for 318,285 shares of our common stock. As a result, Concho Equity Holdings Corp. is now our wholly owned subsidiary. The common and preferred shares of Concho Equity Holdings Corp., which were outstanding between February 27, 2006 and April 16, 2007, have been treated as exchangeable for and equivalent to shares of our common stock in our consolidated financial statements. We completed the initial public offering of our common stock in August 2007, and a secondary public offering of our common stock by certain of our shareholders in December 2007. Concho Equity Holdings Corp. is our predecessor for accounting purposes. As a result, our historical financial statements prior to February 27, 2006, are the financial statements of Concho Equity Holdings Corp. Concho Equity Holdings Corp. was formed on April 21, 2004, and did not own any material assets and did not conduct substantial 33 Table of Contents operations other than organizational activities until it acquired the Lowe Properties on December 7, 2004. For a discussion of the results of operations of Concho (as the accounting successor to Concho Equity Holdings Corp.), See Results of Operations. The financial statements of Concho (as the accounting successor to Concho Equity Holdings Corp.), together with the notes thereto, are also included in this annual report. Additional Indebtedness and Other Expenses During 2007 and 2006, we incurred additional indebtedness and other expenses as a result of our rapid growth, particularly as a result of the combination transaction. Our historical financial information prior to 2006 does not give effect to various items that will affect our results of operations and liquidity in the future, including the following items: we closed the combination transaction on February 27, 2006 and properties were contributed to us by the Chase Group that represented approximately 76% of our PV-10 as of December 31, 2006 and approximately 81% of our PV-10 as of December 31, 2007; we incurred approximately $405 million of new indebtedness upon the initial closing of the combination transaction, which was borrowed on our revolving credit facility dated February 24, 2006 ( 1st Lien Credit Facility ); we entered into a $200.0 million second lien term loan facility on March 27, 2007 ( New 2nd Lien Credit Facility ), from which we received proceeds of $199.0 million that we used to repay the $39.8 million outstanding under our prior term loan facility dated July 6, 2006 ( 2nd Lien Credit Facility ), to reduce the outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility by $154.0 million and the remaining $5.2 million to pay loan fees, accrued interest and for general corporate purposes; we received proceeds of $173.0 million from our initial public offering in August 2007, all of which we used to reduce outstanding borrowings under our debt facilities; and we have incurred additional general and administrative costs as a result of the expansion of our technical and administrative staffs and as a result of increased amounts of professional fees. Curtailment of Drilling We determined in January 2007 to reduce our drilling activities for the three months ended March 31, 2007. This determination was due to a decline in oil and natural gas prices in January 2007 compared to such prices in the fourth quarter of 2006, the costs of goods and services necessary to complete our drilling activities and the resulting effect of these circumstances on our expected cash flow. To preserve our liquidity, we reduced our drilling activities and curtailed capital expenditures until we were able to complete our second lien term loan facility in March 2007. Also due to the reduced drilling activities described above, we recorded an expense during the six months ended June 30, 2007 of $4.3 million for contract drilling fees related to stacked rigs subject to daywork drilling contracts. Approximately $3 million of this amount was paid to Silver Oak Drilling, LLC, which is an affiliate of the Chase Group. We resumed drilling activities in April 2007, and we invested our entire 2007 exploration and development budget of approximately $183 million prior to January 1, 2008. We incurred no contract drilling fees related to stacked rigs in the six months ended December 31, 2007. Natural Gas Processing Plant Interruption On June 27, 2007, we were notified that a natural gas processing plant through which we process and sell a portion of the production from our Shelf Properties in New Mexico was shut-down for repairs as a result of a storm. Approximately 40 MMcfe per day of our production was shut-in as a result of this plant shut-down. The plant became fully operational on July 3, 2007, and we resumed production from all of our properties that had been affected. On July 16, 2007, this plant was shut-down again for repairs. Approximately 40 MMcfe per day of our production was shut-in again as a result of this plant shut-down. The plant became fully operational on July 20, 2007, and we resumed production from all of our properties that had been affected. As a result of this plant downtime and associated gathering system interruptions and high line pressure, our production delivery was further restricted in varying amounts during late July and the full months of August and September. Our total net production 34 Table of Contents during the year ended December 31, 2007 was reduced by approximately 660 MMcfe as a result of this situation. These production delivery restrictions were reduced significantly toward the end of September and the beginning of October and, as a result, we resumed full levels of production delivery during the month of October. Initial Public Offering On August 7, 2007, we completed an initial public offering (the IPO ) of our common stock. We sold 13,332,851 shares and certain shareholders, including our executive officers and members of the Chase Group, sold 7,554,256 shares of our common stock, in each case, at $11.50 per share. After deducting underwriting discounts of approximately $9.6 million and offering expenses of approximately $4.5 million, we received net proceeds of approximately $139.2 million. In conjunction with the IPO, the underwriters were granted an option to purchase from us 3,133,066 additional shares of our common stock. The underwriters fully exercised this option and purchased the additional shares on August 9, 2007. After deducting underwriting discounts of approximately $2.2 million, we received net proceeds of approximately $33.8 million. The aggregate net proceeds of approximately $173.0 million received by us at closings on August 7, 2007 and August 9, 2007 were utilized in equal parts to repay a portion of our New 2nd Lien Credit Facility on August 9, 2007, and to prepay a portion of our 1st Lien Credit Facility on August 20, 2007. Approximately $1 million of the deferred loan costs associated with our New 2nd Lien Credit Facility were written off to interest expense in August 2007. Additionally, approximately $0.4 million of the unamortized original issue discount related to our 2nd Lien Credit Facility was written off to interest expense in August 2007. Secondary Public Offering On December 19, 2007, we completed a secondary public offering of 11,845,000 shares of our common stock sold by certain of our stockholders, including certain members of the Chase Group, pursuant to a registration statement that we previously filed with SEC. Certain members of the Chase Group sold 10,194,732 shares in the aggregate and certain other stockholders sold 1,650,268 shares in the aggregate, including one of our executive officers who sold 45,000 shares. Chase Oil granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to 1,776,615 additional shares to cover over-allotments. The underwriters fully exercised this option and purchased the additional shares on December 19, 2007. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares sold in this secondary offering. Public Company Expenses In addition, we believe that our expected future financial results will be impacted as a result of our having become a public corporation in August 2007. We anticipate incurring additional general and administrative expenses relating to operating as a separate publicly held corporation, including costs associated with annual and quarterly reports to stockholders, costs associated with our compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, independent auditor fees, investor relations activities, registrar and transfer agent fees, legal fees, incremental director and officer liability insurance costs, and director compensation. Amendment of Certain Outstanding Stock Options On November 8, 2007, the compensation committee of our board of directors authorized amendments to certain outstanding agreements related to options to purchase our common stock that were previously awarded to certain of our executive officers and employees in order to amend such award agreements so that the subject stock option awards would constitute deferred compensation that is compliant with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or exempt such awards from the application of Section 409A. Because the offer to amend outstanding stock option agreements previously issued to our employees may constitute a tender offer under the Exchange Act, on November 8, 2007, our board of directors authorized commencement of a tender offer to amend the applicable outstanding stock option award agreements in the form approved by the compensation committee. All affected employees accepted the tender offer. Generally, the amendments provide that the employee stock options, which had previously vested in connection with the combination transaction, will become exercisable in 25% increments over a four year period or upon the occurrence of certain specified events. Each employee who elected to amend his stock option award agreement received on January 2, 2008 a cash payment equal to $0.50 for each share of common stock subject to the amendment, totaling approximately $192,000 for all such employees. Our affected executive officers accepted our 35 Table of Contents offer to amend certain of their stock option awards issued prior to the combination transaction on substantially the same terms, except such executive officers were not offered the $0.50 per share cash payment. Each of these executive officers executed respective amendments on November 16, 2007, prior to the initiation of the tender offer to our non-executive employees. In addition, our executive officers at the time received stock option awards in June 2006 to purchase 450,000 shares of common stock, in the aggregate, at a purchase price of $12.00 per share. We subsequently determined that the fair market value of a share of common stock as of the date of the award was $15.40. As a result, the compensation committee of our board of directors authorized and approved an amendment to these stock option award agreements pursuant to which the exercise price of such stock options would be increased from $12.00 per share to $15.40 per share. This represents incremental value of approximately $0.8 million above the value of the June 2006 options. Such incremental value will be recognized in General and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations beginning in November 2007 continuing through the remaining vesting period. Such executive officers executed these amendments on November 16, 2007. To compensate such executive officers for the $3.40 increase in the exercise price, we issued to each of them an award of the number of shares of restricted stock equal to (i) the product of $3.40 and the number of shares of common stock subject to the stock option award, divided by (ii) $18.38, which was the mean of the high and low sales price of a share of our common stock on November 19, 2007. As a result, such executive officers were granted 83,242 shares of restricted stock in the aggregate on November 19, 2007 based on a grant price of $18.38. The lapse of forfeiture restrictions on this restricted stock is in 25% increments, respectively, on January 1, 2008, June 12, 2008, June 12, 2009, and June 12, 2010, or upon the occurrence of certain specified events. We have determined that our aggregate compensation expense of approximately $0.8 million resulting from these proposed modifications will be recorded during the period from November 8 to December 31, 2007, and during the years ending December 31, 2008, 2009, and 2010. 36 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table presents selected financial and operating information of Concho (as successor to Concho Equity Holdings Corp.) for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005: December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands, except price data) Oil sales $ 195,596 $ 131,773 $ 31,621 Natural gas sales 98,737 66,517 23,315 Total operating revenues 294,333 198,290 54,936 Operating costs and expenses 218,396 134,862 48,626 Interest, net and other revenue 34,558 29,381 2,317 Income before income taxes 41,379 34,047 3,993 Income tax expense (16,019 ) (14,379 ) (2,039 ) Net income $ 25,360 $ 19,668 $ 1,954 Production volumes: Oil (MBbl) 3,014 2,295 599 Natural gas (MMcf) 12,064 9,507 3,404 Natural gas equivalent (MMcfe) 30,148 23,275 6,998 Average prices: Oil, without hedges ($/Bbl) $ 68.58 $ 60.47 $ 54.71 Oil, with hedges ($/Bbl) $ 64.90 $ 57.42 $ 52.79 Natural gas, without hedges ($/Mcf) $ 8.08 $ 6.87 $ 6.99 Natural gas, with hedges ($/Mcf) $ 8.18 $ 7.00 $ 6.85 Natural gas equivalent, without hedges ($/Mcfe) $ 10.09 $ 8.77 $ 8.08 Natural gas equivalent, with hedges ($/Mcfe) $ 9.76 $ 8.52 $ 7.85 Year ended December 31, 2007, compared to year ended December 31, 2006 Oil and gas revenues. Revenue from oil and gas operations was $294.33 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $96.04 million (48%) from $198.29 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily because of increased production as a result of the acquisition of the Chase Group Properties and secondarily due to successful drilling efforts during 2006 and 2007, coupled with moderate increases in realized oil and gas prices. In addition: average realized oil prices (after giving effect to hedging activities) were $64.90 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of 13% from $57.42 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2006; total oil production was 3,014 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of 719 MBbl (31%) from 2,295MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2006; average realized natural gas prices (after giving effect to hedging activities) were $8.18 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of 17% from $7.00 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2006; total natural gas production was 12,064 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of 2,557 MMcf (27%) from 9,507 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2006; average realized natural gas equivalent prices (after giving effect to hedging activities) were $9.76 per Mcfe during the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of 15% from $8.52 per Mcfe during the year ended December 31, 2006; 37 Table of Contents total production was 30,148 MMcfe for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of 6,873 MMcfe (30%) from 23,275 MMcfe for the year ended December 31, 2006; and total production during the year ended December 31, 2007 was reduced by approximately 660 MMcfe as a result of the temporary shut-downs of a natural gas processing plant through which we process and sell a portion of our production. See Items Impacting Comparability of our Financial Results Natural Gas Processing Plant Interruption. Hedging activities. The oil and gas prices that we report are based on the market price received for the commodities adjusted to give effect to the results of our cash flow hedging activities. We utilize commodity derivative instruments (swaps and zero cost collar option contracts) in order to (1) reduce the effect of the volatility of price changes on the commodities we produce and sell, (2) support our annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and (3) lock-in commodity prices to protect economics related to certain capital projects. Following is a summary of the effects of commodity hedges for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Crude Oil Hedges Natural Gas Hedges Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2007 2006 Hedging revenue increase (decrease) $ (11,091,000 ) $ (7,000,000 ) $ 1,291,000 $ 1,232,000 Hedged volumes (Bbls and MMBtus, respectively) 1,076,750 1,080,500 6,482,600 5,447,500 Hedged revenue increase (decrease) per hedged volume $ (10.30 ) $ (6.48 ) $ 0.20 $ 0.23 During the year ended December 31, 2007, our commodity price hedges decreased oil revenues by $11.09 million ($3.68 per Bbl). During the year ended December 31, 2006, our commodity price hedges decreased oil revenues by $7.00 million ($3.05 per Bbl). The effect of the commodity price hedges in decreasing oil revenues during the year ended December 31, 2007 more than their effect of decreasing oil revenues during the year ended December 31, 2006 was the result of (1) a higher average market price of NYMEX crude oil of $72.39 per Bbl in 2007 as compared to $66.21 per Bbl in 2006, and (2) the higher hedged revenue per hedged volume in 2007 as compared to 2006, as shown in the table above, partially offset by a lower amount of hedged volumes of 1,076,750 Bbls in 2007 as compared to 1,080,500 Bbls in 2006. During the year ended December 31, 2007, our commodity price hedges increased gas revenues by $1.29 million ($0.11 per Mcf). During the year ended December 31, 2006, our commodity price hedges increased gas revenues by $1.23 million ($0.13 per Mcf). The effect of commodity price hedges in increasing gas revenues in 2007 more than their effect of increasing gas revenues in 2006 was the result of a higher amount of hedged volumes of 6,482,600 MMBtus in 2007 as compared to 5,447,500 MMBtus in 2006, partially offset by (1) the lower hedged revenue per hedged volume in 2007 as compared to 2006 and (2) a higher reference market price for natural gas of $6.11 per MMBtu in 2007 as compared to $6.05 per MMBtu in 2006, as shown in the table above. As of June 30, 2007, we determined that all of our natural gas commodity contracts no longer qualified as hedges under the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 133. As a result, any amounts in Accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) AOCI as of June 30, 2007 related to these dedesignated hedges will remain in AOCI and be reclassified into earnings under Natural gas revenues during the periods which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. Cash settlements for these natural gas contracts will be recorded to (Gain) loss on derivatives not designated as hedges . Regarding the dedesignated contracts, for the period January 1, 2007 through June 30, 2007, when these natural gas contracts qualified to use hedge accounting, the cash settlement receipts of approximately $0.19 million were recorded in Natural gas revenues . For the period July 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007, when these natural gas contracts no longer qualified to use hedge accounting, a pre-tax amount of $1.10 million was reclassified from AOCI to Natural gas revenues and cash settlement receipts of $1.82 million was recorded to (Gain) loss on derivatives not designated as hedges . See Note I Derivative financial instruments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 38 Table of Contents Production expenses. Production expenses (including production taxes) were $54.27 million ($1.80 per Mcfe) for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $16.45 million (43%) from $37.82 million ($1.62 per Mcfe) for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in production expenses is due to: (1) production expenses associated with the Chase Group Properties acquired in February 2006 of approximately $2.15 million, (2) production expenses associated with new wells that were successfully completed in 2006 and 2007 as a result of our drilling activities, (3) an increase in repair activity on a well in Gaines County, Texas in the amount of $1.44 million, and (4) an increase in production taxes as discussed below. Lease operating expenses and workover costs comprised approximately 55% and 58% of production expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These costs per unit of production were $0.99 per Mcfe during the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of 5% from $0.95 per Mcfe during the year ended December 31, 2006. Lease operating expenses include ad valorem taxes that are affected by commodity price changes and ad valorem tax rates. Ad valorem taxes were approximately 7% and 5% of lease operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The secondary component of production expenses is production taxes and is directly related to commodity price changes. These costs comprised approximately 45% and 42% of production expenses during the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Production taxes per unit of production were $0.81 per Mcfe during the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of 19% from $0.68 per Mcfe during the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily due to an increase in average natural gas equivalent prices we received. Exploration and abandonments expense. The following table provides a breakdown of our exploration and abandonments expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 (In thousands) Geological and geophysical $ 4,089 $ 2,185 Exploratory dry holes 21,923 3,192 Leasehold abandonments 3,086 235 Total exploration and abandonments $ 29,098 $ 5,612 Our geological and geophysical expense, which primarily consists of general and administrative costs for our geology department as well as seismic data, geophysical data and core analysis, during the year ended December 31, 2007 was $4.09 million, an increase of $1.90 million from $2.19 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. This 87% increase is primarily attributable to a comprehensive seismic survey on our Shelf Properties which was initiated in December 2007. Our exploratory dry holes expense during the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily attributable to five operated exploratory wells that were unsuccessful. The costs associated with three of these wells drilled in the Western Delaware Basin in Culberson County, Texas approximated $17.04 million. Another of these wells, which was drilled in the Southeastern New Mexico Basin in Lea County, New Mexico, had costs of approximately $2.36 million. An additional $0.81 million was charged to exploratory dry hole costs relative to a target zone in the fifth of these wells in the Southeastern New Mexico Basin in Eddy County, New Mexico which was determined to be dry. Exploration expense of $1.68 million related to three outside operated wells located in Eddy County, New Mexico was also recorded. Of our exploratory dry holes expense during the year ended December 31, 2006, $3.19 million was attributable to one exploratory dry hole in Gaines County, Texas that we operated and one exploratory dry hole in Val Verde County, Texas operated by another company. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded $3.09 million of leasehold abandonments, of which $0.69 million related to a prospect in Lea County, New Mexico, $0.77 million related to one prospect located in Edwards County, Texas and $0.54 million related to leasehold expiring in Southeast New Mexico. The remaining $1.09 million was related to several individually minor leaseholds. We had minimal leasehold abandonments during the year ended December 31, 2006. 39 Table of Contents Depreciation and depletion expense. Depreciation and depletion expense was $76.78 million ($2.55 per Mcfe) for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $16.06 million from $60.72 million ($2.61 per Mcfe) for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in depreciation and depletion expense was primarily due to the acquisition of the Chase Group Properties and related acquisition costs associated with the combination transaction as well as the costs capitalized associated with new wells that were successfully completed in 2006 and 2007 as a result of our drilling activities. The decrease in depreciation and depletion expense per Mcfe was primarily due to an increase in proved oil and natural gas reserves as a result of our successful development and exploratory drilling program. Impairment of oil and gas properties. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, we review our long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved oil and gas properties accounted for under the successful efforts method of accounting. As a result of this review of the recoverability of the carrying value of our assets during the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized a non-cash charge against earnings of $7.27 million, 33% of which related to wells drilled in Gaines County, Texas, 30% of which related to a well drilled in Schleicher County, Texas and 18% of which related to a well drilled in Crane County, Texas. The remaining 19% was comprised of multiple immaterial wells in various counties. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a non-cash charge against earnings of $9.89 million, 33% of which related to wells located in Pecos and Midland Counties, Texas, acquired in our Lowe Acquisition, 24% of which related to wells located in Lea and Eddy Counties, New Mexico, acquired in our Lowe Acquisition, 11% of which related to a well drilled in Eddy County, New Mexico and 9% of which related to a well drilled in Mountrail County, North Dakota. The remaining 23% was comprised of multiple immaterial wells in various counties. Contract drilling fees stacked rigs. As discussed above under Items impacting comparability of our financial results Curtailment of drilling, we determined in January 2007 to reduce our drilling activities for the first three months of 2007. As a result, we recorded an expense during the six months ended June 30, 2007 of approximately $4.27 million for contract drilling fees related to stacked rigs subject to daywork drilling contracts with two drilling contractors. No additional costs were incurred from July 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007. We resumed the majority of our planned drilling activities in April 2007 and all planned drilling activities in June 2007. These costs were minimized during the first six months of 2007 as one contractor secured work for a rig for 71 days during that period and charged us only the difference between the then-current operating day rate pursuant to the contract and the lower operating day rate received from the new customer. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were $25.18 million ($0.84 per Mcfe) for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $3.46 million (16%) from $21.72 million ($0.93 per Mcfe) for the year ended December 31, 2006. Non-cash stock-based compensation was $3.84 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 and $9.14 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. General and administrative expenses, excluding non-cash stock-based compensation, ( Net general expense ) were $21.34 million ($0.71 per Mcfe) for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $8.76 million (70%) from $12.58 million ($0.54 per Mcfe) for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in Net general expenses during the year ended December 31, 2007 was primarily due to an increase in the number of employees and related personnel expenses. Annual bonuses in the aggregate amount of $2.53 million were paid to the officers and employees in April 2007 representing bonuses for 2006 performance as compared to $0.91 million aggregate bonuses paid to employees in February 2006. Additionally, as of December 31, 2007, we accrued officer and employee bonuses of $3.40 million related to 2007 performance. All of these bonuses were approved by the compensation committee of our board of directors. We earn revenue as operator of certain oil and gas properties in which we own interests. As such, we earned revenue of $1.08 million and $0.80 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. This revenue is reflected as a reduction of general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. (Gain) loss on derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges. As explained in Hedging activities , during the three months ended September 30, 2007, we determined that all of our natural gas commodity contracts no longer qualified as hedges under the requirements of SFAS No. 133. If the hedge is no longer highly effective, according to SFAS No. 133, an entity shall discontinue hedge accounting for an existing hedge, prospectively and during the 40 Table of Contents period the hedges became ineffective. As a result, any changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings under (Gain) loss on derivatives not designated as hedges and any related cash settlements are recorded to (Gain) loss on derivatives not designated as hedges . For the six months since de-designation beginning on July 1, 2007, the related cash settlement receipts was approximately $1.82 million. The non-cash mark-to-market adjustment for other derivative instruments not designated as cash flow hedges was a loss of $22.09 million. Interest expense. Interest expense was $36.04 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $5.48 million from $30.57 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The weighted average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was 7.7% and 7.5%, respectively. The weighted average debt balance during the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was approximately $436.30 million and $406.78 million, respectively. The increase in weighted average debt balance during the year ended December 31, 2007 was due to our borrowings to fund our drilling activities, partially offset by the partial prepayment in August 2007 of $86.60 million on the New 2nd Lien Credit Facility and the repayment in August 2007 of $86.60 million on the 1st Lien Credit Facility. The increase in interest expense is due to a slight increase in the weighted average interest rate, the increase in the weighted average debt and the acceleration of deferred loan cost amortization and original issue discount amortization. In March 2007, we reduced the 1st Lien Credit Facility borrowing base by $100.00 million, or 21%, resulting in accelerated amortization of $0.77 million, and the full repayment of the 2nd Lien Credit Facility resulting in accelerated amortization of $0.43 million. The prepayment of $86.60 million on the New 2nd Lien Credit Facility in August 2007 resulted in accelerated amortization of $1.02 million in deferred loan costs and $0.41 million in original issue discount. Income tax provisions. We recorded income tax expense of $16.02 million and $14.38 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was 38.7% and 42.2%, respectively. We had a net deferred tax liability of $245.57 million and $241.67 million at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. The net liability balance is primarily due to differences in basis and depletion of oil and gas properties for tax purposes as compared to book purposes related to the acquisition of the Chase Group Properties in February 2006. The net change is due to 2007 intangible drilling costs which are allowed by the Internal Revenue Service as deductions and are capitalized under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, partially offset by an increase in deferred hedge losses. Year ended December 31, 2006, compared to year ended December 31, 2005 Oil and gas revenues. Revenue from oil and gas operations was $198.29 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $143.35 million (261%) from $54.94 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. This increase was primarily because of increased production as a result of the acquisition of the Chase Group Properties and secondarily due to successful drilling efforts during 2005 and 2006. The increases in revenue and production attributable to the Chase Group Properties between 2005 and 2006 were $136.23 million and 11,747 MMcfe, respectively. In addition: average realized oil prices (after giving effect to hedging activities) were $57.42 per Bbl in 2006, an increase of 9% from $52.79 per Bbl in 2005; total oil production was 2,295 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of 1,696 MBbl (283%) from 599 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2005; average realized natural gas prices (after giving effect to hedging activities) were $7.00 per Mcf in 2006, an increase of 2% from $6.85 per Mcf in 2005; total natural gas production was 9,507 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of 6,103 MMcf (179%) from 3,404 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2005; average realized natural gas equivalent prices (after giving effect to hedging activities) were $8.52 per Mcfe in 2006, an increase of 9% from $7.85 per Mcfe in 2005; and total production was 23,275 MMcfe for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of 16,277 MMcfe (233%) from 6,998 MMcfe for the year ended December 31, 2005. 41 Table of Contents Hedging activities. The oil and gas prices that we report are based on the market price received for the commodities adjusted to give effect to the results of our cash flow hedging activities. We utilize commodity derivative instruments (swaps and zero cost collar option contracts) in order to (1) reduce the effect of the volatility of price changes on the commodities we produce and sell, (2) support our annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and (3) lock-in commodity prices to protect economics related to certain capital projects. During 2006, our commodity price hedges decreased oil revenues by $7.00 million ($3.05 per Bbl) and increased gas revenues by $1.23 million ($0.13 per Mcf). During 2005, our commodity price hedges decreased oil revenues by $1.15 million ($1.92 per Bbl) and decreased gas revenues by $0.47 million ($0.14 per Mcf). Crude Oil Hedges Natural Gas Hedges Year Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2006 2005 2006 2005 Hedging revenue increase (decrease) $ (7,000,000 ) $ (1,150,000 ) $ 1,232,000 $ (472,000 ) Hedged volumes (Bbls and MMBtus, respectively) 1,080,500 109,500 5,447,500 547,500 Hedged revenue increase (decrease) per hedged volume $ (6.48 ) $ (10.50 ) $ 0.23 $ (0.86 ) The increased effect of the commodity price hedges in reducing oil revenues during 2006 as compared to 2005 was the result of (1) increased hedged volumes to 1,080,500 Bbls in 2006 from 109,500 Bbls in 2005 and (2) an increase in the market price of NYMEX crude oil to an average of $66.21 per Bbl in 2006 from an average of $56.57 per Bbl in 2005. The effect of the commodity price hedges in increasing gas revenues during 2006 as compared to reducing gas revenues in 2005 was the result of (1) increased hedged volumes to 5,447,500 MMBtus in 2006 from 547,500 MMBtus in 2005 and (2) a decrease in the reference market price of natural gas to $6.05 per MMBtu in 2006 from an average of $7.17 per MMBtu in 2005. Production expenses Production expenses (including production taxes) were $37.82 million ($1.62 per Mcfe) for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $23.18 million (158%) from $14.64 million ($2.09 per Mcfe) for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in production expenses is due to two sources: (1) production costs associated with the Chase Group Properties acquired in February 2006 of approximately $20.25 million and (2) costs associated with new wells that were successfully completed in 2006 and 2005 as a result of our drilling activities. Lease operating expenses and workover costs comprised approximately 58% and 75% of production expenses for 2006 and 2005, respectively. These costs per unit of production were $0.95 per Mcfe in 2006, a decrease of 39% from $1.56 per Mcfe in 2005. This is because the Chase Group Properties are, on average, less expensive to operate than the properties we operated prior to the combination transaction. Lease operating expenses include ad valorem taxes that are affected by commodity price changes and ad valorem tax rates. Ad valorem taxes were approximately 5% and 9% of lease operating expenses for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The secondary component of production expenses is production taxes and is directly related to commodity price changes. These costs comprised approximately 42% and 25% of production expenses for 2006 and 2005, respectively. Production taxes per unit of production were $0.68 per Mcfe in 2006, an increase of 28% from $0.53 per Mcfe in 2005. This increase was primarily due to an increase in commodity prices. Exploration and abandonment expense. The following table provides a breakdown of our exploration and abandonments expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 (In thousands) Geological and geophysical $ 2,185 $ 1,113 Exploratory dry holes 3,192 1,355 Leasehold abandonments and other 235 198 Total exploration and abandonments $ 5,612 $ 2,666 42 Table of Contents Exploration and abandonments expense were $5.61 million during 2006, an increase of $2.94 million from $2.67 million during 2005. The exploration and abandonments expense during 2006 consisted of $3.42 million of exploratory dry hole costs and leasehold abandonments and $2.19 million of geological and geophysical costs. The exploratory dry hole costs during 2006 were attributable to one exploratory dry hole in Gaines County, Texas that we operated and one exploratory dry hole in Val Verde County, Texas operated by another company. The geological and geophysical costs for 2006 primarily consisted of general and administrative costs for our geology department as well as seismic data, geophysical data and core analysis. The exploration and abandonments expense during 2005 consisted of $1.56 million of exploratory dry hole costs and leasehold abandonments and $1.11 million of geological and geophysical costs. The exploratory dry hole costs during 2005 were attributable to one exploratory dry hole in each of Eddy and Lea Counties, New Mexico that we operated and to one exploratory dry hole in Zapata County, Texas operated by another company. The geological and geophysical costs for 2005 primarily consisted of general and administrative costs for our geology department as well as seismic data, geophysical data and core analysis. Depreciation and depletion expense. Total depreciation and depletion expense was $60.72 million ($2.61 per Mcfe) for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $49.23 million (428%) from $11.49 million ($1.64 per Mcfe) for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in total expense and expense per Mcfe was primarily due to the acquisition of the Chase Group Properties and related acquisition costs associated with the combination transaction. Approximately $30.7 million of the increase in depreciation and depletion expense for 2006 was attributable to the acquisition of the Chase Group Properties. Impairment of oil and gas properties. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, we review our long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved oil and gas properties accounted for under the successful efforts method of accounting. As a result of this review of the recoverability of the carrying value of our assets during 2006, we recognized a non-cash charge against earnings of $9.89 million related to our proved oil and gas properties. Of this amount, $0.1 million was related to the Chase Group Properties. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized a non-cash charge against earnings of $2.30 million related to our proved oil and gas properties. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were $21.72 million ($0.93 per Mcfe) for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $10.41 million (92%) from $11.31 million ($1.62 per Mcfe) for the year ended December 31, 2005. Non-cash stock-based compensation was $9.14 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 and $3.25 million during the year ended December 31, 2005. General and administrative expenses, excluding non-cash stock-based compensation, ( Net general expense ) were $12.58 million ($0.54 per Mcfe) for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $4.52 million (56%) from $8.06 million ($1.15 per Mcfe) for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in Net general expenses during 2006 was primarily due to the hiring of additional staff and an increase in professional fees related to the combination transaction and other activities of our company. We earn revenue as operator of certain oil and gas properties in which we own interests. As such, we earned revenue of $0.80 million and $0.59 million during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. This revenue is reflected as a reduction of general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Interest expense. Interest expense was $30.57 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $27.47 million from $3.10 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The weighted average interest rate for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was 7.5% and 5.5%, respectively. The weighted average debt outstanding during 2006 and 2005 was approximately $406.78 million and $59.26 million, respectively. The increase in interest expense was due to the increase in overall debt outstanding and the increase in interest rates. The increase in weighted average debt outstanding during 2006 was primarily due to our borrowing under our revolving credit facility on February 27, 2006 to fund the cash payment due as part of the combination transaction, to repay the Concho Equity Holdings Corp. credit facility, and to pay bank and legal fees. The increase in weighted average debt outstanding was also due to our borrowing $40.00 million under our prior second lien term loan facility on July 6, 2006 to reduce the amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility by $32.10 million, with the remaining $7.90 million used for general corporate purposes. Other, net. Interest and other revenue was $1.19 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $0.41 million from $0.78 million during the year ended December 31, 2005. Interest earned was 43 Table of Contents $0.82 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $0.45 million from $0.37 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, due to interest on officer and employee notes. Other revenue was $0.37 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, a decrease of $0.04 million from $0.41 million during the year ended December 31, 2005. Income tax provisions (benefits). We recorded income tax expense of $14.38 million and $2.04 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The income tax expense was due to the income reported during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had a net deferred tax liability of $241.67 million. This change is primarily due to differences in basis and depletion of oil and gas properties for tax purposes as compared to book purposes related to the acquisition of the Chase Group Properties in February 2006, a reduction of deferred hedge losses and the elimination of the net operating loss. We had a net deferred federal and state tax asset at December 31, 2005 in the amount of $4.90 million. This accumulated balance is based on deferred hedge losses and differences in basis of oil and gas properties for tax purposes as compared to book purposes and offset by the effect of a net operating loss. Intangible drilling costs are allowed as deductions by the Internal Revenue Service and are capitalized under the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows generated from operating activities and financing provided by our bank credit facilities. We believe that funds from operating cash flows and our bank credit facilities should be sufficient to meet both our short-term working capital requirements and our 2008 exploration and development budget. Cash Flow from Operating Activities Our net cash provided by operating activities was $169.77 million, $112.18 million and $25.07 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in operating cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2007 over 2006 was principally due to increases in our oil and gas production as a result of our exploration and development program and cash flow from production attributable to the Chase Group Properties that we acquired in the combination transaction in February 2006. The increase in operating cash flows in 2006 over 2005 was principally due to increases in our oil and gas production as a result of our exploration and development program and cash flow from production attributable to the Chase Group Properties that we acquired in the combination transaction in February 2006. Cash Flow Used in Investing Activities During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we invested $162.63 million, $595.62 million and $55.62 million, respectively, for additions to, and acquisitions of, oil and gas properties, inclusive of dry hole costs. Cash flows used in investing activities were substantially higher during the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to the approximately $409.00 million cash portion of the consideration we paid to the Chase Group in the combination transaction and drilling activities in 2006. In order to preserve liquidity, we reduced our drilling activities and curtailed capital expenditures during the three months ended March 31, 2007, until we were able to complete our second lien term loan facility in March 2007. As a result, we recorded an expense during the six months ended June 30, 2007 of approximately $4.27 million for contract drilling fees related to stacked rigs subject to day work drilling contracts with two drilling contractors including Silver Oak Drilling. See Items Impacting Comparability of our Financial Results Curtailment of Drilling above. Cash Flow from Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $19.89 million, $476.61 million and $45.36 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In March 2007, we entered into a $200.00 million second lien term loan facility. The proceeds were principally used to repay the outstanding balance under our prior term loan facility and to reduce the outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility. In August 2007, we completed an initial public of our common stock. The aggregate net proceeds of approximately $173.00 million 44 Table of Contents received by us were utilized in equal parts to repay a portion of the New 2nd Lien Credit Facility on August 9, 2007, and to prepay a portion of the 1st Lien Credit Facility on August 20, 2007. Cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily due to borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund the approximately $409.00 million cash portion of the consideration paid to the Chase Group pursuant to the combination transaction and proceeds from private issuances of equity in our company. In 2005, cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity in our company, partially offset by payment of dividends on preferred stock. The increase during 2006 was primarily due to borrowings under our revolving credit agreement to fund the approximately $409.00 million cash portion of the consideration paid to the Chase Group and associated persons pursuant to the combination transaction and proceeds from private issuances of equity in our company. Bank Credit Facilities We have two separate bank credit facilities. The first is our credit facility agreement, dated February 24, 2006, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as the administrative agent for a group of lenders that provides a revolving line of credit having a total commitment of $475.00 million, which we refer to as our 1st Lien Credit Facility. The total amount that we can borrow and have outstanding at any one time is limited to the lesser of the total commitment of $475.00 million or the borrowing base established by the lenders. As of December 31, 2006, the borrowing base under our 1st Lien Credit Facility was $475.00 million, but was reduced to $375.00 million on March 27, 2007 in connection with the completion of our New 2nd Lien Credit Facility described below. Effective November 21, 2007, in conjunction with the regular redetermination as of June 30, 2007, the borrowing base under our 1st Lien Credit Facility was increased to $425.00 million. In February 2006, we incurred borrowings of approximately $421.00 million under our 1st Lien Credit Facility in connection with the combination transaction to pay the cash purchase price of $400.00 million to the Chase Group, $15.90 million to repay the balance on the prior revolving credit facility of Concho Equity Holdings Corp. and approximately $5.10 million for bank fees and legal costs associated with our 1st Lien Credit Facility. We also incurred borrowings of approximately $8.90 million in May 2006 in connection with the purchase of additional working interests in the Chase Group Properties pursuant to the combination transaction from persons associated with the Chase Group. The remaining borrowings under our 1st Lien Credit Facility during 2006 were used for working capital and to fund a portion of our exploration and development drilling program. During 2007, the outstanding balance on our 1st Lien Credit Facility was reduced by $239.70 million from $455.70 million at December 31, 2006 to $216.00 million at December 31, 2007. This reduction is the result of repayments we made with net proceeds of $154.00 million from our New 2nd Lien Credit Facility in March 2007 and the proceeds of $86.50 million from the initial public offering in August 2007. The second bank credit facility is our term loan agreement, dated March 27, 2007, with Bank of America, N.A., as the administrative agent for the other lenders thereunder, that provides a five year term loan in the amount of $200.0 million, the New 2nd Lien Credit Facility. Upon execution of the New 2nd Lien Credit Facility, we funded the full amount under that facility and received proceeds of $199.00 million to repay the $39.80 million outstanding under our 2nd Lien Credit Facility, to reduce the outstanding balance under our 1st Lien Credit Facility by $154.00 million and the remaining $5.20 million to pay loan fees, accrued interest and for general corporate purposes. We used net proceeds of approximately $173.00 million from our initial public offering that was completed in August 2007 to retire outstanding borrowings under our New 2nd Lien Credit Facility totaling $86.50 million and to retire outstanding borrowings under our 1st Lien Credit Facility totaling $86.50 million. 1st Lien Credit Facility. The 1st Lien Credit Facility allows us to borrow, repay and reborrow amounts available under the borrowing base. The amount of the borrowing base is based primarily upon the estimated value of our oil and natural gas reserves. The borrowing base under our 1st Lien Credit Facility is re-determined at least semi-annually. The 1st Lien Credit Facility matures on February 24, 2010, and borrowings bear interest, payable quarterly, at our option, at (1) a rate (as defined and further described in our revolving credit facility) per annum equal to a Eurodollar Rate (which is substantially the same as the London Interbank Offered Rate) for one, two, three or six months as offered by the lead bank under our 1st Lien Credit Facility, plus an applicable margin ranging from 100 to 225 basis points, or (2) such bank Prime Rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0 to 125 basis points, dependent in each case upon the percentage of our available borrowing base then utilized. Our 1st Lien Credit Facility bore interest at 6.16% per annum as of December 31, 2007. We pay quarterly commitment fees under 45 Table of Contents our 1st Lien Credit Facility on the unused portion of the available borrowing base ranging from 25 to 50 basis points, dependent upon the percentage of our available borrowing base then utilized. Borrowings under our 1st Lien Credit Facility are secured by a first lien on substantially all of our assets and properties. Our 1st Lien Credit Facility also contains restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things, pay cash dividends, incur additional indebtedness, sell assets, make loans to others, make investments, enter into mergers involving our company, incur liens and engage in certain other transactions without the prior consent of the lenders. The 1st Lien Credit Facility also requires us to maintain certain ratios as defined and further described in our 1st Lien Credit Facility agreement, including a current ratio of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 and a maximum leverage ratio (generally defined as the ratio of total funded debt to a defined measure of cash flow) of no greater than 4.0 to 1.0. In addition, at the inception of the 1st Lien Credit Facility, we had a one-time requirement to enter into hedging agreements (as defined in our 1st Lien Credit Facility agreement, but not necessarily accounted for as cash flow hedges in our financial statements) with respect to not less than 75% of our forecasted production through December 31, 2008, that was attributable to our proved developed producing reserves estimated as of December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with all such covenants. New 2nd Lien Credit Facility. The New 2nd Lien Credit Facility provides a $200.00 million term loan, which bears interest, at our option, at (1) a rate per annum equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate, plus an applicable margin of 425 basis points or (2) the prime rate, plus an applicable margin of 275 basis points. We have the option to select different interest periods, subject to availability, and interest is payable at the end of the interest period we select, though such interest payments must be made at least on a quarterly basis. We are required to repay $0.50 million of the outstanding balance on the last day of each calendar quarter, commencing June 30, 2007, until the remaining balance of the loan matures on March 27, 2012. Our New 2nd Lien Credit Facility bore interest at 9.23% per annum as of December 31, 2007. We have the right to prepay the outstanding balance at any time, provided, however, that we will incur a 2% prepayment penalty on any principal amount prepaid from March 27, 2008 until March 26, 2009 and a 1% prepayment penalty on any principal amount prepaid from March 27, 2009 until March 26, 2010. Borrowings under the New 2nd Lien Credit Facility are secured by a second lien on the same assets as are securing our 1st Lien Credit Facility, and are subordinated to liens securing our 1st Lien Credit Facility. The New 2nd Lien Credit Facility also contains various restrictive financial covenants and compliance requirements that are similar to those contained in the 1st Lien Credit Facility, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios. Future Capital Expenditures and Commitments We evaluate opportunities to purchase or sell oil and natural gas properties in the marketplace and could participate as a buyer or seller of properties at various times. We seek to acquire oil and gas properties that provide opportunities for the addition of reserves and production through a combination of exploitation, development, high-potential exploration and control of operations and that will allow us to apply our operating expertise or that otherwise have geologic characteristics that are similar to our existing properties. Expenditures for the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties are the primary use of our capital resources. We invested approximately $183.0 million for exploration and development expenditures in 2007 as follows (in millions): Amount Drilling and recompletion opportunities in our core operating area $ 135.2 Projects in our emerging plays 28.9 Projects operated by third parties 14.2 Acquisition of leasehold acreage and other property interests 4.7 Total 2007 exploration and development expenditures $ 183.0 46 Table of Contents On November 8, 2007, our board of directors approved our 2008 exploration and development budget in the amount of $250.4 million. We anticipate investing our 2008 exploration and development budget as follows (in millions): 2008 Budget Drilling and recompletion opportunities in our core operating areas $ 209.5 Projects operated by third parties 14.3 Emerging plays, acquisition of leasehold acreage and other property interests, and geological and geophysical 20.0 Maintenance capital in our core operating areas 6.6 Total 2008 exploration and development budget $ 250.4 Other than leasehold acreage and other property interests shown above, our 2007 and 2008 exploration and development budgets are exclusive of acquisitions. We do not have a specific acquisition budget since the timing and size of acquisitions are difficult to forecast. Although we cannot provide any assurance, assuming successful implementation of our strategy, including the future development of our proved reserves and realization of our cash flows as anticipated, we believe that our remaining cash balance and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our 2008 exploration and development budget; however, we could use our revolving credit facility to fund such expenditures. The actual amount and timing of our expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, actual drilling results, the timing of expenditures by third parties on projects that we do not operate, the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, and regulatory, technological and competitive developments. In addition, under certain circumstances we would consider increasing or reallocating our 2008 capital budget. Commodity Derivatives and Hedging We account for derivative instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133. The specific accounting treatment for changes in the market value of the derivative instruments is determined based on whether we designate the derivative instruments as a cash flow or fair value hedge and effectiveness of the hedge. Certain of our derivative contracts related to oil production entered into prior to 2007 are accounted for as cash flow hedges. As described below, certain natural gas derivative contracts were originally designated as cash flow hedges, but because of a change in the correlation between the underlying natural gas production and the index referenced in the derivative contracts, we have discontinued hedge accounting related to natural gas contracts as of July 1, 2007. Management has not and does not currently intend to designate or account for derivative contracts entered into subsequent to June 30, 2007 as cash flow hedges. We have utilized fixed-price contracts and zero-cost collars to reduce exposure to unfavorable changes in oil and natural gas prices that are subject to significant and often volatile fluctuation. Under the fixed price physical delivery contracts, we receive the fixed price stated in the contract. Under the zero-cost collars, if the market price of crude oil or natural gas, as applicable, is less than the ceiling strike price and greater than the floor strike price, we receive the market price. If the market price of crude oil or natural gas, as applicable, exceeds the ceiling strike price or falls below the floor strike price, we receive the applicable collar strike price. As of June 30, 2007, we determined that all of our natural gas commodity contracts no longer qualified as hedges under the requirements of SFAS No. 133, for the reason stated in the following paragraph. These contracts are referred to as dedesignated hedges. A key requirement for designation of derivative instruments as cash flow hedges is that at both the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the term of the hedge. Generally, the hedging relationship can be considered to be highly effective if there is a high degree of historical correlation between the hedging instrument and the forecasted transaction. In prior periods and through June 30, 2007, prices received for our natural gas were highly correlated with the Inside FERC El Paso Natural Gas index, which we refer to herein as the Index, which 47 Table of Contents is the index referenced in all of our natural gas derivative instruments. However, subsequent to June 30, 2007, this historical relationship has not met the criteria as being highly correlated. Natural gas produced from our New Mexico Shelf assets has a substantial component of natural gas liquids. Prices received for natural gas liquids are not highly correlated to the price of natural gas, but are more closely correlated to the price of oil. During the third quarter of 2007, the price of oil and natural gas liquids, and therefore the prices we received for our natural gas (including natural gas liquids), rose substantially and at a significantly higher rate than the corresponding change in the Index. This resulted in a decrease in correlation between the prices received and the Index below the level required for cash flow hedge accounting. According to SFAS No. 133, an entity should discontinue prospectively hedge accounting for an existing hedge if the hedge is no longer highly effective. Hedge accounting must be discontinued regardless of whether we believe the hedge will be prospectively highly effective. The hedge must be discontinued during the period the hedges became ineffective. As a result, any changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings under (Gain) loss on derivatives not designated as hedges . Because the natural gas and natural gas liquids prices fluctuate at different rates over time, the loss of effectiveness does not relate to any single date. June 30, 2007 is considered the last date our natural gas hedges were highly effective, and we have discontinued hedge accounting during the six months ended December 31, 2007 and all periods thereafter. Mark-to-market adjustments related to these dedesignated hedges are recorded each period to (Gain) loss on derivatives not designated as hedges . Effective portions of dedesignated hedges, previously recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income as of June 30, 2007, will remain in Accumulated other comprehensive income and be reclassified into earnings under Natural gas revenues , during the periods which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. We do not intend to attempt to re-designate these natural gas derivatives as cash flow hedges in future periods; rather, they will be accounted for as described above through the remaining derivative contract term. On September 20, 2007, we entered into four crude oil price swaps to hedge an additional portion of our estimated crude oil production for calendar years 2008 and 2009. The contracts are for 1,000 Bbls per day each with various fixed prices. We have not designated these derivative instruments as cash flow hedges. Mark-to-market adjustments related to these derivative instruments will be recorded each period to (Gain) loss on derivatives not designated as hedges. At December 31, 2007, we had oil price swaps that settle on a monthly basis covering future oil production from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2009. The volumes are detailed in the table below. Subsequent to December 31, 2007, oil futures prices have increased significantly and have risen to a level that exceeds the weighted average price swap fixed price of $78.45. The average futures NYMEX price for the year ended December 31, 2007, was $72.39. As of March 27, 2008, the NYMEX futures price was $107.58. At this level, we will continue to remit the excess of the average monthly NYMEX futures price for each settlement period over the weighted average price swap fixed price of $78.45. These payments should not significantly affect our cash flow since (1) payments made to counterparties to these contracts should be substantially offset by increased commodity prices received on the sale of our production and (2) only a portion of the total contract volume settles each month. The increase in oil prices, should it continue, will negatively affect the fair value of our commodities contracts as recorded in our balance sheet at March 31, 2008, during future periods and, consequently, our reported net income. Changes in the recorded fair value of certain of our commodity derivatives are marked to market through earnings and are likely to result in substantial charges to earnings for the decrease in the fair value of these contracts during the first quarter of 2008. If oil prices continue to increase, this negative effect on earnings will become more significant. We are currently unable to estimate the effects on earnings in the first quarter of 2008, but the effects may be substantial. 48 Table of Contents The table below provides the volumes and related data associated with our oil and natural gas derivatives as of December 31, 2007: Aggregate Fair Market Value Remaining Daily Index Contract Asset/(Liability) Volume Volume Price Period (In thousands) Cash flow hedges: Crude oil (volumes in Bbls): Price swap (23,942 ) 951,600 2,600 $67.50(a) 1/1/08 - 12/31/08 Cash flow hedges dedesignated: Natural gas (volumes in MMBtus): Price collar 1,866 4,941,000 13,500 $6.50 - $9.35(b) 1/1/08 - 12/31/08 Derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges: Crude oil (volumes in Bbls): Price swap (12,472 ) 732,000 2,000 $75.78(a)(c) 1/1/08 - 12/31/08 Price swap (10,517 ) 730,000 2,000 $72.84(a)(c) 1/1/09 - 12/31/09 Net liability $ (45,065 ) (a) The index prices for the oil price swaps are based on the NYMEX-West Texas Intermediate monthly average futures price.

An executive officer resigned as of March 31, 2008, and the Company will be obligated to pay such person 1/12th of his base salary for each month from April 2008 through March 2009 as consideration for such person covenant not to compete with the Company in accordance with his employment agreement. 49 Table of Contents (e) Amounts represent costs related to expected oil and gas property abandonments related to proved reserves by period, net of any future accretion. Off-balance Sheet Arrangements Currently we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies and Practices Our historical consolidated financial statements and notes to our historical consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to our management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that our management make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. However, the accounting principles used by us generally do not change our reported cash flows or liquidity. Interpretation of the existing rules must be done and judgments made on how the specifics of a given rule apply to us. In management opinion, the more significant reporting areas impacted by management judgments and estimates are revenue recognition, the choice of accounting method for oil and natural gas activities, oil and natural gas reserve estimation, asset retirement obligations and impairment of assets. Management judgments and estimates in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources, including engineers, geologists and historical experience in similar matters. Actual results could differ from the estimates, as additional information becomes known. Successful Efforts Method of Accounting We utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities under this method. Exploration expenses, including geological and geophysical costs, lease rentals and exploratory dry holes, are charged against income as incurred. Costs of successful wells and related production equipment, undeveloped leases and developmental dry holes are also capitalized. This accounting method may yield significantly different results than the full cost method of accounting. Exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized, but are charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found proved reserves. Generally, a gain or loss is recognized when producing properties are sold. The application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires management judgment to determine the proper designation of wells as either developmental or exploratory, which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of costs of dry holes. Once a well is drilled, the determination that proved reserves have been discovered may take considerable time, and requires both judgment and application of industry experience. The evaluation of oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs included in unproved properties requires management judgment to estimate the fair value of such properties. Drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn our leasehold positions. Non-producing properties consist of undeveloped leasehold costs and costs associated with the purchase of certain proved undeveloped reserves. Individually significant non-producing properties are periodically assessed for impairment of value. Depreciation of capitalized drilling and development costs of oil and natural gas properties is computed using the unit-of-production method on an individual property or unit basis based on total estimated proved developed oil and natural gas reserves. Depletion of producing leaseholds is based on the unit-of-production method using our total estimated net proved reserves. In arriving at rates under the unit-of-production method, the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas are established based on estimates made by our geologists and engineers and independent engineers. Service properties, equipment and other assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of 1 to 50 years. Upon sale or retirement of depreciable or depletable property, the cost and related accumulated depletion are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized. 50 Table of Contents Oil and Natural Gas Reserves and Standardized Measure of Future Cash Flows Our independent engineers and technical staff prepare the estimates of our oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net cash flows. Current accounting guidance allows only proved oil and natural gas reserves to be included in our financial statement disclosures. The SEC has defined proved reserves as the estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Even though our independent engineers and technical staff are knowledgeable and follow authoritative guidelines for estimating reserves, they must make a number of subjective assumptions based on professional judgments in developing the reserve estimates. Reserve estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information about each field. Periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future cash flows may be necessary as a result of a number of factors, including reservoir performance, new drilling, oil and natural gas prices, cost changes, technological advances, new geological or geophysical data, or other economic factors. We cannot predict the amounts or timing of future reserve revisions. If such revisions are significant, they could significantly alter future DD&A and result in impairment of assets that may be material. Asset Retirement Obligations In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and the normal operation of a long-lived asset. The primary impact of this standard on us relates to oil and natural gas wells on which we have a legal obligation to plug and abandon. SFAS No. 143 requires us to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The determination of the fair value of the liability requires us to make numerous judgments and estimates, including judgments and estimates related to future costs to plug and abandon wells, future inflation rates and estimated lives of the related assets. Impairment of Assets All of our long-lived assets are monitored for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may be greater than its future net cash flows, including cash flows from risk adjusted proved reserves. The evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future events, such as future sales prices for oil and natural gas, future costs to produce these products, estimates of future oil and natural gas reserves to be recovered and the timing thereof, the economic and regulatory climates and other factors. The need to test a field for impairment may result from significant declines in sales prices or downward revisions to estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves. Any assets held for sale are reviewed for impairment when we approve the plan to sell. Estimates of anticipated sales prices are highly judgmental and subject to material revision in future periods. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors, we cannot predict when or if future impairment charges will be recorded. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurement. This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We adopted SFAS No. 157 effective January 1, 2008, and it has had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, which will become effective in 2008. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to measure eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other generally accepted accounting principles. The fair value measurement election is irrevocable and subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings. We adopted this statement January 1, 2008 and did 51 Table of Contents not elect the fair value option for any of its eligible financial instruments or other items. As such, the adoption had no impact on the consolidated financial statements. In April 2007, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FIN 39-1, Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39 ( FIN No. 39-1 ). FIN No. 39-1 clarifies that a reporting entity that is party to a master netting arrangement can offset fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) against fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments that have been offset under the same master netting arrangement. FIN No. 39-1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Adoption of FIN No. 39-1 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2007, the FASB ratified a consensus opinion reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ) on EITF Issue 06-11, Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment Awards. EITF Issue 06-11 requires an employer to recognize tax benefits realized from dividend or dividend equivalents paid to employees for certain share-based payment awards as an increase to additional paid-in capital and include such amounts in the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb future tax deficiencies on share-based payment awards. If an entity estimate of forfeitures increases (or actual forfeitures exceed the entity estimates), or if an award is no longer expected to vest, entities should reclassify the dividends or dividend equivalents paid on that award from retained earnings to compensation cost. However, the tax benefits from dividends that are reclassified from additional paid-in capital to the income statement are limited to the entity pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies on the date of reclassification. The consensus in EITF Issue 06-11 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2007. Retrospective application of EITF Issue 06-11 is not permitted. Early adoption is permitted; however, we do not intend to adopt EITF Issue 06-11 prior to the required effective date of January 1, 2008. We do not expect the adoption of EITF Issue 06-11 to have a significant effect on our financial statements since we historically have accounted for the income tax benefits of dividends paid for share-based payment awards in the manner described in the consensus. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations ( SFAS No. 141(R) ), which replaces FASB Statement No. 141. SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any non- controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. The Statement also establishes disclosure requirements that will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for acquisitions that occur in an entity fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2008, which will be our fiscal year 2009. The impact, if any, will depend on the nature and size of business combinations we consummate after the effective date. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51. SFAS No. 160 requires that accounting and reporting for minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. SFAS No. 160 also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS No. 160 applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements, except not-for-profit organizations, but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary. This statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2008, which will be our fiscal year 2009. Based upon our December 31, 2007 balance sheet, the statement would have no impact. Inflation Historically, general inflationary trends have not had a material effect on our operating results. However, we have experienced inflationary pressure on technical staff compensation and the cost of oilfield services and equipment due to the increase in drilling activity and competitive pressures resulting from higher oil and natural gas prices in recent years. 52 Table of Contents
