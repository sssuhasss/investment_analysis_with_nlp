ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS General Information We provide scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the United States ( U.S. ) and around the world. On October 29, 2008 (the Closing Date ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours merged (the Merger ) with and into Northwest Airlines Corporation. On the Closing Date, Northwest Airlines Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Northwest Airlines, Inc. (collectively, Northwest ), became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Delta. On December 31, 2009, Northwest Airlines, Inc. merged with and into Delta. As a result of this merger, Northwest Airlines, Inc. ceased to exist as a separate entity. We believe the Merger better positions us to manage through economic cycles and volatile fuel prices, invest in our fleet, improve services for customers and achieve our strategic objectives. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( GAAP ). In accordance with GAAP, our financial results include the results of Northwest for the periods after the Closing Date, but not for periods on or before the Closing Date. Our financial results under GAAP for the year ended December 31, 2009 include the results of Northwest for the full year. In contrast, our financial results under GAAP for the year ended December 31, 2008 include the results of Northwest only from October 30 to December 31, 2008. Accordingly, our financial results under GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are not comparable. In the accompanying Financial Highlights 2009 GAAP Compared to 2008 Combined and Results of Operations 2009 GAAP Compared to 2008 Combined, we sometimes use information that is derived from our Consolidated Financial Statements, but that is not presented in accordance with GAAP. Certain of this information is considered non-GAAP financial measures under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. These non-GAAP financial measures include financial information for the year ended December 31, 2008 presented on a combined basis, which means the financial results for pre-Merger Delta and pre-Merger Northwest are combined beginning January 1, 2008. We believe this presentation of the 2008 financial results provides a more meaningful basis for comparing Delta financial performance in 2009 and 2008. See Results of Operations 2009 GAAP Compared to 2008 Combined and Supplemental Information below for the reasons we use combined and other non-GAAP financial measures, as well as a reconciliation to the corresponding measures under GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. Financial Highlights 2009 GAAP Compared to 2008 Combined For 2009, we reported a net loss of $1.2 billion. These results reflect significant weakness in the airline revenue environment due to the global recession and $1.4 billion in fuel hedge losses. Our net loss for the year also includes a $407 million charge for merger-related items, a $321 million non-cash income tax benefit and an $83 million non-cash loss on the extinguishment of debt. Total operating revenue declined $6.2 billion, or 18%, in 2009 on a 6% decrease in system capacity, or available seat mile ( ASMs ), compared with 2008 on a combined basis. Passenger revenue accounted for $5.9 billion of the decrease. Passenger revenue per ASM ( PRASM ) declined 14% on a 14% decrease in passenger mile yield. The decrease in passenger mile yield reflects (1) significantly reduced demand, particularly in international markets, (2) a reduction in business demand, (3) competitive pricing pressures and (4) lower fuel surcharges due to the year-over-year decline on fuel prices. Volatile fuel prices continue to represent a significant risk to our business and the airline industry as a whole. While our fuel cost per gallon declined 35% in 2009 compared to 2008 on a combined basis, contributing to $5.4 billion in lower fuel expense excluding the mark-to-market adjustments related to fuel hedges settling in future periods, crude oil prices have risen 78% from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009. We have focused on maintaining a competitive cost structure through disciplined spending, productivity initiatives and accelerating Merger synergies. Our consolidated operating cost per ASM ( CASM ), excluding special items (as defined in Supplemental Information below) and fuel expense, increased 4% on a 6% lower capacity in 2009 compared to 2008 on a combined basis. The increase primarily reflects an increase in pension expense from a decrease in value in pension trust assets due to declines in the financial markets during 2008. 28 Table of Contents At December 31, 2009, we had $4.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and $685 million in undrawn revolving credit facilities. In 2009, we completed $3.2 billion in financing transactions. For additional information regarding these financing transactions, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Business Overview Recent Initiatives. We believe that our global network, hub structure and alliances with other airlines enables us to offer customers a service which results in a competitive advantage over other domestic and international airlines. In 2009, we implemented a joint venture with Air France-KLM that further strengthens our transatlantic network, expanded our alliance agreement with Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air to enhance our West coast presence, and received U.S. Department of Transportation approval for a codesharing agreement with Virgin Blue, which will expand our network between the U.S. and Australia and the South Pacific. Expanding our presence in New York City through increased corporate sales, improved facilities and increased and new service from New York is a key component of our network strategy. For example, we continue to make investments in our international operation at New York-JFK and explore long-term options to upgrade the facility. In addition, in August 2009, we announced our intention to make New York LaGuardia Airport a domestic hub through a slot transaction with US Airways. The agreement calls for US Airways to transfer 125 operating slot pairs to us at LaGuardia and for us to transfer 42 operating slot pairs to US Airways at Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C. We also plan to swap gates at LaGuardia to consolidate all of our operations (including the Delta Shuttle) into an expanded main terminal facility with 11 additional gates. The U.S. Department of Transportation has issued a tentative order on the transaction that would require the divestiture of 20 slot pairs at LaGuardia and 14 slot pairs at Reagan National. We and US Airways are reviewing the tentative order to determine our next steps. We also plan to invest $1 billion through mid-2013 to improve the customer experience and the efficiency of our aircraft fleet. Planned enhancements include installing full flat-bed seats in BusinessElite on 90 trans-oceanic aircraft, adding in-seat audio and video throughout Economy Class on 68 widebody aircraft, adding First Class cabins to 66 CRJ-700 aircraft and installing winglets on more than 170 aircraft to extend aircraft range and increase fuel efficiency. Merger Synergies. As a result of our integration efforts, we achieved more than $700 million in Merger synergy benefits in 2009, and we are targeting an additional $600 million in Merger synergy benefits in 2010. In 2009, we completed a significant portion of our Merger integration, including combining frequent flyer programs, consolidating and rebranding all airport facilities and achieving a single operating certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration. Our ability to fully realize targeted annual synergies of $2 billion by 2012 is dependent on various factors, including the integration of technologies of the two pre-Merger airlines, which we expect to occur in the first half of 2010. In January 2010, we completed the integration of the Northwest reservations system, including the transition of Northwest flights and passenger reservations into the Delta system. Results of Operations 2009 GAAP Compared to 2008 Combined In this section, we compare Delta results of operations under GAAP for the year ended December 31, 2009 with Delta results on a combined basis for the year ended December 31, 2008. As discussed in General Information above, Delta results of operations for 2008 on a combined basis add (1) Delta results of operations under GAAP for 2008, which includes Northwest results from October 30 to December 31, 2008; and (2) Northwest results from January 1 to October 29, 2008. We believe this presentation of the 2008 financial results provides a more meaningful basis for comparing Delta financial performance in 2009 and 2008. 29 Table of Contents Operating Revenue 2008 2009 GAAP vs. 2008 Combined GAAP Year Ended GAAP Northwest Combined % December 31, Year Ended January 1 to Year Ended Increase Increase (in millions) 2009 December 31 October 29 December 31 (Decrease) (Decrease) Operating Revenue: Passenger: Domestic $ 10,863 $ 8,707 $ 4,872 $ 13,579 $ (2,716 ) (20 )% Atlantic 4,357 4,390 1,450 5,840 (1,483 ) (25 )% Latin America 1,268 1,362 131 1,493 (225 ) (15 )% Pacific 2,034 678 2,029 2,707 (673 ) (25 )% Total Mainline 18,522 15,137 8,482 23,619 (5,097 ) (22 )% Regional carriers 5,285 4,446 1,643 6,089 (804 ) (13 )% Total passenger revenue 23,807 19,583 10,125 29,708 (5,901 ) (20 )% Cargo 788 686 667 1,353 (565 ) (42 )% Other, net 3,468 2,428 799 3,227 241 7 % Total operating revenue $ 28,063 $ 22,697 $ 11,591 $ 34,288 $ (6,225 ) (18 )% Increase (Decrease) 2009 GAAP vs. 2008 Combined GAAP Year Ended Passenger December 31, Passenger ASMs Mile Load (in millions) 2009 Revenue RPMs (Traffic) (Capacity) Yield PRASM Factor Passenger Revenue: Domestic $ 10,863 (20 )% (8 )% (8 )% (14 )% (14 )% Atlantic 4,357 (25 )% (8 )% (9 )% (20 )% (19 )% 0.9 pts Latin America 1,268 (15 )% (4 )% (2 )% (12 )% (14 )% (1.5) pts Pacific 2,034 (25 )% (12 )% (8 )% (14 )% (17 )% (3.5) pts Total Mainline 18,522 (22 )% (8 )% (7 )% (15 )% (15 )% (0.3) pts Regional carriers 5,285 (13 )% (1 )% % (13 )% (13 )% (0.1) pts Total passenger revenue $ 23,807 (20 )% (7 )% (6 )% (14 )% (14 )% (0.4) pts Mainline Passenger Revenue. Mainline passenger revenue decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 on a combined basis primarily due to weakened demand for air travel from the global recession, capacity reductions and the effects of the H1N1 virus on passenger travel. Passenger mile yield and PRASM both declined 15%. Domestic Passenger Revenue . Domestic passenger revenue decreased 20% from a 14% decrease in PRASM on an 8% decline in capacity. The passenger mile yield decreased 14%, reflecting (1) a reduction in business demand due to the global recession, (2) an overall decrease in average fares due to competitive pricing pressures and (3) lower fuel surcharges due to the year-over-year decline in fuel prices. International Passenger Revenue . International passenger revenue decreased 24% from an 18% decrease in PRASM on an 7% decline in capacity. The passenger mile yield decreased 17%, reflecting (1) significantly reduced demand for international travel, (2) competitive pricing pressures (especially in the Atlantic market, which experienced a 20% decrease in passenger mile yield), primarily from a significant decrease in business demand due to the global recession and (3) the impact of the H1N1 virus, most notably in the Pacific and Latin America markets. The decrease in passenger mile yield in the Atlantic market also reflects unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and lower fuel surcharges due to the year-over-year decline in fuel prices. 30 Table of Contents Regional carriers . Passenger revenue of regional carriers declined $804 million primarily as a result of a 13% decrease in passenger mile yield while traffic and capacity remained flat. The decrease in passenger mile yield reflects (1) a reduction in demand for air travel due to the global recession and (2) an overall decrease in average fares due to competitive pricing pressures. Cargo . Cargo revenue decreased due to capacity reductions, significantly reduced cargo yields and international volume as a result of the global recession, and lower fuel surcharges due to the year-over-year decline in fuel prices. During 2009, we retired our remaining 10 dedicated freighter B-747-200F aircraft, which contributed to a 40% decline in capacity. Other, net . Other, net revenue increased $241 million primarily due to new or increased baggage handling fees and higher SkyMiles program revenue, partially offset by decreased revenue from our alliance agreements and a reduction in our aircraft maintenance and repair service.

Aircraft fuel and related taxes decreased $5.0 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 on a combined basis primarily due to (1) $4.8 billion associated with lower average fuel prices and (2) $858 million from a 7% decline in fuel consumption due to capacity reductions. These decreases were partially offset by $1.4 billion in fuel hedge losses for 2009, compared to $666 million in fuel hedge losses for 2008. The fuel hedge losses in 2009 are primarily from hedges purchased in 2008 during the period fuel prices reached record highs and were expected to continue to rise. Salaries and related costs . Salaries and related costs increased $289 million due to (1) pay increases for pilot and non-pilot frontline employees, (2) higher pension expense from a decline in the value of our defined benefit plan assets as a result of market conditions and (3) Delta airline tickets awarded to employees as part of an employee recognition program. These increases were partially offset by a 5% average decrease in headcount primarily related to workforce reduction programs. Contract carrier arrangements . Contract carrier arrangements expense decreased $844 million primarily due to decreases of (1) $714 million associated with lower average fuel prices and (2) $119 million from a 7% decline in fuel consumption due to capacity reductions. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased $784 million as a result of (1) $641 million in impairment related charges recorded in the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily related to certain definite-lived intangible assets and aircraft, and (2) $125 million related to the December 2008 multi-year extension of our co-brand credit card relationship with American Express (the American Express Agreement ), extending the useful life of the American Express Agreement intangible asset to the date the contract expires. Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs. Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs decreased $347 million primarily from capacity reductions. Passenger commissions and other selling expenses. Passenger commissions and other selling expenses decreased $362 million primarily in connection with the passenger revenue decrease. Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. During 2008, we experienced a significant decline in market capitalization primarily from record high fuel prices and overall airline industry conditions. In addition, the announcement of our intention to merge with Northwest established a stock exchange ratio based on the relative valuation of Delta and Northwest. We determined goodwill was impaired and recorded a non-cash charge of $10.2 billion on a combined basis. We also recorded a non-cash charge of $955 million on a combined basis to reduce the carrying value of certain intangible assets based on their revised estimated fair values. Restructuring and merger-related items. Restructuring and merger-related items decreased $949 million, primarily due to the following: During 2009, we recorded a $288 million charge for merger-related items associated with integrating the operations of Northwest into Delta, including costs related to information technology, employee relocation and training, and re-branding of aircraft and stations. We expect to incur total cash costs of approximately $500 million over approximately three years to integrate the two airlines. For 2009, we recorded a $119 million charge in connection with employee workforce reduction programs. During 2008, we recorded $1.2 billion primarily in non-cash, merger-related charges related to the issuance or vesting of employee equity awards in connection with the Merger and $114 million in restructuring and related charges in connection with voluntary workforce reduction programs. In addition, we recorded charges of $25 million related to the closure of certain facilities and $14 million associated with the early termination of certain contract carrier arrangements. 32 Table of Contents Other (Expense) Income 2008 GAAP Year Ended GAAP Northwest Combined December 31, Year Ended January 1 to Year Ended Favorable (in millions) 2009 December 31 October 29 December 31 (Unfavorable) Interest expense $ (1,278 ) $ (705 ) $ (373 ) $ (1,078 ) $ (200 ) Interest income 27 92 86 178 (151 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt (83 ) (83 ) Miscellaneous, net 77 (114 ) (230 ) (344 ) 421 Total other expense, net $ (1,257 ) $ (727 ) $ (517 ) $ (1,244 ) $ (13 ) Other expense, net for 2009 was $1.3 billion, compared to $1.2 billion for 2008 on a combined basis. This change is primarily attributable to (1) a $200 million increase in interest expense from increased amortization of debt discount, (2) a $151 million decrease in interest income primarily from significantly reduced short-term interest rates, (3) an $83 million non-cash loss for the write-off of the unamortized discount on the extinguishment of the Northwest senior secured exit financing facility (the Bank Credit Facility ) and (4) a $421 million favorable change in miscellaneous, net due to the following: Favorable (Unfavorable) 2009 GAAP vs. (in millions) 2008 Combined Miscellaneous, net Impairment in 2008 of minority ownership interest in Midwest Air Partners, LLC $ 213 Foreign currency exchange rates 99 Mark-to-market adjustments on the ineffective portion of fuel hedge contracts 77 Loss on investments in The Reserve Primary Fund and insured auction rate securities in 2008 41 Other (9 ) Total miscellaneous, net $ 421 Income Taxes 2008 GAAP Year Ended GAAP Northwest Combined December 31, Year Ended January 1 to Year Ended (in millions) 2009 December 31 October 29 December 31 Increase Income tax benefit $ 344 $ 119 $ 211 $ 330 $ 14 We consider all income sources, including other comprehensive income, in determining the amount of tax benefit that should be allocated to continuing operations. For 2009, we recorded an income tax benefit of $344 million, including a non-cash income tax benefit of $321 million on the loss from continuing operations, with an offsetting non-cash income tax expense of $321 million on other comprehensive income. We did not record an income tax benefit for the remainder of our loss for 2009. The deferred tax asset resulting from such a net operating loss was fully reserved by a valuation allowance. We recorded an income tax benefit of $330 million for 2008 on a combined basis as a result of the impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. The impairment of goodwill did not result in an income tax benefit as goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. We did not record an income tax benefit as a result of our loss for 2008. The deferred tax asset resulting from such a net operating loss is fully reserved by a valuation allowance. 33 Table of Contents Results of Operations 2008 GAAP Compared to 2007 Predecessor plus Successor In September 2005, we and substantially all of our subsidiaries (the Delta Debtors ) filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On April 30, 2007 (the Effective Date ), the Delta Debtors emerged from bankruptcy. References in this Form 10-K to Successor refer to Delta on or after May 1, 2007, after giving effect to (1) the cancellation of Delta common stock issued prior to the Effective Date; (2) the issuance of new Delta common stock and certain debt securities in accordance with the Delta Debtors Joint Plan of Reorganization ( Delta Plan of Reorganization ); and (3) the application of fresh start reporting. References to Predecessor refer to Delta prior to May 1, 2007. We adopted fresh start reporting upon emergence from Chapter 11, which resulted in our becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. Due to our adoption of fresh start reporting on April 30, 2007, the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2007 include the results of operations for (1) the four months ended April 30, 2007 of the Predecessor and (2) the eight months ended December 31, 2007 of the Successor. In this section, we added the results of operations for the four months ended April 30, 2007 of the Predecessor with the eight months ended December 31, 2007 of the Successor. We then compared (1) Delta results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 under GAAP with (2) the 2007 Predecessor plus Successor results. We believe this presentation of the 2007 financial results provides a more meaningful basis for comparing Delta financial performance in 2008 and 2007.

As a result of the Merger, our results of operations under GAAP for 2008 include Northwest operations for the period from October 30 to December 31, 2008, which increased our operating revenue by $2.0 billion in 2008 compared to the 2007 Predecessor plus Successor results. The addition of Northwest to our operations for that period increased ASMs, or capacity, 10% for the full year. 34 Table of Contents Increase (Decrease) 2008 GAAP vs. 2007 Predecessor + Successor GAAP Year Ended Passenger December 31, Mile Load (in millions) 2008 Yield PRASM Factor Passenger Revenue: Domestic $ 8,707 4 % 6 % 2.1pts Atlantic 4,390 9 % 7 % (1.2)pts Latin America 1,362 13 % 16 % 2.1pts Pacific 678 4 % 4 % 0.2pts Total Mainline 15,137 6 % 7 % 1.0pts Regional carriers 4,446 5 % 6 % 0.8pts Total passenger revenue $ 19,583 5 % 6 % 1.0pts Mainline Passenger Revenue. Mainline passenger revenue increased in 2008 compared to the 2007 Predecessor plus Successor results primarily due to (1) the inclusion of Northwest operations, (2) fare increases in response to increased fuel charges, (3) pricing and scheduling initiatives and (4) our increased service to international destinations. The increase in passenger revenue reflects a rise of 6% and 7% in passenger mile yield and PRASM, respectively. Domestic Passenger Revenue . Domestic passenger revenue increased 8%, due to a 2.1 point increase in load factor and a 6% increase in PRASM on a 1% increase in capacity. The passenger mile yield increased 4%. The increases in passenger revenue and PRASM reflect (1) the inclusion of Northwest operations and (2) fare increases, higher yields and our reduction of domestic flights in response to high fuel prices and the slowing economy. Excluding Northwest operations, we reduced domestic capacity by 7% for the year. International Passenger Revenue . International passenger revenue increased 38%, due to a 27% increase in capacity from growth in our international operations and the inclusion of Northwest operations, and a 9% increase in PRASM. The passenger mile yield increased 9% due to fuel surcharges and increases in service to international destinations, primarily in the Atlantic and Latin America markets, from the restructuring of our route network. Excluding Northwest operations, we increased international capacity by 14% for the year. Regional carriers . Passenger revenue of regional affiliates increased due to the inclusion of Northwest operations. Excluding Northwest operations, regional carriers revenue declined $58 million primarily due to an 8% decrease in capacity in response to high fuel prices and the slowing economy, as well as the termination of certain contract carrier agreements. Cargo . Cargo revenue increased due to the inclusion of Northwest operations and an increase in fuel surcharges, improved cargo yields, and higher international volume. Other, net . Other, net revenue increased primarily due to the inclusion of Northwest operations. Excluding Northwest operations, other, net revenue increased $485 million primarily due to (1) new or increased administrative service charges and baggage handling fees, (2) growth in aircraft maintenance and staffing services to third parties and (3) higher SkyMiles program revenue. 35 Table of Contents Operating Expense Increase (Decrease) due to: Predecessor + Northwest GAAP Successor Operations Year Ended Year Ended October 30 to Restructuring December 31, December 31, Increase December 31, and merger- Fuel (in millions) 2008 2007 (Decrease) 2008 related items Impairments Expense Other Operating Expense: Aircraft fuel and related taxes $7,346 $4,686 $2,660 $718 $ $ $1,942 $ Salaries and related costs 4,329 3,759 570 504 66 Contract carrier arrangements 3,766 3,275 491 144 303 44 Depreciation and amortization 1,266 1,164 102 91 11 Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs 1,169 983 186 113 73 Contracted services 1,062 910 152 128 24 Passenger commissions and other selling expenses 1,030 933 97 130 (33 ) Landing fees and other rents 787 725 62 106 (44 ) Passenger service 440 338 102 35 67 Aircraft rent 307 246 61 40 21 Profit sharing 158 (158 ) (158 ) Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 7,296 7,296 7,296 Restructuring and merger-related items (1) 1,131 1,131 1,131 Other 1,082 881 201 88 113 Total operating expense $ 31,011 $ 18,058 $ 12,953 $ 2,097 $ 1,131 $ 7,296 $ 2,245 $184 (1) Restructuring and merger-related items include $333 million in one-time merger-related charges, as discussed below related to Northwest for the period from October 30 to December 31, 2008. Northwest Operations. As a result of the Merger, our results of operations under GAAP for 2008 include Northwest operations for the period from October 30 to December 31, 2008, which increased operating expense by $2.1 billion in 2008 compared to the 2007 Predecessor plus Successor results. The addition of Northwest for that period increased capacity 10% for the full year. Restructuring and merger-related items. Restructuring and merger-related items totaled a $1.1 billion charge, primarily consisting of the following: Merger-related charges. $978 million in one-time primarily non-cash charges relating to the issuance or vesting of employee equity awards in connection with the Merger. Severance and related costs. $114 million in restructuring and related charges in connection with two voluntary workforce reduction programs for U.S. non-pilot employees announced in March 2008 in which approximately 4,200 employees elected to participate. Facilities and other. $25 million in facilities charges primarily related to accruals for future lease obligations for previously announced plans to close operations in Concourse C at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (the Cincinnati Airport ). 36 Table of Contents Contract carrier restructuring. $14 million in charges associated with the early termination of certain capacity purchase agreements with regional air carriers. Impairments. During 2008, we experienced a significant decline in market capitalization primarily from record high fuel prices and overall airline industry conditions. In addition, the announcement of our intention to merge with Northwest established a stock exchange ratio based on the relative valuation of Delta and Northwest. As a result, we determined goodwill was impaired and recorded a non-cash charge of $6.9 billion. We also recorded a non-cash charge of $357 million to reduce the carrying value of certain intangible assets based on their revised estimated fair values. Fuel expense . Fuel expense, including contract carriers, increased $2.2 billion, primarily due to higher average fuel prices, which were partially offset by fuel hedge gains and reduced consumption from lower capacity. Fuel prices averaged $3.18 per gallon, including fuel hedge gains of $134 million, for 2008, compared to $2.24 per gallon, including fuel hedge gains of $51 million, for 2007. Salaries and related costs. Salaries and related costs increased $66 million primarily from a 6% average increase in pilots and flight attendants to staff increased international flying, annual pay increases for all pilot and non-pilot non-management employees, and increases in group insurance rates, partially offset by a 3% average decrease in headcount primarily related to two voluntary workforce reduction programs. Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs. Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs increased $73 million primarily due to growth in our third party maintenance and repair business. Passenger service. Passenger service increased $67 million primarily associated with (1) the increased cost of catering on international flights, (2) product upgrades in our Business Elite cabins and (3) unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Profit sharing. In 2007, we recorded a $158 million charge related to our broad-based employee profit sharing plan. We did not record any profit sharing expense in 2008. This plan provides that, for each year in which we have an annual pre-tax profit (as defined), we will pay at least 15% of that profit to eligible employees. Other (Expense) Income Other expense, net for 2008 was $727 million, compared to $492 million for 2007. This change is attributable to (1) a $53 million, or 8%, increase in interest expense primarily due to a higher level of debt outstanding, including Northwest debt for the period from October 30 to December 31, 2008 and the borrowing of the entire amount of our $1.0 billion exit revolving credit facility, partially offset by the repayment of our debtor-in-possession financing facilities (the DIP Facility ) and other higher floating rate debt in connection with our emergence from Chapter 11, (2) a $36 million decrease in interest income primarily from lower cash balances prior to the Merger and lower interest rates compared to 2007 and (3) a $146 million unfavorable change in miscellaneous, net due to the following: Unfavorable 2008 GAAP vs. 2007 Predecessor + (in millions) Successor Miscellaneous, net Foreign currency exchange rates $ 72 Loss on investments in The Reserve Primary Fund and insured auction rate securities 34 Mark-to-market adjustments on the ineffective portion of fuel hedge contracts 21 Northwest non-operating expense from October 30 to December 31, 2008 12 Other 7 Total miscellaneous, net $ 146 37 Table of Contents Reorganization Items, Net Reorganization items, net totaled a $1.2 billion gain for 2007, primarily consisting of the following: Emergence gain. A net $2.1 billion gain due to our emergence from bankruptcy, comprised of (1) a $4.4 billion gain related to the discharge of liabilities subject to compromise in connection with the settlement of claims, (2) a $2.6 billion charge associated with the revaluation of our SkyMiles frequent flyer obligation and (3) a $238 million gain from the revaluation of our remaining assets and liabilities to fair value. Aircraft financing renegotiations and rejections . A $440 million charge for estimated claims primarily associated with the restructuring of the financing arrangements for 143 aircraft and adjustments to prior claims estimates. Contract carrier agreements . A net charge of $163 million in connection with amendments to certain contract carrier agreements. Emergence compensation . In accordance with Delta Plan of Reorganization, we made $130 million in lump-sum cash payments to approximately 39,000 eligible non-contract, non-management employees. We also recorded an additional charge of $32 million related to our portion of payroll related taxes associated with the issuance, as contemplated by Delta Plan of Reorganization, of approximately 14 million shares of common stock to those employees. Pilot collective bargaining agreement . An $83 million allowed general, unsecured claim in connection with the agreement between Comair, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary ( Comair ), and the Air Line Pilots Association ( ALPA ) to reduce Comair pilot labor costs. Facility leases . A net $43 million gain, which primarily reflects (1) a $126 million net gain related to our settlement agreement with the Massachusetts Port Authority partially offset by (2) a net $80 million charge from an allowed general, unsecured claim in connection with the settlement relating to the restructuring of certain of our lease and other obligations at the Cincinnati Airport. Income Taxes We recorded an income tax benefit of $119 million for 2008 due to the impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. The impairment of goodwill did not result in an income tax benefit as goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. We did not record an income tax benefit as a result of our loss for 2008. The deferred tax asset resulting from such a net operating loss is fully reserved by a valuation allowance. For 2007, we recorded an income tax provision totaling $207 million. We recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, excluding the effect of the deferred tax liabilities that are unable to be used as a source of income against these deferred tax assets, based on our belief that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized in the future. Under accounting guidance applicable in 2007, any reduction in the valuation allowance as a result of the recognition of deferred tax assets was adjusted through goodwill, followed by other indefinite-lived intangible assets until the net carrying cost of these assets was zero. Accordingly, during 2007, we reduced goodwill by $211 million with respect to the realization of pre-emergence deferred tax assets. 38 Table of Contents Financial Condition and Liquidity We expect to meet our cash needs for 2010 from cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and financing arrangements. Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $4.7 billion at December 31, 2009. We also have $685 million of additional cash available from undrawn credit facilities. As of December 31, 2009, we have financing commitments from third parties, or definitive agreements to sell, all aircraft subject to purchase commitments, except for nine previously owned MD-90 aircraft. Under these financing commitments third parties have agreed to finance on a long-term basis a substantial portion of the purchase price of the covered aircraft. For additional information regarding our aircraft purchase commitments, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The global economic recession weakened demand for air travel, decreasing our revenue and negatively impacting our liquidity. In an effort to lessen the impact of the global recession, we implemented initiatives to reduce costs, increase revenues and preserve liquidity, primarily through reducing capacity to align with demand, workforce reduction programs and the acceleration of Merger synergy benefits. Our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, on acceptable terms could be affected by the fact that substantially all of our assets are subject to liens. Significant Liquidity Events Significant liquidity events during 2009 were as follows: In September 2009, we borrowed a total of $2.1 billion under three new financings, consisting of: (1) $750 million of senior secured credit facilities, which include a $500 million first-lien revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility ) and a $250 million first-lien term loan facility; (2) $750 million of senior secured notes; and (3) $600 million of senior second lien notes. A portion of the net proceeds was used to repay in full the Bank Credit Facility due in 2010 with the remainder of the proceeds available for general corporate purposes. In November 2009, we issued $689 million of Pass Through Certificates, Series 2009-1 through two separate trusts (the 2009-1 EETC ). We used $342 million of the net proceeds of the 2009-1 EETC offering to prepay existing mortgage financings for five aircraft that were delivered and financed earlier in 2009 and for general corporate purposes. We intend to use the remaining $347 million of the net proceeds of the 2009-1 EETC, which are currently held in escrow, to repay a portion of the refinancing of 22 aircraft that currently secure our 2000-1 EETC. In 2009, we entered into two revolving credit facilities for a total of $250 million. We also received the proceeds from the issuance of $150 million in unsecured tax exempt bonds. In addition, a $300 million revolving credit facility terminated on its maturity date. For additional information regarding these matters and other liquidity events, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Sources and Uses of Cash In this section, we review the sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 under GAAP. For 2007, we added Delta sources and uses of cash for the four months ended April 30, 2007 of the Predecessor with the eight months ended December 31, 2007 of the Successor. We believe the 2007 Predecessor plus Successor sources and uses of cash provides a more meaningful perspective on Delta cash flows for 2007 than if we did not present this information in this manner. Cash flows from operating activities Cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.4 billion for 2009, primarily reflecting (1) the return from counterparties of $1.1 billion of hedge margin primarily used to settle hedge losses recognized during the period and (2) $690 million in net income after adjusting for non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization. 39 Table of Contents Cash used in operating activities totaled $1.7 billion for 2008, primarily reflecting (1) an increase in aircraft fuel payments due to record high fuel prices for most of the year, (2) the posting of $680 million in margin with counterparties primarily from our estimated fair value loss position on our fuel hedge contracts at December 31, 2008, (3) the payment of $438 million in premiums for fuel hedge derivatives entered into during 2008, (4) a $374 million decrease in advance ticket sales due to the slowing economy and (5) the payment of $158 million in 2008 under our broad-based employee profit sharing plan related to 2007. Cash used in operating activities was partially offset by cash flows driven by a $3.5 billion increase in operating revenue, $2.0 billion of which is directly attributable to Northwest operations since the Closing Date. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.4 billion for 2007, primarily reflecting $875 million in cash used under Delta Plan of Reorganization to satisfy bankruptcy-related obligations under our comprehensive agreement with ALPA and settlement agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Cash flows from operating activities during 2007 also reflect (1) the release of $804 million from restricted cash pursuant to an amendment to our Visa/Mastercard credit card processing agreement, (2) revenue and network productivity improvements, including right-sizing capacity to better meet customer demand and the continued restructuring of our route network to reduce less productive short haul domestic flights and reallocate widebody aircraft to international routes and (3) a $476 million decrease in short-term investments primarily from sales of auction rate securities. Cash flows from investing activities Cash used in investing activities totaled $1.0 billion for 2009, primarily reflecting net investments of $951 million for flight equipment and $251 million for ground property and equipment. Cash used in investing activities was partially offset by (1) a $142 million distribution of our investment in The Reserve Primary Fund and (2) $100 million of proceeds from the sale of flight equipment. Cash provided by investing activities totaled $1.6 billion for 2008, primarily reflecting (1) the inclusion of $2.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents from Northwest in the Merger and (2) $609 million in restricted cash and cash equivalents, primarily related to $500 million of cash from a Northwest borrowing that was released from escrow. These inflows were partially offset by investments of $1.3 billion for flight equipment and $241 million for ground property and equipment. Cash used in investing activities totaled $625 million for 2007, primarily reflecting investments of $810 million for flight equipment and advanced payments for aircraft commitments and $226 million for ground property and equipment. During 2007, restricted cash decreased by $185 million. In addition, we received $34 million and $83 million from the sale of our investments in priceline.com Incorporated and ARINC Incorporated, respectively. Cash flows from financing activities Cash used in financing activities totaled $19 million for 2009, primarily reflecting $3.0 billion in proceeds from long-term debt and aircraft financing, largely associated with the issuance of (1) $2.1 billion under three new financings (as discussed above), (2) $342 million from the 2009-1 EETC offering (with the remaining proceeds held in escrow) and (3) $150 million of tax exempt bonds, mostly offset by the repayment of $2.9 billion in long-term debt and capital lease obligations, including the Bank Credit Facility and the Revolving Facility. Cash provided by financing activities totaled $1.7 billion for 2008, primarily reflecting (1) $1.0 billion in borrowings under a revolving credit facility, (2) $1.0 billion received under the American Express Agreement for an advance purchase of SkyMiles, and (3) $1.0 billion from aircraft financing. Cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by the repayment of $1.6 billion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations. 40 Table of Contents Cash used in financing activities totaled $120 million for 2007, primarily reflecting (1) the repayment of the DIP Facility with a portion of the proceeds available under the senior secured exit financing facility and existing cash, (2) the prepayment of $863 million of secured debt with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of enhanced equipment trust certificates and (3) scheduled principal payments on long-term debt and capital lease obligations. During 2007, we also received $181 million in proceeds from an amendment to certain financing arrangements in which the outstanding principal amount was increased. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009. The table does not include commitments that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time, some of which are discussed in footnotes to this table and in the text immediately following the footnotes. Results that vary significantly from our assumptions could have a material impact on our contractual obligations. Contractual Obligations by Year (in millions) 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total Long-term debt (1) $ 2,690 $ 3,460 $ 4,200 $ 2,060 $ 3,440 $ 7,690 $ 23,540 Contract carrier obligations (2) 1,870 1,780 1,770 1,820 1,900 7,550 16,690 Employee benefit obligations (3) 860 740 790 740 740 10,750 14,620 Operating lease payments (4) 1,589 1,407 1,296 1,171 1,085 5,242 11,790 Aircraft purchase commitments (5) 1,080 1,080 Capital lease obligations (6) 148 146 119 87 67 337 904 Other purchase obligations (7) 400 270 260 160 90 90 1,270 Total (8) $ 8,637 $ 7,803 $ 8,435 $ 6,038 $ 7,322 $ 31,659 $ 69,894 (1) Includes the principal amount of our long-term debt, which is also included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The table also includes interest payments related to long-term debt, but excludes the impact of our interest rate hedges. Estimated amounts for future interest and related payments in connection with our long-term debt obligations are based on the fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt agreements. Estimates on variable rate interest were calculated using implied short-term LIBOR based on LIBOR at December 31, 2009. The table also includes (a) payments for credit enhancements required in conjunction with certain financing agreements and (b) debt recorded in connection with the American Express Agreement. As part of the American Express Agreement, we received $1.0 billion from American Express for an advance purchase of SkyMiles. Our obligation to American Express will be satisfied through use of SkyMiles by American Express over an expected two year period that begins in December 2010. (2) Represents our minimum fixed obligations under our contract carrier agreements (excluding contract carrier aircraft lease payments accounted for as operating leases). (3) Represents minimum funding requirements under government regulations for all of our qualified defined benefit pension plans based on actuarially determined estimates and projected future benefit payments from all of our unfunded other postretirement and other postemployment plans. For additional information regarding our qualified defined benefit pension plans, see Pension Obligations below. (4) Includes our noncancelable operating leases and our lease payments related to aircraft under our contract carrier agreements. (5) Approximately $800 million of this amount is associated with our orders to purchase 20 B-737-800 aircraft for which we have entered into definitive agreements to sell to third parties immediately following delivery of these aircraft to us by the manufacturer. We have not received any notice that these parties have defaulted on their purchase obligations. The table excludes our order of 18 B-787-8 aircraft. The Boeing Company ( Boeing ) has informed us that Boeing will be unable to meet the contractual delivery schedule for these aircraft. We are in discussions with Boeing regarding this situation. The table also excludes our order for five A319-100 aircraft and two A320-200 aircraft since we have the right to cancel these orders. (6) Includes interest payments related to capital lease obligations. The present value of these obligations, excluding interest, is included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. (7) Primarily includes purchase obligations pursuant to which we are required to make minimum payments for goods and services, including but not limited to insurance, outsourced human resource services, marketing, maintenance, technology, sponsorships and other third party services and products. 41 Table of Contents (8) In addition to the contractual obligations included in the table, we have significant cash obligations that are not included in the table. For example, we will pay wages required under collective bargaining agreements, purchase capacity under contract carrier arrangements (as discussed below), settle tax contingency reserves (as discussed below), pay credit card processing fees and pay fees for other goods and services, including those related to fuel, maintenance and commissions. While we are parties to legally binding contracts regarding these goods and services, the actual commitment is contingent on certain factors such as volume and/or variable rates that are uncertain or unknown at this time. Therefore, these items are not included in the table. In addition, purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the table and any amounts which we are liable for under the purchase orders are included in current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Payments under our profit-sharing plan or pursuant to our 2007 Performance Compensation Plan are contingent on factors unknown at this time and, therefore, are not included in this table. Pension Obligations. We sponsor a defined benefit pension plan for eligible non-pilot Delta employees and retirees (the Delta Non-Pilot Plan ) and defined benefit pension plans for eligible Northwest employees and retirees (the Northwest Pension Plans ), all of which have been frozen for future benefit accruals. Our funding obligations for these plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 allows commercial airlines to elect alternative funding rules ( Alternative Funding Rules ) for defined benefit plans that are frozen. Under the Alternative Funding Rules, the unfunded liability for a frozen defined benefit plan may be funded over a fixed 17-year period. The unfunded liability is defined as the actuarial liability and is calculated using an 8.85% interest rate. Delta elected the Alternative Funding Rules for the Delta Non-Pilot Plan, effective April 1, 2007; and Northwest elected the Alternative Funding Rules for the Northwest Pension Plans, effective October 1, 2006. We estimate that the funding requirements under these plans will be approximately $720 million in 2010. While this legislation makes our funding obligations for these plans more predictable, factors outside our control continue to have an impact on the funding requirements. Estimates of future funding requirements are based on various assumptions and can vary materially from actual funding requirements. Assumptions include, among other things, the actual and projected market performance of assets; statutory requirements; and demographic data for participants. The following items are not included in the table above: Contract Carrier Agreements . During the year ended December 31, 2009, six regional air carriers ( Contract Carriers ) operated for us (in addition to our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Comair, Compass Airlines, Inc. ( Compass ) and Mesaba Aviation, Inc. ( Mesaba )) pursuant to capacity purchase agreements. Under these agreements, the regional air carriers operate some or all of their aircraft using our flight designator codes, and we control the scheduling, pricing, reservations, ticketing and seat inventories of those aircraft and retain the revenues associated with those flights. We pay those airlines an amount, as defined in the applicable agreement, which is based on a determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services. The above table shows our minimum fixed obligations under these capacity purchase agreements (excluding Comair, Compass and Mesaba). The obligations set forth in the table contemplate minimum levels of flying by the Contract Carriers under the respective agreements and also reflect assumptions regarding certain costs associated with the minimum levels of flying such as for fuel, labor, maintenance, insurance, catering, property tax and landing fees. Accordingly, our actual payments under these agreements could differ materially from the minimum fixed obligations set forth in the table above. For information regarding payments we may be required to make in connection with certain terminations of our capacity purchase agreements with Chautauqua Airlines, Inc. and Shuttle America Corporation, see Contingencies Related to Termination of Contract Carrier Agreements in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Uncertain Tax Positions. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2009 is $66 million. We are currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS ) for the 2008 and 2009 tax years. 42 Table of Contents Legal Contingencies . We are involved in various legal proceedings relating to employment practices, environmental issues, bankruptcy matters, antitrust matters and other matters concerning our business. We cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss for certain legal proceedings because, for example, the litigation is in its early stages or the plaintiff does not specify the damages being sought. Other Contingent Obligations under Contracts . In addition to the contractual obligations discussed above, we have certain contracts for goods and services that require us to pay a penalty, acquire inventory specific to us or purchase contract specific equipment, as defined by each respective contract, if we terminate the contract without cause prior to its expiration date. Because these obligations are contingent on our termination of the contract without cause prior to its expiration date, no obligation would exist unless such a termination occurs. For additional information about other contingencies not discussed above, as well as information related to general indemnifications, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, which are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. Frequent Flyer Programs. We have a frequent flyer program (the SkyMiles Program ) offering incentives to increase travel on Delta. This program allows participants to earn mileage credits by flying on Delta, Contract Carriers and participating airlines, as well as through participating companies such as credit card companies, hotels and car rental agencies. We also sell mileage credits to other airlines and to non-airline businesses. Mileage credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded air travel on Delta and participating airlines, for membership in our Sky Club and for other program awards. In the Merger, we assumed Northwest frequent flyer program (the WorldPerks Program ). In October 2009, we completed the consolidation of the SkyMiles and WorldPerks Programs, which combined miles from each program at a one-to-one ratio. The WorldPerks Program was accounted for under the same methodology as the SkyMiles Program. We use the residual method for revenue recognition of mileage credits. The fair value of the mileage credit component is determined based on prices at which we sell mileage credits to other airlines, currently $0.0054 per mile, and is re-evaluated at least annually. Under the residual method, the portion of the revenue from the sale of mileage credits and the mileage component of passenger ticket sales that approximates fair value is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when miles are redeemed and services are provided based on the weighted- average price of all miles that have been deferred. The portion of the revenue received in excess of the fair value of mileage credits sold is recognized in income when the related marketing services are provided and classified as other, net revenue. For mileage credits which we estimate are not likely to be redeemed ( Breakage ), we recognize the associated value proportionally during the period in which the remaining mileage credits are expected to be redeemed. The estimate of Breakage is based on historical redemption patterns. A change in assumptions as to the period over which mileage credits are expected to be redeemed, the actual redemption activity for mileage credits or the estimated fair value of mileage credits expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years. At December 31, 2009, the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with the SkyMiles Program was $4.8 billion. A hypothetical 1% change in our outstanding number of miles estimated to be redeemed would result in a $33 million impact on our deferred revenue liability at December 31, 2009. 43 Table of Contents Purchase Accounting Measurements. On the Closing Date, Northwest revalued its assets and liabilities at fair value. This revaluation did not impact earnings; it did impact the calculation of goodwill related to the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Northwest in the Merger. Additional changes in the fair values of these assets and liabilities from the current estimated values, as well as changes in other assumptions, could significantly impact earnings. The fair value of Northwest debt and capital lease obligations was determined by estimating the present value of amounts to be paid at appropriate interest rates as of the Closing Date. These rates were determined with swap rates, LIBOR rates and market spreads as of the Closing Date. The market spreads, which were determined with the assistance of third party financial institutions, considered the credit risk and the structure of the debt and capital lease obligations as well as the underlying collateral supporting the obligations. Fair value measurements for goodwill and other intangible assets included significant unobservable inputs, which generally include a five-year business plan, 12 months of historical revenues and expenses by city pair, projections of available seat miles, revenue passenger miles, load factors, operating costs per available seat mile and a discount rate. One of the significant unobservable inputs underlying the intangible fair value measurements performed on the Closing Date is the discount rate. We determined the discount rate using the weighted average cost of capital of the airline industry, which was measured using a Capital Asset Pricing Model ( CAPM ). The CAPM in the valuation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles utilized a 50% debt and 50% equity structure. The historical average debt-to-equity structure of the major airlines since 1990 is also approximately 50% debt and 50% equity, which was similar to Northwest debt-to-equity structure at emergence from Chapter 11. The return on debt was measured using a bid-to-yield analysis of major airline corporate bonds. The expected market rate of return for equity was measured based on the risk free rate, the airline industry beta and risk premiums based on the Federal Reserve Statistical Release H. 15 or Ibbotson Stocks, Bonds, Bills, and Inflation Valuation Yearbook, Edition 2008. These factors resulted in a 13% discount rate. The fair value of Northwest pension and postretirement plans was determined by measuring the plans funded status as of the Closing Date. Any excess projected benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets was recognized as a liability. One of the significant assumptions in determining our projected benefit obligation is the discount rate. We determined the discount rate primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income investments and yield-to-maturity analysis specific to estimated future benefit payments, which resulted in a weighted average discount rate of 7.8%. Other significant assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate, retirement age, and mortality assumptions. Derivative Instruments. Our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in aircraft fuel prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In an effort to manage our exposure to these risks, we periodically enter into derivative instruments, including fuel, interest rate and foreign currency hedges. These derivative instruments are comprised of contracts that are privately negotiated with counterparties without going through a public exchange. Accordingly, our fair value assessments give consideration to the risk of counterparty default (as well as our own credit risk). Aircraft Fuel Derivatives. Our fuel derivative instruments consist of crude oil, heating oil and jet fuel swap, collar and call option contracts. Swap contracts are valued under the income approach using a discounted cash flow model based on data either readily observable or derived from public markets. Option contracts are valued under the income approach using option pricing models. We have based our valuation assessments for our option contracts on data either readily observable in public markets, derived from public markets or provided by counterparties who regularly trade in public markets. Interest Rate Derivatives. Our interest rate derivative instruments consist of swap and call option contracts and are valued based on data readily observable in public markets. 44 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Derivatives. Our foreign currency derivative instruments consist of Japanese yen and Canadian dollar forward and collar contracts and are valued based on data readily observable in public markets. We perform, at least quarterly, both a prospective and retrospective assessment of the effectiveness of our derivative instruments designated as hedges, including assessing the possibility of counterparty default. If we determine that a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively and recognize subsequent changes in the fair value of the hedge in earnings. As a result of our effectiveness assessment at December 31, 2009, we believe our derivative instruments designated as hedges will continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flow attributable to the hedged risk. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill reflects (1) the excess of the reorganization value of the Successor over the fair values of tangible and identifiable intangible assets, net of liabilities, from the adoption of fresh start reporting, adjusted for impairment and (2) the excess of purchase price over the fair values of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Northwest in the Merger. The following table reflects the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009: Gross Carrying (in millions) Amount Impairment Net Balance at January 1, 2008 $ 12,104 $ $ 12,104 Impairment (6,939 ) (6,939 ) Northwest Merger 4,572 4,572 Other (6 ) (6 ) Balance at December 31, 2008 16,670 (6,939 ) 9,731 Northwest Merger 60 60 Other (4 ) (4 ) Balance at December 31, 2009 $ 16,726 $ (6,939 ) $ 9,787 During 2008, we experienced a significant decline in market capitalization primarily from record high fuel prices and overall airline industry conditions. In addition, the announcement of our intention to merge with Northwest established a stock exchange ratio based on the relative valuation of Delta and Northwest (see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). We determined that these factors combined with further increases in fuel prices were an indicator that a goodwill impairment test was required. As a result, we estimated fair value based on a discounted projection of future cash flows, supported with a market-based valuation. We determined that goodwill was impaired and recorded a non-cash charge of $6.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. In estimating fair value, we based our estimates and assumptions on the same valuation techniques employed and levels of inputs used to estimate the fair value of goodwill upon adoption of fresh start reporting. Identifiable intangible assets reflect intangible assets (1) recorded as a result of our adoption of fresh start reporting upon emergence from bankruptcy and (2) acquired in the Merger. Indefinite-lived assets are not amortized. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis or under the undiscounted cash flows method over the estimated economic life of the respective agreements and contracts. 45 Table of Contents In addition to the goodwill impairment charge discussed above, we recorded a non-cash charge of $357 million ($238 million after tax) for the year ended December 31, 2008 to reduce the carrying value of certain intangible assets based on their revised estimated fair values. We apply a fair value-based impairment test to the net book value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis. The annual impairment test date for our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is October 1. In evaluating our goodwill for impairment, we first compare our one reporting unit fair value to its carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our reporting unit by considering (1) our market capitalization, (2) any premium to our market capitalization an investor would pay for a controlling interest, (3) the potential value of synergies and other benefits that could result from such interest, (4) market multiple and recent transaction values of peer companies and (5) projected discounted future cash flows, if reasonably estimable. If the reporting unit fair value exceeds its carrying value, no further testing is required. If, however, the reporting unit carrying value exceeds its fair value, we then determine the amount of the impairment charge, if any. We recognize an impairment charge if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. We perform the impairment test for our indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the asset fair value to its carrying value. Fair value is estimated based on (1) recent market transactions where available, (2) the lease savings method for airport slots (which reflects potential lease savings from owning the slots rather than leasing them from another airline at market rates), (3) the royalty method for the Delta tradename (which assumes hypothetical royalties generated from using our tradename) or (4) projected discounted future cash flows. We recognize an impairment charge if the asset carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Changes in assumptions or circumstances could result in an additional impairment in the period in which the change occurs and in future years. Factors which could cause impairment include, but are not limited to, (1) negative trends in our market capitalization, (2) volatile fuel prices, (3) declining passenger mile yields, (4) lower passenger demand as a result of the weakened U.S. and global economy, (5) interruption to our operations due to an employee strike, terrorist attack, or other reasons, (6) changes to the regulatory environment and (7) consolidation of competitors in the industry. Long-Lived Assets . Our flight equipment and other long-lived assets have a recorded value of $20.4 billion on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2009. This value is based on various factors, including the assets estimated useful lives and their estimated salvage values. We record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the estimated future cash flows generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. If we decide to permanently remove flight equipment or other long-lived assets from operations, we will evaluate those assets for impairment. For long-lived assets held for sale, we record impairment losses when the carrying amount is greater than the fair value less the cost to sell. We discontinue depreciation of long-lived assets when these assets are classified as held for sale. To determine impairments for aircraft used in operations, we group assets at the fleet-type level (the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows) and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity, passenger mile yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant factors. If impairment occurs, the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the aircraft carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. We estimate aircraft fair values using published sources, appraisals and bids received from third parties, as available. For additional information about our accounting policy for the impairment of long-lived assets, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 46 Table of Contents Income Tax Valuation Allowance and Contingencies . We periodically assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets, and we establish valuation allowances if recovery is deemed not likely. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions. We consider, among other things, our deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, our historical earnings and losses, our industry historically cyclical periods of earnings and losses and potential, current and future tax planning strategies. We cannot presently determine when we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. Our income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the IRS and other taxing authorities. Although we believe that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable, we have established tax and interest reserves in recognition that taxing authorities may challenge the positions we have taken, which could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest. We review the reserves as circumstances warrant and adjust the reserves as events occur that affect our potential liability, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, conclusion of tax audits, a change in exposure based on current calculations, identification of new issues, release of administrative guidance or the rendering of a court decision affecting a particular issue. We would adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. Prior to January 1, 2009, in the event that an adjustment to the income tax provision related to a pre-emergence tax position or Northwest Merger-related tax position, we adjusted goodwill followed by other indefinite-lived intangible assets until the net carrying value of those assets was zero. Beginning January 1, 2009, any adjustments to the income tax provision in regard to pre-emergence tax positions are made through the income tax provision. For additional information about income taxes, see Notes 1 and 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Plans . We sponsor defined benefit pension plans ( DB Plans ) for our eligible employees and retirees. We currently estimate that expense for our DB Plans in 2010 will be approximately $400 million. The effect of our DB Plans on our Consolidated Financial Statements is subject to many assumptions. We believe the most critical assumptions are (1) the weighted average discount rate and (2) the expected long-term rate of return on the assets of our DB Plans. We determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income investments and yield-to-maturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments. We used a weighted average discount rate of 5.93% and 6.49% at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Additionally, our weighted average discount rate for net periodic benefit cost in each of the past three years has varied from the rate selected on our measurement date, ranging from 5.99% to 7.19% between 2007 and 2009, due to remeasurements throughout the year. The impact of a 0.50% change in our weighted average discount rate is shown in the table below. 47 Table of Contents The expected long-term rate of return on the assets of our DB Plans is based primarily on plan-specific investment studies using historical market returns and volatility data with forward looking estimates based on existing financial market conditions and forecasts. Modest excess return expectations versus some market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically. We review our rate of return on plan asset assumptions annually. These assumptions are largely based on the asset category rate-of-return assumptions developed annually with our pension investment advisors; however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. The investment strategy for DB Plan assets is to utilize a diversified mix of global public and private equity portfolios, public and private fixed income portfolios, and private real estate and natural resource investments to earn a long-term investment return that meets or exceeds a 9% annualized return target. The impact of a 0.50% change in our expected long-term rate of return is shown in the table below. Effect on Accrued Effect on 2010 Pension Liability at Change in Assumption Pension Expense December 31, 2009 0.50% decrease in discount rate +$ 8 million +$ 1.0 billion 0.50% increase in discount rate -$ 12 million -$ 978 million 0.50% decrease in expected return on assets +$ 37 million 0.50% increase in expected return on assets -$ 37 million For additional information about our DB Plans, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In September 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB ) issued Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. The standard revises guidance on (1) the determination of when individual deliverables may be treated as separate units of accounting and (2) the allocation of transaction consideration among separately identified deliverables. It also expands disclosure requirements regarding an entity multiple element revenue arrangements. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In April 2009, the FASB issued Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The standard amends required disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments in interim and annual financial statements. We adopted this standard on April 1, 2009. In December 2008, the FASB issued Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets. It requires additional annual disclosures about assets held in an employer defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan, primarily related to categories and fair value measurements of plan assets. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2009. For additional information regarding this standard, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The standard requires enhanced disclosures about (1) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (2) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and (3) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This standard is effective for interim and annual periods. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2009. 48 Table of Contents In December 2007, the FASB issued Business Combinations (revised 2007). The standard provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in a business combination and requires disclosure of information regarding the nature and financial effects of a business combination. It also revises the treatment of valuation allowance adjustments related to income tax benefits in existence prior to a business combination or prior to the adoption of fresh start reporting. Under the original standard, any reduction in the valuation allowance from the recognition of deferred tax assets is adjusted through goodwill, followed by other indefinite-lived intangible assets until the net carrying costs of these assets is zero. In contrast, this revised standard requires that any reduction in this valuation allowance be reflected through the income tax provision. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning on January 1, 2009. Supplemental Information Under GAAP, we do not include in our Consolidated Financial Statements the results of Northwest on or before the Closing Date. Accordingly, our financial results under GAAP for the year ended December 31, 2008, include the results of Northwest only for the period from October 30 to December 31, 2008. This impacts the comparability of our financial statements under GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Financial results on a combined basis for the year ended December 31, 2008 include the financial results for both Delta and Northwest beginning January 1, 2008. We believe presenting the 2008 financial information on a combined basis provides useful information for comparing our financial performance in 2009 and 2008.

In addition, we exclude special items because management believes the exclusion of these items is helpful to investors to evaluate the company recurring operational performance. CASM and Combined CASM exclude ancillary businesses which are not associated with the generation of a seat mile. These businesses include aircraft maintenance and staffing services which we provide to third parties, our dedicated freighter operations and our vacation wholesale operations.
