Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company consolidated financial statements and related notes. All references to years relate to fiscal years that end on January 31 of the following calendar year. KEY STRATEGIES The Company key strategies are: To selectively expand its global distribution without compromising the value of the TIFFANY & CO. trademark (the Brand ). Management employs a multi-channel distribution strategy and intends to expand distribution by adding stores in both new and existing markets, and by launching e-commerce websites in new markets. Management recognizes that over-saturation of any market could diminish the distinctive appeal of the Brand, but believes that there are a significant number of potential worldwide locations remaining that meet the requirements of the Brand. To enhance customer awareness. The Brand is the single most important asset of the Company. Management will continue to invest in marketing and public relations programs designed to increase new and existing customer awareness of the Brand and its message, and will continue to monitor the strength of the Brand through market research. To increase store productivity. The Company is committed to growing sales per square foot by increasing consumer traffic, and the percentage of store visitors who make a purchase, through targeted advertising, ongoing sales training and customer-focused initiatives. In addition, in recent years, the Company has opened smaller size stores in the United States which are more comparable to many non-U.S. stores and which have contributed to higher store productivity. To achieve improved operating margins. Management long-term objective is to improve operating margin through greater efficiencies in product sourcing, manufacturing and distribution as well as by controlling selling, general and administrative expenses and enhancing productivity through sales leverage on fixed costs so that sales growth can generate a higher rate of earnings growth. To maintain an active product development program. The Company continues to invest in product development in order to introduce new design collections and expand existing lines. TIFFANY & CO. K - 26 To maintain substantial control over product supply through direct diamond sourcing and internal jewelry manufacturing. The Company diamond processing operations purchase, sort, cut and/or polish rough diamonds for use in merchandise. The Company will continue to seek additional sources of diamonds which, combined with its internal manufacturing operations, are intended to secure adequate product supplies and favorable costs. To provide superior customer service. Maintaining the strength of the Brand requires that the Company make superior customer service a top priority, which it achieves by employing highly qualified sales and customer service professionals and enhancing ongoing training programs. 2012 SUMMARY Worldwide net sales increased 4% to $3,794,249,000 due to growth in all segments. On a constant-exchange-rate basis (see Non-GAAP Measures below), worldwide net sales in 2012 increased 5% and comparable store sales increased 1%. The Company added a net of 28 TIFFANY & CO. stores (13 in the Americas, 8 in Asia-Pacific, 2 in Europe and 5 in the United Arab Emirates ( U.A.E. )). Operating margin decreased 1.0 percentage point. Excluding charges (primarily within selling, general and administrative expenses) of $42,719,000 in 2011 associated with Tiffany relocation of its New York headquarters staff to a single location, operating margin decreased 2.2 percentage points in 2012 due to a decline in gross margin. Net earnings decreased 5% to $416,157,000, or $3.25 per diluted share. Excluding nonrecurring charges (see Non-GAAP Measures below), net earnings declined 11%. In May 2012, the Board of Directors approved a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend rate on the Company Common Stock increasing the annual dividend rate to $1.28 per share. Free cash flow (see Non-GAAP Measures below) improved to an inflow of $108,760,000 in 2012, as compared to an outflow of $28,837,000 in 2011, primarily due to a decelerating rate of inventory growth. In July 2012, the Company issued $250,000,000 of 4.40% Senior Notes. Additionally, the Company increased the commitments under each of the Company three-year and five-year credit facilities from $200,000,000 to $275,000,000 resulting in a total borrowing capacity of $550,000,000 under the Company two principal credit facilities. TIFFANY & CO. K - 27 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Non-GAAP Measures The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ). The Company management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate the Company operating results. Net Sales. The Company reported sales reflect either a translation-related benefit from strengthening foreign currencies or a detriment from a strengthening U.S. dollar. Internally, management monitors its sales performance on a non-GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating sales made outside the U.S. into U.S. dollars ( constant-exchange-rate basis ). Management believes this constant-exchange-rate basis provides a more representative assessment of sales performance and provides better comparability between reporting periods. The following table reconciles sales percentage increases (decreases) from the GAAP to the non-GAAP basis versus the previous year: 2012 2011 GAAP Reported Translation Effect Constant- Exchange- Rate Basis GAAP Reported Translation Effect Constant- Exchange- Rate Basis Net Sales: Worldwide 4 % (1 )% 5 % 18 % 3 % 15 % Americas 2 2 15 1 14 Asia-Pacific 8 8 36 5 31 Japan 4 (2 ) 6 13 10 3 Europe 3 (4 ) 7 17 5 12 Comparable Store Sales: Worldwide % (1 )% 1 % 16 % 3 % 13 % Americas (2 ) (2 ) 13 13 Asia-Pacific 3 1 2 31 4 27 Japan 4 (3 ) 7 13 9 4 Europe (2 ) (4 ) 2 10 4 6 TIFFANY & CO. K - 28 Statement of Earnings. Internally, management monitors its statement of earnings excluding non-recurring items. Management believes excluding such items presents the Company results on a more comparable basis to the corresponding period in the prior year, thereby providing investors with an additional perspective to analyze the results of operations of the Company. The following table reconciles GAAP amounts to non-GAAP amounts: (in thousands) GAAP New York Headquarters Staff Relocation (decrease)/increase Non-GAAP Year Ended January 31, 2012 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 1,442,728 $ (42,506 ) $ 1,400,222 Earnings from operations 708,426 42,719 a 751,145 Net earnings 439,190 25,994 465,184 a On a pre-tax basis includes charges of $213,000 within cost of sales and $42,506,000 within selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended January 31, 2012 associated with Tiffany consolidation of its New York headquarters staff within one location. Free Cash Flow. Internally, management monitors its cash flow on a non-GAAP basis as the ability to generate free cash flow demonstrates how much cash a company has available for discretionary and non-discretionary items after deduction of capital expenditures. The Company operations require regular capital expenditures for the opening, renovation and expansion of stores and distribution and manufacturing facilities as well as ongoing investments in information technology. Management believes this provides a more representative assessment of operating cash flows. The following table reconciles GAAP net cash provided by operating activities to non-GAAP free cash flows: Years Ended January 31, ( in thousands) 2013 2012 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 328,290 $ 210,606 Less: Capital expenditures 219,530 239,443 Free cash inflow (outflow) $ 108,760 $ (28,837 ) Comparable Store Sales Comparable store sales include only sales transacted in Company-operated stores. A store sales are included in comparable store sales when the store has been open for more than 12 months. In markets other than Japan, sales for relocated stores are included in comparable store sales if the relocation occurs within the same geographical market. In Japan, sales for a new store are not included if the store was relocated from one department store to another or from a department store to a free-standing location. In all markets, the results of a store in which the square footage has been expanded or reduced remain in the comparable store base. TIFFANY & CO. K - 29 Net Sales Net sales by segment were as follows: (in thousands) 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011 % Change 2011 vs. 2010 % Change Americas $ 1,839,969 $ 1,805,783 $ 1,574,571 2 % 15 % Asia-Pacific 810,420 748,214 549,197 8 36 Japan 639,185 616,505 546,537 4 13 Europe 432,167 421,141 360,831 3 17 Other 72,508 51,294 54,154 41 (5 ) $ 3,794,249 $ 3,642,937 $ 3,085,290 4 % 18 % Americas .

Asia-Pacific currently includes sales in 66 TIFFANY & CO. stores, as well as sales of TIFFANY & CO. products in certain markets through Internet and wholesale operations. Asia-Pacific represented 21%, 21% and 18% of worldwide net sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010. In 2012, total sales in Asia-Pacific increased $62,206,000, or 8%, primarily due to an increase in the number of units sold. Comparable store sales increased $18,374,000, or 3%, non-comparable store sales grew $32,571,000 and sales of TIFFANY & CO. merchandise to independent distributors increased $9,447,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, Asia-Pacific sales increased 8% and comparable store sales increased 2% due to geographically broad-based sales growth in most markets. In 2011, total sales in Asia-Pacific increased $199,017,000, or 36%, due to similar increases in the average price per unit sold and in the number of units sold. Comparable store sales increased $162,989,000, or 31%, and non-comparable store sales increased $23,830,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, Asia-Pacific sales increased 31% and comparable store sales increased TIFFANY & CO.

Europe represented 11%, 12% and 12% of worldwide net sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010. The United Kingdom ( U.K. ) represents slightly less than half of European sales. In 2012, total sales in Europe increased $11,026,000, or 3%, due to an increase in the average price per unit sold partly offset by a decrease in the number of units sold. Comparable store sales decreased $6,929,000, or 2%, non-comparable store sales increased $15,438,000 and direct marketing sales increased $2,679,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales in Europe increased 7% and comparable store sales increased 2% reflecting growth in most of continental Europe and a modest sales decline in the U.K. In 2011, total sales in Europe increased $60,310,000, or 17%, due to similar increases in the number of units sold and in the average price per unit sold. Comparable store sales increased $33,021,000, or 10%, and non-comparable store sales increased $20,274,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales in Europe increased 12% and comparable store sales increased 6% reflecting relatively stronger growth in Continental Europe than in the U.K. Other. Other consists of all non-reportable segments. Other consists of wholesale sales of TIFFANY & CO. merchandise to independent distributors for resale in certain emerging markets (primarily in the Middle East and Russia) and beginning in July 2012 retail sales in five TIFFANY & CO. stores in the U.A.E. which were converted from independently-operated wholesale distribution to Company-operated stores. In addition, Other includes wholesale sales of diamonds obtained through bulk purchases that were subsequently deemed not suitable for the Company needs and earnings received from third-party licensing agreements. In 2012, Other sales increased $21,214,000, or 41%, primarily due to the addition of the five stores in the U.A.E. In 2011, Other sales decreased $2,860,000, or 5%, due to lower wholesale sales of diamonds partly offset by higher sales of TIFFANY & CO. merchandise to independent distributors in emerging markets. Product Category Information. In 2012, worldwide net sales increased $151,312,000, or 4%, primarily driven by increases of $44,811,000, or 7%, in the statement, fine & solitaire jewelry category (reflecting strong sales of yellow and fancy colored diamond jewelry); $38,534,000, or 3%, in the silver, gold & RUBEDO metal jewelry category (primarily due to the introduction of the TIFFANY & CO. K - 31 RUBEDO metal in 2012 partly offset by a decline in silver jewelry); $34,490,000, or 3%, in the engagement jewelry & wedding bands category; and $30,179,000, or 6%, in the designer jewelry category (reflecting sales growth in jewelry designed by Elsa Peretti and Paloma Picasso). In 2011, worldwide net sales increased $557,647,000, or 18%, primarily driven by increases of $205,433,000, or 24%, in the engagement jewelry & wedding bands category; $121,697,000, or 23%, in the statement, fine & solitaire category (reflecting strong sales of yellow diamond jewelry and statement jewelry); $122,428,000, or 12%, in the silver & gold jewelry category (reflecting strong sales of gold jewelry and modest growth in silver jewelry); and $63,776,000, or 15%, in the designer jewelry category (reflecting sales growth in jewelry designed by Elsa Peretti and Paloma Picasso). The remaining sales increase of $44,313,000, or 16%, in all other product categories was primarily driven by watches and the launch of leather goods. Store Data . In 2012, the Company added a net of 28 stores: 13 in the Americas (6 in Canada which includes the conversion of 4 department-store locations from independently-operated wholesale distribution to Company-operated stores, 4 in the U.S., 2 in Mexico and 1 in Brazil), 8 in Asia-Pacific (6 in China, 1 in Singapore and 1 in Australia), 2 in Europe (France and the Czech Republic) and 5 stores in the U.A.E. which is included as part of the Other non-reportable segment. In 2011, the Company added a net of 14 stores: 6 in the Americas (3 in the U.S., 2 in Canada and 1 in Brazil), 6 in Asia-Pacific (3 in Korea, 2 in China and 1 in Taiwan), 3 in Europe (Germany, Italy and Switzerland) and a net reduction of one in Japan. Sales per gross square foot generated by all company-operated stores were approximately $3,000 in 2012, $3,000 in 2011 and $2,600 in 2010. Gross Margin 2012 2011 2010 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 57.0 % 59.0 % 59.1 % Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) decreased by 2.0 percentage points in 2012 largely due to high precious metal and diamond costs, as well as sales mix favoring higher-priced, lower margin products and reduced sales leverage on fixed costs. Sales mix was affected by, among other items, a decline in sales of silver jewelry. Silver jewelry earns a higher margin than the Company overall gross margin. Gross margin decreased by 0.1 percentage point in 2011 primarily due to higher product costs and changes in product mix toward higher-priced jewelry that achieves a lower gross margin partly offset by sales leverage on fixed costs. Management periodically reviews and adjusts its retail prices when appropriate to address product cost increases, specific market conditions and longer-term changes in foreign currencies/U.S. dollar relationships. Among the market conditions that the Company addresses are consumer demand for the product category involved, which may be influenced by consumer confidence, and competitive pricing conditions. The Company uses derivative instruments to mitigate foreign exchange and precious metal price exposures (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note I. Hedging Instruments ). In recent years, the Company has increased retail prices to address higher product costs and its strategy is to continue that approach, when appropriate, in the future. The Company did not take retail price increases in 2011 and 2012 sufficient to offset commodity cost pressures the Company has continued to experience. The Company intends to increase prices in 2013. TIFFANY & CO. K - 32 Selling, General and Administrative ( SG&A ) Expenses 2012 2011 2010 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 38.6 % 39.6 % 39.8 % SG&A expenses increased $23,339,000, or 2%, in 2012 and $215,231,000, or 18%, in 2011. SG&A expenses in those years are not comparable due to nonrecurring charges. SG&A expenses in 2011 and 2010 included $42,506,000 and $16,625,000 of expenses associated with Tiffany and Company ( Tiffany ) relocation of its New York headquarters staff to a single location (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note K. Commitments and Contingencies ). Excluding the nonrecurring items noted above, SG&A expenses in 2011 and 2010 would have been $1,400,222,000 and $1,210,872,000. The increase of $65,845,000, or 5%, in 2012 was primarily due to increased store occupancy and depreciation expenses of $36,090,000 related to new and existing stores, increased marketing expenses of $8,474,000 and increased labor and benefit costs of $5,081,000. In 2012, the modest increase in labor and benefit costs reflected reduced incentive compensation. The increase of $189,350,000, or 16%, in 2011 was largely due to increased labor and benefits costs of $57,672,000, increased depreciation and store occupancy expenses of $56,657,000 due to new and existing stores and increased marketing expenses of $36,453,000. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 38.6% in 2012 and, excluding the nonrecurring items noted above, would have been 38.4% and 39.2% in 2011 and 2010. The Company SG&A expenses are largely fixed in nature. The improvement in SG&A expenses excluding nonrecurring items as a percentage of net sales in 2011 reflected the leverage effect from increased sales. Variable costs (which include items such as variable store rent, sales commissions and fees paid to credit card companies) represent approximately one-fifth of total SG&A expenses.

TIFFANY & CO. K - 33 Earnings from operations decreased 2% in 2012. On a segment basis, the ratio of earnings (losses) from operations to each segment net sales in 2012 compared with 2011 was as follows: Americas the ratio decreased 2.7 percentage points primarily resulting from a decline in gross margin as well as increased operating expenses due to the opening of new stores; Asia-Pacific the ratio decreased 4.2 percentage points primarily due to a decline in gross margin as well as increased operating expenses due to the opening of new stores and increased marketing; Japan the ratio increased 2.0 percentage points primarily due to the sales leveraging of operating expenses as well as an increase in gross margin; Europe the ratio decreased 4.1 percentage points primarily due to a decline in gross margin; and Other the operating loss is primarily attributable to spending for the development of the emerging markets region. Earnings from operations increased 19% in 2011. On a segment basis, the ratio of earnings (losses) from operations to each segment net sales in 2011 compared with 2010 was as follows: Americas the ratio decreased 0.1 percentage point primarily due to a decline in gross margin that was offset by the leveraging of operating expenses; Asia-Pacific the ratio increased 3.2 percentage points primarily due to the leveraging of operating expenses as well as a decrease in marketing expenses resulting from a major marketing and public relations event that was held in Beijing, China in 2010; Japan the ratio increased 0.2 percentage point primarily due to an improvement in gross margin partly offset by increased operating expenses; Europe the ratio increased 0.6 percentage point primarily due to an improvement in gross margin partly offset by increased operating expenses; and Other the operating loss is primarily attributable to a valuation adjustment related to the write-down of wholesale diamond inventory deemed not suitable for the Company needs as well as increased spending in the latter part of 2011 for the development of the emerging markets region. Unallocated corporate expenses include costs related to administrative support functions which the Company does not allocate to its segments. Such unallocated costs include those for centralized information technology, finance, legal and human resources departments. Unallocated corporate expenses decreased as a percentage of sales in 2012 and 2011. Other operating expense in 2011 and 2010 represents $42,719,000 and $17,635,000 related to Tiffany relocation of its New York headquarters staff to a single location (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note K. Commitments and Contingencies ). Interest Expense and Financing Costs In 2012, interest expense and financing costs increased $10,495,000, or 22%, primarily due to increased interest expense related to increased debt. In 2011, interest expense and financing costs decreased $5,761,000, or 11%, due to maturing debt that was replaced with new lower-rate borrowings. TIFFANY & CO. K - 34 Other Income, Net Other income, net includes interest income, gains/losses on investment activities and foreign currency transactions. Other income, net increased $329,000 in 2012. Other income, net decreased $1,889,000 in 2011 primarily due to changes in foreign currency gains/losses. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 35.3% in 2012 compared with 34.0% in 2011 and 32.7% in 2010. The tax rate for 2011 included a valuation allowance reversal against certain deferred tax assets where management had determined it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized in the future. The tax rate for 2010 included a net income tax benefit of $3,096,000 primarily due to a change in the tax status of certain subsidiaries associated with the acquisition in 2009 of additional equity interests in diamond sourcing and polishing operations. 2013 Outlook Management outlook is based on the following assumptions, which are approximate and may or may not prove valid, and which should be read in conjunction with Item 1A. Risk Factors on page K-14: Worldwide net sales growth of 6% 8% in U.S. dollars. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, an expected high-single-digit percentage increase in worldwide net sales includes growth in all regions, ranging from a mid-teens percentage increase in Asia-Pacific to a low-single-digit percentage increase in Japan. The opening of 14 (net) Company-operated stores including 5 in the Americas, 7 in Asia-Pacific, 3 in Europe and closing one in Japan, as well as refurbishing a number of existing locations around the world. Operating earnings increasing in line with sales growth; a modest improvement in the SG&A expense ratio, due to sales leverage on fixed costs, is expected to be offset by a modestly lower gross margin largely tied to a product sales mix skewed toward higher-priced categories. Interest and other expenses, net of $58,000,000. An effective income tax rate of 35%. Net earnings from operations increasing 6% 9% to a range of $3.43 $3.53 per diluted share. Net earnings from operations are expected to decline approximately 15% 20% in the first quarter due to gross margin pressure and higher marketing-related costs, to be followed by earnings growth in all subsequent quarters. In addition, this forecast excludes $0.05 per diluted share of expected first quarter charges for staffing and occupancy adjustments. An increase in net inventories of 5%, capital expenditures of $230,000,000 and free cash flow of $300,000,000. TIFFANY & CO. K - 35 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company liquidity needs have been, and are expected to remain, primarily a function of its ongoing, seasonal and expansion-related working capital requirements and capital expenditure needs. Over the long term, the Company manages its cash and capital structure to maintain a strong financial position that provides flexibility to pursue strategic initiatives. Management regularly assesses its working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, debt service, dividend payouts, share repurchases and future investments. Management believes that cash on hand, internally-generated cash flows, the funds available under its revolving credit facilities and the ability to access the debt and capital markets are sufficient to support the Company liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. As of January 31, 2013, the Company cash and cash equivalents totaled $504,838,000, of which approximately one-third was held in locations outside the U.S. where the Company has the intention to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings to support its continued expansion and investments outside of the U.S. Such cash balances are not available to fund U.S. cash requirements unless the Company were to decide to repatriate such funds. The Company has sufficient sources of cash in the U.S. to fund its U.S. operations without the need to repatriate any of those funds held outside the U.S. The following table summarizes cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities: (in thousands) 2012 2011 2010 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 328,290 $ 210,606 $ 298,925 Investing activities (331,146 ) (242,583 ) (186,612 ) Financing activities 71,446 (213,817 ) (224,799 ) Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 2,294 (1,843 ) 8,375 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 70,884 $ (247,637 ) $ (104,111 ) Operating Activities The Company had net cash inflows from operating activities of $328,290,000 in 2012, $210,606,000 in 2011 and $298,925,000 in 2010. The increase in 2012 from 2011 primarily resulted from a decelerated rate of inventory growth offset by various other outflows. The decrease in 2011 from 2010 primarily resulted from an increase in inventories partly offset by increased net earnings and adjustments for noncash items. Working Capital. Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) and the corresponding current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) were $2,564,997,000 and 5.4 at January 31, 2013, compared with $2,262,998,000 and 4.6 at January 31, 2012. Accounts receivable, less allowances, at January 31, 2013 were 5% lower than January 31, 2012, primarily due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. On a 12-month rolling basis, accounts receivable turnover was 21 times in 2012 and 20 times in 2011. Inventories, net at January 31, 2013 were 8% higher than January 31, 2012 with finished goods inventories increasing 13% and combined raw material and work-in-process inventories increasing TIFFANY & CO. K - 36 2%. The overall increase resulted from store openings and expanded product assortments which included a meaningful expansion of the Company statement jewelry assortment. Investing Activities The Company had net cash outflows from investing activities of $331,146,000 in 2012, $242,583,000 in 2011 and $186,612,000 in 2010. The increased outflow in 2012 was primarily due to payments of $82,664,000 to acquire intangible assets as well as a $25,000,000 payment related to an acquisition. The increased outflow in 2011 was primarily due to higher capital expenditures and notes receivable funded which was partly offset by net proceeds received from the sale of marketable securities and short-term investments. Marketable Securities and Short-Term Investments. The Company invests a portion of its cash in marketable securities and short-term investments. The Company had net proceeds received from the sale of marketable securities and short-term investments of $4,063,000 during 2012 and $55,139,000 during 2011 and net purchases of investments in marketable securities and short-term investments of $59,610,000 during 2010. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures are typically related to the opening, renovation and expansion of stores (which represents slightly more than half of capital expenditures in 2012, 2011 and 2010 excluding the relocation of Tiffany New York headquarters staff), distribution and manufacturing facilities and ongoing investments in information technology. Capital expenditures were $219,530,000 in 2012, $239,443,000 in 2011 and $127,002,000 in 2010, representing 6%, 7% and 4% of net sales in those respective years. The increase in 2011 was primarily due to the relocation of Tiffany New York headquarters staff to a single location, an increased number of store renovations and lower-than-normal spending in 2010 due to cost containment. Notes Receivable Funded. The Company may, from time to time, extend loans to diamond mining and exploration companies in order to obtain rights to purchase the mine output. In 2012, the Company loaned $8,015,000 to various companies. In 2011, the Company loaned $56,605,000 to various companies of which $50,000,000 was provided to Koidu Holdings S.A. (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note K. Commitments and Contingencies ). Payments to acquire intangible assets. In 2012, the Company made a $47,059,000 payment to retain an exclusive license for Peretti-designed jewelry and products. The Company also made a $35,605,000 payment to secure a prime retail location in Europe. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note B. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Payment for acquisition. In 2012, the Company made a $25,000,000 payment related to the acquisition of net assets associated with the five existing independently-operated TIFFANY & CO. stores located in the U.A.E. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note C. Acquisition. Financing Activities The Company had net cash inflows from financing activities of $71,446,000 in 2012 and net cash outflows from financing activities of $213,817,000 in 2011 and $224,799,000 in 2010. Year-over-year changes in cash flows from financing activities are largely driven by share repurchase activity, borrowings and cash dividends on common stock. Dividends. The cash dividend on the Company Common Stock was increased once in both 2012 and 2011 and twice in 2010. The Company Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends which totaled $1.25, $1.12 and $0.95 per common share in 2012, 2011 and 2010 with cash TIFFANY & CO. K - 37 dividends paid of $158,594,000, $142,840,000 and $120,390,000 in those respective years. The dividend payout ratio (dividends as a percentage of net earnings) was 38%, 33% and 33% in 2012, 2011 and 2010. Share Repurchases. In January 2008, the Company Board of Directors amended the existing share repurchase program to extend the expiration date of the program to January 2011 and to authorize the repurchase of up to an additional $500,000,000 of the Company Common Stock. In January 2011, the Company Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program ( 2011 Program ) and terminated the previously existing program. The 2011 Program authorizes the Company to repurchase up to $400,000,000 of its Common Stock through open market or private transactions. The timing of repurchases and the actual number of shares to be repurchased depend on a variety of discretionary factors such as stock price, cash-flow forecasts and other market conditions. In January 2013, the Board of Directors extended the expiration of the 2011 Program to January 31, 2014 and approximately $163,794,000 remained available for share repurchases under this authorization. The Company share repurchase activity was as follows: (in thousands, except per share amounts) 2012 2011 2010 Cost of repurchases $ 54,107 $ 174,118 $ 80,786 Shares repurchased and retired 813 2,629 1,843 Average cost per share $ 66.54 $ 66.23 $ 43.83 The Company suspended share repurchases during the second quarter of 2012 in order to allow for a more effective allocation of resources consistent with the Company growth strategies. The Company may resume repurchases under the stock repurchase program at any time in its discretion. At least annually, the Company Board of Directors reviews its policies with respect to dividends and share repurchases with a view to actual and projected earnings, cash flows and capital requirements. Recent Borrowings. The Company had net repayments of or net proceeds from short-term and long-term borrowings as follows: (in thousands) 2012 2011 2010 Short-term borrowings: Proceeds from credit facility borrowings, net $ 47,278 $ 13,548 $ 9,170 Proceeds from other credit facilities 40,298 61,020 Repayments of other credit facilities (361 ) (4,517 ) Net proceeds from short-term borrowings 87,215 70,051 9,170 Long-term borrowings: Proceeds from issuance 250,000 118,430 Repayments (60,000 ) (58,915 ) (218,845 ) Net proceeds from (repayments of) long-term borrowings 190,000 (58,915 ) (100,415 ) Net proceeds from (repayments of) total borrowings $ 277,215 $ 11,136 $ (91,245 ) TIFFANY & CO. K - 38 In December 2011, the Company entered into a three-year $200,000,000 revolving credit facility and a five-year $200,000,000 revolving credit facility (the Credit Facilities ). In July 2012, the Credit Facilities were increased from $200,000,000 to $275,000,000 resulting in a total borrowing capacity of $550,000,000 under the Company two principal Credit Facilities. Under the Credit Facilities, borrowings may be made from 10 participating banks at interest rates based upon either (i) local currency borrowing rates or (ii) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5%, whichever is higher, plus a margin based on the Company leverage ratio. In total, there was $194,034,000 outstanding and $479,851,000 available under all revolving credit facilities at January 31, 2013. The weighted-average interest rate for the outstanding amount at January 31, 2013 was 3.05%. In 2012, the Company issued $250,000,000 of long-term debt at an interest rate of 4.40%. Proceeds from long-term debt issuances were used to repay $60,000,000 of 10-year term, 6.56% Series D Senior Notes that came due in July 2012 and for general corporate purposes. In 2010, the Company issued 10,000,000,000 ($118,430,000 at issuance) of long-term debt at an interest rate of 1.72%. These proceeds, in conjunction with other short-term borrowings, were used to refinance existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note H. Debt for additional details. The ratio of total debt (short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt) to stockholders equity was 37% and 30% at January 31, 2013 and 2012. At January 31, 2013, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. Proceeds from Non-controlling Interest. In 2012, the Company received proceeds of $12,750,000 associated with its venture with Damas Jewellery LLC that acquired the five existing independently-operated TIFFANY & CO. stores located in the U.A.E. as noted in Payment for acquisition above. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note C. Acquisition for additional details on the venture. Contractual Cash Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following is a summary of the Company contractual cash obligations at January 31, 2013: (in thousands) Total 2013 2014-2015 2016-2017 Thereafter Unrecorded contractual obligations: Operating leases $ 1,531,194 $ 203,479 $ 360,730 $ 272,856 $ 694,129 Inventory purchase obligations a 300,876 298,634 2,242 Interest on debt b 509,232 51,936 103,017 71,067 283,212 Other contractual obligations c 66,931 51,708 7,568 905 6,750 Recorded contractual obligations: Short-term borrowings 194,034 194,034 Long-term debt 765,238 105,598 234,640 425,000 $ 3,367,505 $ 799,791 $ 579,155 $ 579,468 $ 1,409,091 a) The Company will, from time to time, secure supplies of diamonds by agreeing to purchase a defined portion of a mine output. Inventory purchase obligations associated with these agreements have been estimated for 2013 and included in this table. Purchases beyond 2013 that are contingent upon mine production have been excluded as they cannot be reasonably estimated. TIFFANY & CO. K - 39 b) Excludes interest payments on amounts outstanding under available lines of credit, as the outstanding amounts fluctuate based on the Company working capital needs. c) Consists primarily of fixed royalty commitments, construction-in-progress and packaging supplies. The summary above does not include the following items: Cash contributions to the Company pension plan and cash payments for other postretirement obligations. The Company plans to contribute approximately $30,000,000 to the pension plan in 2013. However, this expectation is subject to change if actual asset performance is different than the assumed long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. In addition, the Company estimates cash payments for postretirement health-care and life insurance benefit obligations to be $2,088,000 in 2013. Unrecognized tax benefits at January 31, 2013 of $28,217,000 and accrued interest and penalties of $7,878,000. The final outcome of tax uncertainties is dependent upon various matters including tax examinations, interpretation of the applicable tax laws or expiration of statutes of limitations. The Company believes that its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that it has adequately provided for these matters. However, the audits may result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in the Company owing additional taxes. Management anticipates that it is reasonably possible that the total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $20,000,000 in the next 12 months, a portion of which may affect the effective tax rate; however, management does not currently anticipate a significant effect on net earnings. Future developments may result in a change in this assessment. The following is a summary of the Company outstanding borrowings and available capacity under its credit facilities at January 31, 2013: (in thousands) Total Capacity Borrowings Outstanding Available Capacity Three-year revolving credit facility a $ 275,000 $ 45,738 $ 229,262 Five-year revolving credit facility b 275,000 32,290 242,710 Other credit facilities c 123,885 116,006 7,879 $ 673,885 $ 194,034 $ 479,851 a This facility matures in December 2014. b This facility matures in December 2016. c These credit facilities mature in 2013. In addition, the Company has available letters of credit and financial guarantees of $70,055,000 of which $30,454,000 was outstanding at January 31, 2013. Of those available letters of credit and financial guarantees, $58,620,000 expires within one year. Seasonality As a jeweler and specialty retailer, the Company business is seasonal in nature, with the fourth quarter typically representing at least one-third of annual net sales and a higher percentage of annual net earnings. Management expects such seasonality to continue. TIFFANY & CO. K - 40 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The Company consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and the differences could be material. Periodically, the Company reviews all significant estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements and records any necessary adjustments. The development and selection of critical accounting estimates and the related disclosures below have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Company Board of Directors. The following critical accounting policies that rely on assumptions and estimates were used in the preparation of the Company consolidated financial statements: Inventory. The Company writes down its inventory for discontinued and slow-moving products. This write-down is equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value, and is based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs might be required. The Company has not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish its reserve for discontinued and slow-moving products during the past three years. At January 31, 2013, a 10% change in the reserve for discontinued and slow-moving products would have resulted in a change of $5,418,000 in inventory and cost of sales. Property, plant and equipment and intangibles assets and key money . The Company reviews its property, plant and equipment and intangibles assets and key money for impairment when management determines that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable due to events or changes in circumstances. Recoverability of these assets is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of the asset with estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the comparisons indicate that the value of the asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset and the loss is recognized during that period. The Company did not record any material impairment charges in 2012, 2011 or 2010. Goodwill . The Company performs its annual impairment evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year or when circumstances otherwise indicate an evaluation should be performed. A qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, an evaluation, based upon discounted cash flows, is performed and requires management to estimate future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. The 2012, 2011 and 2010 evaluations resulted in no impairment charges. Notes receivables and other financing arrangements. The Company may, from time to time, provide financing to diamond mining and exploration companies in order to obtain rights to purchase the mine output. Management evaluates these financing arrangements and any other financing arrangements that may arise for potential impairment by reviewing the parties financial statements and projections and business, operational and other economic factors on a periodic basis. If the analyses indicate that the financing receivable is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized, in respect to all or a portion of the financing, during that period. The Company did not record any material impairment charges in 2012, 2011 or 2010. TIFFANY & CO. K - 41 Income taxes . The Company is subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The calculation of the Company tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across the Company global operations. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense. The Company income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect management best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. Foreign and domestic tax authorities periodically audit the Company income tax returns. These audits often examine and test the factual and legal basis for positions the Company has taken in its tax filings with respect to its tax liabilities, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions ( tax filing positions ). Management believes that its tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable. However, in specific cases, various tax authorities may take a contrary position. In evaluating the exposures associated with the Company various tax filing positions, management records reserves using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold for income tax positions taken or expected to be taken. Earnings could be affected to the extent the Company prevails in matters for which reserves have been established or is required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves. In evaluating the Company ability to recover its deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, management considers all available evidence. The Company records valuation allowances when management determines it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future. Employee benefit plans . The Company maintains several pension and retirement plans, as well as provides certain postretirement health-care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. The Company makes certain assumptions that affect the underlying estimates related to pension and other postretirement costs. Significant changes in interest rates, the market value of securities and projected health-care costs would require the Company to revise key assumptions and could result in a higher or lower charge to earnings. The Company used discount rates of 5.00% to determine its 2012 pension expense for all U.S. plans and 5.25% to determine its 2012 postretirement expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% increase in the discount rate would have decreased 2012 pension and postretirement expenses by $5,734,000 and $342,000. A decrease of 0.5% in the discount rate would have increased the 2012 pension and postretirement expenses by $5,892,000 and $660,000. The discount rate is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in the yield on applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bonds. Management selects a discount rate at which pension and postretirement benefits could be effectively settled based on (i) an analysis of expected benefit payments attributable to current employment service and (ii) appropriate yields related to such cash flows. The Company used an expected long-term rate of return of 7.50% to determine its 2012 pension expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% change in the long-term rate of return would have changed the 2012 pension expense by $1,361,000. The expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the average rate of return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. More specifically, consideration is given to the expected rates of return (including reinvestment asset return rates) based upon the plan current asset mix, investment strategy and the historical performance of plan assets. TIFFANY & CO. K - 42 For postretirement benefit measurement purposes, 8.00% (for pre-age 65 retirees) and 6.50% (for post-age 65 retirees) annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care were assumed for 2013. The rates were assumed to decrease gradually to 4.75% by 2020 and remain at that level thereafter. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health-care cost trend rate would not have a significant effect on the aggregate service and interest cost components of the 2012 postretirement expense. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note B. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
