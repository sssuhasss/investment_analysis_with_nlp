ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) The following Management Discussion and Analysis ( MD&A ) provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Newmont Mining Corporation and its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, Newmont, the Company, our and we ). We use certain non-GAAP financial measures in our MD&A. For a detailed description of each of the non-GAAP measures used in this MD&A, please see the discussion under Non-GAAP Financial Measures beginning on page 80. References to A$ refer to Australian currency. This item should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report. Overview Newmont is one of the world largest gold producers and is the only gold company included in the S&P 500 Index and Fortune 500. We have been included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index-World for 12 consecutive years and have adopted the World Gold Council Conflict-Free Gold Policy. We are also engaged in the exploration for and acquisition of gold and copper properties. We have significant operations and/or assets in the United States ( U.S. ), Australia, Peru, Ghana and Suriname. On January 14, 2019, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (as amended by the first amendment to the arrangement agreement, dated as of February 19, 2019, the Arrangement Agreement ) to acquire all outstanding common shares of Goldcorp, Inc. ( Goldcorp ) in a primarily stock transaction (the Proposed Transaction ). Under the terms of the agreement, Goldcorp shareholders will receive 0.3280 shares of Newmont common stock and $0.02 in cash for each Goldcorp common share they own, for a total transaction value of approximately $10 billion as of the announcement date on January 14, 2019. The transaction, which is subject to approval by both Newmont and Goldcorp shareholders, and other customary conditions and regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the second quarter of 2019. Upon closing, the combined company will be known as Newmont Goldcorp. On November 2, 2016, Newmont completed the sale of its 48.5% economic interest in PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara ( PTNNT ), which operated the Batu Hijau copper and gold mine ( Batu Hijau ) in Indonesia (the Batu Hijau Transaction ). As a result, Newmont presents Batu Hijau as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. In the following discussion and analysis, the operating statistics, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition that we present and discuss are those of our continuing operations unless otherwise indicated. For additional information regarding our discontinued operations, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the discussion in our Results of Consolidated Operations below. We continue to focus on delivering superior operational execution to generate the financial flexibility we need to fund our best projects, make strategic partnerships focused on profitable growth, reduce debt and return cash to shareholders. Consolidated Financial Results The details of our Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders are set forth below: Years Ended December 31, Increase 2018 2017 (decrease) Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders $ 280 $ (76) $ 356 Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders per common share, diluted $ 0.53 $ (0.14) $ 0.67 Years Ended December 31, Increase 2017 2016 (decrease) Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders $ (76) $ (226) $ 150 Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders per common share, diluted $ (0.14) $ (0.42) $ 0.28 Results in 2018 compared to 2017 were impacted by lower income tax expense, as higher taxes in the prior year from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( the Act ) enacted in December 2017 and a tax benefit recorded in the current year for the settlement of an 61 Table of Contents Uncertain Tax Position in Canada were partially offset by increased valuation allowances recorded on deferred tax assets in the United States during the fourth quarter of 2018, and a gain from the sale of our royalty portfolio in June 2018, partially offset by increased impairments of the Company long-lived assets related to certain exploration properties and the Emigrant operation in North America and lower production at various sites, including CC&V, Boddington, Akyem, Kalgoorlie and Carlin, as further described within the Results of Consolidated Operations section below. Results in 2017 compared to 2016 were impacted by a $1,003 impairment charge ($529 attributable to Newmont) in 2016, a full year of production at Merian and Long Canyon, an increase in gold production from the CC&V expansion completed in the first quarter of 2016, and higher realized prices, partially offset by higher taxes from the Act enacted in December 2017, a 2016 gain from the sale of the Company investment in Regis Resources Ltd ( Regis ) and adverse weather conditions impacting production at Tanami and Yanacocha during the first quarter of 2017. The details of our Sales are set forth below. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statement for additional information.

Costs applicable to sales increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a full year of commercial production at Merian and Long Canyon, the CC&V expansion completed in the first quarter of 2016, and higher direct operating costs, partially offset by lower leach pad inventory adjustments. For discussion regarding variations in operations, see Results of Consolidated Operations below. The details of our Depreciation and amortization are set forth below. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Years Ended December 31, Increase Percent 2018 2017 (decrease) Change Gold $ 1,142 $ 1,191 $ (49) (4) % Copper 39 37 2 5 Other 34 33 1 3 $ 1,215 $ 1,261 $ (46) (4) % Years Ended December 31, Increase Percent 2017 2016 (decrease) Change Gold $ 1,191 $ 1,127 $ 64 6 % Copper 37 51 (14) (27) Other 33 35 (2) (6) $ 1,261 $ 1,213 $ 48 4 % Depreciation and amortization decreased in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to lower production at various sites, partially offset by higher stockpile and leach pad inventory adjustments. Depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to a full year of production at Merian and Long Canyon, partially offset by a lower asset balance resulting from an impairment recorded at Yanacocha in December 2016. For discussion regarding variations in operations, see Results of Consolidated Operations below. Reclamation and remediation expense was $163, $192, and $169 for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Reclamation and remediation expense decreased in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to reclamation adjustments recorded in 2017 for revisions in the closure plan for the Rain mine, which is a non-operating site that is part of the Carlin mine complex along with decreased remediation costs at the Midnite Mine and Dawn mill sites. Reclamation and remediation expense increased in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to higher accretion expense at Yanacocha. Higher reclamation costs related to Yanacocha during 2016 were largely offset by increased costs at the Rain, Midnite, Resurrection and San Luis remediation and closure sites during 2017 . 64 Table of Contents Exploration expense was $197, $179, and $148 for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Exploration expense increased in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to increased expenditures at various projects in North America and Australia as we continue to focus on developing future reserves . Exploration expense increased in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to higher expenditures for near-mine exploration at Tanami, CC&V, Kalgoorlie and Yanacocha, in addition to greenfield exploration in the Guiana Shield and other locations as we continue to focus on developing future reserves. For additional information about proven and probable reserves, including additions and reductions, see the discussion in Gold, Copper and Silver Reserves in Item 1, Business, and Proven and Probable Reserves in Item 2, Properties. Advanced projects, research and development expense includes development project management costs, feasibility studies and other project expenses that do not qualify for capitalization. Advanced projects, research and development expense was $153, $143, and $134 for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Advanced projects, research and development expense increased in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to on-going study costs associated with the Yanacocha Sulfides and Chaquicocha Oxides projects in South America and the Long Canyon Phase 2 project in North America. Advanced projects, research and development expense increased in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to costs associated with full potential opportunities in North America and advanced studies on the Yanacocha Sulfides project, partially offset by prior-year Merian pre-production expenses. General and administrative expense was $244, $237, and $233 for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. General and administrative expense increased in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to higher IT project and services costs as well as higher labor costs. General and administrative expense in 2017 was in line with 2016. General and administrative expense as a percentage of Sales increased in 2018 to 3.4%, compared to 3.2% and 3.5% in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Impairment of long-lived assets totaled $369, $14 and $1,003 for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The 2018 impairments primarily related to the impairment of long-lived assets at certain exploration properties and the Emigrant operation in North America, due to the Company decision to focus on advancing other projects and a change in mine plan resulting in a significant decrease in mine life at Emigrant, respectively. The 2017 impairments related to equipment and long lived assets in South America, Australia and Corporate. The 2016 impairments were primarily related to the impairment of long-lived assets at Yanacocha in South America as a result of the updated long-term mining and closure plans. For additional information, see Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Other expense, net was $29, $32, and $58 for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Other expense, net decreased in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to prior-year net adjustments to the contingent consideration and related liabilities associated with the acquisition of the final 33.33% interest in Boddington in June 2009 and decreases in other expenses, partially offset by increased severance, legal and other settlements in 2018. Other expense, net decreased in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to lower severance and outsourcing costs, primarily at Corporate, and lower adjustments to the contingent consideration and related liabilities associated with the acquisition of the final 33.33% interest in Boddington in June 2009. Other income, net was $155, $54, and $69 for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Other income, net increased in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to a gain from the exchange of certain royalty interests for cash consideration and an equity ownership and warrants in Maverix Metals Inc. ( Maverix ) in June 2018, decreases in Australian dollar-denominated liabilities from a weaker Australian dollar, an increase in interest income, and an increase in business interruption insurance proceeds. These increases were partially offset by unrealized holding losses on marketable equity securities related primarily to Continental Gold Inc. and investment impairments for other-than-temporary declines in value of an equity method investment and a cost method investment in December 2018. Other income, net decreased in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to a gain of $103 from the sale of the Company investment in Regis in March 2016 and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by a loss of $55 associated with debt repayments in March 2016 and November 2016. Interest expense, net was $207, $241 and $273 for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Capitalized interest totaled $37, $22 and $33 in each year, respectively. Interest expense, net decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to reduced debt balances as a result of the repayment of the 2017 Convertible Senior Notes in 2017 and higher capitalized interest in 2018 compared to 2017 related to increased spend on the Subika Underground project and Ahafo Mill Expansion . Interest expense, net decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to reduced debt balances as a result of the repayment of the 2017 Convertible Senior Notes in 2017 and partial early extinguishment of the 2019, 2022 and 2039 Senior Notes in 2016, partially offset by lower capitalized interest in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the completion of the Long Canyon and Merian projects in 2016, partially offset by additional interest capitalized for the Subika Underground project and Ahafo Mill Expansion. 65 Table of Contents Income and mining tax expense was $386, $1,127 and $579 for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The effective tax rate is driven by a number of factors as illustrated in the table below. The comparability of our income tax expense for the reported periods has been primarily affected by (i) variations in our income before income taxes; (ii) geographic distribution of that income; (iii) impacts of enactment of tax reform; (iv) the non-recognition of tax assets; (v) percentage depletion; (vi) and the impact of specific transactions and assessments. As a result, the effective tax rate will fluctuate, sometimes significantly, year to year. This trend is expected to continue in future periods.

Due to changes the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act made to certain international tax provisions, it was prudent for the Company to restructure the holding of its non-U.S. operations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This was accomplished by executing and filing various check the box elections with respect to certain non-U.S. subsidiaries of the Company. The elections resulted in the conversions of these subsidiaries from branches and/or foreign partnerships to regarded foreign corporations. (2) Represents income (loss) from continuing operations by geographic location before income taxes and equity in affiliates. These amounts will not reconcile to the segment information for the reasons stated in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Includes deduction for percentage depletion of $(39) and mining taxes of $18. (4) Includes deduction for percentage depletion of $(10) and valuation allowance of $9. (5) Includes valuation allowance of $150 and SAB 118 adjustments of $(48). (6) Includes mining taxes of $36 and valuation allowance of $(45). A valuation allowance release of $(46) related to certain Australian deferred tax assets is being presented as a SAB 118 adjustment on the rate reconciliation in Note 9 as it relates to balances impacted by the tax restructuring completed at December 31, 2017. (7) Includes mining taxes of $9 and valuation allowance of $20. (8) Includes settlement of uncertain tax position of $(34) and valuation allowance of $(7). On December 22, 2017, the US enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( the Act ), significantly changing U.S. income tax law. Key provisions of the Act that impact Newmont include: (i) reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, (ii) repeal of the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT ) system (iii) replacement of the worldwide taxation system with a territorial tax system which exempts certain foreign operations from U.S. taxation, and (iv) further limitation on the deductibility of certain executive compensation. As a result, Newmont recorded a net provisional charge of $706 million which was included in the 2017 tax expense (benefit) in the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss), and consisted of two components: (i) a $312 million charge relating to re-measurement of net deferred tax assets and (ii) a $394 million charge related to the restructuring decisions implemented as a result of the Act. On December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118 ) was issued to address the application of US GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act. In accordance with SAB 118, the Company has finalized the impact of the Act and recorded a total net benefit of $48; $14 due to a reduction in the expense associated with the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities and a benefit of $34 due to a reduction in the expense related to restructuring decisions implemented because of the Act. In January 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income ( GILTI ) provisions of the Act. The GILTI provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. The guidance indicates that either accounting for deferred taxes related to GILTI inclusions or treating any taxes on GILTI inclusions as period cost are both acceptable methods subject to an accounting policy election. Effective the first quarter of 2018, the Company elected to treat any potential GILTI inclusions as a period cost as it is not 66 Table of Contents projecting any material impact from GILTI inclusions and any deferred taxes related to any inclusion would be immaterial. As of December 31, 2018, the Company does not have any GILTI inclusion. For additional information regarding our income and mining taxes, including details of our deferred tax assets, see Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Equity income (loss) of affiliates was $(33), $(16), and $(13) in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The increased loss in 2018 from 2017 is mainly due to a $10 and $5 increase in losses recognized at TMAC Resources Inc. and Minera La Zanja S.R.L. ( La Zanja ), respectively. The equity loss from affiliates increased in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to a $5 increase in losses recognized at La Zanja as a result of an impairment of its long-lived assets. Net income (loss) from discontinued operations was $61, $(38) and $(131) in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Net income (loss) from discontinued operations increased in 2018 from 2017, primarily due to the impacts on the Holt royalty obligation from an increase in discount rate, a decrease in gold price and an expected decrease in production from prior periods. The loss decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the net impacts of the Batu Hijau Transaction in 2016. For additional information regarding our discontinued operations, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. For discussion regarding Batu Hijau operating results, see the Discontinued operations section in Results of Consolidated Operations below. Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax from continuing operations was $(39), $(5), and $586 in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The income from noncontrolling interests increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to decreased losses at Yanacocha. The income from noncontrolling interests increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to decreased losses at Yanacocha, primarily related to the 2016 impairment of long-lived assets, and increased earnings at Merian due to a full year of production in 2017. Other comprehensive income (loss) was $(11), $42, and $- in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The decrease in 2018 from 2017 was primarily due to the change in fair value of pension and other post-retirement benefits, foreign currency translation adjustments and a reduced impact from cash flow hedge instruments. The increase in 2017 from 2016 was primarily due to the change in fair value of marketable securities and pension and other post-retirement benefits, partially offset by a reduced impact from cash flow hedge instruments.

See Non-GAAP Financial Measures beginning on page 80. 67 Table of Contents 2018 compared to 2017 Consolidated gold ounces produced decreased 3% due to: lower production from North America due to lower ore grade mined at CC&V, Long Canyon and Twin Creeks, as well as lower leach tons placed at Carlin, Phoenix and CC&V, partially offset by higher ore grade milled at Phoenix; consistent production from South America as a draw down of in-circuit inventory and higher mill throughput at Merian were offset by lower leach production at Yanacocha; lower production from Australia due to lower ore grade milled at Boddington and Kalgoorlie, partially offset by higher ore grade milled and recovery at Tanami. The lower ore grade milled at Kalgoorlie was a result of reduced ore tons mined from the pit due to a failure in the East wall of the pit, leading to the processing of lower-grade stockpiles; and higher production from Africa due to higher ore grade milled and recovery, as well as a draw down of in-circuit inventory at Ahafo, partially offset by lower mill throughput, ore grade and recovery at Akyem. Consolidated copper production decreased 4% primarily due to lower ore grade milled at Phoenix in North America and Boddington in Australia. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated gold ounce increased 2% primarily due to lower ounces sold, higher stockpile and leach pad inventory adjustments and higher oil prices, partially offset by a lower co-product allocation of costs to gold. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated copper pound increased 15% primarily due to a higher co-product allocation of costs to copper. Depreciation and amortization per gold ounce decreased 2% primarily due to lower amortization rates, partially offset by lower ounces sold and higher stockpile and leach pad inventory adjustments. Depreciation and amortization per consolidated copper pound increased 6% primarily due to a higher co-product allocation of depreciation and amortization to copper.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Foreign currency exchange rates can increase or decrease profit margins and Costs applicable to sales to the extent costs are paid in foreign currencies. Such fluctuations have not had a material impact on our revenue since gold and copper are sold throughout the world principally in U.S. dollars. Despite selling gold in London, we have no exposure to the euro or the British pound. Our foreign operations sell their gold and copper production based on U.S. dollar metal prices. Approximately 33%, 32% and 33% of our Costs applicable to sales were paid in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectivel y, of which approximately 28% was denominated in the Australian dollar in the current year. Variations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar at our foreign mining operations decreased Costs applicable to sales by $6 per ounce, net of hedging losses, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily in Australia. Variations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar at our foreign mining operations increased Costs applicable to sales by $1 per ounce, net of hedging losses, in 2017 compared to 2016, of 73 Table of Contents which Australia accounted for approximately $3 of the total increase, which was partially offset by Suriname of approximately $2 per ounce. Our Merian mine is located in the country of Suriname, which has been considered a hyperinflationary environment in recent years with a cumulative inflation rate of over 100% for the last three years. Although we have balances denominated in Surinamese dollars that relate to labor and payroll liabilities, substantially all of Merian activity is denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, our exposure to fluctuations in the Surinamese dollar exchange rate is not significant to Newmont financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Overview We have a disciplined cash management strategy of maintaining financial flexibility to execute our capital priorities and provide long-term value to our shareholders. Consistent with that strategy, we aim to self-fund development projects and make strategic partnerships focused on profitable growth, while reducing our debt and returning cash to stockholders through dividends. At December 31, 2018, we had $3,397 in Cash and cash equivalents , of which $850 was held in foreign subsidiaries and is primarily held in U.S dollar denominated accounts with the remainder in foreign currencies readily convertible to U.S. dollars. At December 31, 2018, $362 of the consolidated cash and cash equivalents was attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily related to our Peru and Suriname operations, which is being held to fund those operations. At December 31, 2018, $763 in consolidated cash and cash equivalents ($412 attributable to Newmont) was held at certain foreign subsidiaries that, if repatriated, may be subject to withholding taxes. We expect that there would be no additional tax burden upon repatriation after considering the cash cost associated with the withholding taxes. We believe that our liquidity and capital resources from U.S. operations are adequate to fund our U.S. operations and corporate activities. We believe our existing consolidated cash and cash equivalents, available capacity on our revolving credit facility, and cash generated from continuing operations will be adequate to satisfy working capital needs, fund future growth, meet debt obligations, pay dividends and meet other liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. At December 31, 2018, no borrowings were outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Our financial position was as follows: At December 31, At December 31, 2018 2017 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,397 $ 3,259 Debt 4,044 4,040 Leases and other financing obligations 217 25 Net Debt $ 864 $ 806 Borrowing capacity on revolving credit facility expiring May 2022 $ 2,914 $ 2,920 74 Table of Contents Cash Flows Our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are summarized as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities of continuing operations $ 1,837 $ 2,139 $ 1,917 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities of discontinued operations (10) (15) 869 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 1,827 $ 2,124 $ 2,786 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities of continuing operations $ (1,177) $ (946) $ (28) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities of discontinued operations (46) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (1,177) $ (946) $ (74) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities of continuing operations $ (455) $ (668) $ (1,486) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities of discontinued operations (331) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (455) $ (668) $ (1,817) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities of continuing operations was $1,837 in 2018, a decrease of $302 from 2017 primarily due to lower sales volumes and unfavorable working capital movements including an increase in accounts receivable, increase in stockpiles and ore on leach pads, timing of payments on accounts payable and increased tax payments, partially offset by $196 attributable to interest on our Convertible Senior Notes repayment in 2017 and higher realized gold prices.

Debt and Corporate Revolving Credit Facilities In May 2011, we entered into a $2,500 revolving credit facility, which was increased to $3,000 in May 2012. The facility is with a syndicate of financial institutions, provides for borrowings in U.S. dollars and contains a letter of credit sub-facility. Facility fees vary based on the credit ratings of our senior, uncollateralized, non-current debt. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a market based rate plus a margin determined by our credit rating. During 2017, the credit facility was extended to May 25, 2022. Fees and other debt issuance costs related to the extension of the facility were recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of debt and will be amortized over the term of the facility. At December 31, 2018, we had no borrowings outstanding under the facility. There was $86 and $80 outstanding on the sub-facility for letters of credit at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In September 2013, we entered into a Letter of Credit Facility Agreement ( LC Agreement ) with BNP Paribas, New York Branch.

Forward-Looking Statements The foregoing discussion and analysis, as well as certain information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby. See the discussion in Forward-Looking Statements in Item 1, Business. 79 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Financial Measures Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise noted, we present the Non-GAAP financial measures of our continuing operations in the tables below. For additional information regarding our discontinued operations, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization and Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization Management uses Earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) and EBITDA adjusted for non-core or certain items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period ( Adjusted EBITDA ) as non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, net income (loss), operating income (loss), or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by GAAP, and do not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. Although Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements by other companies, our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors. Management determination of the components of Adjusted EBITDA are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts.

Adjusted net income (loss) Management uses Adjusted net income (loss) to evaluate the Company operating performance and for planning and forecasting future business operations. The Company believes the use of Adjusted net income (loss) allows investors and analysts to understand the results of the continuing operations of the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries relating to the sale of products, by excluding certain items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period. Adjustments to continuing operations are presented before tax and net of our partners noncontrolling interests, when applicable.

(14) Re-measurement due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, included in Income and mining tax benefit (expense) , represents the re-measurement of our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities from 35% to the reduced tax rate of 21%. 2018 includes the final adjustments of $(14) to the provisional re-measurement expense. 2017 includes the provisional adjustments of $352 and $8 for changes in executive compensation deductions, partially offset by the release of a valuation allowance on alternative minimum tax credits of $48. For further information about the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, see Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. (15) Tax restructuring related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, included in Income and mining tax benefit (expense) , represents changes resulting from restructuring our holding of non-U.S. operations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 2018 includes the final adjustments of $(34) to the provisional restructuring charge. For further information about the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, see Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. (16) Valuation allowance and other tax adjustments, included in Income and mining tax benefit (expense) , predominantly represent adjustments to remove the impact of our valuation allowances for items such as foreign tax credits, alternative minimum tax credits, capital losses and disallowed foreign losses. We believe that these valuation allowances cause significant fluctuations in our financial results that are not indicative of our underlying financial performance. The adjustments during 2018 are due to an increase to the valuation allowance on U.S. net operating losses, credit carryovers, and other U.S. deferred tax assets of $191, other tax adjustments of $(3), and a decrease to the valuation allowance on U.S. capital losses of $(15). The adjustments during 2017 are due to an increase to the valuation allowance on credit carryovers of $94, a decrease to the valuation allowance carried on the deferred tax asset for investments of $10 and other tax adjustments of $7. The adjustments during 2016 are due to an increase to the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset related to the investment in Yanacocha of $299, a tax restructuring of $170, a decrease in the valuation allowance on capital loss carryover of $169, a carryback of 2015 tax loss to prior years of $124, an increase to the valuation allowance on tax credit carryovers of $70 and other tax adjustments of $17. Amounts are presented net of income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests of $(15), $-, and $-, respectively. (17) Per share measures may not recalculate due to rounding. (18) Adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share is calculated using diluted common shares, which are calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 83 Table of Contents Free Cash Flow Management uses Free Cash Flow as a non-GAAP measure to analyze cash flows generated from operations. Free Cash Flow is Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities of discontinued operations less Additions to property, plant and mine development as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company believes Free Cash Flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing the Company performance with its competitors. Although Free Cash Flow and similar measures are frequently used as measures of cash flows generated from operations by other companies, the Company calculation of Free Cash Flow is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies. The presentation of non-GAAP Free Cash Flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity as those terms are defined by GAAP, and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. The Company definition of Free Cash Flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, the Company believes it is important to view Free Cash Flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to the Company Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities , which the Company believes to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to Free Cash Flow, as well as information regarding Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities and Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities .

Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are calculated by dividing the costs applicable to sales of gold and copper by gold ounces or copper pounds sold, respectively. These measures are calculated for the periods presented on a consolidated basis. Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound statistics are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. The following tables reconcile these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

(3) Per ounce and per pound measures may not recalculate due to rounding. 84 Table of Contents All-In Sustaining Costs Newmont has developed a metric that expands on GAAP measures, such as cost of goods sold, and non-GAAP measures, such as Costs applicable to sales per ounce, to provide visibility into the economics of our mining operations related to expenditures, operating performance and the ability to generate cash flow from our continuing operations. Current GAAP measures used in the mining industry, such as cost of goods sold, do not capture all of the expenditures incurred to discover, develop and sustain production. Therefore, we believe that all-in sustaining costs is a non-GAAP measure that provides additional information to management, investors and analysts that aid in the understanding of the economics of our operations and performance compared to other producers and provides investors visibility by better defining the total costs associated with production. All-in sustaining cost ( AISC ) amounts are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently as a result of differences in the underlying accounting principles, policies applied and in accounting frameworks such as in International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ), or by reflecting the benefit from selling non-gold metals as a reduction to AISC. Differences may also arise related to definitional differences of sustaining versus development (i.e. non-sustaining) capital activities based upon each company internal policies. The Company recently revised its calculation of AISC to exclude development expenditures related to developing new or major projects at existing operations where these projects will materially benefit the operation included in Advanced projects, research and development and Exploration amounts presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The following disclosure provides information regarding the adjustments made in determining the all-in sustaining costs measure: Costs applicable to sales. Includes all direct and indirect costs related to current production incurred to execute the current mine plan. We exclude certain exceptional or unusual amounts from Costs applicable to sales ( CAS ), such as significant revisions to recovery amounts. CAS includes by-product credits from certain metals obtained during the process of extracting and processing the primary ore-body. CAS is accounted for on an accrual basis and excludes Depreciation and amortization and Reclamation and remediation , which is consistent with our presentation of CAS on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In determining AISC, only the CAS associated with producing and selling an ounce of gold is included in the measure. Therefore, the amount of gold CAS included in AISC is derived from the CAS presented in the Company Consolidated Statements of Operations less the amount of CAS attributable to the production of copper at our Phoenix and Boddington mines. The copper CAS at those mine sites is disclosed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Phoenix and Boddington mines is based upon the relative sales value of gold and copper produced during the period. Reclamation costs. Includes accretion expense related to Reclamation liabilities and the amortization of the related Asset Retirement Cost ( ARC ) for the Company operating properties. Accretion related to the Reclamation liabilities and the amortization of the ARC assets for reclamation does not reflect annual cash outflows but are calculated in accordance with GAAP. The accretion and amortization reflect the periodic costs of reclamation associated with current production and are therefore included in the measure. The allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Phoenix and Boddington mines. Advanced projects, research and development and exploration. Includes incurred expenses related to projects that are designed to sustain current production and exploration. We note that as current resources are depleted, exploration and advanced projects are necessary for us to replace the depleting reserves or enhance the recovery and processing of the current reserves to sustain production at existing operations. As these costs relate to sustaining our production and are considered a continuing cost of a mining company, these costs are included in the AISC measure. These costs are derived from the Advanced projects, research and development and Exploration amounts presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations less incurred expenses related to the development of new operations, or related to major projects at existing operations where these projects will materially benefit the operation in the future. The allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Phoenix and Boddington mines. 85 Table of Contents General and administrative. Includes costs related to administrative tasks not directly related to current production, but rather related to support our corporate structure and fulfill our obligations to operate as a public company. Including these expenses in the AISC metric provides visibility of the impact that general and administrative activities have on current operations and profitability on a per ounce basis. Other expense, net. We exclude certain exceptional or unusual expenses from Other expense, net , such as restructuring, as these are not indicative to sustaining our current operations. Furthermore, this adjustment to Other expense, net is also consistent with the nature of the adjustments made to Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders as disclosed in the Company non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted net income (loss). The allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Phoenix and Boddington mines. Treatment and refining costs. Includes costs paid to smelters for treatment and refining of our concentrates to produce the salable metal. These costs are presented net as a reduction of Sales on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Sustaining capital. We determined sustaining capital as those capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain current production and execute the current mine plan. Capital expenditures to develop new operations, or related to major projects at existing operations where these projects will materially benefit the operation, are generally considered non-sustaining or development capital. We determined the classification of sustaining and development (i.e. non-sustaining) capital projects based on a systematic review of our project portfolio in light of the nature of each project. Sustaining capital costs are relevant to the AISC metric as these are needed to maintain the Company current operations and provide improved transparency related to our ability to finance these expenditures from current operations. The allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Phoenix and Boddington mines. 86 Table of Contents Advanced Projects, Research and Treatment All-In Costs Development General Other and All-In Ounces Sustaining Years Ended Applicable Reclamation and and Expense, Refining Sustaining Sustaining (000)/Pounds Costs per December 31, 2018 to Sales (1)(2)(3) Costs (4) Exploration (5) Administrative Net (6) Costs Capital (7) Costs (millions) Sold oz/lb (8) Gold Carlin $ 760 $ 10 $ 24 $ 7 $ $ $ 152 $ 953 929 $ 1,027 Phoenix 202 6 4 2 1 9 23 247 237 1,043 Twin Creeks 240 2 9 2 1 40 294 359 820 Long Canyon 72 2 1 11 86 170 505 CC&V 260 3 5 2 1 29 300 357 840 Other North America 7 1 15 23 North America 1,534 23 49 15 3 9 270 1,903 2,052 928 Yanacocha 425 47 5 2 26 505 522 967 Merian 275 2 4 1 1 54 337 538 627 Other South America 9 1 10 South America 700 49 9 12 2 80 852 1,060 804 Boddington 571 9 21 46 647 726 891 Tanami 297 2 17 1 68 385 505 763 Kalgoorlie 232 4 4 1 21 262 322 813 Other Australia 2 5 10 (5) 5 17 Australia 1,100 17 26 10 (3) 21 140 1,311 1,553 845 Ahafo 323 3 6 1 4 40 377 436 864 Akyem 227 22 1 1 2 40 293 415 705 Other Africa 2 6 8 Africa 550 25 9 8 6 80 678 851 794 Corporate and Other 63 199 1 12 275 Total Gold $ 3,884 $ 114 $ 156 $ 244 $ 9 $ 30 $ 582 $ 5,019 5,516 $ 909 Copper Phoenix $ 55 $ 2 $ 1 $ $ $ 1 $ 8 $ 67 30 $ 2.24 Boddington 132 2 12 10 156 80 1.94 Total Copper $ 187 $ 4 $ 1 $ $ $ 13 $ 18 $ 223 110 $ 2.02 Consolidated $ 4,071 $ 118 $ 157 $ 244 $ 9 $ 43 $ 600 $ 5,242 (1) Excludes Depreciation and amortization and Reclamation and remediation .

Accounting Developments For a discussion of Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies Listed below are the accounting policies that we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported. Our discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the information reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) requires us to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements. We base our 89 Table of Contents assumptions and estimates on historical experience and various other sources that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from the estimates we calculate due to changes in circumstances, global economics and politics, and general business conditions. A summary of our significant accounting policies is detailed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We have outlined below those policies identified as being critical to the understanding of our business and results of operations and that require the application of significant management judgment. Depreciation and amortization Expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and depreciated using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to amortize such costs over the estimated future lives of such facilities or equipment and their components. Facilities and equipment acquired as a part of a capital lease, build-to-suit or other financing arrangement are capitalized and recorded based on the contractual lease terms. The facilities and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to depreciate such costs over the estimated productive lives of such facilities. These lives do not exceed the estimated mine life based on proven and probable reserves as the useful lives of these assets are considered to be limited to the life of the relevant mine. Costs incurred to develop new properties are capitalized as incurred where it has been determined that the property can be economically developed based on the existence of proven and probable reserves. At our surface mines, these costs include costs to further delineate the ore body and remove overburden to initially expose the ore body. At our underground mines, these costs include the cost of building access ways, shaft sinking and access, lateral development, drift development, ramps and infrastructure development. All such costs are amortized using the units-of-production ( UOP ) method over the estimated life of the ore body based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves. Major mine development costs incurred after the commencement of production, that are capitalized, are amortized using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves. To the extent that such costs benefit the entire ore body, they are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of the entire ore body. Costs incurred to access specific ore blocks or areas that only provide benefit over the life of that block or area are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of that specific ore block or area. Capitalized asset retirement costs incurred are amortized according to how the related assets are being depreciated. Open pit and underground mining costs are amortized using the UOP method based on recoverable ounces by source. Other costs, including leaching facilities, tailing facilities, and mills and other infrastructure costs, are amortized using the straight-line method over the same estimated future lives of the associated assets. The calculation of the UOP rate of amortization, and therefore the annual amortization charge to operations, could be materially impacted to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on proven and probable reserves. This would generally occur to the extent that there were significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in determining reserves. These changes could include: (i) an expansion of proven and probable reserves through exploration activities; (ii) differences between estimated and actual costs of production, due to differences in grade, metal recovery rates and foreign currency exchange rates; and (iii) differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of reserves. If reserves decreased significantly, amortization charged to operations would increase; conversely, if reserves increased significantly, amortization charged to operations would decrease. Such changes in reserves could similarly impact the useful lives of assets depreciated on a straight-line basis, where those lives are limited to the life of the mine, which in turn is limited to the life of the proven and probable reserves. The expected useful lives used in depreciation and amortization calculations are determined based on applicable facts and circumstances, as described above. Significant judgment is involved in the determination of useful lives, and no assurance can be given that actual useful lives will not differ significantly from the useful lives assumed for the purpose of depreciation and amortization calculations. Carrying value of stockpiles Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing. Mine sequencing may result in mining material at a faster rate than can be processed. We generally process the highest ore grade material first to maximize metal production; however, a blend of gold ore stockpiles may be processed to balance hardness and/or metallurgy in order to maximize throughput and recovery. Processing of lower grade stockpiled ore may continue after mining operations are completed. 90 Table of Contents Sulfide copper ores are subject to oxidation over time which can reduce expected future recoveries. Stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile, the number of contained ounces or pounds (based on assay data), and the estimated metallurgical recovery rates (based on the expected processing method). Stockpile ore tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. Costs are added to stockpiles based on current mining costs, including applicable overhead and depreciation and amortization relating to mining operations and removed at each stockpile average cost per recoverable unit as material is processed. We record stockpiles at the lower of average cost or net realizable value, and carrying values are evaluated at least quarterly. Net realizable value represents the estimated future sales price based on short-term and long-term metals price assumptions that are applied to expected short-term (12 months or less) and long-term sales from stockpiles, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. The primary factors that influence the need to record write-downs of stockpiles include declines in short-term or long-term metals prices, increases in costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy, materials and supplies, as well as realized ore grades and recovery rates. We recorded write-downs to reduce the carrying value of stockpiles to net realizable value of $152, $134 and $144 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as components of Cost applicable to sales and Depreciation and amortization . The significant assumption in determining the stockpile net realizable value for each mine site at December 31, 2018 is a long-term gold price of $1,300 per ounce. A decrease of $100 per ounce in the long-term gold price assumption could result in a write-down to the carrying value of stockpiles of up to approximately $150. Other assumptions include future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors unique to each operation based on the life of mine plans, as well as a long-term copper price of $3.00 per pound and an Australian to U.S. dollar long-term exchange rate of $0.80. If short-term and long-term commodity prices decrease, estimated future processing costs increase, or other negative factors occur, it may be necessary to record a write-down of ore on stockpiles. A high degree of judgment is involved in determining such assumptions and estimates and no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions.

Costs are added to ore on leach pads based on current mining costs, including applicable depreciation and amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are removed from ore on leach pads as ounces are recovered based on the average cost per estimated recoverable ounce of gold or pound of copper on the leach pad. Estimates of recoverable ore on the leach pads are calculated from the quantities of ore placed on the leach pads (measured tons added to the leach pads), the grade of ore placed on the leach pads (based on assay data) and a recovery percentage (based on ore type). In general, leach pads recover between 50% and 95% of the recoverable ounces in the first year of leaching, declining each year thereafter until the leaching process is complete. Although the quantities of recoverable metal placed on the leach pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on pads to the quantities of metal actually recovered (metallurgical balancing), the nature of the leaching process inherently limits the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. As a result, the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and estimates are refined based on actual results over time. Historically, our operating results have not been materially impacted by variations between the estimated and actual recoverable quantities of metal on our leach pads. Variations between actual and estimated quantities resulting from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in write-downs to net realizable value are accounted for on a prospective basis. We recorded write-downs to reduce the carrying value of leach pads to net realizable value of $202, $141 and $270 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as components of Cost applicable to sales and Depreciation and amortization . The significant assumption in determining the net realizable value for each mine site at December 31, 2018 is a long-term gold price of $1,300 per ounce. A decrease of $100 per ounce in the long-term gold price assumption could result in a write-down to the carrying value of leach pads of up to approximately $50. 92 Table of Contents Other assumptions include future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors unique to each operation based on the life of mine plans, as well as a long-term copper price of $3.00 per pound. If short-term and long-term commodity prices decrease, estimated future processing costs increase, or other negative factors occur, it may be necessary to record a write-down of ore on leach pads to net realizable value.

An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on the estimated fair value of the long-lived assets being tested for impairment and their carrying amounts. Fair value is typically determined through the use of an income approach utilizing estimates of discounted pre-tax future cash flows or a market approach utilizing recent transaction activity for comparable properties. These approaches are considered Level 3 fair value measurements. Occasionally, such as when an asset is held for sale, market prices are used. We believe our estimates and models used to determine fair value are similar to what a market participant would use. 93 Table of Contents The estimated undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability of long-lived assets and to measure the fair value of our mining operations are derived from current business plans, which are developed using short-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and our projections for long-term average metal prices. In addition to short- and long-term metal price assumptions, other assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves; value beyond proven and probable estimates; estimated future closure costs; and the use of appropriate discount rates. The significant assumption in determining the future cash flows for each mine site at December 31, 2018 is a long-term gold price of $1,300 per ounce. A decrease of $100 per ounce in the long-term gold price assumption could result in an impairment of our long lived assets of up to approximately $1,500 before consideration of other value beyond proven and probable reserves which may significantly decrease the amount of any potential impairment charge. Other assumptions include proven and probable mineral reserve estimates, value beyond proven and probable estimates, the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves, commodity-based and other input costs, future closure costs and discount rates unique to each operation, as well as a long-term copper price of $3.00 per pound and an Australian to U.S. dollar long-term exchange rate of $0.80. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded impairments of $369, $14, and $1,003, respectively, to reduce the carrying value of long-lived assets in Impairment of long-lived assets. Refer to Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding impairments. As discussed above under Depreciation and amortization, various factors could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted production schedules from proven and probable reserves which could impact the carrying value of our long-lived assets. The ability to achieve the estimated quantities of recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests involves further risks in addition to those factors applicable to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have been identified, due to the lower level of confidence that the identified mineralized material could ultimately be mined economically. Assets classified as exploration potential have the highest level of risk that the carrying value of the asset can be ultimately realized, due to the still lower level of geological confidence and economic modeling. Events that could result in additional impairment of our long-lived assets include, but are not limited to, decreases in future metal prices, unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, increases in future closure costs, and any event that might otherwise have a material adverse effect on mine site cash flows. Derivative instruments All financial instruments that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, except for the portion of the change in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges. Management applies judgment in estimating the fair value of instruments that are highly sensitive to assumptions such as commodity prices, market volatilities, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Variations in these factors could materially affect amounts credited or charged to earnings to reflect the changes in fair value of derivatives. Certain derivative contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, whereby the changes in fair value of these instruments are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and will be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations when the underlying transaction designated as the hedged item impacts earnings. The derivative contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges are designated against purchases where management believes the forecasted transaction is probable of occurring. To the extent that management determines that the forecasted transactions are no longer probable of occurring, gains and losses deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be reclassified to the Consolidated Statements of Operations immediately. Reclamation and remediation obligations Reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation costs. Reclamation obligations are based on when the spending for an existing environmental disturbance will occur. Changes in reclamation estimates at non-operating mines are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. We review, on at least an annual basis, the reclamation obligation at each mine. 94 Table of Contents Remediation costs are accrued based on management best estimate at the end of each period of the costs expected to be incurred at a site. Such cost estimates may include ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs. Changes in remediation estimates at inactive mines are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. Water treatment costs included in environmental remediation obligations are discounted to their present value as cash flows are readily estimable. All other costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value. Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. Any such changes in future costs, the timing of reclamation activities, scope, or the exclusion of certain costs not considered reclamation and remediation costs, could materially impact the amounts charged to earnings for reclamation and remediation. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required. Income and mining taxes We account for income taxes using the liability method, recognizing certain temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of our liabilities and assets and the related income tax basis for such liabilities and assets. This method generates either a net deferred income tax liability or asset for us, as measured by the statutory tax rates in effect. We derive our deferred income tax charge or benefit by recording the change in either the net deferred income tax liability or asset balance for the year. The financial statement effects of changes in tax law are recorded as discrete items in the period enacted as part of income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations, regardless of the category of income or loss to which the deferred taxes relate. For those effects determined to be incomplete, the Company determines whether a reasonable estimate of those effects can be made. If a reasonable estimate can be made, the estimate is recognized as a provisional amount. If a reasonable estimate cannot be made, no effects are recognized as provisional amounts until the first reporting period in which a reasonable estimate can be made. Provisional amounts are updated when additional information becomes available and the evaluation of such information is complete. The Company completes the accounting for all provisional amounts within a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date. Mining taxes represent state and provincial taxes levied on mining operations and are classified as income taxes as such taxes are based on a percentage of mining profits. With respect to the earnings that we derive from the operations of our consolidated subsidiaries, in those situations where the earnings are indefinitely reinvested, no deferred taxes have been provided on the unremitted earnings (including the excess of the carrying value of the net equity of such entities for financial reporting purposes over the tax basis of such equity) of our consolidated companies. Our operations are in multiple jurisdictions where uncertainties arise in the application of complex tax regulations. Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, while others are defined by general tax laws and regulations. We are subject to reviews of our income tax filings and other tax payments, and disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation of its contracts or laws. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be greater than the ultimate assessment, a tax benefit would result. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in Income and mining tax benefit (expense) . In certain jurisdictions, we must pay a portion of the disputed amount to the local government in order to formally appeal the assessment. Such payment is recorded as a receivable if we believe the amount is ultimately collectible. Valuation of deferred tax assets Our deferred income tax assets include certain future tax benefits. We record a valuation allowance against any portion of those deferred income tax assets when we believe, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized. We review the likelihood that we will realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets and therefore the need for valuation allowances on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if events indicate that a review is required. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or consolidated group recording the net deferred tax asset is considered, along with all other available positive and negative evidence. 95 Table of Contents Certain categories of evidence carry more weight in the analysis than others based upon the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. We look to the nature and severity of cumulative pretax losses (if any) in the current three-year period ending on the evaluation date or the expectation of future pretax losses and the existence and frequency of prior cumulative pretax losses. We utilize a rolling twelve quarters of pre-tax income or loss as a measure of our cumulative results in recent years. Concluding that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence which is objective and verifiable, such as cumulative losses in recent years. However, a cumulative three year loss is not solely determinative of the need for a valuation allowance. We also consider all other available positive and negative evidence in our analysis. Other factors considered in the determination of the probability of the realization of the deferred tax assets include, but are not limited to: Earnings history; Projected future financial and taxable income based upon existing reserves and long-term estimates of commodity prices; The duration of statutory carry forward periods; Prudent and feasible t ax planning strategies readily available that may alter the timing of reversal of the temporary difference; Nature of temporary differences and predictability of reversal patterns of existing temporary differences; and The sensitivity of future forecasted results to commodity prices and other factors. The Company assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the recent pretax losses and/or expectations of future pretax losses. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence such as our projections for future growth. On the basis of this evaluation, a valuation allowance has been recorded in the U.S., Canada and Peru. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth. During 2018, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets in the U.S., excluding the $26 related to AMT credits, of $150. The total valuation allowance on the U.S. deferred tax assets is $1,112 at December 31, 2018, which includes deferred tax assets related to capital losses and foreign tax credits. An additional valuation allowance of $20 on the deferred tax assets in Peru was recognized in 2018. The total valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets in Peru is $655 at December 31, 2018. In prior periods, the Company determined that the realization of deferred tax assets related to certain carry forward amounts such as tax losses and tax pools in Canada and capital losses and capital assets in Australia, do not meet the more likely than not standard. Accordingly, these assets continue to be subject to a valuation allowance. At December 31, 2018, the valuation allowance related to these assets was $1,130. The Company also carries valuation allowances on deferred tax assets in other foreign jurisdictions of $97. The re-measurement of the Company deferred tax assets due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also impacted related valuation allowances; see Schedule II-Valuation and Qualifying Accounts. For additional risk factors that could impact the Company ability to realize the deferred tax assets, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 96 Table of Contents
