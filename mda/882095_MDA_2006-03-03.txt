ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Gilead. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements. Executive Summary Gilead experienced another year of increasing revenues, profits and cash flows due to the successful launches and adoption of our drugs for the treatment of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the hepatitis B virus (HBV), as well as the maintenance of our product sales for AmBisome. We have been able to increase market share due to the favorable and consistent safety and efficacy profile that has been demonstrated to date on our products, including Viread, Truvada and Emtriva. The increase in market share on our HIV products helped contribute to a 53% increase in 2005 HIV product sales to $1.39 billion from 2004, while the continued adoption of Hepsera increased 2005 product sales to $186.5 million, an increase of 66% from 2004. We intend to build upon the successes of these products by continuing to engage in long-term clinical studies to differentiate our products. Additionally, within the HIV franchise, we intend to work with patients, physicians and key opinion leaders to educate them on the benefits of earlier treatment that is expected to help expand the treated-patient population. As we continue to gather positive data on the safety and efficacy of Truvada, which we launched in various European countries in 2005, we believe that the uptake of Truvada will continue to be a driving force in increasing our HIV product sales. Over the last few years, we have also focused on creating what we believe is a solid foundation for long-term growth by looking for opportunities to acquire or in-license innovative technologies or drug candidates and developing those technologies alongside our in-house initiatives. In 2005, we entered into a collaboration with Japan Tobacco Inc. (Japan Tobacco) and made advances on the Phase 1/2 clinical trial based on the HIV integrase inhibitor we licensed from them. Additionally, we demonstrated bioequivalence on a formulation of the fixed-dose combination of Truvada and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) Sustiva (the triple product) as well as began dosing patients in a Phase 1 study with the HCV drug candidate we licensed from Achillion Pharmaceuticals. Internally, we made significant progress in the enrollment of two Phase 3 studies comparing the efficacy and safety of tenofovir versus Hepsera in patients with HBV. We also filed an Investigational New Drug application in December 2005 for GS 9160, one of our internal integrase clinical candidates, and initiated a Phase 1 clinical study in healthy volunteers in February 2006. We intend to sustain the long-term growth of our business by continuing to discover and commercialize new drugs in the antivirals area, especially in the HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) areas. We also plan on exploring other therapeutic areas with significant unmet medical needs for licensing or acquisition opportunities that fit with our core competencies and complement our long-term growth strategy. Part of our ability to grow consists of building a strong global organization. During the year, we relocated our European commercial, medical and administrative headquarters from France to the United Kingdom, thereby uniting these functions with the regulatory, safety and information technology groups already headquartered in the United Kingdom. We also made strategic expansion of our global sales and marketing activities for 2005. As our revenues continued to increase, and as we continued to see collection improvements in certain European regions over the last two years, cash and investment management continued to be an important priority. In addition to re-examining our cash and investments portfolio, investment policies and strategies, we also used our cash for various collaborative activities. During the third quarter of 2005, along with Royalty Pharma, we purchased the royalty interest owned by Emory University in emtricitabine for $525.0 million. Furthermore, in December 2005, leveraging our strong financial position and results, we entered into a $500.0 million credit facility with a syndicate of banks consisting of a $300.0 million term loan and a $200.0 million revolving credit facility. The term loan, which we used to facilitate a one-time repatriation of qualified foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA), resulted in a $25.1 million income tax benefit that we recorded in 2005. We have not yet drawn any amounts under the revolving facility but the facility will give us flexibility to use our 31 Table of Contents funds for future corporate development initiatives, including licensing opportunities and potential acquisitions, while allowing us to meet our ongoing working capital and infrastructure needs. Our focus for 2006 will be to continue building upon our current infrastructure, continuing to advance our drug candidates through the clinic and executing on our operational goals of promoting our products safety and efficacy data to drive higher patient adoption. We also intend to build a stronger working relationship with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (Roche) with respect to Tamiflu under our amended agreement to jointly drive more effective marketing and supply chain strategies to meet the increasing demand for Tamiflu. We will also focus significant resources in preparing for the launch of the co-formulated Truvada-Sustiva product in the United States. Moreover, we are working with Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck) and BMS on arrangements to launch the co-formulated product outside of the United States. Finally, we will continue to strengthen our global infrastructure to better support our growing employee and customer base, including expanding certain aspects of our manufacturing capabilities as well as upgrading our facilities and information systems. Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories, prepaid royalties, clinical trial accruals and our tax provision. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market-specific assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, however, may differ significantly from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence an arrangement exists, delivery to the customer has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. We record estimated reductions to revenue for expected returns of expired products, distributor fees, government rebate programs such as Medicaid reimbursements and customer incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment. Estimates for distributor fees are based on contractually determined fixed percentages of sales. Estimates for government rebate programs and cash discounts are based on contractual terms, historical utilization rates and our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs. Estimates for product returns, including new products, are based on an on-going analysis of industry and historical return patterns. This includes monitoring the feedback that we receive from our sales force regarding customer use and satisfaction, reviewing inventory data available to us through our inventory management agreements with U.S. wholesalers to assist us in monitoring channel inventory levels, purchasing third-party data to monitor prescriptions as well as, for new products, comparing these products against our other products with same or similar sales channels. Further, we monitor the activities and clinical trials of our key competitors and assess the potential impact on our future sales and return expectations where necessary. Expected returns for our marketed drugs are generally low because the shelf lives for these products in the United States ranges from 24 months for Truvada and Hepsera, and up to 36 months for Viread and AmBisome. If conditions become more competitive for any of the markets served by our drugs or if other circumstances change, we may take actions to increase our product return estimates or we may offer additional customer incentives. This would result in an incremental reduction of future revenue at the time the return estimate is changed or new incentives are offered. Contract revenue for research and development (R&D) is recorded as performance occurs and the earnings process is completed based on the performance requirements of the contract. Nonrefundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist, and where there is no continuing involvement by Gilead, are recognized on the earlier to occur of when the payments are received or when collection is reasonably assured. 32 Table of Contents Revenues from non-refundable up-front license fees and milestone payments where we continue to have involvement such as through a development collaboration or an obligation to supply product are recognized as performance occurs and our obligations are completed. In accordance with the specific terms of Gilead obligations under these types of arrangements, revenues are recognized as the obligation is fulfilled or ratably over the development or manufacturing period. Revenues associated with substantive at-risk milestones are recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones as defined in the respective agreements. Advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including, but not limited to, contractual payment terms, historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days sales outstanding by customer and geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Our allowance for doubtful accounts balance as a percentage of total accounts receivable did not materially change from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions; however, significant deterioration in any of the above factors, especially with respect to the government funding and reimbursement practices in the European market could materially change these expectations and result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts. Inventories We record write downs of the value of our inventory based on review of the historical quantity of bad batches experienced during the manufacturing process and expectations of production and inventory levels. We also perform quality control reviews of our individual raw material batches. We generally do not record inventory write-offs relating to estimated obsolescence or risk of competition primarily because the shelf life of our products is long. However, if our current assumptions about future production or inventory levels, demand or competition were to change or if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could negatively impact our product gross margins and results of operations. Prepaid Royalties We capitalize royalties that we have prepaid at cost, specifically those related to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to Emory for the HIV indication, based on the present value of the future royalty obligation that we would expect to pay to Emory assuming certain expected levels of our product sales incorporating the emtricitabine technology. The net book value of our prepaid asset was determined using our best estimate of relevant future product sales available at the time we consummated the transaction; however, we review at least annually, the expected future performance of our products and indicators that would support a write-down in the net recoverable value of our asset. We amortize our prepaid royalties based on an effective royalty rate that we derive from forecasted HIV product sales incorporating emtricitabine. Our product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity. If a previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts, including the introduction of a competing product by us or one of our competitors into the same HIV market as emtricitabine, we would prospectively update the royalty rate used to amortize our prepaid royalties which may increase future royalty expense. We review our royalty rate at least annually and would adjust the rate based on any significant new facts or circumstances that may arise. Clinical Trial Accruals We record accruals for estimated clinical study costs. Most of our clinical studies are performed by third party contract research organizations (CROs). These costs are a significant component of R&D expenses. During 33 Table of Contents 2005, 2004 and 2003, we incurred CRO costs of $21.1 million, $24.7 million and $15.0 million, respectively. We accrue costs for clinical studies performed by CROs on a straight-line basis over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjust our estimates, if required, based upon our on-going review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CRO. We validate our accruals quarterly with our vendors and perform detailed reviews of the activities related to our significant contracts. Based upon the results of these validation processes, we assess the appropriateness of our accruals and make any adjustments we deem necessary to ensure that our expenses reflect the actual effort incurred by the CROs. Generally, a significant portion of the total clinical trial costs are associated with start up activities for the trial and patient enrollment. Gilead extensively outsources its clinical trial activities and usually performs only a small portion of the start-up activities in-house. As a result, CROs typically perform most of the total start-up activities for our trials, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training and program management. On a budgeted basis, these costs are typically 20% to 30% of the total contract value. On an actual basis, this percentage range is significantly wider as many of our contracts are either expanded or reduced in scope compared to the original budget, while start-up costs for the particular trial do not change significantly. Start-up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are milestone or event driven in nature. The remaining activities and related costs, such as patient monitoring and administration, generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study. Most contracts are negotiated as fixed unit prices and can vary in length between six months for a single dose Phase 1 study and up to two years or more for a more complex Phase 3 study. The average length of contracts in 2005, 2004 and 2003 has been at the upper end of this range in order to provide long-term safety and efficacy data to support the commercial launches of Viread, Truvada, Hepsera and Emtriva. All of our material CRO contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and Gilead is generally only liable for actual effort expended by the CRO at any point in time during the contract, regardless of payment status. Amounts paid in advance of services being performed will be refunded if a contract is terminated. Through December 31, 2005, differences between actual and estimated activity levels for any particular study were not significant enough to require a material adjustment. However, if management does not receive complete and accurate information from our vendors or has underestimated activity levels associated with a study at a given point in time, we would have to record additional and potentially significant R&D expenses in future periods. Tax Provision We estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we would reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. Such adjustments were made in the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004 when we determined that it was more likely than not that certain of our deferred tax assets would be realized, and therefore, we released the related valuation allowance. This resulted in an income tax benefit for 2005 and 2004 of approximately $8.2 million and $14.2 million, respectively. Similarly, if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets for which we have no valuation allowance, we would increase the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. Our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, regulations and/or rates, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, changes in our international organization, and changes in overall levels of income before tax. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of Gilead Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosures presented above relating to them. 34 Table of Contents Results of Operations Total Revenues We had total revenues of $2.03 billion in 2005, $1.32 billion in 2004 and $867.9 million in 2003. Included in total revenues are product sales, royalty revenue and contract revenue including revenue earned from manufacturing collaborations. Product Sales Product sales consisted of the following (in thousands): 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 HIV products: Viread $ 778,783 (1 )% $ 782,915 38 % $ 566,478 Truvada 567,829 737 % 67,865 Emtriva 47,486 (18 )% 57,600 475 % 10,021 HIV products 1,394,098 53 % 908,380 58 % 576,499 AmBisome 220,753 4 % 211,688 7 % 198,350 Hepsera 186,532 66 % 112,525 123 % 50,506 Vistide 6,629 (16 )% 7,904 4 % 7,576 DaunoXome 1,287 (25 )% 1,727 (49 )% 3,410 Total product sales $ 1,809,299 46 % $ 1,242,224 49 % $ 836,341 Total product sales increased by 46% in 2005 compared to 2004 and 49% in 2004 compared to 2003, in each case, primarily due to an increase in the volume of sales of our HIV products. A significant percentage of our product sales continue to be denominated in foreign currencies. We use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in Euro. This reduces, but does not eliminate, fluctuations in sales due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. HIV Products Viread, Truvada and Emtriva were approved for sale in the United States in October 2001, August 2004 and July 2003, respectively. Viread, Truvada and Emtriva were approved for sale in the European Union in February 2002, February 2005 and October 2003, respectively. Sales of Truvada commenced in the United States in the third quarter of 2004 and country-specific launches in Europe began in 2005. HIV product volume increased by 37% in 2005 compared to 2004 and by 55% in 2004 compared to 2003. HIV product volume growth in the United States were 18% and 44% in 2005 and 2004, respectively, whereas volume increases outside the United States were 71% and 77% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Viread Sales of Viread in 2005 remained relatively consistent with sales levels in 2004, resulting from the continued strong performance of Viread offset by the impact of patients switching from a Viread-containing regimen to one containing Truvada in countries where Truvada is available. Sales of Viread in 2004 increased by 38% compared to 2003, primarily driven by volume increases in the United States and across most European countries. Truvada Sales of Truvada increased in the United States in 2005, the first full year of Truvada sales. Truvada patients come primarily from patients new to therapy, and secondarily, from patients switching from other regimens, including those containing Viread or Emtriva. 35 Table of Contents Emtriva Sales of Emtriva in 2005 decreased by 18% compared to 2004, primarily driven by the impact of patients switching from an Emtriva-containing regimen to one containing Truvada in countries where Truvada is available. In 2006, we expect sales from our HIV products to be in the range of $1.675 billion to $1.750 billion. This does not include future product sales, if any, that may result should the triple product be approved for commercial sale in the United States, as we cannot predict whether the triple product will be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). AmBisome AmBisome product sales increased by 4% in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily driven by an increase in overall sales volume of 15%, partially offset by lower pricing in most regions outside of the United States. Product sales increased by 7% in 2004 over the prior year due primarily to higher sales volume outside of the United States and a stronger European currency, partially offset by lower pricing in many regions outside of the United States. Our discussion of U.S. AmBisome product sales relates solely to our sales of AmBisome to Astellas Pharma Inc. (Astellas), as successor to Fujisawa USA, Inc., which are recorded at our manufacturing cost. In 2004, due to greater manufacturing efficiencies, our per unit manufacturing cost for AmBisome decreased, thereby decreasing revenues reported for our sales to Astellas. Royalties that we earn on sales of AmBisome by Astellas are discussed under Royalty Revenue below. As a result of pricing pressures in Europe and increased competition, we expect AmBisome product sales for 2006 to be in the range of $205.0 million to $215.0 million. Hepsera Sales of Hepsera increased by 66% in 2005 compared to 2004 and by 123% in 2004 compared to 2003, primarily driven by sales volume growth in both Europe and the United States. Volume also increased with respect to our sales of Hepsera to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). We sell Hepsera to GSK at our manufacturing cost in connection with GSK distribution activities in Asia. Royalties we earn on sales of Hepsera by GSK are recorded as royalty revenue. We expect Hepsera sales for 2006 to be in the range of $200.0 million to $210.0 million, which takes into account the impact of existing and potential competitor products in the United States and Europe. Royalty Revenue We recorded royalty revenues of $196.9 million in 2005, compared with $63.4 million in 2004 and $25.2 million in 2003. During this three-year period, our most significant sources of royalty revenues were from sales of Tamiflu by Roche and sales of AmBisome in the United States by Astellas. In November 2005, Gilead resolved its dispute with Roche relating to our 1996 development and license agreement and agreed to terminate the related arbitration pending between Gilead and Roche. As part of the terms of the dispute resolution, Gilead and Roche have established joint committees to oversee manufacturing, commercial and pandemic planning for the product and we have the option to co-promote Tamiflu in specialized areas in the United States. Related to the dispute resolution, Roche also paid us $80.7 million that we recognized as royalty revenue in 2005, which consisted of $18.2 million relating to disputed royalties from 2001 to 2003, $11.8 million relating to the reimbursement of the 2004 contractual cost of goods adjustment that had previously reduced our earned royalties, and $50.7 million relating to the updating of royalties payable to Gilead for the first nine months of 2005 based on current year royalty rates instead of the prior year effective royalty rate. Excluding the amounts received in connection with the dispute resolution, the significant year over year increase for Tamiflu royalties in 2005 was primarily due to higher royalties received from Roche for higher Tamiflu sales caused by the significant 2004/2005 flu season, particularly in Japan, and the fulfillment of orders for pandemic 36 Table of Contents readiness supplies in certain countries in 2005. Royalty revenues earned from Roche, including the amounts recognized from the dispute resolution in 2005, were $161.6 million, $44.6 million and $12.0 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Comparing 2004 to 2003, royalty revenues earned from sales of Tamiflu by Roche also increased substantially due to a severe influenza epidemic in the United States from late 2003 through early 2004. Increased awareness and discussion about the supply of influenza treatments in 2003/2004 also increased Roche sales of Tamiflu and consequently, our royalties in 2004. As it is difficult to estimate third party product sales, similar to our other out-licensing arrangements other than our arrangement with Astellas, under which royalties are recorded one month in arrears, we record royalty revenue from Roche one quarter in arrears. Royalty revenue earned on sales of AmBisome by Astellas have remained consistent at $13.0 million for both 2005 and 2004, a slight increase from $12.5 million in 2003. Contract Revenue Total contract revenues were $22.2 million in 2005, compared with $19.0 million in 2004 and $6.3 million in 2003. In 2005, contract revenues consisted primarily of a $7.0 million milestone payment earned from OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OSI), as successor to Eyetech Pharmaceuticals, Inc., upon its first commercial sale of Macugen in the United States in 2005 as well as revenue earned from various contract manufacturing projects. In 2004, contract revenues consisted primarily of $10.0 million in research and milestone revenue earned from OSI, which included $7.6 million recognized upon the filing of new drug applications by OSI in Europe and the United States for Macugen. Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross Margin The following table indicates total product sales and cost of goods sold (in thousands) and product gross margin: 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 Total product sales $ 1,809,299 46 % $ 1,242,224 49 % $ 836,341 Cost of goods sold $ 260,326 56 % $ 166,587 48 % $ 112,691 Product gross margin 86 % 87 % 87 % Our product gross margin for 2005 was slightly lower than that for 2004 due to product mix changes as patients continue to switch from Viread, a higher margin product, to Truvada. Our product gross margin was relatively consistent from 2003 to 2004 as the positive impact of improvements in certain manufacturing processes and a favorable foreign currency environment in 2004 was offset by changes in product sales mix. As a result of Royalty Pharma and our purchase of the royalty interest owned by Emory in emtricitabine in July 2005, we capitalized $341.3 million in prepaid royalties, representing our 65% share of the $525.0 million purchase price. In the third quarter of 2005, we have begun to amortize this prepaid royalty to cost of goods sold over the remaining life of the underlying patent based on an effective royalty rate derived from our forecasted sales. We recorded royalties to Royalty Pharma based on actual emtricitabine net sales relative to Royalty Pharma 35% ownership interest in the underlying Emory royalty interest. Although we expect this transaction to have a favorable impact on our emtricitabine product gross margin in the long-term, the impact to our overall product gross margin in 2005 was not significant. We expect our product gross margin in 2006 to be generally consistent with that of 2005. This excludes the impact of the potential launch of the triple product as we cannot predict whether or when the triple product will be approved by the FDA. Although we expect the launch of the triple product will decrease our product gross margin percentage, there will be no impact to our net profit. This is due to the fact that as the majority owner of 37 Table of Contents our joint venture with BMS, we will consolidate 100% of the triple product revenue. However, we will earn the full product margin of the Truvada portion of the triple product but earn zero product margin on the Sustiva portion of the triple product. Research and Development Expenses The following table summarizes our R&D expenses into these major components (in thousands): 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 Research $ 55,918 27 % $ 43,872 17 % $ 37,494 Clinical development 178,015 21 % 146,983 37 % 107,438 Pharmaceutical development 43,791 34 % 32,697 (11 )% 36,832 Total $ 277,724 24 % $ 223,552 23 % $ 181,764 R&D expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries and benefits, clinical studies performed by CROs, materials and supplies, licenses and fees and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs. Our R&D activities are separated into three main categories: research, clinical development and pharmaceutical development. Research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology costs. Clinical development costs include costs for Phase 1, 2, 3 and 4 clinical trials. Pharmaceutical development costs consist of product formulation and chemical analysis costs. The $54.2 million increase in R&D expenses in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily attributable to a $15.0 million payment made to Emory in connection with the amendment of our existing license agreement with Emory related to our obligation to develop emtricitabine for the hepatitis B indication, a $15.0 million payment made to Japan Tobacco related to the execution of our HIV integrase license agreement for GS 9137, increased salaries from additional headcount of $8.9 million and increased clinical and product development activities associated with our HCV, HBV and HIV programs. The payments made to Emory and Japan Tobacco were expensed as the underlying technology was incomplete and had no alternative future use, and in the case of Emory, no significant R&D activities are expected in the next several years. The $41.8 million increase in R&D expenses in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily attributable to increased salaries of $10.2 million due largely to higher headcount, $13.0 million in research and license fees paid in relation to the HCV collaboration agreements we entered into with Achillion Pharmaceuticals (Achillion) and Genelabs Technologies (Genelabs) during 2004, as well as increased CRO costs of $9.7 million associated with increased clinical activities. The payments made to Achillion and Genelabs were expensed as the underlying technology had no alternative future use. The increase in 2004 R&D expenses compared to 2003 was partially offset by a decrease in spending due to the discontinuation of our two internal programs, GS 9005 and GS 7340, that focused on the development of certain HIV investigational products. Our 2003 R&D expenses included a reimbursement to Gilead of $13.2 million from the settlement of a contractual dispute with a vendor. In 2006, we expect R&D expenses to increase over 2005 levels reflecting increased spending on our internal and collaborative R&D efforts relating to our expectation that pipeline products will progress into more advanced clinical trials, increased headcount as well as the impact of expensing share-based payments. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table summarizes our SG&A expenses (in thousands): 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 Selling, general and administrative $ 379,248 25 % $ 302,793 30 % $ 233,266 38 Table of Contents SG&A expenses for 2005 were $379.2 million, an increase of $76.5 million compared to 2004. The significant increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries of $12.8 million due largely to higher headcount, an increase in market research, speaker programs and symposia costs of $9.2 million, $8.4 million of severance and relocation expenses associated with the relocation of our European commercial, medical and administrative headquarters from France to the United Kingdom, an increase in medical education costs of $5.6 million, an increase in journal advertising costs of $4.6 million, as well as a general expansion of our sales and marketing activities worldwide. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of $5.7 million as a result of higher collections in certain European countries. SG&A expenses in 2004 were $302.8 million compared to $233.3 million for 2003, which includes the reclassification of Phase 4 clinical trial expenses to R&D as mentioned above. The significant increase in expenses in 2004 compared to 2003 is primarily related to an increase in salaries of $14.2 million due largely to higher headcount, an increase in consulting fees of $5.9 million related to Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and business strategy consulting, as well as an increase in costs of $12.6 million relating to speaker programs, grants and journal advertising. The remainder of the increase in SG&A expenses in 2004 as compared to 2003 was generally due to our increased global marketing efforts and expanded infrastructure required to support the growth of our business. During 2004, as part of our infrastructure investments, we implemented a reorganization of our sales and marketing functions into a newly created commercial division. In conjunction with this reorganization, we created and filled the new position of executive vice-president, commercial operations responsible for global commercial operations and strategy for our product portfolio. In 2006, we expect SG&A expenses to increase primarily due to the anticipated costs associated with launching and supporting Truvada in various countries, costs related to our ongoing investment in our global commercial organization through hiring and promotional programs as well as the impact of expensing share-based payments. Purchased In-process Research and Development In connection with the acquisition of the net assets of Triangle Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Triangle) completed in January 2003, we recorded purchased in-process R&D expenses of $488.6 million in the first quarter of 2003. The charge was due to Triangle incomplete R&D programs that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date. The value of the purchased in-process R&D was determined by estimating the related future net cash flows between 2003 and 2020 using a present value risk adjusted discount rate of 15.75%. This discount rate is a significant assumption and is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital adjusted upward for the risks associated with the projects acquired. The projected cash flows from the acquired projects were based on estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the projects considering the stage of development of each potential product acquired, the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of each product, the life of each potential commercialized product and associated risks including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a drug compound including obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals, and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. 39 Table of Contents A summary of these programs at the acquisition date follows, updated for subsequent changes in status of development: Program Description Status of Development Estimated Acquisition Date Fair Value (in millions) Emtricitabine for HIV A nucleoside analogue that has been shown to be an inhibitor of HIV replication in patients. Four Phase 3 studies were completed prior to the acquisition date. U.S. marketing approval received from the FDA in July 2003 for Emtriva and European Union approval received from the European Commission in October 2003. $ 178.8 Emtricitabine/Tenofovir DF Fixed Dose Combination for HIV Therapy A fixed-dose co-formulation of tenofovir and emtricitabine. As of the acquisition date, work had not commenced on the potential co-formulation except to the extent that work on emtricitabine as a single agent was progressing. In March 2004, applications for marketing approval were submitted in the United States and European Union and in August 2004 marketing approval in the United States was received from the FDA for Truvada, the fixed-dose co-formulation of tenofovir and emtricitabine. Marketing approval in the European Union was received in February 2005 and sales commenced later during the first quarter. $ 106.4 Amdoxovir for HIV A purine dioxolane nucleoside that may offer advantages over other marketed nucleosides because of its activity against drug resistant viruses as exhibited in patients with HIV infection. This program was in Phase 2 trials at acquisition date. In 2004, we terminated the licensing agreement with Emory University and the University of Georgia Research Foundation, Inc. and development was discontinued. $ 114.8 Clevudine for HBV A pyrimidine nucleoside analogue that has been shown to be an inhibitor of HBV replication in patients chronically infected with HBV. This program was in Phase 1/2 trials at acquisition date. In August 2003, the licensing agreement with Bukwang Pharm. Ind. Co., Ltd was terminated and development was discontinued. $ 58.8 Emtricitabine for HBV An inhibitor of HBV replication in patients chronically infected with HBV. This program was in Phase 3 trials at acquisition date but was completed as of December 31, 2004. We continue to evaluate our strategy for the development of emtricitabine for the hepatitis B indication. We currently do not expect to undertake any significant R&D activities in the next several years. $ 29.8 40 Table of Contents Asset Impairment During 2003, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $10.2 million on certain of our long-lived assets, primarily leasehold improvements, manufacturing and laboratory equipment. This non-cash charge was driven by the decision in December 2003 to terminate our liposomal R&D activities in San Dimas and discontinue the DaunoXome product line. The impairment was based on our analysis of the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the affected assets as compared to their carrying value. As the carrying value exceeded the related estimated undiscounted cash flows, we wrote the carrying value of the long-lived assets down to their estimated fair value. In 2004, subsequent to our decision to discontinue the DaunoXome product line, we received unanticipated requests in Europe asking Gilead to reconsider selling DaunoXome. As a result of these requests, management decided to continue selling this product in certain countries although we are evaluating our supply and sales strategy with respect to DaunoXome. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the new cost basis for the impaired assets was not adjusted for these new facts and circumstances. Gain on Warrant Pursuant to our agreement with Eyetech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Eyetech), as predecessor to OSI, that we entered into in March 2000, we received a warrant to purchase 791,667 shares of Eyetech series B convertible preferred stock, exercisable at a price of $6.00 per share. In January 2004, Eyetech completed an initial public offering of its common stock at which time we adjusted the fair value of the warrant resulting in a gain of $20.6 million. At that time, the fair value of the warrant was estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model with a volatility rate of 50% and a discount rate of 2.8%. At the end of the first quarter of 2004, we exercised the warrant on a net basis using shares of Eyetech common stock as consideration for the exercise price and subsequently held 646,841 shares of Eyetech common stock. In the second quarter of 2004, we sold all of the Eyetech shares we owned and realized a gain of approximately $2.3 million, which is included in interest and other income, net, in 2004. Make-Whole Payment on Convertible Debt Redemption In October 2004, we called for the redemption of all our outstanding 2% convertible senior notes due December 15, 2007 on November 20, 2004. The convertible senior notes were called under a provisional redemption based upon the market price of Gilead common stock exceeding certain thresholds. The aggregate principal amount outstanding of the notes was $345.0 million. The convertible senior notes were redeemable at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes, plus a cash payment equal to accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date and a cash make-whole payment equal to $60 per $1,000 principal value of the notes less interest actually paid or accrued and unpaid from the date of issuance of the notes to the redemption date. Interest on the convertible senior notes ceased to accrue on the redemption date, and the only remaining right of the holders thereafter was to receive the redemption payment, including accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date and the make-whole payment. Alternatively, note holders could elect to convert their notes into shares of Gilead common stock at a price of $23.50 per share, or 42.55 shares of Gilead common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the notes. Holders of substantially all of the outstanding notes converted their notes into shares of Gilead common stock prior to the November 20, 2004 redemption date. As a result of these conversions, 14,676,952 shares of common stock were issued to these note holders. In connection with the redemption, we made aggregate make-whole payments of $7.4 million to note holders. Interest and Other Income, net We recorded interest and other income, net of $47.1 million in 2005, $18.9 million in 2004 and $13.0 million in 2003. The increases in 2005 and 2004 are primarily attributable to the higher cash balances over the previous year. Interest income in 2006 will depend principally upon prevailing interest rates and the level of our cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances. 41 Table of Contents Interest Expense We incurred interest expense of $0.4 million in 2005, compared with $7.3 million in 2004 and $21.9 million in 2003. The decrease in 2005 over 2004 is primarily attributable to the conversion of our $345.0 million 2% convertible senior notes into shares of our common stock in November 2004. The decrease in 2004 over 2003 is primarily due to the conversion of our $250.0 million 5% convertible subordinated notes into shares of our common stock in December 2003. We expect interest expense in 2006 to increase as a result of the interest we will be paying under the $300.0 million five-year term loan that we entered into in December 2005. Minority Interest in Joint Venture The minority interest reflects BMS interest in the operating results of our joint venture with BMS in the United States. The operations of the joint venture commenced in 2005 with activities primarily focusing on the the triple product and achieving bioequivalence with the various co-formulations. With the achievement of a successful formulation in the fourth quarter of 2005, we expect a significant increase in activities during 2006, especially if FDA and commercial approval is obtained. Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes Our provision for (benefit from) income taxes was $347.9 million, $207.1 million and ($95.5) million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2005 effective income tax rate of 29.9% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due generally to the recognition of previously unbenefitted net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, certain earnings from operations in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than the United States and in jurisdictions for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States and the benefit derived from the qualifying dividend made under the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA), partially offset by state taxes. On October 22, 2004, the AJCA was signed into law. The AJCA allows for a deduction of 85% of certain qualified foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined in the AJCA. We elected to apply this provision to qualifying earnings that were repatriated in 2005. The earnings repatriation resulted in a one-time tax provision benefit of approximately $25.1 million, which includes the reversal of the deferred tax liability previously accrued on unremitted foreign earnings of $13.1 million at December 31, 2004. The 2004 effective income tax rate of 31.5% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due generally to the recognition of previously unbenefitted net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards and certain earnings from operations in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than the United States and in jurisdictions for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States, partially offset by state taxes. The tax benefit in 2003 includes the reversal of our valuation allowance against certain of our deferred tax assets. In December 2003, we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize a portion of the benefit related to our deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we reduced the valuation allowance against the assets and recorded a tax benefit of $111.6 million. The recognition of these deferred tax assets had no impact on our cash flows. Partially offsetting our recorded tax benefit was income tax expense associated with income earned by our foreign subsidiaries, foreign losses at lower tax rates and the non-tax deductibility of purchased in-process R&D. We had significant net operating loss carryforwards that were used to reduce our U.S. tax liability. Excluding the benefit relating to the reversal of our valuation allowance and the write off of purchased in-process R&D, our effective tax rate for 2003 was 5%. 42 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, our working capital, and our statements of cash flows (in thousands): 2005 2004 2003 As of December 31: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 2,323,885 $ 1,254,038 $ 707,000 Working capital 2,636,870 1,596,241 1,080,003 Year Ended December 31: Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 715,080 511,378 234,607 Investing activities (691,916 ) (490,828 ) (727,345 ) Financing activities 441,896 78,659 82,091 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable securities Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.32 billion at December 31, 2005, an increase of 85% from December 31, 2004. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.25 billion at December 31, 2004, an increase of 77% from December 31, 2003. The increase of $1.07 billion in 2005 and $547.0 million in 2004 was primarily due to: net cash provided by operations of $715.1 million in 2005 and $511.4 million in 2004; proceeds from the issuance of stock under employee stock plans of $143.3 million in 2005 and $78.8 million in 2004; and proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $300.0 million in 2005. These increases were partially offset by capital expenditures of $46.9 million in 2005 and $51.4 million in 2004. Working Capital Working capital at December 31, 2005 was $2.64 billion compared to $1.60 billion at December 31, 2004. Significant factors that resulted in an increase in 2005 working capital were: $1.07 billion increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; $24.9 million increase in accounts receivable primarily due to increased sales in 2005 partially offset by improved collection activity especially in certain European countries where collections have traditionally been slower; $80.9 million increase in inventories to meet growing demand in our HIV products and in Hepsera as well as to meet Gilead Access Program requirements; $31.8 million increase in deferred tax assets; and $35.1 million increase in prepaids and other current assets primarily related to the current portion of our prepaid royalties to Emory for emtricitabine. These increases were partially offset by: $87.0 million increase in income taxes payable primarily due to higher profitability partially offset by tax benefits from employee stock plans; $60.0 million increase reflecting the current portion of the $300.0 million term loan that we entered into in December 2005; and 43 Table of Contents $25.4 million increase in other accrued liabilities including increases in accruals related to Medicaid rebates, royalty expenses, sales and marketing expenses and rent expenses, partially offset by the decrease in the liability associated with the fair value of our forward currency contracts as the U.S. dollar strengthened against the Euro. Working capital at December 31, 2004 was $1.60 billion compared to $1.08 billion at December 31, 2003. Significant factors that resulted in an increase in 2004 working capital were: $547.0 million increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; $118.8 million increase in accounts receivable primarily due to increased sales of Viread in the United States and Europe and sales from our new product, Truvada, launched in the United States in the latter half of 2004; and $37.9 million increase in inventories primarily due to an increase in the purchase of raw materials and the production of Viread and Truvada inventory to meet increasing sales demand. The increases in the 2004 working capital were partially offset by: $144.5 million decrease in current deferred tax assets that was primarily due to the utilization of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards to offset taxable income; and $67.6 million increase in current liabilities including: $15.0 million increase in Medicaid rebate obligations; $14.4 million increase in deferred revenue primarily due to royalties received from Roche; $12.9 million increase in the liability associated with the fair value of our forward currency contracts as the U.S. dollar continued to weaken against the Euro; and $11.9 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to increases in our raw material purchases in support of Viread and Truvada sales growth. Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by increases in our net income, which has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of cash. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2005 of $715.1 million is primarily attributed to our product sales growth, increased cash collections from customers as well as payments received related to the resolution of our dispute with Roche, partially offset by the $341.3 million of prepaid royalties that we made to Emory. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities primarily related to purchases, sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities and capital expenditures. We used $691.9 million of cash for investing activities during 2005, compared to $490.8 million during 2004 and $727.3 million in 2003. Increases in cash used in investing activities were primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents balances year over year. Net cash used in investing activities for purchases of available-for-sale securities increased in 2005 to $644.0 million, compared to $439.5 million in 2004 and $190.2 million in 2003. Cash used in investing activities was higher in 2003 compared to 2004, due to the $375.5 million we paid for the acquisition of Triangle net assets and the $123.0 million paid for the purchase of our Foster City facilities. Capital expenditures made in 2005 related primarily to expanding certain aspects of our manufacturing capabilities as well as upgrading our facilities. Our capital expenditures in 2004 were primarily for facilities improvements, including approximately $26.0 million associated with the completion of our pilot plant in Foster City to be used to develop our drug processes and prepare materials to supply clinical trials, as well as additional spending for laboratory and manufacturing equipment to accommodate our growth. 44 Table of Contents Cash Provided by Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities in 2005 primarily related to proceeds from our $300.0 million term loan as well as stock option exercises and stock purchases made under our employee stock plans. We also received $143.3 million, $78.8 million and $83.8 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, relating to stock option exercises and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan. We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: the commercial performance of our current and future products; the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials; the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews; the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities; administrative expenses; the possibility of acquiring manufacturing capabilities or additional office facilities; the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products; the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and defense costs associated with, settlements of and adverse results of litigation. We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings, such as from our universal shelf registration statement filed in December 2004 for the potential issuance of up to $500.0 million of our securities. If such funding is required, we cannot assure that it will be available on favorable terms, if at all. In December 2005, we entered into an agreement with a syndicate of banks, to provide for a five-year $500.0 million senior credit facility. The $500.0 million facility comprised an uncollateralized $300.0 million term loan and an uncollateralized $200.0 million revolving credit facility. The proceeds from the term loan were used in December 2005 to facilitate a qualified intercompany cash dividend distribution of $280.0 million from Gilead Biopharmaceutics Ireland Corporation (GBIC), a wholly-owned Irish subsidiary of Gilead, to the U.S. parent company, Gilead Sciences, Inc., as part of the repatriation of our qualified foreign earnings under the provisions of the AJCA. Under the terms of the $300.0 million term loan, the minimum principal payments to be repaid at the end of each calendar quarter, beginning March 31, 2006, are $15.0 million. As of December 31, 2005, there were no amounts outstanding under the $200.0 million revolving credit facility. The capacity of the revolving credit facility will increase to a maximum of $500.0 million as the $300.0 million term loan is repaid. We have the ability to irrevocably cancel any unutilized portion of the revolving credit facility, in whole or in part. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our financial position or results of operations. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations consist of capital and operating leases, as well as purchase obligations primarily in the form of capital commitments, purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory-related items and clinical trials contracts. The following table summarizes our enforceable and legally binding obligations, future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless 45 Table of Contents of the fact that they are cancelable as of December 31, 2005. The following table summarizes these contractual obligations at December 31, 2005 (in thousands): Payments due by period Contractual Obligations Total Less than one year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Term loan (1) $ 300,000 $ 60,000 $ 120,000 $ 120,000 $ Capital lease obligations 898 276 622 Operating lease obligations 99,113 17,318 31,081 19,923 30,791 Capital commitments (2) 4,596 4,596 Purchase obligations (3) 367,082 126,569 240,513 Clinical trials (4) 90,878 45,294 41,697 3,887 Total $ 862,567 $ 254,053 $ 433,913 $ 143,810 $ 30,791 (1) At December 31, 2005, we had long-term debt which consists of the $300 million, 5-year term loan that we entered into in the fourth quarter of 2005. (2) At December 31, 2005, we had firm capital project commitments of approximately $4.6 million relating to facilities improvement. In addition, we have budgeted significant capital expenditures for 2006, mainly due to anticipated increased infrastructure needs and higher R&D spending. We may have more capital spending in future years. (3) At December 31, 2005, we had firm commitments to purchase active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory-related items. The amounts disclosed only represent minimum purchase requirements. Actual purchases are expected to significantly exceed these amounts. (4) At December 31, 2005, we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. Although most of our contracts with CROs are cancelable, we generally have not cancelled such contracts. These amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to existing contracts and anticipated or potential new contracts. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004 ), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which is a revision of SFAS 123. SFAS 123R supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) 25 and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows . SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values, beginning with the first quarterly period after June 15, 2005, with early adoption permitted. On April 14, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a new rule that amended the compliance date for SFAS 123R such that we are allowed to adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2006. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition under SFAS 123R. We adopted SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006. Under SFAS 123R, we must determine the appropriate fair value model and related assumptions to be used for valuing share-based payments, the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption. The transition methods include modified prospective and retroactive adoption methods. The modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of SFAS 123R, while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated. We have determined that we will adopt the modified prospective method and continue to use the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Based on our preliminary analysis, we expect that the adoption of SFAS 123R will have a material impact on our income statement and earnings per share. We currently estimate the impact to be approximately $0.15 to $0.17 per diluted share for 2006. SFAS 123R also requires the benefit of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported in the statement of cash flows as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current accounting literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. 46 Table of Contents
