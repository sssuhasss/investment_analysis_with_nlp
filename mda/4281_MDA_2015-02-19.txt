Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (dollars in millions, except per-share amounts and ingot prices; production and shipments in thousands of metric tons [kmt]) Overview Our Business Alcoa is a global leader in lightweight metals engineering and manufacturing. Alcoa innovative, multi-material products, which include aluminum, titanium, and nickel, are used worldwide in aircraft, automobiles, commercial transportation, packaging, building and construction, oil and gas, defense, consumer electronics, and industrial applications. 51 Alcoa is also the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina combined, through its active participation in all major aspects of the industry: technology, mining, refining, smelting, fabricating, and recycling. Aluminum is a commodity that is traded on the London Metal Exchange (LME) and priced daily. Sales of primary aluminum and alumina represent approximately 40% of Alcoa revenues. The price of aluminum influences the operating results of Alcoa. Alcoa is a global company operating in 30 countries. Based upon the country where the point of sale occurred, the United States and Europe generated 51% and 27%, respectively, of Alcoa sales in 2014. In addition, Alcoa has investments and operating activities in, among others, Australia, Brazil, China, Guinea, Iceland, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, all of which present opportunities for substantial growth. Governmental policies, laws and regulations, and other economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, affect the results of operations in these countries. Management Review of 2014 and Outlook for the Future In 2014, growth in global aluminum demand reached 7%, which was consistent with management projection at the end of 2013. The LME price of aluminum remained relatively stable compared to 2013; however, regional premiums increased substantially, significantly benefitting the smelting portion of Alcoa upstream operations. The refining portion of the upstream operations continued to make progress in shifting customer pricing away from the LME aluminum price to a mixture of alumina pricing index and spot pricing. Additionally, the midstream and downstream operations continued to grow revenue through innovations and share gains. Cost headwinds continued to be a challenge; however, management was able to more than offset these with net productivity improvements across all operations. Alcoa also realized the benefit of a stronger U.S. dollar in 2014 compared to 2013. As a result of all of the foregoing, each of Alcoa operations achieved improved results over 2013. Separately from the 2014 operational results, management initiated a number of portfolio actions during the year. In the upstream operations, following similar actions taken in 2013, smelting capacity of 424 kmt was permanently closed (of which 150 kmt was previously curtailed) and 159 kmt was temporarily curtailed, which in turn led to the temporary curtailment of 200 kmt in refining capacity. Additionally, in the midstream operations, 200 kmt of can sheet capacity was permanently closed. Management also completed the divestiture of four operations within the upstream and midstream operations that were no longer part of the strategic direction of Alcoa. These included a majority ownership interest in both a mining and refining joint venture and a smelter and wholly-owned interests in three rolling mills and an aluminum rod plant. From a growth perspective, Alcoa completed the acquisition of an aerospace business and entered into an agreement to purchase another, both of which will enhance the portfolio of Alcoa downstream operations. Management continued its focus on liquidity and cash flows, generating incremental improvements in procurement efficiencies, overhead rationalization, working capital, and disciplined capital spending. This focus and the related results enabled Alcoa to end 2014 with a strengthened balance sheet. The following financial information reflects certain key measures of Alcoa 2014 results: Sales of $23,906 and Net income of $268, or $0.21 per diluted share; Total segment after-tax operating income of $2,043, an increase of 68% from 2013; Cash from operations of $1,674, reduced by pension plan contributions of $501; Capital expenditures of $1,219, under $1,500 for the fifth consecutive year; Cash on hand at the end of the year of $1,877, in excess of $1,400 for the sixth consecutive year; Increase in total debt of $533, but a decline of $1,726 since 2008; and Debt-to-capital ratio of 37.4%, a decrease of 70 basis points from 2013. 52 In 2015, management is projecting continued growth (increase of 7%) in the global consumption of primary aluminum, consistent with that of the last three years, led by China at an estimated 10%. All other regions in the world are expected to have positive growth in aluminum demand over 2013, including North America at an estimated 5%. After considering forecasted added production, along with few industry-wide capacity curtailments, management anticipates a balanced aluminum market. For alumina, growth in global consumption is estimated to be 6%, and supply is expected to slightly exceed overall demand due to added production in China, as well as other parts of the world. Management also anticipates improved market conditions for value-added products in the aerospace, automotive, building and construction, packaging, and industrial gas turbine global end markets, despite declines in certain regions, while the commercial transportation global end market is expected to be flat. Aerospace is expected to be driven by large commercial aircraft due to an eight-year order backlog, as well as strength in orders for regional jets. For automotive, growth is anticipated in both the United States, due to the replacement of older vehicles, low borrowing rates, and the decline in gasoline prices, and China, due to new clean air legislation and a continued increase in the percentage of the population driving automobiles. In building and construction, awarded nonresidential contracts are up once again in North America while the decline in Europe continues. For packaging, growth in China and Europe, mainly driven by the penetration of aluminum in the growing beer segment and the continued conversion from steel cans to aluminum cans, respectively, is expected to more than offset a slight decrease in North America. Industrial gas turbines are expected to see growth as a result of new demand for high technology turbines and upgrades of existing turbines. In commercial transportation, strong production in North America, underpinned by significant order backlog, is expected to be offset by weakness in Europe, including from the impact of sanctions on Russia. On a company-wide basis, management has established and is committed to achieving the following specific goals in 2015: generating incremental savings over those realized in 2014 from procurement, overhead, and working capital programs; generating cash from operations that will exceed capital spending by a minimum of $500; and maintaining a debt-to-EBITDA ratio between 2.25 and 2.75. Looking ahead over the next two years, management will focus on the 2016 strategic targets that were set at the end of 2013. These targets include lowering Alcoa refining and smelting operations on the respective global cost curves to the 21st (from 27th) and 38th (from 43rd) percentiles, respectively. Additionally, the targets include driving revenue growth, while improving margins that meet or exceed historical levels, in the midstream (increase of $1,000) and downstream (increase of $1,200) operations, of which 90% and 75%, respectively, is expected to be generated from innovation and share gains. The following describes the progress made on these targets in 2014 as well as future expectations. At December 31, 2014, Alcoa refining operations were at the 25th percentile, a two-percentage point improvement, and its smelting operations were at the 43rd percentile on the respective cost curves. In 2014, actions taken to improve Alcoa position on the cost curve for both refining and smelting operations included productivity improvements, both new initiatives as well as the full realization of those implemented in 2013. Additionally, for the refining operations, Alcoa curtailed approximately 200 kmt of high-cost capacity and increased production by approximately 200 kmt from low-cost capacity. The smelting operations also permanently closed 274 kmt of high cost capacity in Australia and the United States. While the benefits of these actions can be seen in Alcoa improved position on the refining cost curve at the end of 2014, the benefits in the smelting operations were offset by the strong U.S. dollar. Other actions taken in 2014 to help drive a lower position on the respective cost curves include the sales of ownership interests in a mining and refining joint venture in Jamaica and a smelter in the United States. The sales of these operations occurred late in 2014; therefore, management expects to realize the benefits of divesting this high-cost capacity in 2015. Also in late 2014, the refining operations 53 completed the conversion of the fuel source from fuel oil to natural gas at a refinery in Spain and the smelting operations renewed power contracts at each of the three smelters in Canada, all of which are expected to yield significant cost savings beginning in 2015. Additionally, as previously mentioned, Alcoa has initiatives to drive further productivity improvements during 2015. Furthermore, the smelter and the refinery at the joint venture in Saudi Arabia are fully operational and are expected to provide a two-percentage point reduction on each of the respective cost curves by the end of 2016. In 2014, the midstream and downstream operations generated revenue of $7,351 and $6,006, respectively, representing an increase of $245 and $273 ($81 was related to an acquisition see below), respectively, compared to the 2013 baselines. The increase related to the midstream operations was mostly due to rising demand for aluminum sheet from the U.S. automotive end market as a result of changing emission regulations. A significant portion of this demand is being met by Alcoa Davenport, IA rolling mill facility, which completed an expansion to meet this demand in January 2014. For the downstream operations, the increase (excluding the acquisition) was largely attributable to higher demand for both Alcoa fasteners and jet engine components products from the commercial aerospace end market and Alcoa aluminum wheels in the commercial transportation end market. Beyond the improvement in 2014, revenue growth for both the midstream and downstream operations is expected from multiple sources. In mid 2014, Alcoa entered into two $1,000 multi-year supply agreements with two major customers, one to supply aluminum sheet and plate from the midstream operations and the other to supply jet engine components from the downstream operations. Additionally, the midstream operations anticipate positive contributions from both the Davenport facility, as production continues to ramp-up to serve growing demand, and Alcoa Tennessee rolling mill facility, which expects to complete an expansion to meet automotive demand in 2015. Likewise, the downstream operations expect favorable results from projects completed in late 2014 or expected to be completed in 2015 to meet growing demand in both the aerospace and commercial transportation end markets. These projects include an expansion of aluminum lithium capabilities in Lafayette, IN, expansions in LaPorte, IN and Hampton, VA to provide nickel-based super alloy structural components and airfoil blades for jet engines, and an expansion at a facility in Hungary to double production of aluminum wheels. Separately from the organic growth described above, Alcoa acquired an aerospace jet engine components company, Firth Rixson, in November 2014. Firth Rixson generated approximately $970 of revenue in 2014 (of which $81 was reflected in Alcoa Statement of Consolidated Income) and is expected to generate approximately $1,600 of revenue by 2016. See Engineered Products and Solutions in Segment Information under Results of Operations below. Results of Operations Earnings Summary Net income attributable to Alcoa for 2014 was $268, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared with Net loss attributable to Alcoa of $2,285, or $2.14 per share, in 2013. The improvement in results of $2,553 was primarily due to the absence of all of the following: an impairment of goodwill, a discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets, and charges for the resolution of a legal matter. Other significant changes in results included the following: higher energy sales, a higher average realized price for primary aluminum, net productivity improvements, and net favorable foreign currency movements. These other changes were mostly offset by higher charges related to a number of portfolio actions (e.g., capacity reductions, divestitures, acquisitions), higher overall input costs, and an unfavorable change in income taxes due to higher operating results. Net loss attributable to Alcoa for 2013 was $2,285, or $2.14 per share, compared with Net income attributable to Alcoa of $191, or $0.18 per share, in 2012. The decrease in results of $2,476 was mostly due to an impairment of goodwill, a discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets, and charges for the resolution of a legal matter. Other significant changes in results included the following: a lower average realized price for aluminum in the upstream and midstream businesses, higher input costs across three of the four segments, the absence of a gain on the sale of U.S. hydroelectric power assets, and restructuring and other charges related to the permanent shutdown 54 of smelter capacity. These other changes were mostly offset by net productivity improvements, net favorable foreign currency movements, the absence of both a net charge for certain environmental remediation matters and a charge for the civil portion of a legal matter, and stronger volumes in three of the four segments. Sales Sales for 2014 were $23,906 compared with sales of $23,032 in 2013, an improvement of $874, or 4%. The increase was mainly the result of higher volumes in the midstream, downstream, and alumina portion of the upstream operations, higher energy sales resulting from excess power due to curtailed smelter capacity, increased buy/resell activity for primary aluminum, and a higher average realized price for primary aluminum. These items were partially offset by lower primary aluminum volumes, including those related to curtailed and shutdown smelter capacity, and unfavorable price/product mix in the midstream operations. Sales for 2013 were $23,032 compared with sales of $23,700 in 2012, a decline of $668, or 3%. The decrease was primarily due to lower primary aluminum volumes, including those related to curtailed and shutdown smelter capacity, a decline in the average realized price for primary aluminum, driven by lower London Metal Exchange (LME) prices, and unfavorable pricing in the midstream segment due to a decrease in metal prices. These items were somewhat offset by higher volumes in the alumina portion of the upstream operations and the midstream and downstream operations. Cost of Goods Sold COGS as a percentage of Sales was 80.1% in 2014 compared with 83.7% in 2013. The percentage was positively impacted by net productivity improvements across all segments, both the previously mentioned higher energy sales and higher average realized price for primary aluminum, net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar, lower costs for caustic and carbon, and the absence of costs related to a planned maintenance outage in 2013 at a power plant in Australia. These items were partially offset by higher costs for bauxite, energy, and labor, write-offs of inventory related to the decisions to permanently shut down certain smelter and rolling mill capacity (difference of $58 see Restructuring and Other Charges below), and costs related to a new labor agreement that covers employees at 10 locations in the United States (see below). On June 6, 2014, the United Steelworkers ratified a new five-year labor agreement covering approximately 6,100 employees at 10 U.S. locations; the previous labor agreement expired on May 15, 2014. In 2014, as a result of the preparation for and ratification of the new agreement, Alcoa recognized $18 ($12 after-tax) in COGS for, among other items, business contingency costs and a one-time signing bonus for employees. Additionally, as a result of the provisions of the new labor agreement, a significant plan amendment was adopted by one of Alcoa U.S. pension plans. Accordingly, this plan was required to be remeasured, which resulted in a $13 decrease to 2014 net periodic benefit cost. COGS as a percentage of Sales was 83.7% in 2013 compared with 86.1% in 2012. The percentage was positively impacted by net productivity improvements across all segments, the absence of a net charge for five environmental remediation matters ($194), net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar, and a positive impact related to the March 2012 fire at the cast house in Massena, NY (insurance recovery in 2013 plus the absence of business interruption and repair costs that occurred in 2012). These items were partially offset by the previously mentioned realized price impacts and higher input costs, including those related to bauxite mining and a planned maintenance outage at a power plant. Selling, General Administrative, and Other Expenses SG&A expenses were $995, or 4.2% of Sales, in 2014 compared with $1,008, or 4.4% of Sales, in 2013. The decline of $13 was due to decreases in various expenses, including legal and consulting fees and contract services, mostly offset by costs associated with an acquisition of an aerospace business ($42 see Engineered Products and Solutions in Segment Information below) and higher stock-based compensation expense. SG&A expenses were $1,008, or 4.4% of Sales, in 2013 compared with $997, or 4.2% of Sales, in 2012. The increase of $11 was principally the result of higher labor costs, partially offset by a decrease in professional expenses and contract services and lower bad debt expense. 55 Research and Development Expenses R&D expenses were $218 in 2014 compared with $192 in 2013 and $197 in 2012. The increase in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily caused by spending related to an upgrade of a Micromill in San Antonio, TX for the Global Rolled Products segment and additional spending related to inert anode and carbothermic technology for the Primary Metals segment. The decrease in 2013 as compared to 2012 was mainly driven by lower spending related to inert anode and carbothermic technology for the Primary Metals segment and other various projects, mostly offset by spending related to an upgrade of a Micromill in San Antonio, TX for the Global Rolled Products segment. The Micromill upgrade is expected to be completed by the end of 2015 and, as a result, the Micromill will develop and qualify aluminum products for the automotive end market. Provision for Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization The provision for DD&A was $1,371 in 2014 compared with $1,421 in 2013. The decrease of $50, or 4%, was principally the result of net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar, particularly against the Australian dollar and Brazilian real, and a reduction in expense related to the permanent shutdown of smelter capacity in Australia, Canada, the United States, and Italy that occurred at different points during both 2013 and 2014 (see Primary Metals in Segment Information below). These items were somewhat offset by new DD&A associated with both the acquisition of an aerospace business in November 2014 (see Engineered Products and Solutions in Segment Information below) and assets placed into service in January 2014 related to the completed automotive expansion at the Davenport, IA plant. The provision for DD&A was $1,421 in 2013 compared with $1,460 in 2012. The decrease of $39, or 3%, was mostly due to net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar, particularly against the Australian dollar and Brazilian real; a reduction in expense related to the permanent shutdown of smelter capacity in Canada, the United States, and Italy that occurred mid-2013 (see Primary Metals in Segment Information below); and the absence of expense due to the divestiture of U.S. hydroelectric power assets in late 2012 (see Primary Metals in Segment Information below). These items were slightly offset by new depreciation associated with a hydroelectric power project in Brazil (Machadinho). In early 2013, there was a change in the legal structure of the entity that owned the project resulting in Alcoa recording its 30.99% share of the project assets directly, whereas in 2012, Alcoa share was recorded as an equity method investment. Impairment of Goodwill In 2013, Alcoa recognized an impairment of goodwill in the amount of $1,731 ($1,719 after noncontrolling interest) related to the annual impairment review of the Primary Metals segment (see Goodwill in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below). Restructuring and Other Charges Restructuring and other charges for each year in the three-year period ended December 31, 2014 were comprised of the following: 2014 2013 2012 Asset impairments $ 406 $ 116 $ 40 Net loss on divestitures of businesses 332 - - Layoff costs 259 201 47 Resolution of a legal matter - 391 85 Other 199 82 21 Reversals of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs (28 ) (8 ) (21 ) Restructuring and other charges $ 1,168 $ 782 $ 172 Layoff costs were recorded based on approved detailed action plans submitted by the operating locations that specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans, union contracts or statutory requirements, and the expected timetable for completion of the plans. 2014 Actions. In 2014, Alcoa recorded Restructuring and other charges of $1,168 ($703 after-tax and noncontrolling interest), which were comprised of the following components: $693 ($443 after-tax and noncontrolling interest) for exit costs related to decisions to permanently shut down and demolish three smelters and two rolling mills (see below); $332 ($163 after-tax and noncontrolling interest) for the divestitures of four operations (see Alumina, Primary Metals, 56 and Global Rolled Products in Segment Information below); $68 ($45 after-tax and noncontrolling interest) for the temporary curtailment of two smelters and a related production slowdown at one refinery (see below); $51 ($36 after-tax and noncontrolling interest) for layoff costs, including the separation of approximately 1,120 employees (550 in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, 45 in the Global Rolled Products segment, 60 in the Alumina and Primary Metals segments combined, and 465 in Corporate); $34 ($26 after-tax) for asset impairments related to prior capitalized costs for a modernization project at a smelter in Canada that is no longer being pursued; a net charge of $18 ($11 after-tax and noncontrolling interest) for other miscellaneous items, including $2 ($2 after-tax) for asset impairments and accelerated depreciation; and $28 ($21 after-tax and noncontrolling interest) for the reversal of a number of layoff reserves related to prior periods, including those associated with a smelter in Italy due to changes in facts and circumstances (see below). In early 2014, management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of the remaining capacity (84 kmt-per-year) at the Massena East smelter in New York and the full capacity (190 kmt-per-year) at the Point Henry smelter in Australia. The capacity at Massena East was fully shut down by the end of March 2014 and the Point Henry smelter was fully shut down in August 2014. Demolition and remediation activities related to both the Massena East and Point Henry smelters began in late 2014 and are expected to be completed by the end of 2020 and 2018, respectively. The decisions on the Massena East and Point Henry smelters were part of a 15-month review of 460 kmt of smelting capacity initiated by management in May 2013 (see 2013 Actions below) for possible curtailment. Through this review, management determined that the remaining capacity of the Massena East smelter was no longer competitive and the Point Henry smelter had no prospect of becoming financially viable. Management also initiated the temporary curtailment of the remaining capacity (62 kmt-per-year) at the Po os de Caldas smelter and additional capacity (85 kmt-per-year) at the S o Lu smelter, both in Brazil. These curtailments were completed by the end of May 2014. As a result of these curtailments, 200 kmt-per-year of production at the Po os de Caldas refinery was reduced by the end of June 2014. Also in early 2014, management approved the permanent shutdown of Alcoa two rolling mills in Australia, Point Henry and Yennora. This decision was made due to the significant impact of excess can sheet capacity in both Australia and Asia. The two rolling mills had a combined can sheet capacity of 200 kmt-per-year and were closed by the end of 2014. Demolition and remediation activities related to the two rolling mills will begin in 2015 and are expected to be completed by the end of 2018. Additionally, in August 2014, management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of the capacity (150 kmt-per-year) at the Portovesme smelter in Italy, which had been idle since November 2012. This decision was made because the fundamental reasons that made the Portovesme smelter uncompetitive remained unchanged, including the lack of a viable long-term power solution. Demolition and remediation activities related to the Portovesme smelter will begin in 2015 and are expected to be completed by the end of 2019. In 2014, costs related to the shutdown and curtailment actions included $208 for the layoff of approximately 1,790 employees (1,210 in the Primary Metals segment, 470 in the Global Rolled Products segment, 80 in the Alumina segment, and 30 in Corporate), including $26 in pension costs; accelerated depreciation of $204 related to the three facilities in Australia as they continued to operate during 2014; asset impairments of $166 representing the write-off of the remaining book value of all related properties, plants, and equipment; and $183 in other exit costs. Additionally in 2014, remaining inventories, mostly operating supplies and raw materials, were written down to their net realizable value, resulting in a charge of $67 ($47 after-tax and noncontrolling interest), which was recorded in Cost of goods sold on Alcoa Statement of Consolidated Operations. The other exit costs represent $95 in asset retirement obligations and $42 in environmental remediation, both of which were triggered by the decisions to permanently shut down and demolish the aforementioned structures in Australia, Italy, and the United States, and $46 in other related costs, including supplier and customer contract-related costs. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 2,185 of the 2,910 employees were separated. The remaining separations for the 2014 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2015. In 2014, cash payments of $141 were made against layoff reserves related to the 2014 restructuring programs. 57 2013 Actions. In 2013, Alcoa recorded Restructuring and other charges of $782 ($585 after-tax and noncontrolling interests), which were comprised of the following components: $391 ($305 after-tax and noncontrolling interest) related to a legal matter; $245 ($183 after-tax) for exit costs related to the permanent shutdown and demolition of certain structures at three smelter locations (see below); $87 ($61 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for layoff costs, including the separation of approximately 1,110 employees (340 in the Primary Metals segment, 260 in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, 250 in the Global Rolled Products segment, 85 in the Alumina segment, and 175 in Corporate), of which 590 relates to a global overhead reduction program, and $9 in pension plan settlement charges related to previously separated employees; $25 ($17 after-tax) in net charges, including $12 ($8 after-tax) for asset impairments, related to retirements and/or the sale of previously idled structures; $25 ($13 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for asset impairments related to the write-off of capitalized costs for projects no longer being pursued due to the market environment; a net charge of $17 ($12 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for other miscellaneous items, including $3 ($2 after-tax) for asset impairments; and $8 ($6 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for the reversal of a number of small layoff reserves related to prior periods. In May 2013, management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of two potlines (capacity of 105 kmt-per-year) that utilize Soderberg technology at the Baie Comeau smelter in Qu bec, Canada (remaining capacity of 280 kmt-per-year composed of two prebake potlines) and the full capacity (44 kmt-per-year) at the Fusina smelter in Italy. Additionally, in August 2013, management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of one potline (capacity of 41 kmt-per-year) that utilizes Soderberg technology at the Massena East smelter in New York (remaining capacity of 84 kmt-per-year composed of two Soderberg potlines). The aforementioned Soderberg lines at Baie Comeau and Massena East were fully shut down by the end of September 2013 while the Fusina smelter was previously temporarily idled in 2010. Demolition and remediation activities related to all three facilities began in late 2013 and are expected to be completed by the end of 2015 for Massena East and by the end of 2017 for both Baie Comeau and Fusina. The decisions on the Soderberg lines for Baie Comeau and Massena East were part of a 15-month review of 460 kmt of smelting capacity initiated by management in May 2013 for possible curtailment, while the decision on the Fusina smelter was in addition to the capacity being reviewed. Factors leading to all three decisions were in general focused on achieving sustained competitiveness and included, among others: lack of an economically viable, long-term power solution (Italy); changed market fundamentals; other existing idle capacity; and restart costs. In 2013, exit costs related to the shutdown actions included $114 for the layoff of approximately 550 employees (Primary Metals segment), including $83 in pension costs; accelerated depreciation of $58 (Baie Comeau) and asset impairments of $18 (Fusina and Massena East) representing the write-off of the remaining book value of all related properties, plants, and equipment; and $55 in other exit costs. Additionally in 2013, remaining inventories, mostly operating supplies and raw materials, were written down to their net realizable value resulting in a charge of $9 ($6 after-tax), which was recorded in Cost of goods sold on Alcoa Statement of Consolidated Operations. The other exit costs represent $48 in asset retirement obligations and $5 in environmental remediation, both of which were triggered by the decisions to permanently shut down and demolish these structures, and $2 in other related costs. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 1,440 of the 1,530 employees (previously 1,660) were separated. The total number of employees associated with the 2013 restructuring programs was updated to reflect employees, who were initially identified for separation, accepting other positions within Alcoa and natural attrition. The remaining separations for the 2013 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2015. In 2014 and 2013, cash payments of $39 and $33, respectively, were made against layoff reserves related to the 2013 restructuring programs. 2012 Actions. In 2012, Alcoa recorded Restructuring and other charges of $172 ($106 after-tax and noncontrolling interests), which were comprised of the following components: $85 ($33 after-tax and noncontrolling interest) related to the civil portion of a legal matter; $47 ($29 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for the layoff of approximately 800 employees (390 in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, 250 in the Primary Metals segment, 85 in the Alumina segment, and 75 in Corporate), including $10 ($7 after-tax) for the layoff of an additional 170 employees 58 related to the previously reported smelter curtailments in Spain; $30 ($30 after-tax) in asset impairments and $6 ($6 after-tax) for lease and contract termination costs due to a decision to exit the lithographic sheet business in Bohai, China; $11 ($11 after-tax) in costs to idle the Portovesme smelter; $10 ($8 after-tax) in other asset impairments; a net charge of $4 ($4 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for other miscellaneous items; and $21 ($15 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for the reversal of a number of layoff reserves related to prior periods, including $10 ($7 after-tax) related to the smelters in Spain. The reversal related to the smelters in Spain was due to lower than expected costs based on agreements with employee representatives and the government, as well as a reduction of 55 in the number of layoffs due to the anticipation of the restart of a portion of the previously curtailed capacity based on an agreement with the Spanish government that will provide interruptibility rights (i.e. compensation for power interruptions when grids are overloaded) to the smelters during 2013 (see Primary Metals in Segment Information below). A portion of this reversal relates to layoff costs recorded at the end of 2011 and a portion of this reversal relates to layoff costs recorded during 2012 (see above). As of December 31, 2013, the separations associated with 2012 restructuring programs were essentially complete. In 2014, 2013, and 2012, cash payments of $3, $17, and $16, respectively, were made against layoff reserves related to the 2012 restructuring programs. Alcoa does not include Restructuring and other charges in the results of its reportable segments. The pretax impact of allocating such charges to segment results would have been as follows: 2014 2013 2012 Alumina $ 287 $ 11 $ 3 Primary Metals 553 295 20 Global Rolled Products 266 15 43 Engineered Products and Solutions 19 27 13 Segment total 1,125 348 79 Corporate 43 434 93 Total restructuring and other charges $ 1,168 $ 782 $ 172 Interest Expense Interest expense was $473 in 2014 compared with $453 in 2013. The increase of $20, or 4%, was principally caused by lower capitalized interest ($43), largely due to the progress completed at the aluminum complex in Saudi Arabia, and fees paid associated with the execution and termination of a 364-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility related to the acquisition of an aerospace business ($13 see Engineered Products and Solutions in Segment Information below). These items were partially offset by a 3% lower average debt level and lower amortization of debt-related costs due to the conversion of convertible notes. The lower average debt level was mostly attributable to lower outstanding long-term debt due to the March 2014 conversion of $575 in 5.25% Convertible Notes and the June 2013 repayment of $422 in 6.00% Notes, partially offset by the September 2014 issuance of $1,250 in 5.125% Notes. Interest expense was $453 in 2013 compared with $490 in 2012. The decrease of $37, or 8%, was primarily due to a 7% lower average debt level, which was mostly attributable to lower outstanding long-term debt due to the June 2013 repayment of $422 in 6.00% Notes and payments associated with the loans supporting growth projects in Brazil. Other Expenses (Income), net Other expenses, net was $47 in 2014 compared with Other income, net of $25 in 2013. The change of $72 was mostly due to an unfavorable change in mark-to-market derivative aluminum contracts ($42), net unfavorable foreign currency movements ($34), a higher equity loss related to Alcoa share of the joint venture in Saudi Arabia due to start-up costs of the entire complex, including restart costs for one of the smelter potlines that was previously shut down due to a period of instability, and a smaller improvement in the cash surrender value of company-owned life insurance. These items were somewhat offset by a gain on the sale of (i) a mining interest in Suriname ($28) and (ii) an equity investment in a China rolling mill ($14). 59 Other income, net was $25 in 2013 compared with $341 in 2012. The change of $316 was mainly the result of the absence of a gain on the sale of U.S. hydroelectric power assets ($320: see Primary Metals in Segment Information below). Also, a higher equity loss ($40) related to Alcoa share of the joint venture in Saudi Arabia due to start-up costs and a shutdown of one of the two smelter potlines due to a period of instability was partially offset by net favorable foreign currency movements ($28). Income Taxes Alcoa effective tax rate was 64.4% (provision on income) in 2014 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate mainly due to restructuring charges related to operations in Italy (no tax benefit) and Australia (benefit at a lower tax rate) (see Restructuring and Other Charges above), a $52 ($31 after noncontrolling interest) discrete income tax charge related to a tax rate change in Brazil (see below), a loss on the sale of three rolling mills in Europe (no tax benefit) (see Global Rolled Products in Segment Information below), and a $27 ($16 after noncontrolling interest) discrete income tax charge for the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets of a subsidiary in Spain due to a November 2014 enacted tax rate change (from 30% in 2014 to 28% in 2015 to 25% in 2016). These items were somewhat offset by foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions and a $9 discrete income tax benefit for the release of a valuation allowance related to operations in Germany due to the initiation of a tax planning strategy. In December 2011, one of Alcoa subsidiaries in Brazil applied for a tax holiday related to its expanded mining and refining operations. During 2013, the application was amended and re-filed and, separately, a similar application was filed for another one of the Company subsidiaries in Brazil. The deadline for the Brazilian government to deny the application was July 11, 2014. Since Alcoa did not receive notice that its applications were denied, the tax holiday took effect automatically on July 12, 2014. As a result, the tax rate for these subsidiaries decreased significantly (from 34% to 15.25%), resulting in future cash tax savings over the 10-year holiday period (retroactively effective as of January 1, 2013). Additionally, a portion of one of the subsidiaries net deferred tax asset that reverses within the holiday period was remeasured at the new tax rate (the net deferred tax asset of the other subsidiary was not remeasured since it could still be utilized against the subsidiary future earnings not subject to the tax holiday). This remeasurement resulted in a decrease to that subsidiary net deferred tax asset and a noncash charge to earnings of $52 ($31 after noncontrolling interest). Alcoa effective tax rate was 23.6% in 2013 (provision on a loss) compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%. The effective tax rate differs (by (58.6)% points) from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to a $1,731 impairment of goodwill (see Impairment of Goodwill above) and a $209 charge for a legal matter (see Restructuring and Other Charges above) that are nondeductible for income tax purposes, a $372 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in Spain and the United States (see Income Taxes in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below), restructuring charges related to operations in Canada (benefit at a lower tax rate) and Italy (no tax benefit) (see Restructuring and Other Charges above), and a $9 discrete income tax charge related to prior year taxes in Spain and Australia. These items were slightly offset by an $18 discrete income tax benefit related to new U.S. tax legislation (see below). On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law and reinstated various expired or expiring temporary business tax provisions through 2013. Two specific temporary business tax provisions that expired in 2011 and impacted Alcoa are the look-through rule for payments between related controlled foreign corporations and the research and experimentation credit. The expiration of these two provisions resulted in Alcoa recognizing a higher income tax provision of $18 in 2012. As tax law changes are accounted for in the period of enactment, Alcoa recognized an $18 discrete income tax benefit in 2013 related to the 2012 tax year to reflect the extension of these provisions. Beginning on January 1, 2014, these two provisions once again expired. On December 19, 2014, the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 was signed into law, which retroactively extended for one year (i.e. calendar year 2014) a number of the tax provisions that expired at the end of 2013, including the two specific aforementioned provisions. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2014, these two provisions once again expire. Absent a retroactive extension enacted in 2015, Alcoa would recognize a higher income tax provision of $12 in 2015. Alcoa effective tax rate was 50.0% (provision on income) in 2012 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate principally due to the tax impact from the gain 60 recognized on the sale of U.S. hydroelectric power assets (see Primary Metals in Segment Information below) and an $8 discrete income tax charge related to prior year U.S. taxes on certain depletable assets, slightly offset by a $13 discrete income tax benefit related to a change in the legal structure of an investment. Management anticipates that the effective tax rate in 2015 will be between 30% and 35%. However, changes in the current economic environment, tax legislation or rate changes, currency fluctuations, ability to realize deferred tax assets, and the results of operations in certain taxing jurisdictions may cause this estimated rate to fluctuate. Noncontrolling Interests Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $91 in 2014 compared with Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $41 in 2013 and Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of $29 in 2012. These amounts were virtually all related to the results of Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC), which is owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Alumina Limited. In 2014, AWAC generated a smaller loss compared to 2013 mainly driven by the absence of a $384 charge for a legal matter (see below) and improved operating results, mostly offset by restructuring and other charges associated with both the decision to permanently shut down the Point Henry smelter in Australia (see Restructuring and Other Charges above) and the divestiture of an ownership interest in a mining and refining joint venture in Jamaica (see Alumina in Segment Information below) and a combined $79 ($32 was noncontrolling interest share) discrete income tax charge related to a tax rate change in both Brazil and Spain (see Income Taxes above). The improvement in AWAC operating results was principally due to net favorable foreign currency movements and net productivity improvements, partially offset by an increase in input costs. Even though AWAC generated an overall loss in both 2014 and 2013, the noncontrolling interest share resulted in income in 2013 due to the manner in which the charges and costs related to a legal matter were allocated (see below). In 2013, AWAC generated a higher loss compared to 2012 primarily related to a $384 charge for a legal matter, partially offset by improved operating results and the absence of an $85 charge related to the civil portion of the same legal matter. The increase in AWAC operating results was largely driven by net favorable foreign currency movements and net productivity improvements, somewhat offset by an increase in input costs. Even though AWAC generated an overall loss in both 2013 and 2012, the noncontrolling interest share resulted in income in 2013 due to the manner in which the charges and costs related to the legal matter were allocated. A description of how these charges for this legal matter impacted Noncontrolling interests follows. The noncontrolling interest share of AWAC charge for a legal matter in 2013 and 2012 was $58 (related to the aforementioned $384) and $34 (related to the aforementioned $85), respectively. In 2012, the $34 was based on the 40% ownership interest of Alumina Limited, while, in 2013, the $58 was based on 15%. The application of a different percentage was due to the criteria in a 2012 allocation agreement between Alcoa and Alumina Limited related to this legal matter being met. Additionally, the $34 charge, as well as costs related to this legal matter, was retroactively adjusted to reflect the terms of the allocation agreement, resulting in a credit to Noncontrolling interests of $41 in 2013. In summary, Noncontrolling interests included a charge of $17 and $34 related to this legal matter in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Segment Information Alcoa operations consist of four worldwide reportable segments: Alumina, Primary Metals, Global Rolled Products, and Engineered Products and Solutions. Segment performance under Alcoa management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors; however, the primary measure of performance is the after-tax operating income (ATOI) of each segment. Certain items such as the impact of LIFO inventory accounting; interest expense; noncontrolling interests; corporate expense (general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities, along with depreciation and amortization on corporate-owned assets); restructuring and other charges; and other items, including intersegment profit eliminations, differences between tax rates applicable to the segments and the consolidated effective tax rate, the results of the soft alloy extrusions business in Brazil, and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency transaction gains/losses and interest income are excluded from segment ATOI. 61 ATOI for all reportable segments totaled $2,043 in 2014, $1,217 in 2013, and $1,357 in 2012. The following information provides shipments, sales, and ATOI data for each reportable segment, as well as certain production, realized price, and average cost data, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014. See Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. Alumina 2014 2013 2012 Alumina production (kmt) 16,606 16,618 16,342 Third-party alumina shipments (kmt) 10,652 9,966 9,295 Alcoa average realized price per metric ton of alumina $ 324 $ 328 $ 327 Alcoa average cost per metric ton of alumina* $ 282 $ 295 $ 310 Third-party sales $ 3,509 $ 3,326 $ 3,092 Intersegment sales 1,941 2,235 2,310 Total sales $ 5,450 $ 5,561 $ 5,402 ATOI $ 370 $ 259 $ 90 * Includes all production-related costs, including raw materials consumed; conversion costs, such as labor, materials, and utilities; depreciation, depletion, and amortization; and plant administrative expenses. This segment represents a portion of Alcoa upstream operations and consists of the Company worldwide refinery system, including the mining of bauxite, which is then refined into alumina. Alumina is mainly sold directly to internal and external smelter customers worldwide or is sold to customers who process it into industrial chemical products. A portion of this segment third-party sales are completed through the use of agents, alumina traders, and distributors. More than half of Alcoa alumina production is sold under supply contracts to third parties worldwide, while the remainder is used internally by the Primary Metals segment. In December 2014, Alcoa majority-owned subsidiary, AWAC, completed the sale of its ownership stake in Jamalco, a bauxite mine and alumina refinery joint venture in Jamaica, to Noble Group Ltd. Jamalco was 55% owned by a subsidiary of AWAC, and, while owned by AWAC, 55% of both the operating results and assets and liabilities of this joint venture were included in the Alumina segment. As it relates to AWAC previous 55% ownership stake, the refinery (AWAC share of the capacity was 779 kmt-per-year) generated sales (third-party and intersegment) of approximately $200 in 2013, and the refinery and mine combined, at the time of divestiture, had approximately 500 employees. See Restructuring and Other Charges in Results of Operations above. In 2014, alumina production decreased by 12 kmt compared to 2013. The decline was mainly driven by lower production at the Po os de Caldas (Brazil), Jamalco (Jamaica), and San Ciprian (Spain) refineries, mostly offset by higher production at every other refinery in the global system. The Po os de Caldas refinery started to reduce production in early 2014 in response to management decision to fully curtail the Po os de Caldas smelter by the end of May 2014 (see Primary Metals below). As a result, management reduced the alumina production at the Po os de Caldas refinery by approximately 200 kmt-per-year by mid-2014. This reduction was replaced by an increase in production at lower cost refineries within Alcoa global system. Additionally, the decrease at the refinery in Jamaica was due to the absence of production for one month as a result of the sale of the ownership stake in Jamalco. In 2013, alumina production increased by 276 kmt compared to 2012. The improvement was mostly the result of higher production in the Atlantic refinery system, primarily at the Point Comfort, TX refinery. Third-party sales for the Alumina segment improved 6% in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily related to a 7% improvement in volume. Third-party sales for this segment increased 8% in 2013 compared with 2012, largely attributable to an increase of 7% in volume and positive impacts from moving customer contracts to alumina index pricing and spot pricing, somewhat offset by a decrease in contractual LME-based pricing (fewer sales subject to LME pricing and lower average LME prices for those sales subject to LME pricing). 62 Intersegment sales for the Alumina segment decreased 13% in 2014 compared with 2013 and declined 3% in 2013 compared with 2012. The decrease in both periods was mostly the result of lower demand from the Primary Metals segment. ATOI for the Alumina segment improved $111 in 2014 compared with 2013, mostly due to net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar, especially against the Australian dollar, net productivity improvements, and a gain on the sale of a mining interest in Suriname ($18). These positive impacts were partially offset by higher input costs, including natural gas (particularly higher prices in Australia), bauxite (mainly due to a new mining site in Suriname), and labor and maintenance, all of which were somewhat offset by lower costs for caustic; and a higher equity loss due to start-up costs of the bauxite mine and refinery in Saudi Arabia. ATOI for this segment increased $169 in 2013 compared with 2012, mainly caused by net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar, especially against the Australian dollar, and net productivity improvements. These positive impacts were somewhat offset by cost increases for bauxite due to a new mining site in Suriname and a crusher equipment move in Australia, rising natural gas prices in Australia, and higher maintenance costs in Australia and Latin America. In 2015, alumina production will be approximately 700 kmt lower due to the sale of the interest in the Jamaica refinery. Also, the continued shift towards alumina index and spot pricing is expected to average 75% of third-party shipments. Additionally, net productivity improvements are anticipated and lower energy costs are expected in Spain due to the conversion of the fuel source at the refinery from fuel oil to natural gas. Furthermore, the refinery in Saudi Arabia is expected to produce 1,100 kmt (276 kmt is Alcoa share) of alumina, as it became fully operational at the end of 2014. Primary Metals 2014 2013 2012 Aluminum production (kmt) 3,125 3,550 3,742 Third-party aluminum shipments (kmt) 2,534 2,801 3,056 Alcoa average realized price per metric ton of aluminum* $ 2,405 $ 2,243 $ 2,327 Alcoa average cost per metric ton of aluminum** $ 2,252 $ 2,201 $ 2,287 Third-party sales $ 6,800 $ 6,596 $ 7,432 Intersegment sales 2,931 2,621 2,877 Total sales $ 9,731 $ 9,217 $ 10,309 ATOI $ 594 $ (20 ) $ 309 * Average realized price per metric ton of aluminum includes three elements: a) the underlying base metal component, based on quoted prices from the LME; b) the regional premium, which represents the incremental price over the base LME component that is associated with the physical delivery of metal to a particular region (e.g., the Midwest premium for metal sold in the United States); and c) the product premium, which represents the incremental price for receiving physical metal in a particular shape (e.g., billet, slab, rod, etc.) or alloy. ** Includes all production-related costs, including raw materials consumed; conversion costs, such as labor, materials, and utilities; depreciation and amortization; and plant administrative expenses. This segment represents a portion of Alcoa upstream operations and consists of the Company worldwide smelter system. Primary Metals receives alumina, mostly from the Alumina segment, and produces primary aluminum used by Alcoa fabricating businesses, as well as sold to external customers and traders. Results from the sale of aluminum powder, scrap, and excess power are also included in this segment, as well as the results of aluminum derivative contracts and buy/resell activity. Primary aluminum produced by Alcoa and used internally is transferred to other segments at prevailing market prices. The sale of primary aluminum represents approximately 90% of this segment third-party sales. Buy/resell activity occurs when this segment purchases metal and resells such metal to external customers or the midstream and downstream segments in order to maximize smelting system efficiency and to meet customer requirements. 63 In November 2014, Alcoa completed the sale of an aluminum rod plant located in B cancour, Qu bec, Canada to Sural Laminated Products. This facility takes molten aluminum and shapes it into the form of a rod, which is used by customers primarily for the transportation of electricity. While owned by Alcoa, the operating results and assets and liabilities of this plant were included in the Primary Metals segment. In conjunction with this transaction, Alcoa entered into a multi-year agreement with Sural Laminated Products to supply molten aluminum for the rod plant. The aluminum rod plant generated sales of approximately $200 in 2013 and, at the time of divestiture, had approximately 60 employees. See Restructuring and Other Charges in Results of Operations above. In December 2014, Alcoa completed the sale of its 50.33% ownership stake in the Mt. Holly smelter located in Goose Creek, South Carolina to Century Aluminum Company. While owned by Alcoa, 50.33% of both the operating results and assets and liabilities related to the smelter were included in the Primary Metals segment. As it relates to Alcoa previous 50.33% ownership stake, the smelter (Alcoa share of the capacity was 115 kmt-per-year) generated sales of approximately $280 in 2013 and, at the time of divestiture, had approximately 250 employees. See Restructuring and Other Charges in Results of Operations above. In November 2012, Alcoa completed the sale of its 351-megawatt Tapoco Hydroelectric Project ( Tapoco ) to Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners for $597 in cash. Alcoa recognized a gain of $320 ($173 after-tax) in Other income, net on the Statement of Consolidated Operations, of which a gain of $426 ($275 after-tax) was reflected in the Primary Metals segment and a loss of $106 ($102 after-tax) was reflected in Corporate. The amount in Corporate represents the write-off of goodwill and capitalized interest related to Tapoco that were not included in the assets of the Primary Metals segment. Tapoco is a four-station hydroelectric project located on the Little Tennessee and Cheoah Rivers in eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina. The transaction included four generating stations and dams, 86 miles of transmission lines, and approximately 14,500 acres of land associated with and surrounding Tapoco. The power generated by Tapoco was primarily consumed by Alcoa smelter in Tennessee, which was temporarily idled in 2009 and permanently shut down in 2011. Since 2009, the power generated from Tapoco was sold into the open market. At December 31, 2014, Alcoa had 665 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 3,497 kmt. In 2014, idle capacity increased 10 kmt compared to 2013 due to the temporary curtailment of 159 kmt combined at two smelters in Brazil, mostly offset by the permanent closure of the Portovesme smelter in Italy (150 kmt-per-year). Base capacity declined 540 kmt between December 31, 2014 and 2013 due to the permanent closure of a smelter in Australia and two remaining potlines at a smelter in the United States (274 kmt combined) and the previously mentioned permanent shutdown of the Portovesme smelter and the sale of Alcoa ownership stake in the Mt. Holly smelter (see above). A detailed description of each of these actions follows. At December 31, 2013, Alcoa had 655 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 4,037 kmt. In 2013, idle capacity increased 64 kmt compared to 2012 mostly due to the temporary curtailment of 131 kmt combined at two smelters in Brazil, partially offset by the permanent closure of the Fusina smelter in Italy (44 kmt-per-year) and the restart of a portion (27 kmt combined) of the capacity that was temporary curtailed in 2012 related to the Avil and La Coru a smelters in Spain. Base capacity declined 190 kmt between December 31, 2013 and 2012 due to the permanent closure of three potlines combined at smelters in Canada and in the United States (146 kmt combined) and the previously mentioned permanent shutdown of the Fusina smelter. A detailed description of each of these actions follows. The restarts in Spain occurred in order to meet the requirements of the modified interruptibility regime in the Spanish power market. In December 2012, the Spanish Government issued a Ministerial Order that modified the interruptibility regime previously in place in the Spanish power market. The interruptibility regime allowed certain industrial customers who were willing to be subject to temporary interruptions in the supply of power to sell interruption rights to the high voltage transmission system operator. In January 2013, Alcoa applied for and was granted rights to sell interruption services under the modified regime from its San Ciprian, Avil s, and La Coru a smelters in Spain. The commitment was taken for a one-year period, which was subsequently extended until December 2014. In September 2014, Spanish regulation imposed a budget cap on the revenues associated with the sale of interruption services resulting in higher energy costs for the three smelters during the last three months of 2014. In late 2014, a new market- 64 based interruptibility regime replaced the previously regulated interruptibility regime resulting in a competitive auction process to allocate interruptibility rights in Spain for calendar year 2015. Through this process, Alcoa was able to secure the sale of enough interruptibility rights to operate all three smelters in Spain at competitive energy prices during 2015 (the structure of the energy market in Spain subsequent to 2015 is unknown). In May 2013, Alcoa announced that management would review 460 kmt of smelting capacity over a 15-month period for possible curtailment. This review was aimed at maintaining Alcoa competitiveness despite falling aluminum prices and would focus on the highest-cost smelting capacity and those plants that have long-term risk due to factors such as energy costs or regulatory uncertainty. As part of this review, also in May 2013, management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of two potlines (105 kmt-per-year) that utilize Soderberg technology at the Baie Comeau smelter in Quebec, Canada. Additionally, in August 2013, management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of one potline (41 kmt-per-year) that utilizes Soderberg technology at the Massena East, NY plant. The shutdown of these three lines was completed by the end of September 2013. The Baie Comeau smelter has a remaining capacity of 280 kmt-per-year composed of two prebake potlines and the Massena East smelter had a remaining capacity of 84 kmt-per-year composed of two Soderberg potlines (see below). Also in August 2013 as part of this review, management initiated the temporary curtailment of 97 kmt at the S o Lu smelter and 31 kmt at the Po os de Caldas smelter, both in Brazil. This action was also completed by the end of September 2013. An additional 3 kmt was temporarily curtailed at the Po os de Caldas smelter by the end of 2013. The review of the remaining 183 kmt of smelting capacity was completed during 2014. Also, during 2014, an additional 250 kmt of smelting capacity was included in the review. In early 2014, management initiated three additional actions resulting in the permanent shutdown of an additional 274 kmt of capacity and the temporary curtailment of an additional 147 kmt of capacity. The permanent shutdowns were comprised of the remaining capacity (84 kmt-per-year) at the Massena East smelter and the full capacity (190 kmt-per-year) at the Point Henry smelter in Australia. The remaining capacity of the Massena East smelter represented two Soderberg potlines that were no longer competitive. This shutdown was completed by the end of March 2014. For Point Henry, management determined that the smelter had no prospect of becoming financially viable. The shutdown of the Point Henry smelter was completed in August 2014. The temporary curtailments were comprised of the remaining capacity (62 kmt-per-year) at the Po os de Caldas smelter and additional capacity (85 kmt-per-year) at the S o Lu smelter. The process of curtailing this additional capacity began in March 2014 and was completed by the end of May 2014. An additional 12 kmt was temporarily curtailed at the S o Lu smelter during the remainder of 2014. Separate from the review, in June 2013, management decided to permanently close the Fusina smelter as the underlying conditions that led to the idling of the smelter in 2010 had not fundamentally changed, including low aluminum prices and the lack of an economically viable, long-term power solution. In August 2014, management approved the permanent shutdown of the Portovesme smelter, which had been idle since November 2012. This decision was made because the fundamental reasons that made the Portovesme smelter uncompetitive remained unchanged, including the lack of a viable long-term power solution. See Restructuring and Other Charges in Results of Operations above for a description of the associated charges related to all of the above actions. In 2014, aluminum production decreased by 425 kmt, mostly due to lower and/or the absence of production at the five smelters impacted by the 2013 and 2014 capacity reductions described above. 65 In 2013, aluminum production declined by 192 kmt, mainly the result of the absence of production at the Portovesme smelter (fully curtailed at the end of 2012), the temporary curtailment of capacity at two smelters in Brazil (see above), and the permanent shutdown of three potlines combined at smelters in Canada and in the United States (see above). Third-party sales for the Primary Metals segment increased 3% in 2014 compared with 2013, mainly due to higher energy sales in Brazil resulting from excess power due to curtailed smelter capacity, higher buy/resell activity, and a 7% increase in average realized aluminum price, mostly offset by lower volumes, including from the five smelters impacted by the 2013 and 2014 capacity reductions. The change in average realized price was driven by higher regional premiums, which increased by an average of 84% in the United States and Canada and 56% in Europe. Third-party sales for this segment declined 11% in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily due to lower volumes, including from the curtailed smelters in Italy, Spain, and Brazil and the permanent shutdown of certain capacity in Canada and the United States. Also contributing to the decrease was a 4% decline in average realized prices, somewhat offset by higher energy sales related to excess power, mostly in Brazil, and favorable product mix. The change in realized prices was driven by an 8% lower average LME price (on 15-day lag), somewhat offset by higher regional premiums, including an average of 12% in the United States and Canada and 13% in Europe. Intersegment sales for the Primary Metals segment improved 12% in 2014 compared with 2013, principally due to an increase in realized prices, driven by higher regional premiums, and higher demand from the midstream and downstream businesses. Intersegment sales for this segment declined 9% in 2013 compared with 2012, mainly the result of a decrease in both realized prices, driven by a lower LME price, and demand from the midstream and downstream businesses. ATOI for the Primary Metals segment climbed $614 in 2014 compared with 2013, principally related to a higher average realized aluminum price; the previously mentioned energy sales in Brazil; net productivity improvements; net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar against all major currencies; lower costs for carbon and alumina; and the absence of costs related to a planned maintenance outage in 2013 at a power plant in Australia. These positive impacts were slightly offset by an unfavorable impact associated with the 2013 and 2014 capacity reductions described above, including a write-off of inventory related to the decisions to permanently shut down the Portovesme, Point Henry, and Massena East smelters ($44), and higher costs for energy (particularly in Spain see above), labor, and maintenance. ATOI for this segment decreased $329 in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily caused by a decline in realized prices, the absence of a gain on the sale of Tapoco (see above), higher costs for labor and transportation, a higher equity loss related to the joint venture in Saudi Arabia due to start-up costs and a shutdown of one of the two potlines due to a period of instability, and costs related to a planned maintenance outage at the Anglesea power plant in Australia. These negative impacts were somewhat offset by lower costs for carbon and energy, net productivity improvements, net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar against most major currencies, favorable product mix, and a positive impact (insurance recovery in 2013 plus the absence of business interruption and repair costs that occurred in 2012) related to the March 2012 fire at the Massena West cast house ($36). In 2015, aluminum production will be approximately 270 kmt lower due to the sale of the ownership stake in the Mt. Holly smelter and the shutdown and curtailment actions described above. Also, energy sales in Brazil will be negatively impacted by approximately $100 due to a decline in energy prices. Additionally, net productivity improvements are anticipated and the smelter in Saudi Arabia is expected to provide a positive contribution to ATOI, as it became fully operational in mid 2014. Furthermore, lower energy costs in Canada are anticipated due to new power contracts executed in late 2014. 66 Global Rolled Products 2014 2013 2012 Third-party aluminum shipments (kmt) 1,964 1,905 1,867 Alcoa average realized price per metric ton of aluminum $ 3,743 $ 3,730 $ 3,953 Third-party sales $ 7,351 $ 7,106 $ 7,378 Intersegment sales 185 178 163 Total sales $ 7,536 $ 7,284 $ 7,541 ATOI $ 312 $ 252 $ 346 This segment represents Alcoa midstream operations, whose principal business is the production and sale of aluminum plate and sheet. A small portion of this segment operations relate to foil produced at one plant in Brazil. This segment includes rigid container sheet (RCS), which is sold directly to customers in the packaging and consumer market and is used to produce aluminum beverage cans. Seasonal increases in RCS sales are generally experienced in the second and third quarters of the year. Approximately one-half of the third-party shipments in this segment consist of RCS. This segment also includes sheet and plate used in the aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation, building and construction, and industrial products (mainly used in the production of machinery and equipment and consumer durables) end markets, which is sold directly to customers and through distributors. While the customer base for flat-rolled products is large, a significant amount of sales of RCS, sheet, and plate is to a relatively small number of customers. In February 2014, management approved the permanent shutdown of Alcoa two rolling mills in Australia, Point Henry and Yennora. This decision was made due to the significant impact of excess can sheet capacity in both Australia and Asia. The two rolling mills had a combined can sheet capacity of 200 kmt-per-year and were closed by the end of 2014. See Restructuring and Other Charges in Results of Operations above for a description of the associated charges. In December 2014, Alcoa completed the sale of three rolling mills located in Spain (Alicante and Amorebieta) and France (Castelsarrasin) to a subsidiary of Atlas Holdings LLC. While owned by Alcoa, the operating results and assets and liabilities of the rolling mills were included in the Global Rolled Products segment. In conjunction with this transaction, Alcoa entered into a multi-year agreement with the buyer to supply aluminum for the rolling mills. The rolling mills combined generated sales of approximately $500 in 2013 and, at the time of divestiture, had approximately 750 employees. See Restructuring and Other Charges in Results of Operations above. Third-party sales for the Global Rolled Products segment improved 3% in 2014 compared with 2013, principally caused by increased demand, somewhat offset by unfavorable price/product mix related to the packaging, aerospace, and industrial products end markets. Volume improvements were mostly driven by the automotive and commercial transportation end markets. Third-party sales for this segment declined 4% in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily driven by unfavorable pricing, mostly due to a decrease in metal prices, and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by increased demand. Volume improvements were mostly due to the packaging, automotive, and building and construction end markets, partially offset by a decline in the industrial products end market (especially in North America). ATOI for the Global Rolled Products segment improved $60 in 2014 compared with 2013, mainly the result of net productivity improvements across most businesses, a positive impact from the timing lag in metal prices (i.e., this segment realized a lower average cost of metal purchased compared to the average metal price realized in sales due to its rising trend during 2014), and overall higher volumes. These items were partially offset by unfavorable price/product mix related to the packaging, aerospace, and industrial products end markets; higher input costs, including energy, labor, maintenance, and transportation; a write-off of inventory related to the decision to permanently shut down the Point Henry and Yennora rolling mills ($9); a larger equity loss due to start-up costs related to the rolling 67 mill at the joint venture in Saudi Arabia; and costs (business continuity and contract specific) related to a new labor agreement that covers employees at three rolling mills in the United States ($4) (see Cost of Goods Sold in Results of Operations above). ATOI for this segment declined $94 in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily attributable to a combination of unfavorable pricing and product mix; higher input costs, including metal premiums, energy, and labor; and a negative impact from the timing lag in metal prices (i.e., this segment realized a lower average metal price in sales compared to the average cost of the metal purchased). These items were partially offset by net productivity improvements across most businesses. In 2015, demand in the automotive end market is expected to remain strong and the automotive expansion at the Davenport, IA facility will continue to ramp-up to serve the growing demand for aluminum-intensive vehicles. Also, pricing pressure due to continued oversupply in both the packaging and industrial products end markets is expected. Additionally, Third-party sales will decline by approximately $1,000 due to the divestiture and closure of five rolling mills (see above). Furthermore, net productivity improvements are anticipated while higher research and development costs are anticipated as Alcoa develops and qualifies products from a new Micromill production process. Engineered Products and Solutions 2014 2013 2012 Third-party aluminum shipments (kmt) 246 229 222 Third-party sales $ 6,006 $ 5,733 $ 5,525 ATOI $ 767 $ 726 $ 612 This segment represents Alcoa downstream operations and includes titanium, aluminum, and super alloy investment castings; fasteners; aluminum wheels; integrated aluminum structural systems; architectural extrusions; and forgings and hard alloy extrusions. These products, which are used in the aerospace, automotive, building and construction, commercial transportation, power generation, and industrial products end markets, are sold directly to customers and through distributors. On November 19, 2014, after satisfying all customary closing conditions and receiving the required regulatory approvals, Alcoa completed the acquisition of Firth Rixson, a global leader in aerospace jet engine components. Firth Rixson manufactures rings, forgings, and metal products for the aerospace end market, as well as other markets requiring highly engineered material applications. This business generated sales of approximately $970 in 2014 and has 13 operating facilities in the United States, United Kingdom, Europe, and Asia employing approximately 2,400 people combined. The purpose of this acquisition is to strengthen Alcoa aerospace business and position the Company to capture additional aerospace growth with a broader range of high-growth, value-add jet engine components. Alcoa expects Third-party sales of the Firth Rixson business to increase to $1,600 and $2,000 by 2016 and 2019, respectively. In executing its integration plan for Firth Rixson, Alcoa expects to realize annual cost savings of more than $100 by 2019 due to synergies derived from procurement and productivity improvements, optimizing internal metal supply, and leveraging Alcoa global shared services. This transaction is expected to be neutral to earnings in 2015 and accretive thereafter. The operating results and assets and liabilities of Firth Rixson were included within the Engineered Products and Solutions segment since the date of acquisition. Third-party sales and ATOI of Firth Rixson from the acquisition date through December 31, 2014 were $81 and $(12), respectively. In December 2014, Alcoa signed a definitive agreement to acquire TITAL, a privately held company based in Germany. TITAL business is composed primarily of aluminum and titanium investment casting products for the aerospace and defense end markets. The purpose of this acquisition is to capture increasing demand for advanced jet engine components made of titanium, establish titanium casting capabilities in Europe, and expand existing aluminum casting capacity. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals and is expected to close by the end of March 2015. At that time, TITAL will be included within the Engineered Products and Solutions segment. TITAL generated sales of approximately $100 in 2013 and has approximately 650 employees. 68 Third-party sales for the Engineered Products and Solutions segment increased 5% in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to higher volumes and the acquisition of Firth Rixson (see above). The higher volumes were mostly related to the commercial transportation and aerospace (commercial) end markets, somewhat offset by lower volumes in the industrial gas turbine end market. Third-party sales for this segment improved 4% in 2013 compared with 2012, largely attributable to higher volumes related to the aerospace end market. ATOI for the Engineered Products and Solutions segment climbed $41 in 2014 compared with 2013, mainly due to net productivity improvements across all businesses and overall higher volumes, partially offset by higher costs, primarily labor, and unfavorable product mix. ATOI for this segment rose $114 in 2013 compared with 2012, principally the result of net productivity improvements across all businesses and the previously mentioned volume impact, somewhat offset by higher costs, including labor and research and development expenses, and unfavorable price/product mix. In 2015, the commercial aerospace end market is expected to remain strong, driven by significant order backlog, while improvement in the industrial gas turbine end market is anticipated as the market moves towards higher value-add products. Also, the building and construction end market is expected to improve through growth in North America for the non-residential sector but will be somewhat offset by overall weakness in Europe. Additionally, stronger North America build rates in the commercial transportation end market will be offset by declines in Europe and China. Furthermore, Third-party sales are expected to grow significantly due to the acquisition of Firth Rixson and the planned acquisition of TITAL (see above) and net productivity improvements across existing and newly-acquired businesses are anticipated. Reconciliation of ATOI to Consolidated Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Alcoa Items required to reconcile total segment ATOI to consolidated net income (loss) attributable to Alcoa include: the impact of LIFO inventory accounting; interest expense; noncontrolling interests; corporate expense (general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities, along with depreciation and amortization on corporate-owned assets); restructuring and other charges; and other items, including intersegment profit eliminations, differences between tax rates applicable to the segments and the consolidated effective tax rate, the results of the soft alloy extrusions business in Brazil, and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency transaction gains/losses and interest income. The following table reconciles total segment ATOI to consolidated net income (loss) attributable to Alcoa: 2014 2013 2012 Total segment ATOI $ 2,043 $ 1,217 $ 1,357 Unallocated amounts (net of tax): Impact of LIFO (54 ) 52 20 Interest expense (308 ) (294 ) (319 ) Noncontrolling interests 91 (41 ) 29 Corporate expense (294 ) (284 ) (282 ) Impairment of goodwill - (1,731 ) - Restructuring and other charges (894 ) (607 ) (142 ) Other (316 ) (597 ) (472 ) Consolidated net income (loss) attributable to Alcoa $ 268 $ (2,285 ) $ 191 69 The significant changes in the reconciling items between total segment ATOI and consolidated net income (loss) attributable to Alcoa for 2014 compared with 2013 consisted of: a change in the Impact of LIFO, mostly due to higher prices for aluminum, driven by both higher LME levels and regional premiums (increase in price at December 31, 2014 indexed to December 31, 2013 compared to a decrease in price at December 31, 2013 indexed to December 31, 2012), and the absence of significant reductions in LIFO inventory quantities, which caused a partial liquidation of the lower cost LIFO inventory base in 2013 (income of $17 in 2013); an increase in Interest expense, primarily the result of lower capitalized interest ($28) and fees paid associated with the execution and termination of a 364-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility related to an acquisition of an aerospace business ($8), partially offset by a 3% lower average debt level and lower amortization of debt-related costs due to the conversion of convertible notes; a change in Noncontrolling interests, due to the change in results of AWAC, mainly driven by restructuring and other charges associated with both the decision to permanently shut down the Point Henry smelter in Australia and the divestiture of an ownership interest in a mining and refining joint venture in Jamaica and a discrete income tax charge related to a tax rate change in both Brazil and Spain ($32 combined), partially offset by improved operating results and the absence of a charge for a legal matter ($17); an increase in Restructuring and other charges, principally caused by higher costs related to decisions to permanently shut down and/or temporarily curtail refinery, smelter and/or rolling mill capacity and a net loss on the divestiture of four operations, partially offset by the absence of a charge for a legal matter ($322); and a change in Other, largely attributable to the absence of a discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in Spain and the United States ($372), slightly offset by a discrete income tax charge related to a tax rate change in both Brazil and Spain ($79 combined). The significant changes in the reconciling items between total segment ATOI and consolidated net (loss) income attributable to Alcoa for 2013 compared with 2012 consisted of: a change in the Impact of LIFO, mostly due to lower prices for aluminum, driven by lower LME prices (a larger decrease in price at December 31, 2013 indexed to December 31, 2012 compared to the decrease in price at December 31, 2012 indexed to December 31, 2011), and significant reductions in LIFO inventory quantities, which caused a partial liquidation of the lower cost LIFO inventory base (income of $17); a decrease in Interest expense, principally caused by a 7% lower average debt level, which was largely attributable to lower outstanding long-term debt due to the June 2013 repayment of $422 in 6.00% Notes and payments associated with the loans supporting growth projects in Brazil; a change in Noncontrolling interests, mainly due to improved operating results of AWAC, primarily driven by net favorable foreign currency movements and net productivity improvements, somewhat offset by an increase in input costs, and a favorable change in charges allocated to Noncontrolling interests related to a legal matter (see Noncontrolling Interests in Earnings Summary above); an Impairment of goodwill related to the annual impairment review of the Primary Metals segment (see Goodwill in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below); an increase in Restructuring and other charges, mostly the result of a charge for a legal matter ($322) and exit costs related to the permanent shutdown and demolition of certain structures at three smelter locations ($183), slightly offset by the absence of a charge for the civil portion of a legal matter ($67); and a change in Other, primarily due to a discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in Spain and the United States ($372), partially offset by the absence of both a net charge for five environmental remediation matters ($129) and a charge for the write-off of goodwill and capitalized interest related to the 2012 sale of U.S. hydroelectric power assets that were not included in the assets of the Primary Metals segment ($102). 70 Environmental Matters See the Environmental Matters section of Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Liquidity and Capital Resources Alcoa maintains a disciplined approach to cash management and strengthening of its balance sheet. In 2014, as in the prior five years, management initiated actions to significantly improve Alcoa cost structure and liquidity, providing the Company with the ability to operate effectively. Such actions include procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs, working capital initiatives to yield significant cash improvements, and maintaining a sustainable level of capital expenditures. In 2015, this approach will continue with the ultimate goal of generating cash from operations that exceeds capital expenditures by a minimum of $500. Along with the foregoing actions, cash provided from operations and financing activities is expected to be adequate to cover Alcoa operational and business needs over the next 12 months. For an analysis of long-term liquidity, see Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements below. At December 31, 2014, cash and cash equivalents of Alcoa were $1,877, of which $800 was held outside the United States. Alcoa has a number of commitments and obligations related to the Company growth strategy in foreign jurisdictions, resulting in the need for cash outside the United States. As such, management does not have a current expectation of repatriating cash held in foreign jurisdictions. Cash from Operations Cash provided from operations in 2014 was $1,674 compared with $1,578 in 2013. The increase of $96, or 6%, was due to higher operating results (net income plus net add-back for noncash transactions in earnings) and a positive change in noncurrent assets of $134, mostly offset by a negative change associated with working capital of $620, a negative change in noncurrent liabilities of $251, and higher pension contributions of $39. The components of the negative change in working capital were as follows: an unfavorable change of $171 in receivables, primarily related to higher customer sales; a negative change of $380 in inventories, largely attributable to inventory build for the ramp-up of automotive production at the Davenport, IA plant and customer requirements related to smelters that have been curtailed or shut down in 2014; an unfavorable change of $16 in prepaid expenses and other current assets; a negative change of $70 in accounts payable, trade, principally the result of timing of payments; an unfavorable change of $33 in accrued expenses, mainly caused by $139 in higher payments for layoff and other exit costs associated with restructuring actions and an $88 payment to the United States government due to the resolution of a legal matter (see below), partially offset by the absence of $148 ( 109) in payments to the Italian government related to a November 2009 European Commission decision on electricity pricing for certain energy-intensive industries; and a positive change of $50 in taxes, including income taxes, mostly driven by higher pretax income. The higher pension contributions of $39 were principally driven by special termination benefits of $86 for employees affected by the 2013 shutdown of capacity at a smelter in Canada. On August 8, 2014, the Highway and Transportation Funding Act (HATFA) was signed into law by the United States government. HATFA, in part, provides temporary relief for employers who sponsor defined benefit pension plans 71 related to funding contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Specifically, HATFA modifies the interest rates that had been set in 2012 by the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21 st Century Act. This relief had an immediate impact on the calculation of the then remaining funding contributions in 2014, resulting in a reduction of $100 in minimum required pension funding. In 2014, Alcoa World Alumina LLC, a majority-owned subsidiary of Alcoa, and Alcoa Inc. paid a combined $88 to the United States government due to the resolution of a legal matter (paid on January 22, 2014). Additionally, another $74 will be paid in each of the four subsequent years, 2015 (paid on January 9 and 23, 2015) through 2018. Cash provided from operations in 2013 was $1,578 compared with $1,497 in 2012. The increase of $81, or 5%, was due to higher operating results (net loss plus net add back for noncash impacts to earnings) and lower pension contributions of $99, mostly offset by a negative change associated with all of the following: working capital of $235, noncurrent assets of $162, and noncurrent liabilities of $128. The lower pension contributions of $99 were principally driven by a change in minimum funding obligations for U.S. pension plans due to enacted legislation in 2012 (see below). The components of the negative change in working capital were as follows: an unfavorable change of $245 in receivables; a negative change of $71 in inventories, principally due to a lower LIFO reserve; a favorable change of $53 in prepaid expenses and other current assets, mostly caused by the sale of excess carbon credits in Australia; a positive change of $338 in accounts payable, trade, principally the result of timing of payments, including a policy change in Alcoa vendor payment process; an unfavorable change of $252 in accrued expenses, largely attributable to a decrease in deferred revenue and payments made to the Italian Government (see below); and a negative change of $58 in taxes, including income taxes. The unfavorable change in noncurrent assets was mostly related to an increase in deferred mining costs in Australia and the absence of value-added tax receipts in Brazil. The negative change in noncurrent liabilities was largely attributable to the absence of a net increase in the environmental reserve of $194 related to five remediation matters. In June 2012, Alcoa received formal notification from the Italian Government requesting a net payment of $310 ( 250) related to a November 2009 European Commission decision on electricity pricing for smelters. Alcoa commenced payment of the requested amount in five quarterly installments of $69 ( 50) beginning in October 2012 through December 2013. On July 6, 2012, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21 st Century Act (MAP-21) was signed into law by the United States government. MAP-21, in part, provides temporary relief for employers who sponsor defined benefit pension plans related to funding contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Specifically, MAP-21 allows for the use of a 25-year average interest rate within an upper and lower range for purposes of determining minimum funding obligations instead of an average interest rate for the two most recent years. This relief had an immediate impact on the calculation of the then remaining funding contributions in 2012, resulting in a reduction of $130 in minimum required pension funding. In 2013, this relief resulted in a reduction of $250 in minimum required pension funding. On October 9, 2012, Alcoa World Alumina LLC, a majority-owned subsidiary of Alcoa, paid $42.5 to the plaintiff of the civil portion of a legal matter pursuant to a settlement agreement. The remaining $42.5 was paid on October 9, 2013. 72 Financing Activities Cash provided from financing activities was $2,250 in 2014 compared with cash used for financing activities of $679 and $798 in 2013 and 2012, respectively. The source of cash in 2014 was mostly driven by $2,878 in additions to debt, virtually all of which was the result of $1,238 in net proceeds from the issuance of new senior debt securities used for the acquisition of an aerospace business (see below) and $1,640 in borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below); net proceeds of $1,211 from the issuance of mandatory convertible preferred stock related to the aforementioned acquisition; and $150 in proceeds from employee exercises of 17.3 million stock options at a weighted average exercise price of $8.70 (not in millions). These items were somewhat offset by $1,723 in payments on debt, mostly related to $1,640 for the repayment of borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below), and $161 in dividends paid to shareholders. The use of cash in 2013 was primarily due to $2,317 in payments on debt, mainly related to $1,850 for the repayment of borrowings under certain credit facilities (see below), a $422 early repayment of 6.00% Notes due July 2013, and $27 for previous borrowings on the loans supporting the Estreito hydroelectric power project in Brazil; $132 in dividends paid to shareholders; and net cash paid to noncontrolling interests of $97, most of which relates to Alumina Limited share of AWAC. These items were partially offset by $1,852 in additions to debt, virtually all of which was the result of borrowings under certain credit facilities (see below). The use of cash in 2012 was principally the result of $1,489 in payments on debt, mainly related to $600 for the repayment of borrowings under certain credit facilities (see below), $322 for the repayment of 6% Notes due 2012 as scheduled, $280 for the repayment of short-term loans to support the export operations of a subsidiary in Brazil, and $272 for previous borrowings on the loans supporting the S o Lu refinery expansion, Juruti bauxite mine development, and Estreito hydroelectric power project in Brazil; a change of $224 in commercial paper; and $131 in dividends paid to shareholders. These items were partially offset by $972 in additions to debt, due to $600 in borrowings under certain credit facilities (see below), $280 in short-term loans to support the export operations of a subsidiary in Brazil, and $92 in borrowings under loans that support the Estreito hydroelectric power project in Brazil; and net cash received from noncontrolling interests of $76, all of which relates to Alumina Limited share of AWAC. On July 25, 2014, Alcoa entered into a Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ) with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein. The Credit Agreement provides a $4,000 senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ), the proceeds of which are to be used to provide working capital or for other general corporate purposes of Alcoa. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, Alcoa may from time to time request increases in lender commitments under the Credit Facility, not to exceed $500 in aggregate principal amount, and may also request the issuance of letters of credit, subject to a letter of credit sublimit of $1,000 under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility matures on July 25, 2019, unless extended or earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement. Alcoa may make two one-year extension requests during the term of the Credit Facility, with any extension being subject to the lender consent requirements set forth in the Credit Agreement. Under the provisions of the Credit Agreement, Alcoa will pay a fee of 0.25% (based on Alcoa long-term debt ratings as of December 31, 2014) of the total commitment per annum to maintain the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility is unsecured and amounts payable under it will rank pari passu with all other unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness of Alcoa. Borrowings under the Credit Facility may be denominated in U.S. dollars or euros. Loans will bear interest at a base rate or a rate equal to LIBOR, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of Alcoa outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt. The applicable margin on base rate loans and LIBOR loans will be 0.50% and 1.50% per annum, respectively, based on Alcoa long-term debt ratings as of December 31, 2014. Loans may be prepaid without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs. The Credit Agreement replaces Alcoa Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of July 25, 2011 (the Former Credit Agreement ), which was scheduled to mature on July 25, 2017. The Former Credit Agreement, which had a total capacity of $3,750 and was undrawn, was terminated effective July 25, 2014. 73 The Credit Agreement includes covenants substantially similar to those in the Former Credit Agreement, including, among others, (a) a leverage ratio, (b) limitations on Alcoa ability to incur liens securing indebtedness for borrowed money, (c) limitations on Alcoa ability to consummate a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, and (d) limitations on Alcoa ability to change the nature of its business. As of December 31, 2014, Alcoa was in compliance with all such covenants. The obligation of Alcoa to pay amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an Event of Default as defined in the Credit Agreement. Such Events of Default include, among others, (a) Alcoa failure to pay the principal of, or interest on, borrowings under the Credit Facility, (b) any representation or warranty of Alcoa in the Credit Agreement proving to be materially false or misleading, (c) Alcoa breach of any of its covenants contained in the Credit Agreement, and (d) the bankruptcy or insolvency of Alcoa. There were no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2014 and no amounts were borrowed during 2014 under the Credit Facility. There were no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2013 and no amounts were borrowed during 2014 and 2013 related to the Former Credit Agreement. In addition to the Credit Agreement above, Alcoa entered into a number of credit agreements between 2012 and 2014 for additional liquidity. As of December 31, 2014, these arrangements provide a combined borrowing capacity of $1,040, of which $740 is due to expire in 2015 and $300 is due to expire in 2016. The purpose of any borrowings under these credit arrangements is to provide for working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. The covenants contained in all these arrangements are the same as the Credit Agreement (see above). In 2014, 2013, and 2012, Alcoa borrowed and repaid $1,640, $1,850, and $600, respectively, under the respective credit arrangements. The weighted-average interest rate and weighted-average days outstanding of the respective borrowings during 2014, 2013, and 2012 were 1.54%, 1.57%, and 1.89%, respectively, and 67 days, 213 days, and 260 days, respectively. In February 2014, Alcoa automatic shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission expired. On July 11, 2014, Alcoa filed a new shelf registration statement, which was amended on July 25, 2014 and became effective on July 30, 2014, for up to $5,000 of securities on an unallocated basis for future issuance. As of December 31, 2014, $2,500 in securities were issued under the new shelf registration statement. In September 2014, Alcoa completed two public securities offerings under its shelf registration statement for (i) $1,250 of 25 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/10th interest in a share of Alcoa 5.375% Class B Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series 1, par value $1 per share, liquidation preference $500 per share (the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock ), and (ii) $1,250 of 5.125% Notes due 2024 (the 2024 Notes ). The net proceeds of the offerings were used to finance the cash portion of the acquisition of Firth Rixson (see Engineered Products and Solutions in Segment Information above). Alcoa cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short- and long-term debt ratings assigned to Alcoa debt by the major credit rating agencies. On May 29, 2013, Moody Investors Service (Moody s) downgraded the following ratings for Alcoa: long-term debt from Baa3 to Ba1 and short-term debt from Prime-3 to Speculative Grade Liquidity Rating-1. Additionally, Moody changed the current outlook from rating under review to stable. The following is a summary of Alcoa liquidity position as it relates to the ratings downgrade by Moody s. Cash and letters of credit. As a result of the ratings downgrade by Moody s, certain power companies and counterparties to derivative contracts required Alcoa to post letters of credit and cash collateral, respectively, in the 74 amount of $167 and $18, respectively, in June 2013. Since that time, the amount of letters of credit posted decreased by $10 and the amount of cash collateral posted declined by $8. Other vendors and third-parties may require Alcoa to post additional letters of credit and/or cash collateral in future periods. Outstanding debt. Alcoa outstanding debt as of December 31, 2014 totaled $8,852 (excludes commercial paper see below). It is important to note that, due to this downgrade, the issuance of new public debt in the U.S. capital markets may be more difficult as the investor population may be smaller and the cost of the debt may be higher. In September 2014, Alcoa was able to raise enough capital to issue the 2024 Notes (see above) without any difficulty; however, the cost of the 2024 Notes was higher than it would have been had Alcoa not been downgraded. Except for the foregoing, there were no ramifications to Alcoa as a result of the ratings downgrade and interest payments and fees related to the outstanding debt remain unchanged. Revolving credit facilities. Alcoa has a $4,000 revolving credit facility that expires in July 2019 (see above) and ten other revolving credit facilities totaling $1,040 (see above). This $5,040 of borrowing capacity was also unaffected by the ratings downgrade, including the margins that would be applicable to any borrowings, and remains available for use by Alcoa at its discretion. Commercial paper. During the period since the downgrade, Alcoa was able to issue the desired level of commercial paper to support operations without difficulty. At the time of the downgrade, the spreads on commercial paper increased slightly, however, by one to three basis points, which did not result in a significant change to Alcoa total interest costs. While Alcoa expects it can continue to issue commercial paper, there is no assurance about the amount or cost at which it could issue commercial paper. On April 11, 2014, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) downgraded the following ratings for Alcoa: long-term debt from BBB- to BB+ and short-term debt from F3 to B. Additionally, Fitch changed the current outlook from negative to stable. As of December 31, 2014, this downgrade did not have a significant impact on Alcoa financing activities, including its ability to access the capital markets. The descriptions for outstanding debt and revolving credit facilities above remain unchanged as a result of the Fitch downgrade. Also, Alcoa is in full compliance with the project financing requirements for the Ma aden-Alcoa joint venture project in Saudi Arabia, and did not need to post collateral as a result of the ratings downgrade. On April 23, 2014, Standard and Poor Ratings Services (S&P) affirmed the following ratings for Alcoa: long-term debt at BBB- and short-term debt at A-3. Additionally, S&P maintained the current outlook as negative. On June 26, 2014, Moody s, Fitch, and S&P each issued statements that the respective ratings and outlook for Alcoa were not affected by Alcoa then-planned acquisition of an aerospace business, Firth Rixson, for $2,850 in cash and stock. On September 16, 2014, Fitch and S&P issued a rating of B+ and BB, respectively, to Alcoa Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. Additionally, on September 17, 2014, Moody s, Fitch, and S&P each issued statements that the respective existing debt ratings and outlook for Alcoa were assigned to the 2024 Notes. Investing Activities Cash used for investing activities was $3,460 in 2014 compared with $1,290 in 2013 and $759 in 2012. The use of cash in 2014 was principally due to $2,385 (net of cash acquired) for the acquisition of an aerospace business (see Engineered Products and Solutions in Segment Information above); $1,219 in capital expenditures (includes costs related to environmental control in new and expanded facilities of $129), 40% of which related to growth projects, including the automotive expansions at the Alcoa, TN and Davenport, IA fabrication plants, the aerospace expansion at the La Porte, IN plant, the aluminum-lithium capacity expansion at the Lafayette, IN plant, and the specialty foil expansion at the Itapissuma plant in Brazil; and $195 in additions to investments, including equity 75 contributions of $120 related to the aluminum complex joint venture in Saudi Arabia and the purchase of $49 in equities and fixed income securities held by Alcoa captive insurance company. These items were slightly offset by $253 in proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses, largely attributable to the sale of an ownership stake in a bauxite mine and refinery in Jamaica (see Alumina in Segment Information above), an ownership stake in a smelter in the United States (see Primary Metals in Segment Information above), three rolling mills in Spain and France combined (see Global Rolled Products in Segment Information above), and a rod plant in Canada (see Primary Metals in Segment Information above); and $57 in sales of investments, mostly related to $42 in combined proceeds from the sale of a mining interest in Suriname and an equity investment in a China rolling mill. The use of cash in 2013 was primarily due to $1,193 in capital expenditures (includes costs related to environmental control in new and expanded facilities of $143), 34% of which related to growth projects, including the automotive expansion at the Davenport, IA fabrication plant, the aluminum-lithium capacity expansion at the Lafayette, IN plant, and the automotive sheet expansion at the Alcoa, TN plant; and $293 in additions to investments, including equity contributions of $171 related to the aluminum complex joint venture in Saudi Arabia and the purchase of $54 in equities and fixed income securities held by Alcoa captive insurance company. These items were slightly offset by a net change in restricted cash of $170, mostly related to the release of funds to be used for capital expenditures of the automotive expansion at the Davenport, IA fabrication plant (see Noncash Financing and Investing Activities below). The use of cash in 2012 was mainly due to $1,261 in capital expenditures (includes costs related to environmental control in new and expanded facilities of $153), 33% of which related to growth projects, including the automotive expansion at the Davenport, IA fabrication plant and the Estreito hydroelectric power project; and $300 in additions to investments, principally for the equity contributions of $253 related to the aluminum complex joint venture in Saudi Arabia. These items were somewhat offset by $615 in proceeds from the sale of assets, mostly the result of $597 received for the sale of U.S. hydroelectric power assets (see Primary Metals in Segment Information above), and a net change in restricted cash of $87, principally related to the release of funds to be used for capital expenditures of the automotive expansion at the Davenport, IA fabrication plant (see Noncash Financing and Investing Activities below). Noncash Financing and Investing Activities In early 2014, holders of $575 principal amount of Alcoa 5.25% Convertible Notes due March 15, 2014 (the 2014 Notes ) exercised their option to convert the 2014 Notes into 89 million shares of Alcoa common stock. The conversion rate for the 2014 Notes was 155.4908 shares of Alcoa common stock per $1,000 (in full dollars) principal amount of notes, equivalent to a conversion price of $6.43 per share. The difference between the $575 principal amount of the 2014 Notes and the $89 par value of the issued shares increased Additional capital on Alcoa Consolidated Balance Sheet. This transaction was not reflected in Alcoa Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows as it represents a noncash financing activity. In late 2014, Alcoa paid $2,995 (net of cash acquired) to acquire an aerospace business, Firth Rixson (see Engineered Products and Solutions in Segment Information above). A portion of this consideration was paid through the issuance of 37 million shares in Alcoa common stock valued at $610. The issuance of common stock was not reflected in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows as it represents a noncash investing activity. In August 2012, Alcoa received a loan of $250 for the purpose of financing all or part of the cost of acquiring, constructing, reconstructing, and renovating certain facilities at Alcoa rolling mill plant in Davenport, IA. Because this loan can only be used for this purpose, the net proceeds of $248 were classified as restricted cash. Since restricted cash is not part of cash and cash equivalents, this transaction was not reflected in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows as it represents a noncash activity. As funds were expended for the project, the release of the cash was reflected as both an inflow on the Net change in restricted cash line and an outflow on the Capital expenditures line in the Investing Activities section of the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, Alcoa had $13 and $171, respectively, of restricted cash remaining related to this transaction. In 2014, the remaining funds were expended on the project. 76 Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Contractual Obligations. Alcoa is required to make future payments under various contracts, including long-term purchase obligations, financing arrangements, and lease agreements. Alcoa also has commitments to fund its pension plans, provide payments for other postretirement benefit plans, and fund capital projects. As of December 31, 2014, a summary of Alcoa outstanding contractual obligations is as follows (these contractual obligations are grouped in the same manner as they are classified in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in order to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information): Total 2015 2016-2017 2018-2019 Thereafter Operating activities: Energy-related purchase obligations $ 16,429 $ 1,488 $ 2,752 $ 2,548 $ 9,641 Raw material purchase obligations 7,260 2,430 1,148 941 2,741 Other purchase obligations 1,405 170 303 305 627 Operating leases 853 205 303 180 165 Interest related to total debt 4,318 500 975 822 2,021 Estimated minimum required pension funding 1,945 485 725 735 - Other postretirement benefit payments 2,110 230 440 440 1,000 Layoff and other restructuring payments 132 113 15 4 - Deferred revenue arrangements 166 20 41 40 65 Uncertain tax positions 44 - - - 44 Financing activities: Total debt 8,846 83 795 1,815 6,153 Dividends to shareholders - - - - - Investing activities: Capital projects 1,312 777 460 75 - Equity contributions 46 46 - - - Payments related to acquisitions 150 - 32 118 - Totals $ 45,016 $ 6,547 $ 7,989 $ 8,023 $ 22,457 Obligations for Operating Activities Energy-related purchase obligations consist primarily of electricity and natural gas contracts with expiration dates ranging from 1 year to 33 years. Raw material obligations consist mostly of bauxite (relates to Alcoa bauxite mine interests in Guinea and Brazil), caustic soda, alumina, aluminum fluoride, calcined petroleum coke, cathode blocks, and various metals with expiration dates ranging from less than 1 year to 18 years. Other purchase obligations consist principally of freight for bauxite and alumina with expiration dates ranging from 1 to 17 years. Many of these purchase obligations contain variable pricing components, and, as a result, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table. Operating leases represent multi-year obligations for certain land and buildings, alumina refinery process control technology, plant equipment, vehicles, and computer equipment. Interest related to total debt is based on interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2014 and is calculated on debt with maturities that extend to 2042. The effect of outstanding interest rate swaps, which are accounted for as fair value hedges, was included in interest related to total debt. As of December 31, 2014, these hedges effectively convert the interest rate from fixed to floating on $200 of debt through 2018. As the contractual interest rates for certain debt and interest rate swaps are variable, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table. Estimated minimum required pension funding and postretirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates, long-term rate of return on plan assets, rate of compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates, among others. The minimum required contributions for pension funding are estimated to be $485 for 2015, $375 for 2016, $350 for 2017, $375 for 2018, and $360 for 2019. These expected pension contributions reflect the impacts of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery 77 Act of 2008, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21 st Century Act, and the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014. The estimated decline in pension contributions assumes that all actuarial assumptions are realized and remain the same in the future. Other postretirement benefit payments are expected to approximate $220 to $230 annually for years 2015 through 2019 and $200 annually for years 2020 through 2024. Such payments will be slightly offset by subsidy receipts related to Medicare Part D, which are estimated to be approximately $15 to $20 annually for years 2015 through 2024. Alcoa has determined that it is not practicable to present pension funding and other postretirement benefit payments beyond 2019 and 2024, respectively. Layoff and other restructuring payments expected to be paid within one year primarily relate to severance costs. Amounts scheduled to be paid beyond one year are related to lease termination costs, ongoing site remediation work, and special separation benefit payments. Deferred revenue arrangements require Alcoa to deliver alumina and sheet and plate to certain customers over the specified contract period (through 2027 for an alumina contract and through 2020 for a sheet and plate contract). While these obligations are not expected to result in cash payments, they represent contractual obligations for which the Company would be obligated if the specified product deliveries could not be made. Uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return may result in additional payments to tax authorities. The amount in the preceding table includes interest and penalties accrued related to such positions as of December 31, 2014. The total amount of uncertain tax positions is included in the Thereafter column as the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments. If a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires, then additional payments will not be necessary. Obligations for Financing Activities Total debt amounts in the preceding table represent the principal amounts of all outstanding debt, including short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Maturities for long-term debt extend to 2042. Alcoa has historically paid quarterly dividends on its preferred and common stock. Including dividends on preferred stock, Alcoa paid $161 in dividends to shareholders during 2014. This amount includes dividends related to a new class of preferred stock issued in September 2014 (see Financing Activities in Liquidity and Capital Resources above). Because all dividends are subject to approval by Alcoa Board of Directors, amounts are not included in the preceding table unless such authorization has occurred. There were $19 of preferred stock dividends approved to be paid on January 1, 2015; however, Alcoa paid the dividends on December 30, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, there were 1,216,663,661 shares of outstanding common stock and 546,024 and 2,500,000 shares of outstanding Class A and Class B preferred stock, respectively. The annual Class A and Class B preferred stock dividends are at the rate of $3.75 and $26.8750 per share, respectively, and the annual common stock dividend is $0.12 per share. Obligations for Investing Activities Capital projects in the preceding table only include amounts approved by management as of December 31, 2014. Funding levels may vary in future years based on anticipated construction schedules of the projects. It is expected that significant expansion projects will be funded through various sources, including cash provided from operations. Total capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately $1,400 in 2015. Equity contributions represent Alcoa committed investment related to a joint venture in Saudi Arabia. Alcoa is a participant in a joint venture to develop a new aluminum complex in Saudi Arabia, comprised of a bauxite mine, alumina refinery, aluminum smelter, and rolling mill, which requires the Company to contribute approximately $1,100. As of December 31, 2014, Alcoa has made equity contributions of $952. Based on changes to both the project capital investment and equity and debt structure from the initial plans, the estimated $1,100 equity contribution may be reduced. The timing of the amounts included in the preceding table may vary based on changes in anticipated construction schedules of the project. 78 Payments related to acquisitions are based on provisions in certain acquisition agreements that state additional funds are due to the seller from Alcoa if the businesses acquired achieve stated financial and operational thresholds. Amounts are only presented in the preceding table if it is has been determined that payment is more likely than not to occur. In connection with the 2005 acquisition of two fabricating facilities in Russia, Alcoa could be required to make contingent payments of approximately $50 through 2015, but are not included in the preceding table as they have not met such standard. Separately, in conjunction with the acquisition of an aerospace business, Firth Rixson, (see Engineered Products and Solutions in Segment Information above), Alcoa entered into an earn-out agreement, which states that Alcoa will make earn-out payments up to an aggregate maximum amount of $150 through 2020. The amounts in the preceding table represent Alcoa best estimate of when the payments may be made. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. At December 31, 2014, Alcoa has maximum potential future payments for guarantees issued on behalf of a third party of $596. These guarantees expire at various times between 2017 and 2024 and relate to project financing for the aluminum complex in Saudi Arabia. Alcoa also has outstanding bank guarantees related to tax matters, outstanding debt, workers compensation, environmental obligations, energy contracts, and customs duties, among others. The total amount committed under these guarantees, which expire at various dates between 2015 and 2022 was $394 at December 31, 2014. Alcoa has outstanding letters of credit primarily related to workers compensation, energy contracts, and leasing obligations. The total amount committed under these letters of credit, which automatically renew or expire at various dates, mostly in 2015, was $354 at December 31, 2014. Alcoa also has outstanding surety bonds primarily related to tax matters, contract performance, workers compensation, environmental-related matters, and customs duties. The total amount committed under these bonds, which automatically renew or expire at various dates, mostly in 2015, was $203 at December 31, 2014. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosed in the accompanying Notes. Areas that require significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions include accounting for derivatives and hedging activities; environmental and litigation matters; asset retirement obligations; the testing of goodwill, equity investments, and properties, plants, and equipment for impairment; estimating fair value of businesses to be divested; pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations; stock-based compensation; and income taxes. Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments, estimates, and assumptions, and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the Company Consolidated Financial Statements at any given time. Despite these inherent limitations, management believes that Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the Company. A summary of the Company significant accounting policies is included in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the Company to provide the users of the Consolidated Financial Statements with useful and reliable information about the Company operating results and financial condition. Derivatives and Hedging. Derivatives are held for purposes other than trading and are part of a formally documented risk management program. For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, Alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing, at least quarterly, the historical high correlation of changes in the fair value of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, Alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing, at least quarterly, the probable high correlation of the expected future cash flows of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument. The ineffective portions of both types of hedges are recorded in sales or 79 other income or expense in the current period. If the hedging relationship ceases to be highly effective or it becomes probable that an expected transaction will no longer occur, future gains or losses on the derivative instrument are recorded in other income or expense. Alcoa accounts for interest rate swaps related to its existing long-term debt and hedges of firm customer commitments for aluminum as fair value hedges. As a result, the fair values of the derivatives and changes in the fair values of the underlying hedged items are reported in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in the fair values of these derivatives and underlying hedged items generally offset and are recorded each period in sales or interest expense, consistent with the underlying hedged item. Alcoa accounts for hedges of foreign currency exposures and certain forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges. The fair values of the derivatives are recorded in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The effective portions of the changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income and are reclassified to sales, cost of goods sold, or other income or expense in the period in which earnings are impacted by the hedged items or in the period that the transaction no longer qualifies as a cash flow hedge. These contracts cover the same periods as known or expected exposures, generally not exceeding five years. If no hedging relationship is designated, the derivative is marked to market through earnings. Cash flows from derivatives are recognized in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in a manner consistent with the underlying transactions. Environmental Matters. Expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate. Expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations, which will not contribute to future revenues, are expensed. Liabilities are recorded when remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The liability may include costs such as site investigations, consultant fees, feasibility studies, outside contractors, and monitoring expenses. Estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery. Claims for recovery are recognized as agreements are reached with third parties. The estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that Alcoa has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share. The liability is continuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress, prospective estimates of required activity, and other factors that may be relevant, including changes in technology or regulations. Litigation Matters. For asserted claims and assessments, liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. Management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter, available defenses and case strategy, progress of the matter, views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors, applicability and success of appeals processes, and the outcome of similar historical matters, among others. Once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable, management weighs the probability of estimated losses, and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded. If an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible, then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded. With respect to unasserted claims or assessments, management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely, then, a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made. Legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss. Asset Retirement Obligations. Alcoa recognizes asset retirement obligations (AROs) related to legal obligations associated with the normal operation of Alcoa bauxite mining, alumina refining, and aluminum smelting facilities. These AROs consist primarily of costs associated with spent pot lining disposal, closure of bauxite residue areas, mine reclamation, and landfill closure. Alcoa also recognizes AROs for any significant lease restoration obligation, if required by a lease agreement, and for the disposal of regulated waste materials related to the demolition of certain power facilities. The fair values of these AROs are recorded on a discounted basis, at the time the obligation is incurred, and accreted over time for the change in present value. Additionally, Alcoa capitalizes asset retirement costs by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived assets and depreciating these assets over their remaining useful life. 80 Certain conditional asset retirement obligations (CAROs) related to alumina refineries, aluminum smelters, and fabrication facilities have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements due to uncertainties surrounding the ultimate settlement date. A CARO is a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within Alcoa control. Such uncertainties exist as a result of the perpetual nature of the structures, maintenance and upgrade programs, and other factors. At the date a reasonable estimate of the ultimate settlement date can be made, Alcoa would record an ARO for the removal, treatment, transportation, storage and/or disposal of various regulated assets and hazardous materials such as asbestos, underground and aboveground storage tanks, polychlorinated biphenyls, various process residuals, solid wastes, electronic equipment waste, and various other materials. Such amounts may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the period in which they are recorded. If Alcoa was required to demolish all such structures immediately, the estimated CARO as of December 31, 2014 ranges from less than $1 to $46 per structure (136 structures) in today dollars. Goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is reviewed for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or exit a business. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions, negative developments in equity and credit markets, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates, increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. The fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill. Goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Alcoa has nine reporting units, of which five are included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment. The remaining four reporting units are the Alumina segment, the Primary Metals segment (all goodwill was impaired in 2013 see below), the Global Rolled Products segment, and the soft alloy extrusions business in Brazil (hereafter SAE ), which is included in Corporate. More than 80% of Alcoa total goodwill is allocated to two reporting units as follows: Alcoa Fastening Systems (AFS) ($1,145) and Alcoa Power and Propulsion (APP) ($1,590) businesses, both of which are included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment. These amounts include an allocation of Corporate goodwill. In November 2014, Alcoa acquired an aerospace business, Firth Rixson (see Engineered Products and Solutions in Segment Information above), and, as a result recognized $1,898 in goodwill. This amount will be allocated between the AFS and the Alcoa Forgings and Extrusion reporting units, both of which are part of the Engineered Products and Solutions segment. However, none of this goodwill is reflected in the $1,145 above for AFS since the annual impairment review was completed prior to the acquisition. In reviewing goodwill for impairment, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not, the entity is then required to perform the existing two-step quantitative impairment test (described below), otherwise no further analysis is required. An entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test. The ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test. Alcoa policy for its annual review of goodwill is to perform the qualitative assessment for all reporting units not subjected directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test. Management will proceed directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test for a minimum of three reporting units (based on facts and circumstances) during each annual review of goodwill. This policy will result in each of the eight reporting units with goodwill being subjected to the two-step quantitative impairment test at least once during every three-year period. Under the qualitative assessment, various events and circumstances (or factors) that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified (similar to impairment indicators above). These factors are then classified by the 81 type of impact they would have on the estimated fair value using positive, neutral, and adverse categories based on current business conditions. Additionally, an assessment of the level of impact that a particular factor would have on the estimated fair value is determined using high, medium, and low weighting. Furthermore, management considers the results of the most recent two-step quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) between the current and prior years for each reporting unit. During the 2014 annual review of goodwill, management performed the qualitative assessment for five reporting units, the Global Rolled Products segment and four of the five reporting units in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, including AFS and APP. Management concluded that it was not more likely than not that the estimated fair values of the five reporting units were less than their carrying values. As such, no further analysis was required. Under the two-step quantitative impairment test, the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Alcoa uses a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment, as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows, including markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, production costs, tax rates, capital spending, discount rate, and working capital changes. Most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units. Cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years. The betas used in calculating the individual reporting units WACC rate are estimated for each business with the assistance of valuation experts. In the event the estimated fair value of a reporting unit per the DCF model is less than the carrying value, additional analysis would be required. The additional analysis would compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill, which may involve the use of valuation experts. The implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to such excess would be recognized, which could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations and shareholders equity. During the 2014 annual review of goodwill, management proceeded directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test for three reporting units as follows: the Alumina segment, SAE, and one of the five reporting units in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment. The estimated fair values of these three reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective carrying value, resulting in no impairment. Goodwill impairment tests in prior years indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any of the Company reporting units, except for the Primary Metals segment in 2013 (see below), and there were no triggering events since that time that necessitated an impairment test. In 2013, for Primary Metals, the estimated fair value as determined by the DCF model was lower than the associated carrying value. As a result, management performed the second step of the impairment analysis in order to determine the implied fair value of Primary Metals goodwill. The results of the second-step analysis showed that the implied fair value of goodwill was zero. Therefore, in the fourth quarter of 2013, Alcoa recorded a goodwill impairment of $1,731 ($1,719 after noncontrolling interest). As a result of the goodwill impairment, there is no goodwill remaining for the Primary Metals reporting unit. The impairment of Primary Metals goodwill resulted from several causes: the prolonged economic downturn; a disconnect between industry fundamentals and pricing that has resulted in lower metal prices; and the increased cost of alumina, a key raw material, resulting from expansion of the Alumina Price Index throughout the industry. All of these factors, exacerbated by increases in discount rates, continue to place significant downward pressure on metal prices and operating margins, and the resulting estimated fair value, of the Primary Metals business. As a result, management decreased the near-term and long-term estimates of the operating results and cash flows utilized in assessing Primary 82 Metals goodwill for impairment. The valuation of goodwill for the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis is considered a level 3 fair value measurement, which means that the valuation of the assets and liabilities reflect management own judgments regarding the assumptions market participants would use in determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities. Equity Investments. Alcoa invests in a number of privately-held companies, primarily through joint ventures and consortia, which are accounted for on the equity method. The equity method is applied in situations where Alcoa has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. Management reviews equity investments for impairment whenever certain indicators are present suggesting that the carrying value of an investment is not recoverable. This analysis requires a significant amount of judgment from management to identify events or circumstances indicating that an equity investment is impaired. The following items are examples of impairment indicators: significant, sustained declines in an investee revenue, earnings, and cash flow trends; adverse market conditions of the investee industry or geographic area; the investee ability to continue operations measured by several items, including liquidity; and other factors. Once an impairment indicator is identified, management uses considerable judgment to determine if the impairment is other than temporary, in which case the equity investment is written down to its estimated fair value. An impairment that is other than temporary could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations. Properties, Plants, and Equipment. Properties, plants, and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets (asset group) may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets (asset group) to their carrying amount. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets (asset group) exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets (asset group) over their fair value, with fair value determined using the best information available, which generally is a DCF model. The determination of what constitutes an asset group, the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows, and the estimated useful lives of assets also require significant judgments. Discontinued Operations and Assets Held For Sale. The fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a DCF model, valuations performed by third parties, earnings multiples, or indicative bids, when available. A number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques, including the forecasting of markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs and expenses, and multiple other factors. Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made; however, the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits. Liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions, including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (salary increases, health care cost trend rates, retirement age, and mortality). The interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined using a Company-specific yield curve model (above-median) developed with the assistance of an external actuary. The cash flows of the plans projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds, which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors, including finance and banking, consumer products, transportation, insurance, and pharmaceutical, among others. The yield curve model parallels the plans projected cash flows, which have an average duration of 10 years, and the underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the Company plans obligations multiple times. In 2014, 2013, and 2012, the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations for U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 4.00%, 4.80%, and 4.15%, respectively. The impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 1/4 of 1% would be approximately $460 and either a charge or credit of approximately $20 to after-tax earnings in the following year. 83 The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a five-year market-related value of plan assets (a four-year average or the fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain non-U.S. plans). The process used by management to develop this assumption is one that relies on a combination of historical asset return information and forward-looking returns by asset class. As it relates to historical asset return information, management focuses on the annual, 10-year moving, and 20-year moving averages when developing this assumption. Management also incorporates expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and consultants, as well as management own judgment. For 2014, 2013, and 2012, management used 8.00%, 8.50%, and 8.50% as its expected long-term rate of return, which was based on the prevailing and planned strategic asset allocations, as well as estimates of future returns by asset class. These rates fell within the respective range of the 20-year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class. In 2014, the decrease of 50 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return was due to a combination of a decrease in the 20-year moving average of actual performance and lower future expected market returns at that time. For 2015, management has determined that 7.75% will be the expected long-term rate of return. The decrease of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return is due to lower future expected market returns. A change in the assumption for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 1/4 of 1% would impact after-tax earnings by approximately $20 for 2014. During 2014, an independent U.S. organization that publishes standard mortality rates based on statistical analysis and studies issued updated mortality tables. The rates within these standard tables are used by actuaries as one of the many assumptions when measuring a company projected benefit obligation for pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The funded status of all of Alcoa pension and other postretirement benefit plans are measured as of December 31 each calendar year. During the measurement process at the end of 2014, Alcoa, with the assistance of an external actuary, considered the rates in the new mortality tables, along with specific data related to Alcoa retiree population, to develop the mortality-related assumptions used to measure the benefit obligation of various U.S. benefit plans. As a result, Alcoa recognized a charge of approximately $100 ($65 after-tax) in other comprehensive loss related to the updated mortality assumptions. In 2014, a net charge of $99 ($69 after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to an 80 basis point decrease in the discount rate and a change in the mortality assumption (see above), which was mostly offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the amortization of actuarial losses. In 2013, a net benefit of $876 ($531 after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to a 65 basis point increase in the discount rate and the amortization of actuarial losses. In 2012, a net charge of $769 ($529 after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to a 75 basis point decrease in the discount rate, which was slightly offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the amortization of actuarial losses. Stock-based Compensation. Alcoa recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the non-substantive vesting period approach, in which the expense (net of estimated forfeitures) is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value. The fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-pricing model. Determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment, including estimates for the average risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility, annual forfeiture rate, and exercise behavior. These assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time. Equity grants are issued in January each year. As part of Alcoa stock-based compensation plan design, individuals who are retirement-eligible have a six-month requisite service period in the year of grant. As a result, a larger portion of expense will be recognized in the first half of each year for these retirement-eligible employees. Compensation expense recorded in 2014, 2013, and 2012 was $87 ($58 after-tax), $71 ($48 after-tax), and $67 ($46 after-tax), respectively. Of this amount, $15, $14, and $13 in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, pertains to the acceleration of expense related to retirement-eligible employees. 84 Most plan participants can choose whether to receive their award in the form of stock options, stock awards, or a combination of both. This choice is made before the grant is issued and is irrevocable. Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable (or received or receivable) for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid, and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of Alcoa assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that a tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in carryback periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future profitability within the carryforward period, including from tax planning strategies, and Alcoa experience with similar operations. Existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence. Negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses, projections of future losses, or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income. Deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances, resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance. Existing valuation allowances are re-examined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance, if any, is released. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are also re-measured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays. In 2013, Alcoa recognized a $372 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in Spain and the United States. Of this amount, a $237 valuation allowance was established on the full value of the deferred tax assets related to a Spanish consolidated tax group. These deferred tax assets have an expiration period ranging from 2016 (for certain credits) to an unlimited life (for operating losses). After weighing all available positive and negative evidence, as described above, management determined that it was no longer more likely than not that Alcoa will realize the tax benefit of these deferred tax assets. This was mainly driven by a decline in the outlook of the Primary Metals business (2013 realized prices were the lowest since 2009) combined with prior year cumulative losses of the Spanish consolidated tax group. During 2014, the underlying value of the deferred tax assets decreased due to a remeasurement as a result of the enactment of new tax rates in Spain beginning in 2015 (see Income Taxes in Earnings Summary under Results of Operations above), the sale of a member of the Spanish consolidated tax group, and a change in foreign currency exchange rates. As a result, the valuation allowance decreased by the same amount. At December 31, 2014, the amount of the valuation allowance was $163. This valuation allowance was reevaluated as of December 31, 2014, and no change to the allowance was deemed necessary based on all available evidence. The need for this valuation allowance will be assessed on a continuous basis in future periods and, as a result, a portion or all of the allowance may be reversed based on changes in facts and circumstances. The remaining $135 relates to a valuation allowance established on a portion of available foreign tax credits in the United States. These credits can be carried forward for 10 years, and have an expiration period ranging from 2016 to 2023 as of December 31, 2013 (2015 to 2019 as of December 31, 2014). After weighing all available positive and negative evidence, as described above, management determined that it was no longer more likely than not that Alcoa will realize the full tax benefit of these foreign tax credits. This was primarily due to lower foreign sourced taxable income after consideration of tax planning strategies and after the inclusion of earnings from foreign subsidiaries projected to be distributable as taxable foreign dividends. This valuation allowance was reevaluated as of December 31, 2014, and no change to the allowance was deemed necessary based on all available evidence. The need for this valuation allowance will be assessed on a continuous basis in future periods and, as a result, an increase or decrease to this allowance may result based on changes in facts and circumstances. 85 Tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold. Otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitation has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized. Related Party Transactions Alcoa buys products from and sells products to various related companies, consisting of entities in which Alcoa retains a 50% or less equity interest, at negotiated arms-length prices between the two parties. These transactions were not material to the financial position or results of operations of Alcoa for all periods presented.
