BUSINESS OVERVIEW General CarMax is the nation largest retailer of used vehicles. We operate in two reportable segments: CarMax Sales Operations and CarMax Auto Finance ( CAF ). Our CarMax Sales Operations segment consists of all aspects of our auto merchandising and service operations, excluding financing provided by CAF. Our CAF segment consists solely of our own finance operation that provides vehicle financing through CarMax superstores. We pioneered the used car superstore concept, opening our first store in 1993. Our strategy is to revolutionize the auto retailing market by addressing the major sources of customer dissatisfaction with traditional auto retailers and to maximize operating efficiencies through the use of standardized operating procedures and store formats enhanced by sophisticated, proprietary management information systems. As of February 28, 2013, we operated 118 used car superstores in 58 markets, comprising 45 mid-sized markets, 1 2 large markets and 1 small market. We define mid-sized markets as those with television viewing populations generally between 600,000 and 2.5 million people. We also operated four new car franchises. During fiscal 2013, we sold 447,728 used cars, representing 98 % of the total 455,583 v ehicles we sold at retail. We believe the CarMax consumer offer is distinctive within the auto retailing marketplace. Our offer provides customers the opportunity to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for items at other big box retailers. Our consumer offer features low, no-haggle prices; a broad selection of CarMax Quality Certified used vehicles; and superior customer service. Our website, carmax.com, is a valuable tool for communicating the CarMax consumer offer, as well as a sophisticated search engine and efficient channel for customers who prefer to commence their shopping online. Our financial results are driven by retailing used vehicles and associated items including vehicle financing, extended service plans ( ESPs ), a guaranteed asset protection ( GAP ) product and vehicle repair service . GAP is designed to cover the unpaid balance on an auto loan in the event of a total loss of the vehicle or unrecovered theft. Our financial results also reflect the sale of vehicles purchased through our appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards. These vehicles are sold through on-site wholesale auctions. Wholesale auctions are generally held on a weekly or bi-weekly basis, and as of February 28, 2013, we conducted auctions at 57 used car superstores. During fiscal 2013, we sold 324,779 wholesale vehicles. On average, the vehicles we wholesale are approximately 10 years old and have more than 100,000 miles. Participation in our wholesale auctions is restricted to licensed automobile dealers, the majority of whom are independent dealers and licensed wholesalers. We sell ESPs and GAP on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors. As of February 28, 2013, the used vehicle third-party ESP providers were CNA National Warranty Corporation and The Warranty Group, and the third-party GAP provider was Safe-Guard Products International, LLC. We have no contractual liability to the customer under these third-party plans. ESP revenue represents commissions earned on the sale of ESPs and GAP from the unrelated third parties. We provide financing to qualified retail customers through CAF, our finance operation, and our arrangements with several industry-leading financial institutions. As of February 28, 2013, these third parties included Capital One Auto Finance, Santander Consumer USA, Wells Fargo Dealer Services and American Credit Acceptance . Depending on the credit profile of the customer, the third-party finance providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed, pre-negotiated fee per contract. The fee amount is independent of any finance term offered to the customer; it does not vary based on the amount financed, the term of the loan, the interest rate or the loan-to-value ratio. We refer to the providers who pay us a fee as prime and nonprime providers, and we refer to the providers to whom we pay a fee as subprime providers. W e periodically test additional third-party providers . We have no recourse liability on retail installment contracts arranged with third-party providers . 21 We offer financing through CAF to qualified customers purchasing vehicles at CarMax. CAF utilizes proprietary customized scoring models based upon the credit history of the customer, along with CAF historical experience, to predict the likelihood of customer repayment. CAF offers customers an array of competitive rates and terms, allowing them to choose the ones that best fit their needs. In addition, customers are permitted to refinance or pay off their contract with CAF or a third-party provider within three business days of a purchase without incurring any finance or related charges. We randomly test different credit offers and closely monitor acceptance rates and 3-day payoffs to assess market competitiveness. After the effect of 3-day payoffs and vehicle returns, CAF financed 39% of our retail vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2013. As of February 28, 2013, CAF serviced approximately 459,000 customer accounts in its $5.93 billion portfolio of managed receivables. Over the long term, we believe the primary driver for earnings growth will be vehicle unit sales growth from both new stores and stores included in our comparable store base. Increased vehicle unit sales should also drive increased sales of wholesale vehicles and ancillary products and CAF income. We target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold. The gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors, including its probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age; however, it is not primarily based on the vehicle selling price . In December 2008, we temporarily suspended store growth due to the weak economic and sales environment. We opened 3 superstores in fiscal 2011, 5 superstores in fiscal 2012 and 10 superstores in fiscal 2013. We currently plan to open 13 superstores in fiscal 2014 and between 10 and 15 superstores in each of the following 2 fiscal years . While we currently have more than 100 superstores, we are still in the midst of the national rollout of our retail concept, and as of February 2 8 , 201 3 , we had used car superstores located in markets that comprised approximately 53 % of the U.S. population. Th e principal challenges we face in expanding our store base include our ability to build our management bench strength to support our store growth and our ability to procure suitable real estate at favorable terms . We staff each newly opened store with associates who have extensive CarMax training . Therefore, w e must recruit, train and develop managers and associates to fill the pipeline necessary to support future store openings. Fiscal 2013 Highlights Net sales and operating revenues increased 10% to $10.96 billion from $10.00 billion in fiscal 2012. Net earnings grew 5% to $434.3 million, or $1.87 per share, from $413.8 million, or $1.79 per share. Total used vehicle revenues increased 12% to $8.75 billion versus $7.83 billion in fiscal 2012. Total used vehicle unit sales rose 10%, reflecting the combination of a 5% increase in comparable store used unit sales together with sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base. Total wholesale vehicle revenues increased 2% to $1.76 billion versus $1.72 billion in fiscal 2012. Wholesale vehicle unit sales increased 3%, reflecting the combined effects of the growth in our store base, higher appraisal traffic and a lower appraisal buy rate. The modest growth in wholesale unit sales also reflected the challenging comparisons with fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, when wholesale unit sales grew 20% and 33%, respectively. Total other sales and revenues declined 2% to $248.6 million from $254.5 million in fiscal 2012, as a 13% increase in ESP revenues was more than offset by a reduction in net third-party finance fees. Total gross profit increased 6% to $1.46 billion compared with $1.38 billion in fiscal 2012, primarily reflecting the increases in used and wholesale vehicle unit sales. Selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses rose 10% to $1.03 billion from $940.8 million in fiscal 2012. The increase reflected the combination of the 9% expansion in our store base during fiscal 2013 (representing the addition of 10 stores), higher variable selling costs resulting from the 5% increase in comparable store used unit sales and higher growth-related costs. SG&A per retail unit was consistent at $2,263 in both fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012. CAF income increased 14% to $299.3 million compared with $262.2 million in fiscal 2012. The improvement in CAF income was largely attributable to the 16% increase in average managed receivables. The allowance for loan losses increased moderately to 1.0% of managed receivables as of February 28, 2013, compared with 0.9% as of February 29, 2012. Net cash used in operating activities totaled $778.4 million in fiscal 2013 compared with $62.2 million in fiscal 2012. These amounts included increases in auto loan receivables of $992.2 million and $675.7 million, respectively. The majority of the increases in auto loan receivables are accompanied by increases in non-recourse notes payable, which are reflected as cash provided by financing activities. In fiscal 2013, net cash used in operating activities also included a $425.2 million increase in inventory. We had 35% more used vehicles in inventory as of February 28, 2013, compared with a year earlier, reflecting the additional used vehicle units to support the 10 stores opened during fiscal 2013 and our comparable store sales growth. In 22 addition, during the second half of fiscal 2013 we built inventories at a higher rate than in recent years to better position ourselves for seasonal sales opportunities. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions. We continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions. Note 2 includes a discussion of significant accounting policies. The accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment. Our financial results might have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed. Financing and Securitization Transactions We maintain a revolving securitization program composed of two warehouse facilities ( warehouse facilities ) that we use to fund auto loan receivables originated by CAF until they are funded through a term securitization or alternative funding arrangement. We recognize transfers of auto loan receivables into the warehouse facilities and term securitizations as secured borrowings, which result in recording the auto loan receivables and the related non-recourse notes payable on our consolidated balance sheets. CAF income included in the consolidated statements of earnings primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables, a provision for estimated loan losses and direct CAF expenses . Auto loan receivables include amounts due from customers related to retail vehicle sales financed through CAF. The receivables are presented net of an allowance for estimated loan losses. The allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the amount of net losses inherent in our portfolio of managed receivables as of the applicable reporting date and anticipated to occur during the following 12 months. The allowance is primarily based on the credit quality of the underlying receivables, historical loss trends and forecasted forward loss curves. We also take into account recent trends in delinquencies and losses, recovery rates and the economic environment. The provision for loan losses is the periodic expense of maintaining an adequate allowance. Se e Notes 2(F), 2(I) and 4 for additional inf ormation on securitizations and auto loan receivables. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete, generally either at the time of sale to a customer or upon delivery to a customer. As part of our customer service strategy, we guarantee the retail vehicles we sell with a 5 day, money-back guarantee. We record a reserve for estimated returns based on historical experience and trends , and results could be affected if future vehicle returns differ from historical averages. We also sell ESPs and GAP on behalf of unrelated third parties to customers who purchase a vehicle. The ESPs we offer on all used vehicles provide coverage up to 72 months (subject to mileage limitations), while GAP covers the customer for the term of their finance contract. Because we are not the primary obligor under these plans, we recognize commission revenue at the time of sale, net of a reserve for estimated customer cancellations . The reserve for cancellations is based on historical experience and trends , and results could be affected if future cancellations differ from historical averages. Customers applying for financing who are not approved by CAF may be evaluated by other financial institutions. Depending on the credit profile of the customer, third-party finance providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed, pre-negotiated fee per contract. We recognize these fees at the time of sale. We collect sales taxes and other taxes from customers on behalf of governmental authorities at the time of sale. These taxes are accounted for on a net basis and are not included in net sales and operating revenues or cost of sales. Income Taxes Estimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets. In the ordinary course of business, transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain at the time of the transactions. We adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is probable that our actual results will differ from our estimates. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted . See Note 8 for additional information on income taxes. 23 We evaluate the need to record valuation allowances that would reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. When assessing the need for valuation allowances, we consider available carrybacks, future reversals of existing temporary differences and future taxable income. Except for a valuation allowance recorded for capital loss carryforwards that may not be utilized before their expiration, we believe that our recorded deferred tax assets as of February 28, 2013, will more likely than not be realized. However, if a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would be affected in the period when the change in circumstances occurs. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payments of these amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result in the period of determination.

The 12% increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2013 resulted from a 10% increase in used unit sales and a 2% increase in average retail selling price. The increase in used unit sales included a 5% increase in comparable store used unit sales, together with sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base. The comparable store unit growth was driven by improved conversion, which we believe benefited from a variety of factors, including more compelling credit offers from third-party finance providers and CAF, increased inventory selection and continued strong in-store execution. The increase in average retail selling price primarily reflected changes in our sales mix by vehicle age, with an increased mix of ages 0-2 vehicles and a reduced mix of ages 3-4 vehicles, which corresponds to the model years in shortest supply. The overall supply of late-model used vehicles being remarketed has remained constrained following four years of new car industry sales at rates significantly below pre-recession levels. During much of the period from 2009 through 2011, wholesale vehicle industry values rose, which increased our vehicle acquisition costs and average selling prices compared with pre-recession periods. We believe the constrained supply of late-model used vehicles and the resulting increase in selling prices has had an adverse effect on our used vehicle sales in recent years. As new car industry sales return to historical levels, the supply of late-model used vehicles should gradually improve, which we believe will benefit our business. Our data indicated that we increased our share of the late-model (0- to 6-year old) used vehicle market by approximately 4 % in fiscal 2013. This data also indicated that our share of the broader, 0- to 10-year old used vehicle market grew approximately 7 %, reflecting shifts in our inventory mix in recent years in response to changing consumer preferences. We believe our ability to grow market share year after year is a reflection of the strength of our consumer offer, the skill of our associates and the preference for our brand . Fiscal 2012 Versus Fiscal 2011. The 9% increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2012 resulted from a 5% increase in average retail selling price and a 3% increase in unit sales. The growth in the average retail selling price primarily reflected increases in our acquisition costs, which resulted from the year-over-year increase in used vehicle wholesale industry values. A shift in our sales mix moderated the effect of higher acquisition costs on our average retail selling price. During fiscal 2012, 5- to 10-year old vehicles, which generally have lower selling prices than later-model vehicles, represented an increased portion of our sales mix. The 3% increase in used unit sales included a 1% increase in comparable store used unit sales, together with sales from superstores not yet included in the comparable store base. We believe the modest rate of comparable store used unit sales growth reflected both a challenging sales comparison with fiscal 2011, when comparable store used unit sales increased 10%, and the continuation of weak economic conditions and low consumer confidence for much of fiscal 2012 . While customer traffic at comparable stores was higher than in the prior year, a larger portion of the fiscal 2012 traffic represented customers who only obtained vehicle appraisals, which contributed to a decline in sales conversion. 25 Our data indicated that we increased our share of the late model used vehicle market by approximately 3% in fiscal 2012. We achieved market share growth despite a shift within the market for 0 to 6 year old vehicles towards older used vehicles and having fewer immature stores (those less than five years old) in our store base due to our temporary suspension of store growth. Historically, market share gains are strongest among immature stores . Wholesale Vehicle Sales We seek to build customer satisfaction by offering high-quality vehicles. Fewer than half of the vehicles acquired from consumers through the appraisal purchase process meet our standards for reconditioning and subsequent retail sale. Those vehicles that do not meet our standards are sold through on-site wholesale auctions. Our wholesale auction prices usually reflect the trends in the general wholesale market for the types of vehicles we sell, although they can also be affected by changes in vehicle mix or the average age, mileage or condition of the vehicles sold. Fiscal 2013 Versus Fiscal 2012. The 2% increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2013 resulted from a 3% increase in wholesale unit sales offset by a slight reduction in average wholesale vehicle selling price. The wholesale unit growth included the combined effects of the growth in our store base and higher appraisal traffic, offset by a lower appraisal buy rate. The modest growth in wholesale unit sales also reflected the challenging comparisons with fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, when wholesale unit sales grew 20% and 33%, respectively. Fiscal 2012 Versus Fiscal 2011. The 32% increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2012 resulted from a 20% increase in wholesale unit sales combined with a 10% increase in average wholesale vehicle selling price. The increase in unit sales primarily reflected a significant increase in appraisal traffic. While the appraisal buy rate remained high relative to historical averages, it declined modestly from the prior year. Our appraisal traffic benefited from the increase in customer traffic in our stores and from the lift in new car industry sales and related used vehicle trade-in activity in fiscal 2012. Other Sales and Revenues Other sales and revenues include commissions on the sale of ESPs and GAP (reported in ESP revenues), service department sales and net third-party finance fees. The fixed, per-vehicle fees paid to us by prime and nonprime third-party finance providers may vary , reflecting the providers differing levels of credit risk exposure. The fixed, per-vehicle fees that we pay to the subprime providers are reflected as an offset to finance fee revenues received from prime and nonprime providers . Fiscal 2013 Versus Fiscal 2012. Other sales and revenues declined 2% in fiscal 2013, as an increase in ESP revenues was more than offset by a decrease in net third-party finance fees. ESP revenues increased 13%, primarily reflecting the growth in our retail vehicle unit sales and an increase in ESP penetration. The decrease in net third-party finance fees was driven by a mix shift among providers, including an increase in the percentage of our retail unit sales financed by the subprime providers to 15% in fiscal 2013 versus 10% in fiscal 2012. The growth in the subprime sales mix primarily resulted from more compelling credit offers being made by the subprime providers. Fiscal 2012 Versus Fiscal 2011. Other sales and revenues declined 4% in fiscal 2012, as a 3% increase in ESP revenues was more than offset by a decrease in net third-party finance fees resulting from a mix change among providers. Subprime providers financed 10% of our retail vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2012 compared with 8% in fiscal 2011. The reduction in net third-party finance fees also reflected the decision by CAF to retain an increased portion of the loans that third-party providers had been purchasing following CAF tightening of lending standards beginning in fiscal 2010. As CAF retained an increased portion of these loans, the fees previously received from third parties declined. Gross Profit Years Ended February 28 or 29 (In millions) 2013 Change 2012 Change 2011 Used vehicle gross profit $ 971.5 9.3 % $ 888.6 4.0 % $ 854.0 New vehicle gross profit 5.0 (23.8) % 6.5 19.9 % 5.4 Wholesale vehicle gross profit 308.1 2.1 % 301.8 26.4 % 238.8 Other gross profit 179.8 (1.2) % 181.9 (10.4) % 203.0 Total $ 1,464.4 6.2 % $ 1,378.8 6.0 % $ 1,301.2 26 Gross Profit per Unit Years Ended February 28 or 29 2013 2012 2011 $ per unit (1) % (2) $ per unit (1) % (2) $ per unit (1) % (2) Used vehicle gross profit $ 2,170 11.1 $ 2,177 11.4 $ 2,156 11.8 New vehicle gross profit $ 630 2.4 $ 847 3.2 $ 659 2.7 Wholesale vehicle gross profit $ 949 17.5 $ 953 17.5 $ 908 18.3 Other gross profit $ 395 72.3 $ 438 71.5 $ 502 76.5 Total gross profit $ 3,214 13.4 $ 3,316 13.8 $ 3,218 14.5 (1) Calculated as category gross profit divided by its respective units sold, except the other and total categories, which are divided by total retail units sold. (2) Calculated as a percentage of its respective sales or revenue. Used Vehicle Gross Profit We target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold. The gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors, including its anticipated probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age; however, it is not primarily based on the vehicle selling price. Our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with the broader market trade-in trends and our rapid inventory turns reduce our exposure to the inherent continual fluctuation in used vehicle values and contribute to our ability to manage gross profit dollars per unit. We employ a volume-based strategy, and we systematically mark down individual vehicle prices based on proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales trends, inventory turns and gross profit achievement. Other factors that may influence gross profit include changes in our vehicle reconditioning costs, changes in the percentage of vehicles sourced directly from consumers through our appraisal process and changes in the wholesale pricing environment. Vehicles purchased directly from consumers typically generate more gross profit per unit compared with vehicles purchased at auction. Over the past several years, we have successfully managed to generate a used vehicle gross profit per unit within a fairly narrow range. Fiscal 2013 Versus Fiscal 2012. Used vehicle gross profit increased 9% in fiscal 2013, driven primarily by the 10% increase in used unit sales. Used vehicles gross profit per unit was only marginally lower, averaging $2,170 in fiscal 2013 versus $2,177 in fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2012 Versus Fiscal 2011. Used vehicle gross profit increased 4% in fiscal 2011, reflecting the combination of the 3% increase in used unit sales and a 1% improvement in gross profit per unit. Used vehicle gross profit per unit increased $21 to $2,177 per unit compared with $2,156 per unit in fiscal 2011. Our shift to selling an increased mix of 5- to 10-year old vehicles in fiscal 2012 increased our average reconditioning cost per unit, as older vehicles typically require more reconditioning effort. However, the older vehicles we sold were generally no les s profitable than newer models. Wholesale Vehicle Gross Profit The strength of our wholesale gross profit per unit in recent years reflects the strong demand for older, higher mileage vehicles, which are the mainstay of our auctions, as well as the continued strong dealer attendance and resulting high dealer-to-car ratios at our auctions. The frequency of our auctions, which are generally held weekly or bi-weekly, minimizes the depreciation risk on these vehicles. Fiscal 2013 Versus Fiscal 2012. Wholesale vehicle gross profit increased 2% in fiscal 2013, driven by the 3% increase in wholesale unit sales. Wholesale gross profit per unit was relatively stable, declining only $4 per unit. Fiscal 2012 Versus Fiscal 2011. Wholesale vehicle gross profit increased 26% in fiscal 2012. The improvement reflected the 20% increase in wholesale unit sales combined with a 5% rise in wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit, to $953 per unit from $908 per unit in fiscal 2011. The year-over-year increase in industry pricing and strong dealer demand contributed to the improved wholesale gross profit per unit. Other Gross Profit Other gross profit includes profits related to ESP and GAP revenues, net third-party finance fees and the service department. We have no cost of sales related to ESP and GAP revenues or net third-party finance fees, as these represent commissions paid to us by certain third-party providers, net of the fees we pay to third-party subprime 27 finance providers. Accordingly, changes in the relative mix of the other gross profit components can affect the composition and amount of other gross profit. Fiscal 2013 Versus Fiscal 2012. Other gross profit declined 1% in fiscal 201 3 , as improved ESP and service department profits were more than offset by the lower net third- party finance fees. Fiscal 2012 Versus Fiscal 2011. Other gross profit fell 10% in fiscal 201 2 , as the 3% growth in ESP profits was more than offset by the lower net third-party finance fees and service department profits. Service department gross profit declined $12.2 million primarily due to the deleverage associated with increased service overhead costs, the modest retail unit sales growth and lower service retail sales. Impact of Inflation Historically, inflation has not been a significant contributor to results. Profitability is primarily affected by our ability to achieve targeted unit sales and gross profit dollars per vehicle rather than by changes in average retail prices. However, increases in average vehicle selling prices benefit CAF income, to the extent the average amount financed also increases. During fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 , we experienced a period of appreciation in used vehicle wholesale pricing. We believe the appreciation resulted, in part, from the reduced supply of late-model used vehicles in the market that was caused by the dramatic decline in new car industry sales and the associated slow down in used vehicle trade-in activity, compared with pre-recession periods. The higher wholesale values increased both our vehicle acquisition costs and our average selling prices for us ed and wholesale vehicles. In fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, we also experienced inflationary increases in key reconditioning costs. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Components of SG&A Expense Years Ended February 28 or 29 (In millions except per unit data) 2013 Change 2012 Change 2011 Compensation and benefits (1) $ 581.9 11.7 % $ 521.0 6.8 % $ 487.8 Store occupancy costs 199.9 6.5 % 187.6 3.3 % 181.6 Advertising expense 106.3 7.2 % 99.1 3.8 % 95.5 Other overhead costs (2) 142.9 7.5 % 133.1 16.7 % 113.9 Total SG&A expenses $ 1,031.0 9.6 % $ 940.8 7.1 % $ 878.8 (1) Excludes compensation and benefits related to reconditioning and vehicle repair service, which is included in cost of sales. (2) Includes IT expenses, insurance, bad debt, travel, preopening and relocation costs, charitable contributions and other administrative expenses. Fiscal 2013 Versus Fiscal 2012. SG&A expenses increased 10% in fiscal 2013. The increase primarily reflected the combination of the 9% expansion in our store base during fiscal 2013 (representing the addition of 10 stores), higher variable selling costs resulting from the 5% increase in comparable store used unit sales, and higher growth-related costs. Growth-related costs include store pre-opening expenses, relocation expenses, and the costs of maintaining store management bench strength to support future growth. These costs were affected by the increase in the rate of our store openings, from 5 stores in fiscal 2012 to 10 stores in fiscal 2013. SG&A per retail unit was consistent at $2,263 in both fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2012 Versus Fiscal 2011. SG&A expenses increased 7% in fiscal 2012. The increase was driven by the 5% expansion of our store base in fiscal 2012 (representing the addition of five stores), higher growth-related costs, and increases in variable selling cost s . SG&A per retail unit rose 4% to $2,263 from $2,173 in fiscal 2011. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 38.1% in fiscal 2013, 38.0% in fiscal 2012 and 37.9% in fiscal 2011. 28 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CARMAX AUTO FINANCE CAF provides financing to qualified customers purchasing vehicles at CarMax. Because the purchase of a vehicle is generally reliant on the consumer ability to obtain on-the-spot financing, it is important to our business that financing be available to creditworthy customers. While financing can also be obtained from third-party sources, we believe that total reliance on third parties can create unacceptable volatility and business risk . Furthermore, we believe the company processes and systems, transparency of pricing, vehicle quality and the integrity of the information collected at the time the customer applies for credit provide a unique and ideal environment in which to procure high quality auto loans, bot h for CAF and for the third-party finance providers. We believe CAF enables us to capture additional sales, profits and cash flows while managing our reliance on third- party finance sources. Management regularly analyzes CAF's operating results by assessing profitability, the performance of the auto loan receivables including trends in credit losses and delinquencies, and CAF direct expenses. CAF income primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables, a provision for estimated loan losses and direct CAF expense s. CAF income does not include any allocation of indirect costs. We present this information on a direct basis to avoid making arbitrary decisions regarding the indirect benefits or costs that could be attributed to CAF. Examples of indirect costs not allocated to CAF include retail store expenses and corporate expenses such as human resources, administrative services, marketing, information systems, accounting, legal, treasury and executive payroll.

(2) Vehicle units financed as a percentage of total retail units sold. Fiscal 2013 Versus Fiscal 2012. CAF income increased 14% to $299.3 million compared with $262.2 million in fiscal 2012, primarily reflecting the growth in managed receivables. Despite the growth in our receivables, direct expenses decreased modestly as we benefited from operating efficiencies. CAF average managed receivables increased 16% during fiscal 2013, driven by the growth in CAF origination volume throughout fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013. Origination volumes benefited from an increase in CAF loan penetration, as we have transitioned back to our pre-recession origination strategy and reduced the volume of finance contracts we were selling to third-party providers. Our decision to retain the loans that third parties had been purchasing primarily reflected our confidence in our ability to economically fund these loans. This transition was completed in January 2012. Originations also benefited from increased ave rage retail selling prices, which translated into an increase in the average amount financed, and from the growth in retail unit sales during fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013. Additionally, historically low funding costs have allowed CAF to begin offering more compelling credit offers. Positive customer response to these credit offers further bolstered CAF origination volumes in the second half of fiscal 2013. See Note 4 for additional information on the credit quality of auto loan receivables. Total interest margin, which reflects the spread between interest and fees charged to consumers and our funding costs, was 7.4% of average managed receivables for fiscal 2013, similar to the 7.3% margin in fiscal 2012. For the past several years, CAF has benefited from historically low funding costs in the asset-backed securitization market. Rising interest rates or competitive pressure on consumer rates could result in compression in the interest margin on new originations. We began to experience this compression in the second half of fiscal 2013 as we lowered rates in response to customer demand, which resulted in lower interest margins on new originations. Changes in the interest margin on new originations affect CAF income over time, as loans amortize within the portfolio of managed receivables. The provision for loan losses is the periodic expense of maintaining an adequate allowance. For fiscal 2013, the provision for loan losses as a percentage of average managed receivables increased moderately to 1.0% compared to 0.8% in fiscal 2012. Low unit charge-offs and strong recovery rates continued to partially offset the effect of the change in credit mix resulting from the transition in our origination strategy. Allowance for Loan Losses Years Ended February 28 or 29 (In millions) 2013 % (1) 2012 % (1) Balance as of beginning of year $ 43.3 0.9 $ 38.9 0.9 Charge-offs (103.1) (92.7) Recoveries 60.9 60.7 Provision for loan losses 56.2 36.4 Balance as of end of year $ 57.3 1.0 $ 43.3 0.9 (1) Percent of total ending managed receivables as of the corresponding reporting date. The allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the amount of net losses inherent in our portfolio of managed receivables as of the applicable reporting date and anticipated to occur during the following 12 months. The allowance is primarily based on the credit quality of the underlying receivables, historical loss trends and forecasted forward loss curves. We also take into account recent trends in delinquencies and losses, recovery rates and the economic environment. 30 The allowance for loan losses increased to 1.0% of managed receivables, or $57.3 million, as of February 28, 2013, compared with 0.9%, or $43.3 million as of February 29, 2012. The increase in the allowance reflected the growth in managed receivables and the origination and retention of loans with greater credit risk resulting from the transition in our origination strategy, partially offset by the net effects of low unit charge-offs and strong recovery rates relative to historical norms. We expect the allowance for loan losses as a percent of managed receivables to increase in future periods as the higher credit risk loans continue to become a larger percentage of managed receivables. Past Due Account Information As of February 28 or 29 (In millions) 2013 2012 2011 Accounts 31+ days past due $ 154.2 $ 116.5 $ 121.3 Ending managed receivables $ 5,933.3 $ 4,981.8 $ 4,334.6 Past due accounts as a percentage of ending managed receivables 2.60 % 2.34 % 2.80 % Credit Loss Information Years Ended February 28 or 29 (In millions) 2013 2012 2011 Net credit losses on managed receivables $ 42.2 $ 32.0 $ 47.5 Total average managed receivables $ 5,385.5 $ 4,662.4 $ 4,229.9 Net credit losses as a percentage of total average managed receivables 0.78 % 0.69 % 1.12 % Average recovery rate 58.4 % 59.7 % 54.8 % As of February 28, 2013, past due accounts as a percentage of ending managed receivables increased modestly compared with February 29, 2012, while net credit losses increased to 0.78% of average managed receivables from 0.69%. The increase in net credit losses reflected the growth in average managed receivables and the origination and retention of loans with greater credit risk resulting from the transition in our origination strategy. Low unit charge-offs and strong recovery rates continued to partially offset the effect of this change in credit mix. The average recovery rate represents the average percentage of the outstanding principal balance we receive when a vehicle is repossessed and liquidated, generally at our wholesale auctions. The annual recovery rate has ranged from a low of 42% to a high of 60%, and it is primarily affected by changes in the wholesale market pricing environment. Fiscal 2012 Versus Fiscal 2011. CAF income increased 19% to $262.2 million compared with $220.0 million in fiscal 2011, reflecting the combined effects of the growth in managed receivables, an increase in total interest margin and favorable CAF loan loss experience. CAF average managed receivables increased 10% during fiscal 2012. Net loans originated increased 32% to $2.84 billion from $2.15 billion in fiscal 2011, reflecting our decision to retain an increased portion of the loans that third-party providers had been purchasing since CAF tightening of lending standards in fiscal 2010, as well as our growth in retail vehicle revenues. The total interest margin increased to 7.3% of average managed receivables versus 6.7% in fiscal 2011. As a percentage of managed receivables, interest and fee income declined modestly to 9.6% from 9.9% in fiscal 2011 , primarily reflecting the effect of the amortization of older loans, partly offset by the shift in the credit quality mix in more recent loan originations. Over the last few years, the average contract rate charged on auto loans has gradually declined, and older loans with higher contract rates have become a smaller portion of total managed receivables. The weighted average contract rate on current loan originations increased slightly to 8.8% in fiscal 2012 from 8.7% in fiscal 2011, primarily reflecting our increased retention of higher risk loans during fiscal 2012. Loans with higher risk are generally charged higher rates of interest. As a percentage of managed receivables, interest expense declined to 2.3% from 3.2% in fiscal 2011 , reflecting the effects of the amortization of older, higher-cost term securitizations and the increased portion of managed receivables funded with newer, lower-cost securitizations. 31 The provision for loan losses increased modestly to 0.8% of average managed receivables, or $36.4 million, in fiscal 2012 from 0.7% or $27.7 million, in fiscal 2011. The increase in the provision primarily reflected the cumulative effect of the origination and retention of loans with higher risk, partly offset by favorable loss experience in fiscal 2012.

(2) Opened in April 2013. Normal, permitting or other scheduling delays could shift the opening dates of any of these stores into a later period. We estimate capital expenditures will total approximately $ 300 million in fiscal 201 4 . We currently plan to open between 10 and 15 superstores in each of the following 2 fiscal years. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2( Y ) f or information on recent accounting pronouncements applicable to CarMax . FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary ongoing cash requirements are to fund our existing operations, new store expansion (including capital expenditures and inventory purchas es) and CAF, our finance operation . Our p rimary ongoing sources of liquidity include existing cash balances, funds provided by operations, proceeds from securitization transactions or other funding arrangements, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Operating Activities . Net cash used in operating activities totaled $778.4 million in fiscal 2013, $62.2 million in fiscal 2012 and $6.8 million in fiscal 2011. These amounts included increases in auto loan receivables of $992.2 million, $675.7 million and $304.7 million, respectively. The majority of the increases in auto loan receivables are accompanied by increases in non-recourse notes payable, which are reflected as cash provided by financing activities. Inventory totaled $1.52 billion as of the end of fiscal 2013, up 39% versus $1.09 billion as of the end of fiscal 2012. The increase reflected a 40% increase in used vehicle inventories, which was primarily attributable to a 35% increase in used vehicles in inventory. The additional used vehicle units supported the ten stores opened during fiscal 2013 and our comparable store sales growth. In addition, during the second half of fiscal 2013 we built inventories at a higher rate than in recent years to better position ourselves for seasonal sales opportunities. Inventory totaled $1.09 billion as of the end of fiscal 2012, up 4% versus $1.05 billion as of the end of fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2012, used vehicle inventories increased 7%, including a 6% increase in used vehicles that largely supported the opening of five new used car superstores. The increase in used inventories was partially offset by a reduction in new vehicle inventory. 32 Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $255.3 million in fiscal 2013, $219.4 million in fiscal 2012 and $72.2 million in fiscal 2011. Investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures, which totaled $235.7 million in fiscal 2013, $172.6 million in fiscal 2012 and $76.6 million in fiscal 2011. Capital expenditures primarily include real estate acquisitions for planned future store openings and store construction costs. We maintain a multi-year pipeline of store sites to support our store growth, so portions of capital spending in one year may relate to stores that we plan to open in subsequent fiscal years. The increases in capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 primarily related to the growth in our store opening pace, as we increased store openings from 5 in fiscal 2012, to 10 in fiscal 2013. Historically, capital expenditures have been funded with internally-generated funds, debt and sale-leaseback transactions. No sale-leasebacks have been executed since fiscal 2009. As of February 28, 2013, we owned 60 and leased 58 of our 118 used car superstores. Restricted cash from collections on auto loan receivables increased $20.0 million in fiscal 2013 and $43.3 million in fiscal 2012 versus a decrease of $1.6 million in fiscal 2011. These collections vary depending on the timing of the receipt of principal and interest payments on securitized auto loan receivables, the change in average managed receivables and the funding vehicle utilized. Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $1.04 billion in fiscal 2013, $683.1 million in fiscal 2012 and $101.8 million in fiscal 2011. Included in these amounts were net increases in total non-recourse notes payable of $1.17 billion, $670.4 million and $187.3 million, respectively, which were used to provide the financing for the majority of the increases of $992.2 million, $675.7 million and $304.7 million, respectively, in auto loan receivables. In fiscal 2013, net cash provided by financing activities was net of $203.4 million of stock repurchases. In fiscal 2011, net cash provided by financing activities was net of a $121.5 million net reduction in borrowings under the revolving credit facility. Total Debt and Cash and Cash Equivalents As of February 28 or 29 (In thousands) 2013 2012 Borrowings under revolving credit facility $ 355 $ 943 Finance and capital lease obligations 353,591 367,674 Non-recourse notes payable 5,855,090 4,684,089 Total debt $ 6,209,036 $ 5,052,706 Cash and cash equivalents $ 449,364 $ 442,658 We have a $700 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in August 201 6. Borrowings under this credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes, and the unused portion is fully available to us. See Note 10 for additional information on the revolving credit facility. The credit facility agreement contains representations and warranties, conditions and covenants. If these requirements were not met, all amounts outstanding or otherwise owed could become due and payable immediately and other limitations could be placed on our ability to use any available borrowing capacity. CAF auto loan receivables are primarily funded through securitization transactions. Our securitizations are structured to legally isolate the auto loan receivables, and we would not expect to be able to access the assets of our securitization vehicles , even in insolvency, receivership or conservatorship proceedings. Similarly, the investors in the non-recourse notes payable have no recourse to our assets beyond the securitized receivables, the amounts on deposit in reserve accounts and the restricted cash from collections on auto loan receivables . We do, however, continue to have the rights associated with the interest we retain in these securitization vehicles . The timing of principal payments on the non-recourse notes payable is based on principal collections, net of losses, on the securitized auto loan receivables. The current portion of non-recourse notes payable represents principal payments that are due to be distributed in the following period. As of February 28, 2013, $ 5.06 billion of non-recourse notes payable was outstanding related to term securitizations. Thes e notes payable accrue interest at fixed rates and have scheduled maturities through August 2019, but may 33 mature earlier or later, depending upon the repayment rate of the underlying auto loan receivables. During fiscal 2013, we completed three term securitizations, funding a total of $2.99 billion of auto loan receivables. Our term securitizations typically contain an option to repurchase the securitized receivables when the outstanding balance in the pool of auto loan receivables falls below 10% of the original pool balance. During fiscal 2013, we exercised this option on three term securitizations that had originally been issued in 2008, and for which CarMax had provided $115.0 million of capital. Upon the exercise of these options, we funded substantially all of the remaining receivables throu gh our warehouse facilities . As of February 28, 2013 , $ 792.0 million of non-recourse notes payable was outstanding related to our warehouse facilities. The combined warehouse facility limit is $1.7 billion, and the unused warehouse capacity totaled $908.0 m illion. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we renewed our $800 million warehouse facility that was scheduled to expire in February 2013 for an additional 364-day term and increased the limit to $900 million. Of the combined warehouse facility limit , $800 million will expire in August 2013 and $ 9 00 million will expire in February 201 4 . The return requirements of the warehouse facility investors could fluctuate significantly depending on market conditions. At renewal, the cost, structure and capacity of the facilities could change. These changes could have a significant effect on our funding costs. See Notes 2(F) and 10 for additional information on the warehouse facilities. The securitization agreements related to the warehouse facilities include various representations and warranties, covenants and performance triggers. If these requirements are not met, we could be unable to continue to securitize the receivables through the warehouse facilities. In addition, warehouse facility investors could charge us a higher rate of interest and could have us replaced as servicer. Further, we could be required to deposit collections on the securitized receivables with the warehouse facility agents on a daily basis and deliver executed lockbox agreements to the warehouse facility agents. We expect that cash generated by operations and proceeds from securitization transactions or other funding arrangements, sale-leaseback transactions and borrowings under existing, new or expanded credit facilities will be sufficient to fund CAF, capital expenditures and working capital for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will be able to enter into new, or renew or expand existing , funding arrangements to meet our future funding needs. However, based on conditions in the credit markets, the cost for these arrangements could be materially higher than historical levels and the timing and capacity of these transactions could be dictated by market availability rather than our requirements. In October 2012, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of our common stock, with an expiration of December 31, 2013. In January 2013, our board of directors authorized an additional $500 million for the repurchase of our common stock , expiring December 31, 2014. Purchase s may be made in open market or privately negotiated transactions at management discretion, and the timing and amount of repurchases are determined based on share price, market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Shares redeemed are deemed authorized but unissued shares of common stock. During fiscal 2013, we repurchased 5.8 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $36.77 per share, leaving $588.1 million available for repurchase under the authorization. Of the $211.9 million of purchases made during fiscal 2013, $8.6 million related to trades that were not settled until March 2013. This amount was included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of February 28, 2013. Fair Value Measurements. We report money market securities, mutual fund investments and derivative instruments at fair value.

The securitized receivables can only be used as collateral to settle obligations of these securitization vehicles. In addition, the investors in the non-recourse notes payable have no recourse to our assets beyond the securitized receivables, the amounts on deposit in reserve accounts and the restricted cash from collections on auto loan receivables. See Note 2(F). (2) Due to the uncertainty of forecasting expected variable interest rate payments, those amounts are not included in the table. See Note 10.
