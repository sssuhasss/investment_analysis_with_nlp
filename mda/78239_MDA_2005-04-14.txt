Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW The following discussion and analysis is intended to help you understand us, our operations and our financial performance. It should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, which are included elsewhere in this report. We are one of the largest apparel companies in the world. Our portfolio of brands includes Van Heusen, Calvin Klein, IZOD, Arrow, G.H. Bass & Co. and Bass , which are owned, and Geoffrey Beene, Kenneth Cole New York , Reaction Kenneth Cole , BCBG Max Azria, BCBG Attitude, MICHAEL Michael Kors, Sean John, Chaps and, beginning in early 2005, Donald J. Trump Signature Collection , which are licensed. Importantly, our acquisition of Calvin Klein, Inc. in February 2003 provided us with an additional platform for growth in revenues and profitability. This acquisition also further diversified our business model by providing a growth opportunity from a strong and highly profitable licensing stream which does not require investments in working capital. Our historical strategy has been to manage and market a portfolio of nationally recognized brands across multiple product categories, through multiple channels of distribution and at multiple price points. This strategy was enhanced by the Calvin Klein acquisition, which provides us with one of the most famous designer names in the world. Here, we acquired a solid base of licensed businesses offering a broad range of products globally under multiple Calvin Klein brands in a range of price points. As importantly, we also have a significant opportunity to broaden the reach of the Calvin Klein brands through growth of existing businesses and entry into new businesses, both directly by us and through licensees. This additional diversification, in terms of product, positioning, business model and opportunity has not only enhanced our growth prospects, but has also further moderated our risk to a downturn in any one of our businesses. We also continue to leverage our sourcing, warehousing, distribution and information technology expertise across all of our brands, which creates both operational efficiencies as well as the ability to respond rapidly to changes in sales trends and customer demands. It also allowed for the smooth integration of the Calvin Klein organization subsequent to its acquisition, enabling us to exceed our operating income targets for our Calvin Klein businesses in both 2003 and 2004. 22 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operations Overview We generate net sales from (i) the wholesale distribution of men's dress shirts and sportswear, principally under the brand names Van Heusen, IZOD, Geoffrey Beene, Arrow, Kenneth Cole New York, Reaction Kenneth Cole, Calvin Klein, ck Calvin Klein, BCBG Max Azria, BCBG Attitude, MICHAEL Michael Kors, Chaps, Sean John and various private labels, and, through the end of 2003, footwear under the Bass brand and (ii) the sale, through approximately 700 company operated retail stores, of apparel, footwear and accessories under the brand names Van Heusen , IZOD , Geoffrey Beene , Bass and, beginning in 2003, Calvin Klein . Our stores operate in an outlet format, except for three Calvin Klein image stores located in New York City, Dallas and Paris selling men's and women's high-end collection apparel and accessories, soft home furnishings and tableware. We are introducing a line of dress shirts under the Donald J. Trump Signature Collection brand in 2005. We generate royalty and other revenues from fees for licensing the use of our trademarks. Prior to 2003, royalty and other revenues related principally to licensing the IZOD and Van Heusen trademarks. In 2003, royalty and other revenues increased significantly due to the acquisition of Calvin Klein. Calvin Klein royalty and other revenues are derived under licenses and other arrangements primarily for jeans, underwear, fragrances, eyewear, watches, table top and soft home furnishings. In December 2004, we acquired the companies that own and license the Arrow trademark, which will generate additional royalty and other income in 2005. Gross profit on total revenues is total revenues less cost of goods sold. We include as cost of goods sold costs of production and procurement of product, including inbound freight, inspection and internal transfer costs. Since there is no cost of goods sold associated with royalty and other revenues, 100% of such revenues are included in gross profit. Due to the above factors, our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities. Selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating expenses other than expenses included in cost of goods sold. Salaries and related fringe benefits are the largest component of selling, general and administrative expenses, comprising 49% of such expenses in 2004. Rent and occupancy for offices, warehouses and retail stores is the next largest expense, comprising 21% of selling, general and administrative expenses in 2004. 23 The following table summarizes our results of operations in 2004, 2003 and 2002: (in millions, except percentages) 2004 2003 2002 Net sales $1,460.2 $1,425.7 $1,380.2 Royalty and other revenues 181.2 143.1 11.8 Total revenues 1,641.4 1,568.8 1,392.0 Gross profit 751.0 644.4 518.3 % of total revenues 45.8% 41.1% 37.2% Selling, general and administrative expenses 621.8 588.6 449.3 % of total revenues 37.9% 37.5% 32.3% Gain on sale of investments 0.7 3.5 - Income before interest and taxes 129.9 59.3 69.0 Interest expense 44.6 37.5 23.9 Interest income 1.7 1.1 1.2 Income before taxes 87.0 22.9 46.3 Income tax expense 28.4 8.2 15.9 Net income $ 58.6 $ 14.7 $ 30.4 Net Sales Net sales in 2004 increased to $1,460.2 million from $1,425.7 million in 2003 and $1,380.2 million in 2002. The 2004 net sales increase of $34.5 million over 2003 net sales is due principally to the net effect of the items described below. Net sales increases in 2004 include: The addition of $88.0 million of net sales attributable to the launch of our Calvin Klein men's better sportswear line marketed to upscale specialty and department stores commencing with the Fall 2004 season, as well as the continued opening of Calvin Klein retail outlet stores in premium outlet malls, which we began to open in 2003. We currently intend to have as many as 75 Calvin Klein outlet stores by the end of 2007. The addition of $41.5 million attributable to growth in our IZOD and Arrow wholesale sportswear businesses. The addition of $12.0 million attributable to growth in our wholesale dress shirt business, particularly from the launch of five new labels: BCBG Max Azria, BCBG Attitude, MICHAEL Michael Kors, Sean John and Chaps. 24 Net sales decreases in 2004 include: The loss of the net sales attributable to the wholesale distribution of footwear, principally under the Bass brand, which in 2003 was $63.2 million. The Bass wholesale footwear business was transferred to a third party under a license agreement. The loss of the net sales attributable to the wholesale distribution of the Calvin Klein men's and women's high-end collection apparel businesses, which businesses were transferred to a third party under a license agreement. The net sales of these businesses were $20.9 million in 2003. The loss of the net sales attributable to retail store closings, an 0.8% sales decline in our retail stores open at least two years and reduced wholesale sales of private label sportswear. In 2003, the $45.5 million net sales increase over 2002 related principally to the Calvin Klein businesses acquired in that year and significant sales increases in our branded wholesale apparel business, offset, in part, by net sales decreases in our retail stores related principally to a weak overall retail environment, as sales in our retail stores open at least two years declined 3.6%, and reduced wholesale sales of footwear and private label sportswear. Net sales in 2005 are expected to increase 6% - 8% due principally to growth in Calvin Klein men's better sportswear, which we began selling for the Fall 2004 season, and full year sales for the BCBG Max Azria, BCBG Attitude, MICHAEL Michael Kors, Sean John and Chaps dress shirt brands which we began selling in mid-to-late-2004 under license agreements and the introduction in 2005 of a licensed line of Donald J. Trump Signature Collection brand dress shirts. Royalty and Other Revenues The royalty and other revenues increases over the prior year of $38.1 million and $131.3 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, are principally attributable to royalty and other revenues of the Calvin Klein Licensing segment. We currently expect that royalty and other revenues of the segment will increase 6% - 8% in 2005, both as a result of growth in the businesses of existing licensees, as well as royalties generated by new license agreements. In addition, royalty and other revenues of the Apparel and Related Products segment are expected to increase significantly in 2005, principally as a result of the royalties generated by the Arrow brand license agreements acquired as part of our acquisition of the Arrow tradename in December 2004. Gross Profit on Total Revenues The following table shows our revenue mix between net sales and royalty and other revenues, as well as our gross profit, as a percentage of total revenues for 2004, 2003 and 2002: 2004 2003 2002 Net sales 89.0% 90.9% 99.2% Royalty and other revenues 11.0% 9.1% 0.8% Gross profit as a % of total revenues 45.8% 41.1% 37.2% The increases in the 2004 gross profit on total revenues percentage compared with 2003, and the 2003 gross profit on total revenues percentage compared with 2002, are due principally to the increase in royalty and other revenues as a percentage of total revenues. Since royalty and other revenues do not carry a cost of sales, the gross profit percentage on such revenues is 100.0%. In addition to revenue mix, our gross profit percentage improvement in 2004 was enhanced by (i) a stronger retail environment for our outlet stores, which resulted in less promotional selling, (ii) stronger sell-throughs of our product in department stores, requiring less support under margin allowance arrangements with many of our 25 department and specialty store customers and (iii) the exiting of the lower margin Bass wholesale and Calvin Klein Collection businesses at the end of 2003, as both businesses were transferred to third parties under license agreements which went into effect at the beginning of 2004. We currently expect that royalty and other revenues will continue to increase as a percentage of total revenues in 2005, but at a slower rate than the 2004 increase. If this occurs, the gross profit on total revenues percentage should increase 30 to 50 basis points in 2005. Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses Our SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues are as follows: 2004 2003 2002 37.9% 37.5% 32.3% The increased 2003 SG&A expense as a percentage of total revenues compared with 2002 is principally related to two factors: Revenues associated with the Calvin Klein Licensing segment, which we acquired in 2003, are principally royalty and other revenues which do not carry a cost of sales. Thus, all operating expenses associated with the Calvin Klein Licensing segment's royalty and other revenues are classified as SG&A expenses, which increased our SG&A expense as a percentage of total revenues. In 2003, we incurred approximately $36.4 million of SG&A expense associated with (i) the wholesale distribution of Calvin Klein men's and women's high-end collection apparel products and (ii) the costs of certain duplicative personnel and facilities incurred during the integration of various Calvin Klein logistical and back office functions. The 2003 year also includes an $11.1 million charge for the impairment of long-lived assets in certain of our retail outlet stores, and related severance and lease termination costs. The 2004 SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues of 37.9% remained relatively flat compared with 37.5% in 2003. While the significant Calvin Klein integration and retail store impairment costs did not recur in 2004, we incurred $12.6 million to exit the wholesale footwear business. In addition, our advertising expenses, principally for Calvin Klein, increased by $23.3 million in 2004. The 2005 SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues are currently expected to decrease 75 to 125 basis points as we leverage the revenue increases noted above. Also, we do not expect significant integration or other activity exit costs in 2005. Gain on Sale of Investments In 2004, we sold an investment in marketable securities for a pre-tax gain of $0.7 million. In 2003, we sold our minority interest in Gant Company AB for $17.2 million, net of related expenses, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $3.5 million. Interest Expense and Interest Income The 2004 interest expense increase to $44.6 million compared with $37.5 million in 2003 is due to a prepayment penalty of $7.3 million and the write-off of debt issuance costs of $2.1 million in connection with the purchase and redemption of our 9 1/2% senior subordinated notes due 2008 in February of 2004. These notes were purchased and redeemed with the net proceeds of the issuance on February 18, 2004 of 7 1/4% senior unsecured 26 notes. Excluding the effect of the prepayment penalty and the write-off of debt issuance costs, 2004 interest expense is below 2003 levels due to the realization of the benefits of the lower interest rate of the 7 1/4% notes. Interest expense of $37.5 million in 2003 increased by $13.6 million from $23.9 million in 2002 due to the acquisition of Calvin Klein. The $401.6 million net cash purchase price was funded by issuing $250.0 million of convertible redeemable preferred stock with the balance being funded by use of our cash and a term loan from the holders of the convertible redeemable preferred stock. The term loan carried an interest rate of 10% and had a principal amount of between $100.0 million and $125.0 million from February 12, 2003 through May 5, 2003. The term loan was repaid on May 5, 2003 with the proceeds from our issuance of $150.0 million of 8 1/8% senior unsecured notes due 2013. Amortization of fees associated with the 8 1/8% senior unsecured notes also contributed to the increased interest expense in 2003. Income Taxes Income tax expense as a percentage of pre-tax income was as follows: 2004 2003 2002 32.6% 35.8% 34.3% The decreased percentage for 2004 compared with 2003 relates principally to (i) higher pre-tax income, which causes state and local franchise taxes that are not based on income to become a lower percentage, (ii) non-deductible expenses included in 2003 pre-tax income related to the sale of our minority interest in Gant and (iii) a $3.0 million reduction in the valuation allowance for state loss carryforwards. Excluding the effect of the valuation allowance reduction, our income tax expense as a percentage of pre-tax income in 2004 would have been 36.1%. The increased percentage for 2003 compared with 2002 relates principally to (i) lower pre-tax income, which causes state and local franchise taxes that are not based on income to become a higher percentage and (ii) non-deductible expenses included in pre-tax income, related to the sale of Gant. We are currently undergoing examinations of our income tax returns for multiple years by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We have reserves for exposures we believe could result from these examinations. Any favorable or unfavorable result as compared with our reserves will affect our tax rate in the year it materializes. Excluding any such discrete items, we currently anticipate our 2005 tax expense as a percentage of pre-tax income will be approximately 37%. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal source of cash is from operations, and our principal uses of cash are for capital spending, contingent purchase price payments and dividends. In 2004, our cash flow was also impacted by our acquisition of the Arrow trademark. Operations Cash provided by operating activities in 2004 was $142.6 million, which significantly exceeded our net income of $58.6 million, principally as a result of depreciation and amortization, tax benefits from the exercise of stock options and deferred taxes. In 2005, we expect our cash provided by operating activities to again exceed net income, but to a lesser extent due to increases in working capital and an expected increase in income tax payments due to exhausting certain net operating loss carryforwards. Capital Spending Our capital spending in 2004 was $46.2 million. We currently expect capital spending in 2005 to be in a range of $40 million to $45 million, and decrease moderately thereafter. Our capital spending is generally for 27 information systems, warehouse and office facilities and retail outlet stores. As such, we have no long-term contractual commitments for capital spending. Contingent Purchase Price Payments In connection with our acquisition of Calvin Klein in 2003, we are obligated to pay Mr. Klein contingent purchase price payments through 2017 based on 1.15% of total worldwide net sales of products bearing any of the Calvin Klein brands. Such contingent purchase price payments are recorded as an addition to goodwill and totaled $22.2 million in 2004. We currently expect that such payments will be $24 million to $26 million in 2005, and will continue to increase moderately thereafter. Dividends Our convertible redeemable preferred stock has a dividend rate of 8.0% per annum, payable in cash. If we elect not to pay a cash dividend for any quarter, then the convertible redeemable preferred stock will be treated for purposes of the payment of future dividends and upon conversion, redemption or liquidation as if an in-kind dividend had been paid. We currently expect to pay our preferred stock dividends in cash for the forseeable future. Based on the current preferred stock liquidation preference of $264.7 million, cash dividends are expected to aggregate $21.1 million in 2005. Our common stock currently pays an annual dividend of $0.15 per share. Based on the number of common shares outstanding at January 30, 2005 and our estimates of stock option exercises, we project that cash dividends on our common stock in 2005 will be $4.8 million to $5.0 million. Cash Flow Summary Our net cash outflow in 2004 was $8.9 million, which included $70.5 million used for the Arrow acquisition. Excluding this purchase, our cash flow would have been a positive $61.6 million. Our 2005 cash flow will be impacted by various other factors in addition to those noted above. For example, the exercise of stock options provided $24.8 million of cash in 2004. We currently estimate that 2005 will include a similar amount. Also in 2004, we made approximately $10.0 million of contributions to our defined benefit pension plans. We currently do not expect to make any material contributions to the plans in 2005. We currently expect to generate $65 million to $75 million of cash flow in 2005. There can be no assurance that this estimate will prove to be accurate, or that unforeseen events, including changes in our net income, working capital requirements or other items, including acquisitions, could occur which could cause our cash flow to vary. Financing Arrangements Our capital structure as of January 30, 2005 was as follows: (in millions) Long-term debt $399.5 Convertible redeemable preferred stock 264.7 Stockholders' equity 364.0 We believe this capital structure provides a secure base. There are no maturities of our long-term debt until 2011. Our convertible redeemable preferred stock has a conversion price of $14.00 per share, and based on current market conditions, and that redemption cannot be required until November 2013, we believe the preferred stock will be converted to common stock rather than redeemed. 28 For near-term liquidity, in addition to our cash balance, we have a $325.0 million secured revolving credit facility that provides for revolving credit borrowings, as well as the issuance of letters of credit. We may, at our option, borrow and repay amounts up to a maximum of $325.0 million for revolving credit borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit, with no sublimits. Based on our working capital projections, we believe that our borrowing capacity under this facility provides us with adequate liquidity for our peak seasonal needs for the foreseeable future. During 2004, we had no revolving credit borrowings under the facility, and the maximum amount of letters of credit outstanding was $186.3 million. As of January 30, 2005, we had $169.8 million outstanding letters of credit under this facility. Given our capital structure and our projections for future profitability and cash flow, we believe we could obtain additional financing, if necessary, for refinancing our long-term debt or preferred stock, or, if opportunities present themselves, future acquisitions. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes, as of January 30, 2005, our contractual cash obligations by future period: Payments Due by Period Total Description Obligations 2005 2006-2007 2008-2009 Thereafter (in millions) Long-term debt $ 400.0 $ - $ - $ - $400.0 Interest payments on long-term debt 311.7 30.8 61.6 61.6 157.7 Operating leases (1) 379.1 77.8 115.1 77.8 108.4 Inventory purchase commitments 234.6 234.6 - - - Minimum contractual royalty payments (2) 19.8 7.7 9.4 2.7 - Supplemental defined benefit plan (3) 35.4 0.9 2.6 2.9 29.0 Total contractual cash obligations $1,380.6 $351.8 $188.7 $145.0 $695.1 (1) Includes store operating leases, which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. These obligation amounts include future minimum lease payments and exclude such direct operating costs. (2) We currently anticipate that future payments required under our license agreements on an aggregate basis will exceed significantly the contractual minimums shown in the table. (3) We have an unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan covering 23 executives under which the participants will receive a predetermined amount during the 10 years following the attainment of age 65. Not included in the above table are contingent purchase price payments we are obligated to pay Mr. Klein through 2017 based on 1.15% of total worldwide net sales of products bearing any of the Calvin Klein brands. Such payments were $22.2 million in 2004. Also not included in the above table are payments of cash dividends on our convertible redeemable preferred stock. If we elect not to pay a cash dividend, then the convertible redeemable preferred stock will be treated for purposes of the payment of future dividends and upon conversion, redemption or liquidation as if an in-kind dividend had been paid. We currently expect to pay our preferred stock dividends in cash for the forseeable future. Based on the current preferred stock liquidation preference of $264.7 million, cash dividends are expected to aggregate $21.1 million in each year. In addition, the preferred stockholders can require the Company to redeem for cash all of the then outstanding shares of convertible redeemable preferred stock on or after November 1, 2013. Based on the conversion price of $14.00 per share, we believe the preferred stock will be converted to common stock rather than redeemed. 29 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect, or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect, on our financial position, changes in financial position, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. MARKET RISK INTEREST AND EXCHANGE RATE SENSITIVITY Financial instruments held by us include cash equivalents and long-term debt. Based upon the amount of cash equivalents held at January 30, 2005 and the average net amount of cash equivalents that we currently anticipate holding during 2005, we believe that a change of 100 basis points in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. Note 9, "Long-Term Debt," in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements outlines the principal amounts, interest rates, fair values and other terms required to evaluate the expected sensitivity of interest rate changes on the fair value of our fixed rate long-term debt. Substantially all of our sales and expenses are currently denominated in United States dollars. However, certain of our operations and license agreements, particularly in the Calvin Klein Licensing segment, expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the rate of exchange of the United States dollar against the Euro and the Yen. Exchange rate fluctuations can cause the United States dollar equivalent of the foreign currency cash flows to vary. This exposure arises as a result of (i) license agreements that require licensees to make royalty and other payments to us based on the local currency in which the licensees operate, with us bearing the risk of exchange rate fluctuations and (ii) our retail and administrative operations that require cash outflows in foreign currencies. To a certain extent, there is a natural hedge of exchange rate changes in that the foreign license agreements general ly produce cash inflows and the foreign retail and administrative operations generally produce cash outflows. We may from time to time purchase foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge against changes in exchange rates. No forward exchange contracts were held as of January 30, 2005. We believe that future exchange rate changes will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. SEASONALITY Our seasonality has changed significantly in the last two years due to the Calvin Klein acquisition, and the Arrow acquisition in December 2004 will further modify our seasonality in 2005 by increasing royalty and other revenues, which tend to be earned somewhat evenly throughout the year. The third quarter has the highest level of royalty income. Our dress shirt and sportswear wholesale businesses generate higher levels of sales and income in the first and third quarters, as the selling of spring and fall merchandise to our department store customers occurs at higher levels as these selling seasons begin. The aggregate effect of our seasonality is that our first and third quarters have the highest levels of sales and income. Revenues in the second and fourth quarters are relatively equal, but earnings in the fourth quarter are lower from significant holiday marketing costs as well as post-holiday promotional selling and inventory clearance activity. ACCOUNTING POLICY CHANGES In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment," which is a revision of FASB Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" and FASB Statement No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure." FASB Statement No. 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values, effective at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2005, which will be our third quarter of 2005. We are in the process of determining the impact FASB Statement No. 123R will have on our consolidated financial statements, which will depend, in part, on the timing and amount of an y future stock option grants. 30 ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES Our financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. We believe that the following are the more critical judgmental areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial position and results of operations: Sales allowances and returns - We have arrangements with many of our department and specialty store customers to support their sales of our products. We establish accruals which, based on a review of the individual customer arrangements and the expected performance of our products in their stores, we believe will be required to satisfy our sales allowance obligations. We also establish accruals, which are partly based on historical data, that we believe are necessary to provide for inventory returns. It is possible that the accrual estimates could vary from actual results, which would require adjustment to the allowance and returns accruals. Inventories - Inventories related to our wholesale operations, comprised principally of finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories related to our retail operations, comprised entirely of finished goods, are valued at the lower of average cost or market using the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost is calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value inventories. Permanent and point of sale markdowns, when taken, reduce both the retail and cost components of inventory on hand so as to maintain the already established cost-to-retail relationship. Based on a review of current business trends, inventory agings and discontinued merchandise categories, a further adjustment to inventory is recorded to reflect additional markdowns which are estimated to be necessary to liquidate existing clearance inventories and r educe inventories to the lower of cost or market. We believe that all inventory writedowns required at January 30, 2005 have been recorded. If market conditions were to change, it is possible that the required level of inventory reserves would need to be adjusted. Allowance for doubtful accounts Accounts receivable as shown on the consolidated balance sheets is net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable, assessments of collectibility based on historic trends, the financial position of our customers and an evaluation of economic conditions. Any significant changes to the above factors could impact our financial position and results of operations. Income taxes - As of January 30, 2005, we have deferred tax assets of $61.9 million related to tax loss and credit carryforwards which begin to expire principally in 2010. Realization of these carryforwards is primarily dependent upon the achievement of future taxable income. Based on the extended expiration dates and projections of future taxable income, we have determined that realization of $55.8 million of these assets is more likely than not. If future conditions require a change in judgment as to realization, it is possible that material adjustments to these deferred tax assets may be required. Goodwill and other intangible assets - Goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets are tested for impairment based on fair value. An impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. Performance of the goodwill impairment tests requires significant judgments regarding the allocation of net assets to the reporting unit level, which is the level at which the impairment tests are required. The determination of whether an impairment exists also depends on, among other factors, the estimated fair value of the reporting units, which itself depends in part on market conditions. Medical claims accrual - We self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical costs. Based on trends and the number of covered employees, we record estimates of medical claims which have been incurred but not paid. If actual medical claims varied significantly from these estimates, an adjustment to the medical claims accrual would be required. Pension benefits - Included in the calculations of expense and liability for our pension plans are various assumptions, including return on assets, discount rate and future compensation increases. Based on these assumptions, and due in large part to decreases in discount rates and the poor performance of U.S. equity markets in 2001 and 2002, we have significant unrecognized costs for our pension plans. Depending on future asset performance and discount rates, such costs could be required to be amortized in the future which could have a 31 material effect on future pension expense. We are currently estimating that our 2005 pension expense will approximate our 2004 pension expense. Long-lived asset impairment - In each of the last two years, we determined that the long-lived assets in various retail outlet stores were not recoverable, which resulted in us recording impairment charges. In order to calculate the impairment charges, we estimated each store's undiscounted future cash flows and the fair value of the related long-lived assets. The undiscounted future cash flows for each store were estimated using current sales trends and other assumptions. If different assumptions had been used for future sales trends, the number of impaired stores could have been significantly higher or lower.
