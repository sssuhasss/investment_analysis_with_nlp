ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview General Humana Inc., headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, is a leading health and well-being company committed to helping our millions of medical and specialty members achieve their best health. Our successful history in care delivery and health plan administration is helping us create a new kind of integrated care with the power to improve health and well being and lower costs. Our efforts are leading to a better quality of life for people with Medicare, families, individuals, military service personnel, and communities at large. To accomplish that, we support physicians and other health care professionals as they work to deliver the right care in the right place for their patients, our members. Our range of clinical capabilities, resources and tools, such as in home care, behavioral health, pharmacy services, data analytics and wellness solutions, combine to produce a simplified experience that makes health care easier to navigate and more effective. Our industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance. The benefit ratio, which is computed by taking total benefits expense as a percentage of premiums revenue, represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability. The operating cost ratio, which is computed by taking total operating costs, excluding Merger termination fee and related costs, net, and depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of total revenue less investment income, represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency. Business Segments We manage our business with four reportable segments: Retail, Group and Specialty, Healthcare Services, and Individual Commercial. In addition, the Other Businesses category includes businesses that are not individually reportable because they do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by generally accepted accounting principles. These segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on well-being solutions for our health plans and other customers, as described below. These segment groupings are consistent with information used by our Chief Executive Officer to assess performance and allocate resources. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for segment financial information. The Retail segment consists of Medicare benefits, marketed to individuals or directly via group Medicare accounts. In addition, the Retail segment also includes our contract with CMS to administer the Limited Income Newly Eligible Transition, or LI-NET, prescription drug plan program and contracts with various states to provide Medicaid, dual eligible, and Long-Term Support Services benefits, which we refer to collectively as our state-based contracts. The Group and Specialty segment consists of employer group commercial fully-insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits marketed to individuals and employer groups, including dental, vision, and other supplemental health benefits, as well as administrative services only, or ASO products. In addition, our Group and Specialty segment includes military services business, primarily our TRICARE T2017 East Region contract. The Healthcare Services segment includes our services offered to our health plan members as well as to third parties, including pharmacy solutions, provider services, and clinical care service, such as home health and other services and capabilities to promote wellness and advance population health, including our investment in Kindred at Home. The Individual Commercial segment consisted of our individual commercial fully-insured medical health insurance business, which we exited beginning January 1, 2018. We report under the category of Other Businesses those businesses that do not align with the reportable segments described above, primarily our closed-block long-term care insurance policies, which were sold in 2018. The results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes and equity in net earnings from Kindred at Home, or segment earnings. Transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our Healthcare Services segment, primarily pharmacy, provider, and clinical care services, to our Retail and Group and Specialty segment customers . Intersegment sales and expenses are recorded at fair value and eliminated in consolidation. Members served by our segments often use the same provider networks, enabling us in some instances to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. Our segments also share indirect costs and assets. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. We allocate most operating expenses to our segments. Assets and 38 certain corporate income and expenses are not allocated to the segments, including the portion of investment income not supporting segment operations, interest expense on corporate debt, and certain other corporate expenses. These items are managed at a corporate level. These corporate amounts are reported separately from our reportable segments and are included with intersegment eliminations . Seasonality One of the product offerings of our Retail segment is Medicare stand-alone prescription drug plans, or PDPs, under the Medicare Part D program. Our quarterly Retail segment earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the Medicare Part D benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership. The Medicare Part D benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member cumulative out-of-pocket costs pass through successive stages of a member plan period, which begins annually on January 1 for renewals. These plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages. As a result, the PDP benefit ratio generally decreases as the year progresses. In addition, the number of low income senior members as well as year-over-year changes in the mix of membership in our stand-alone PDP products affects the quarterly benefit ratio pattern. In addition, the Retail segment also experiences seasonality in the operating cost ratio as a result of costs incurred in the second half of the year associated with the Medicare marketing season. Our Group and Specialty segment also experiences seasonality in the benefit ratio pattern. However, the effect is opposite of Medicare stand-alone PDP in the Retail segment, with the Group and Specialty segment benefit ratio increasing as fully-insured members progress through their annual deductible and maximum out-of-pocket expenses. Aetna Merger On February 16, 2017, under the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, or Merger Agreement, with Aetna Inc., and certain wholly owned subsidiaries of Aetna Inc., which we collectively refer to as Aetna, we received a breakup fee of $1 billion from Aetna, which is included in our consolidated statement of income in the line captioned "Merger termination fee and related costs, net." Acquisitions and Divestitures On August 9, 2018, we completed the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary, KMG America Corporation, or KMG, to Continental General Insurance Company, or CGIC, a Texas-based insurance company wholly owned by HC2 Holdings, Inc., a diversified holding company. KMG's subsidiary, Kanawha Insurance Company, or KIC, includes our closed block of non-strategic commercial long-term care policies. Upon closing, we funded the transaction with approximately $190 million of parent company cash contributed into KMG, subject to customary adjustments, in addition to the transfer of approximately $160 million of statutory capital with the sale. In connection with the sale of KMG, we recognized a pretax loss, including transaction costs, of $786 million and a corresponding $452 million tax benefit. Prior to the sale of KMG, we entered into reinsurance contracts to transfer the risk associated with certain voluntary benefit and financial protection products previously issued primarily by KIC to a third party. We transferred approximately $245 million of cash to the third party and recorded a commensurate reinsurance recoverable as a result of these transactions. The reinsurance recoverable was included as part of the net assets disposed. There was no material impact to operating results from these reinsurance transactions. On July 2, 2018 and July 11, 2018, we along with TPG Capital, or TPG, and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, or WCAS, collectively, the Sponsors, completed the acquisitions of Kindred and Curo, respectively, merging Curo with the hospice business of Kindred at Home. As part of these transactions, we acquired a 40% minority interest in the combined business, Kindred at Home, a for total cash consideration of approximately $1.1 billion. On April 10, 2018, we acquired Family Physicians Group, or FPG, for cash consideration of approximately $185 million, net of cash received. FPG is one of the largest at-risk providers serving Medicare Advantage and Managed 39 Medicaid HMO patients in Greater Orlando, Florida with a footprint that includes clinics located in Lake, Orange, Osceola and Seminole counties. On March 1, 2018, we acquired the remaining equity interest in MCCI Holdings LLC, or MCCI, a privately held management service organization headquartered in Miami, Florida, that primarily coordinates medical care for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries in Florida and Texas. The purchase price consisted primarily of $169 million cash, as well as our existing investment in MCCI and a note receivable and a revolving note with an aggregate balance of $383 million. These transactions are more fully discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. Highlights Consolidated Our 2018 results reflect the continued implementation of our strategy to offer our members affordable health care combined with a positive consumer experience in growing markets. At the core of this strategy is our integrated care delivery model, which unites quality care, high member engagement, and sophisticated data analytics. Our approach to primary, physician-directed care for our members aims to provide quality care that is consistent, integrated, cost-effective, and member-focused, provided by both employed physicians and physicians with network contract arrangements. The model is designed to improve health outcomes and affordability for individuals and for the health system as a whole, while offering our members a simple, seamless healthcare experience. We believe this strategy is positioning us for long-term growth in both membership and earnings. We offer providers a continuum of opportunities to increase the integration of care and offer assistance to providers in transitioning from a fee-for-service to a value-based arrangement. These include performance bonuses, shared savings and shared risk relationships. At December 31, 2018, approximately 2,039,100 members, or 67% , of our individual Medicare Advantage members were in value-based relationships under our integrated care delivery model, as compared to 1,901,300 members, or 66% , at December 31, 2017. Our consolidated pretax income was $2.06 billion for 2018 compared to $4.02 billion in 2017 . A number of significant items effected our year-over-year comparisons including the following: The net gain associated with the terminated Merger Agreement, mainly the break-up fee of $936 million in 2017. The loss on sale of KMG of $786 million in 2018. Charges in 2017 of $219 million associated with voluntary and involuntary workforce reduction programs, the Penn Treaty guaranty fund assessment and costs associated with the early retirement of debt. Lower year-over-year segment earnings in our Retail, Group and Specialty and Healthcare Services segments reflects the impact of investing the benefit of a lower tax rate from the 2017 Tax Reform Law into the establishment of an annual incentive compensation program for a broader range of employees, together with additional investments in the communities of our members, technology and our integrated care delivery model to drive more affordable healthcare and better clinical outcomes. Our year-over-year pretax comparisons were also favorably impacted by strong Medicare Advantage membership growth and operating efficiencies from productivity initiatives implemented in 2017. These increases were partially offset by enhanced 2018 Medicare Advantage benefits resulting from investing the better than expected 2017 individual Medicare Advantage pretax earnings, coupled with the return of the health insurance industry fee, and a more severe flu season in 2018. Year-over-year comparisons of diluted earnings per common share were also favorably impacted by a lower number of shares used to compute earnings per common share from share repurchases and the impact of a lower tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018.The 2017 Tax Reform Law coupled with the tax benefit 40 from the sale of KMG, partially offset by return of the nondeductible health insurance industry fee, drove the lower tax rate in 2018. We returned capital to our shareholders in the form of increased shareholder dividends and significant share repurchase. In 2018, we increased our per share dividend by 25% and repurchased shares worth approximately $1.1 billion, including the accelerated share repurchase agreement, or ASR, that we entered into in November 2018. The annual health insurance industry fee was suspended for calendar year 2017, but resumed in 2018. Operating costs associated with the health insurance industry fee attributable to 2018 were $1.04 billion paid in October 2018. This fee is not deductible for tax purposes, which increases our effective income tax rate. The one-year suspension in 2017 of the health insurance industry fee significantly reduced our operating costs and effective tax rate during 2017. The annual health insurance industry fee is also suspended for calendar year 2019, but under current law is scheduled to resume for calendar year 2020. Retail Segment Individual and Group Medicare Advantage membership increased 259,600 members, or 7.9%, in 2018 to 3,561,800 members December 31, 2018. On January 30, 2019, after the stock market closed, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued its preliminary 2020 Medicare Advantage and Part D payment rates and proposed policy changes (collectively, the Advance Notice). CMS has invited public comment on the Advance Notice before publishing final rates on April 1, 2019 (the Final Notice). In the Advance Notice, CMS estimates Medicare Advantage plans across the sector will, on average, experience a 1.59 percent increase in benchmark funding based on proposals included therein. As indicated by CMS, its estimate excludes the impact of fee for service county rebasing/re pricing since the related impact is dependent upon finalization of certain data, which will be available with the publication of the Final Notice. Based on our preliminary analysis using the same factors CMS included in its estimate, the components of which are detailed on CMS website, we anticipate the proposals in the Advance Notice would result in a change to our benchmark funding relatively in line with CMS estimate. We will be drawing upon our program expertise to provide CMS formal commentary on the impact of the Advance Notice and the related impact upon Medicare beneficiaries quality of care and service to our members through the Medicare Advantage program. On April 24, 2018, we received a Notice of Intent to be Awarded a Comprehensive Medicaid Contract under Florida Statewide Managed Medicaid Program in all 11 regions, including the South Florida, Tampa, Jacksonville, and Orlando metro areas. The comprehensive program combines the traditional Medicaid, or TANF, and Long-Term Care programs. Phase-in under the new contract began December 2018 and was fully implemented February 1, 2019. In October 2018, CMS published its updated Star quality ratings for bonus year 2020. We received a 5-star rating on CMS' 5-star rating system for two MA contracts offered in Florida and Tennessee. In addition, we received a 4.5-star rating for two MA contracts offered in Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Oregon. We have 12 contracts rated 4-star or above and 3 million members in 4-star or above rated contracts to be offered in 2019, representing 84% of our MA membership as of July 2018. The achievement of a 5-star rating for two MA contracts in Florida and Tennessee provides us the ability to market for these contracts throughout the year, creating an opportunity for increased penetration in these important geographies. We cannot guarantee, however, our ability to maintain or improve our star ratings. Group and Specialty Segment During 2018, we transitioned to the new, larger T2017 East Region contract increasing membership 2,846,800 or 92.4% .The T2017 East Region contract is a consolidation of the former T3 North and South Regions, comprising thirty-two states and approximately 6 million TRICARE beneficiaries, under which delivery of health care services commenced on January 1, 2018. The T2017 East Region contract is a 5-year contract set 41 to expire on December 31, 2022 and is subject to renewals on January 1 of each year during its term at the government's option. Healthcare Services Segment We continued to invest in our Healthcare Services segment necessary to drive effective care delivery and clinical outcomes with our acquisitions of MCCI and FPG and our 40% investment in Kindred at Home. Medicare Advantage and dual demonstration program membership enrolled in a Humana chronic care management program was 716,000 at December 31, 2018, a decrease of 9.9% from 794,900 at December 31, 2017. These members may not be unique to each program since members have the ability to enroll in multiple programs. We have undergone an optimization process that ensures the appropriate level of member interaction with clinicians to drive quality outcomes, which has resulted in improved Retail segment operating results. Health Care Reform The Health Care Reform Law enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the U.S. health insurance industry. Certain significant provisions of the Health Care Reform Law include, among others, mandated coverage requirements, mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance, rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios, adjustments to Medicare Advantage premiums, the establishment of federally facilitated or state-based exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers, and the introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values. In addition, the Health Care Reform Law established insurance industry assessments, including an annual health insurance industry fee. The annual health insurance industry fee levied on the insurance industry is $14.3 billion in 2018 and is not deductible for income tax purposes, which significantly increases our effective income tax rate. A one year suspension of the health insurance industry fee, as we experienced in 2017 and are experiencing in 2019, significantly impacts our trend in key operating metrics including our operating cost and medical expense ratios, as well as our effective tax rate. The annual health insurance industry fee is scheduled to resume for calendar year 2020 under current law. As noted above, the Health Care Reform Law required the establishment of health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance that became effective January 1, 2014, with an annual open enrollment period. Although we previously participated in these exchanges by offering on-exchange individual commercial medical plans, effective January 1, 2018, we have exited our Individual Commercial medical business. On November 2, 2017, we filed suit against the United States of America in the United States Court of Federal Claims, on behalf of our health plans seeking recovery from the federal government of approximately $611 million in payments under the risk corridor premium stabilization program established under the Health Care Reform Law, for years 2014, 2015 and 2016. Our case has been stayed by the Court, pending resolution of similar cases filed by other insurers. It is reasonably possible that the Health Care Reform Law and related regulations, as well as future legislative, judicial or regulatory changes, including restrictions on our ability to manage our provider network or otherwise operate our business, or restrictions on profitability, including reviews by regulatory bodies that may compare our Medicare Advantage profitability to our non-Medicare Advantage business profitability, or compare the profitability of various products within our Medicare Advantage business, and require that they remain within certain ranges of each other, in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations (including restricting revenue, enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments, restricting our ability to expand into new markets, increasing our medical and operating costs, further lowering our Medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with the non-deductible health insurance industry fee and other assessments); our financial position (including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill); and our cash flows. We intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, including the primary factors that accounted for those changes. Transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our Healthcare Services segment, primarily pharmacy, provider, and 42 clinical care services, to our Retail and Group and Specialty segment customers and are described in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this 2018 Form 10-K. 43 Comparison of Results of Operations for 2018 and 2017 Certain financial data on a consolidated basis and for our segments was as follows for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 : Consolidated Change 2018 2017 Dollars Percentage (dollars in millions, except per common share results) Revenues: Premiums: Retail $ 48,108 $ 44,626 $ 3,482 7.8 % Group and Specialty 6,803 6,772 31 0.5 % Individual Commercial 8 947 (939 ) (99.2 )% Other Businesses 22 35 (13 ) (37.1 )% Total premiums 54,941 52,380 2,561 4.9 % Services: Retail 11 10 1 10.0 % Group and Specialty 835 626 209 33.4 % Healthcare Services 607 338 269 79.6 % Other Businesses 4 8 (4 ) (50.0 )% Total services 1,457 982 475 48.4 % Investment income 514 405 109 26.9 % Total revenues 56,912 53,767 3,145 5.8 % Operating expenses: Benefits 45,882 43,496 2,386 5.5 % Operating costs 7,525 6,567 958 14.6 % Merger termination fee and related costs, net (936 ) 936 (100.0 )% Depreciation and amortization 405 378 27 7.1 % Total operating expenses 53,812 49,505 4,307 8.7 % Income from operations 3,100 4,262 (1,162 ) (27.3 )% Loss on sale of business 786 786 100.0 % Interest expense 218 242 (24 ) (9.9 )% Other expense, net 33 33 100.0 % Income before income taxes and equity in net earnings 2,063 4,020 (1,957 ) (48.7 )% Provision for income taxes 391 1,572 (1,181 ) (75.1 )% Equity in net earnings of Kindred at Home 11 11 100.0 % Net income $ 1,683 $ 2,448 $ (765 ) (31.3 )% Diluted earnings per common share $ 12.16 $ 16.81 $ (4.65 ) (27.7 )% Benefit ratio (a) 83.5 % 83.0 % 0.5 % Operating cost ratio (b) 13.3 % 12.3 % 1.0 % Effective tax rate 18.9 % 39.1 % (20.2 )% (a) Represents total benefits expense as a percentage of premiums revenue. (b) Represents total operating costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of total revenues less investment income. 44 Summary Net income for 2018 was $1.7 billion , or $12.16 per diluted common share compared to $2.4 billion , or $16.81 per diluted common share, in 2017 . This comparison was impacted by the loss on sale of KMG in 2018, the Merger Agreement break-up fee in 2017, the suspension of the health insurance industry fee for calendar year 2017, the exit out of the Individual Commercial business effective January 1, 2018, a lower tax rate due to the Tax Reform Law, charges associated with both voluntary and involuntary workforce reduction programs in 2017, and the estimated guaranty fund assessment expense to support the policyholders obligation of Penn Treaty in 2017. After consideration of these items, our earnings were favorably impacted by strong Medicare Advantage membership growth and significant operating efficiencies in 2018 driven by productivity initiatives implemented in 2017. These increases were partially offset by our offering of enhanced 2018 Medicare Advantage member benefits which resulted from the investment of the better than expected 2017 individual Medicare Advantage pretax earnings, coupled with the return of the health insurance industry fee and the more severe flu season during the first quarter of 2018.The comparison of diluted earnings per common share are also impacted by a lower number of shares from share repurchases. Premiums Revenue Consolidated premiums increased $2.6 billion , or 4.9% , from $52.4 billion for 2017 to $54.9 billion for 2018 primarily driven by higher Medicare Advantage revenues, partially offset by the impact of lower revenues from the exit of the Individual Commercial business. Services Revenue Consolidated services revenue increased $475 million , or 48.4% , from $982 million for 2017 to $1.5 billion for 2018 , primarily due to an increase in services revenue in the Healthcare Services and Group and Specialty segments, as discussed in the detailed segment results discussion that follows. Investment Income Investment income was $514 million for 2018 , increasing $109 million , or 26.9% , from 2017 , primarily due to higher realized capital gains and higher interest rates in 2018, partially offset by lower average invested balances. Benefits Expense Consolidated benefits expense was $45.9 billion for 2018 , an increase of $2.4 billion , or 5.5% , from 2017 reflecting an increase in the Retail and Group and Specialty segments benefits expense as discussed in the detailed segment results discussion that follows. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the Individual Commercial segment benefits expense. As more fully described herein under the section entitled Benefits Expense Recognition , actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience, which generally results in favorable reserve development, or reserves that are considered redundant. We experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of $503 million in 2018 and $483 million in 2017 . The consolidated benefit ratio for 2018 was 83.5% , an increase of 50 basis points from 2017 primarily due to the enhanced 2018 Medicare Advantage member benefits resulting from the investment of the better than expected 2017 individual Medicare Advantage pretax earnings and a more severe flu season in the first quarter of 2018. These items were partially offset by the positive impact from the reinstatement of the health insurance industry fee in 2018, which was contemplated in the pricing and benefit design of our products and higher favorable prior-period reserve development. Favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development decreased the consolidated benefit ratio by approximately 90 basis points in both 2018 and 2017 . 45 Operating Costs Our segments incur both direct and shared indirect operating costs. We allocate the indirect costs shared by the segments primarily as a function of revenues. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. Consolidated operating costs increased $958 million , or 14.6% , from 2017 to $7.5 billion in 2018 reflecting an increase in the Retail and Group and Specialty segments discussed in the detailed segment results discussion that follows. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the Individual Commercial segment operating costs. The consolidated operating cost ratio for 2018 was 13.3% , increasing 100 basis points from 12.3% in 2017 primarily due to the reinstatement of the health insurance industry fee in 2018, and long term sustainability investments made in 2018 as a result of the Tax Reform Law. Our long-term sustainability investments include the continuation of investments in our associate workforce, primarily the establishment of an annual incentive program for a broader range of employees, together with additional investments in the communities of our members, technology and our integrated care delivery model to drive more affordable healthcare and better clinical outcomes, and an increase in incentive compensation costs under the expanded program noted above. The ratio was further impacted by the growth in our military services business, which carries a higher operating ratio than our other products, due to the previously disclosed transition to the T2017 East Region contract effective January 1, 2018. These items were partially offset by the favorable impact of significant operating cost efficiencies in 2018 driven by productivity initiatives implemented in 2017, the impact of the charges recorded in 2017 associated with the voluntary and involuntary workforce reduction program, and the favorable year-over-year comparison of the impact of the guaranty fund assessment expense to support policyholder obligations of Penn Treaty in 2017, as well as the exit of the Individual Commercial business effective January 1, 2018, which carried a higher operating cost ratio than our other products. The nondeductible health insurance industry fee impacted the operating cost ratio by approximately 180 basis points in 2018. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization in 2018 totaled $405 million compared to $378 million in 2017 , an increase of 7.1% , primarily due to capital expenditures, the acquisitions of MCCI and FPG, and the write-off of a trade name value reflecting the re-branding of certain provider assets. Interest Expense Interest expense was $218 million for 2018 compared to $242 million for 2017 , a decrease of $24 million , or 9.9% , primarily as a result of the early redemption of higher rate debt in December 2017. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate during 2018 was 18.9% compared to the effective tax rate of 39.1% in 2017 . This decrease is primarily due to the Tax Reform Law and the tax benefit resulting from the sale of KMG, partially offset by the impact of the reinstatement of the non-deductible health insurance industry fee in 2018. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate. 46 Retail Segment Change 2018 2017 Members Percentage Membership: Medical membership: Individual Medicare Advantage 3,064,000 2,860,800 203,200 7.1 % Group Medicare Advantage 497,800 441,400 56,400 12.8 % Medicare stand-alone PDP 5,004,300 5,308,100 (303,800 ) (5.7 )% Total Retail Medicare 8,566,100 8,610,300 (44,200 ) (0.5 )% State-based Medicaid 341,100 360,100 (19,000 ) (5.3 )% Medicare Supplement 254,300 235,900 18,400 7.8 % Total Retail medical members 9,161,500 9,206,300 (44,800 ) (0.5 )% Change 2018 2017 Dollars Percentage (in millions) Premiums and Services Revenue: Premiums: Individual Medicare Advantage $ 35,656 $ 32,720 $ 2,936 9.0 % Group Medicare Advantage 6,103 5,155 948 18.4 % Medicare stand-alone PDP 3,584 3,702 (118 ) (3.2 )% Total Retail Medicare 45,343 41,577 3,766 9.1 % State-based Medicaid 2,255 2,571 (316 ) (12.3 )% Medicare Supplement 510 478 32 6.7 % Total premiums 48,108 44,626 3,482 7.8 % Services 11 10 1 10.0 % Total premiums and services revenue $ 48,119 $ 44,636 $ 3,483 7.8 % Segment earnings $ 1,733 $ 1,978 $ (245 ) (12.4 )% Benefit ratio 85.1 % 85.6 % (0.5 )% Operating cost ratio 11.1 % 9.6 % 1.5 % Segment Earnings Retail segment earnings were $1.7 billion in 2018 , a decrease of $245 million , or 12.4% , compared to 2017 reflecting a higher operating cost ratio in 2018, partially offset by a lower benefit ratio. Enrollment Individual Medicare Advantage membership increased 203,200 members, or 7.1% , from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 reflecting net membership additions associated with last year's Annual Election Period, or AEP, for Medicare beneficiaries. For full year 2019, we anticipate net membership growth in our individual Medicare Advantage offerings of 375,000 to 400,000. Group Medicare Advantage membership increased 56,400 members, or 12.8% , from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 reflecting increased sales to our existing group accounts during last year's AEP for Medicare beneficiaries. For full year 2019, we anticipate net membership growth in our group Medicare Advantage offerings of approximately 30,000. 47 Medicare stand-alone PDP membership decreased 303,800 members, or 5.7% , from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 reflecting net declines during last year's AEP for Medicare beneficiaries. These declines primarily resulted from the previously disclosed loss of auto assigned members in Florida and South Carolina due to pricing over the CMS low income benchmark and continued membership declines in our Enhanced Plan. In addition, growth in our co-branded Walmart plan was significantly lower than historical levels due to the introduction of additional low-priced competitor offerings in many regions. For the full year 2019, we anticipate a net membership decline in our Medicare stand-alone PDP offerings of 700,000 to 750,000. State-based Medicaid membership decreased 19,000 members, or 5.3% , from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 , primarily driven by our election not to participate in Illinois' Medicaid Integrated Care Program and the Virginia Long Term Support Services contract that replaced the state's previous stand-alone dual eligible demonstration program in December 2017. Year-over-year decline was also impacted by lower membership associated with our Florida Medicaid contract due to overall strengthening economic conditions, partially offset by the addition of members associated with the new Florida Managed Medical Assistance program from the contract phase-in for certain regions that began December 1, 2018. Premiums revenue Retail segment premiums increased $3.5 billion , or 7.8% , from 2017 to 2018 primarily reflecting individual and group Medicare Advantage membership growth in last year's AEP as well as increased per-member premiums for certain of the segment's products, partially offset by declines in stand-alone PDP and state-based contracts revenues resulting from year-over-year membership declines discussed above. Average group and individual Medicare Advantage membership increased 7.6% in 2018 . Average membership is calculated by summing the ending membership for each month in a period and dividing the result by the number of months in a period. Premiums revenue reflects changes in membership and average per-member premiums. Items impacting average per-member premiums include changes in premium rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership, the mix of product offerings, and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership. Benefits expense The Retail segment benefit ratio of 85.1% for 2018 decreased 50 basis points from 2017 primarily due to the reinstatement of the non-deductible health insurance industry fee in 2018 which was contemplated in the pricing and benefit design of our products, partially offset by the unfavorable impact from enhanced 2018 Medicare Advantage member benefits resulting from the investment of the better than expected 2017 individual Medicare Advantage pretax earnings. 2018 was also impacted by a more severe flu season. The Retail segment benefits expense for 2018 included the beneficial effect of $398 million in favorable prior-year medical claims reserve development versus $386 million in 2017 . This favorable prior-year medical claims reserve development decreased the Retail segment benefit ratio by approximately 80 basis points in 2018 versus approximately 90 basis points in 2017 . Operating costs The Retail segment operating cost ratio of 11.1% for 2018 increased 150 basis points from 2017 primarily due to the reinstatement of the health insurance industry fee in 2018 and increase in incentive compensation costs under the expanded program, resulting from the strategic investments made in 2018 as a result of the Tax Reform Law. These items were partially offset by significant operating cost efficiencies in 2018 driven by productivity initiatives implemented in 2017. The non-deductible health insurance industry fee increased the operating cost ratio by approximately 190 basis points in 2018 . 48 Group and Specialty Segment Change 2018 2017 Members Percentage Membership: Medical membership: Fully-insured commercial group 1,004,700 1,097,700 (93,000 ) (8.5 )% ASO 481,900 458,700 23,200 5.1 % Military services 5,928,600 3,081,800 2,846,800 92.4 % Total group medical members 7,415,200 4,638,200 2,777,000 59.9 % Specialty membership (a) 6,072,300 6,986,000 (913,700 ) (13.1 )% (a) Specialty products include dental, vision, voluntary benefit products and other supplemental health benefits and financial protection products.

Change 2018 2017 Dollars Percentage (in millions) Premiums and Services Revenue: Premiums: Fully-insured commercial group $ 5,444 $ 5,462 $ (18 ) (0.3 )% Specialty 1,359 1,310 49 3.7 % Total premiums 6,803 6,772 31 0.5 % Services 835 626 209 33.4 % Total premiums and services revenue $ 7,638 $ 7,398 $ 240 3.2 % Segment earnings $ 361 $ 412 $ (51 ) (12.4 )% Benefit ratio 79.7 % 79.2 % 0.5 % Operating cost ratio 23.6 % 21.4 % 2.2 % Segment Earnings Group and Specialty segment earnings were $361 million in 2018 , a decrease of $51 million , or 12.4% , from $412 million in 2017 primarily reflecting higher benefit and operating cost ratios in 2018, partially offset by a favorable year-over-year earnings comparison for our group ASO commercial medical business. Enrollment Fully-insured commercial group medical membership decreased 93,000 members, or 8.5% from December 31, 2017 primarily reflecting lower membership in small group accounts due in part to more small group accounts selecting level-funded ASO products in 2018. The portion of group fully-insured commercial medical membership in small group accounts was approximately 61% at December 31, 2018 and 64% at December 31, 2017. Group ASO commercial medical membership increased 23,200 members, or 5.1% , from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 reflecting more small group accounts selecting level-funded ASO products in 2018, partially offset by the loss of certain large group accounts as a result of continued discipline in pricing of services for self-funded accounts amid a highly competitive environment. Specialty membership decreased 913,700 members, or 13.1% , from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 primarily resulted from the exit of our voluntary benefits and financial protection lines of business in connection 49 with the sale of KMG, as well as the loss of some large group accounts offering stand-alone dental and vision products. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in individual dental and vision membership. Premiums revenue Group and Specialty segment premiums increased $31 million , or 0.5% , from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to higher stop-loss premiums related to our level funded ASO accounts resulting from membership growth in this product, and higher per-member premiums across the commercial fully-insured business, partially offset by the exit of our voluntary benefits and financial protection lines of business in connection with the sale of KMG, as well as declines in average group fully-insured commercial medical membership. Services revenue Group and Specialty segment services revenue increased $209 million , or 33.4% , from 2017 to 2018 as a result of the transition to the TRICARE T2017 East Region contract on January 1, 2018. Benefits expense The Group and Specialty segment benefit ratio increased 50 basis points from 79.2% in 2017 to 79.7% in 2018 primarily due to retroactive contractual rate adjustments, membership mix, including the continued migration of healthier groups to level funded ASO products in 2018, and the impact of the exit of our voluntary benefits and financial protection lines of business in connection with the sale of KMG, which carried a very low benefit ratio. These factors were partially offset by the reinstatement of the health insurance industry fee in 2018 which was contemplated in the pricing of our products, and higher favorable prior-period reserve development. The Group and Specialty segment benefits expense included the beneficial effect of $46 million in favorable prior-year medical claims reserve development in 2018 versus $40 million in 2017 . This favorable prior-year medical claims reserve development decreased the Group and Specialty segment benefit ratio by approximately 70 basis points in 2018 versus approximately 60 basis points in 2017 . Operating costs The Group and Specialty segment operating cost ratio of 23.6% for 2018 increased 220 basis points from 21.4% for 2017 . These increases primarily were due to the reinstatement of the health insurance industry fee in 2018, growth in our military services business, which carries a higher operating cost ratio than other products within the segment, as a result of the transition to the TRICARE T2017 East Region contract, an increase in incentive compensation costs under the expanded program resulting from the strategic investments made in 2018 as a result of the Tax Reform Law. These items were partially offset by significant operating cost efficiencies driven by productivity initiatives implemented in 2017, and the impact of the exit of our voluntary benefits and financial protection lines of business in connection with the sale of KMG. The non-deductible health insurance industry fee increased the operating cost ratio by approximately 160 basis points in 2018 . 50 Healthcare Services Segment Change 2018 2017 Dollars Percentage (in millions) Revenues: Services: Clinical care services $ 176 $ 181 $ (5 ) (2.8 )% Pharmacy solutions 203 80 123 153.8 % Provider services 228 77 151 196.1 % Total services revenues 607 338 269 79.6 % Intersegment revenues: Pharmacy solutions 20,514 20,881 (367 ) (1.8 )% Provider services 1,994 1,593 401 25.2 % Clinical care services 662 1,111 (449 ) (40.4 )% Total intersegment revenues 23,170 23,585 (415 ) (1.8 )% Total services and intersegment revenues $ 23,777 $ 23,923 $ (146 ) (0.6 )% Segment earnings $ 754 $ 967 $ (213 ) (22.0 )% Operating cost ratio 96.3 % 95.5 % 0.8 % Segment Earnings Healthcare Services segment earnings were $754 million in 2018 , a decrease of $213 million , or 22.0% , from 2017 primarily due to the impact of the optimization process associated with our chronic care management programs and investments made in 2018 as a result of the Tax Reform Law, partially offset by the impact of Kindred at Home. Script Volume Humana Pharmacy Solutions script volumes for the Retail and Group and Specialty segment membership increased to approximately 440 million in 2018 , up 2% versus scripts of approximately 433 million in 2017 . The increase primarily reflects growth associated with higher Individual Advantage Medicare membership, partially offset by the decline in stand-alone PDP and Individual Commercial membership. Services revenue Services revenue increased $269 million , or 79.6% , from 2017 to $607 million for 2018 primarily due to service revenue growth from our provider services and pharmacy solutions business. Intersegment revenues Intersegment revenues decreased $415 million , or 1.8% , from 2017 to $23.2 billion for 2018 primarily due to a decline in pharmacy solutions revenue due to lower stand-alone PDP membership, the loss of intersegment revenues associated with our exit from the Individual commercial business, the result of improving the effectiveness of our chronic care management programs, and the impact to our provider services business of the lower Medicare rates year-over-year in geographies where our provider assets are primarily located. These declines were partially offset by Medicare Advantage membership growth as well as higher intersegment revenues associated with our provider services business reflecting our acquisition of MCCI. 51 Operating costs The Healthcare Services segment operating cost ratio of 96.3% for 2018 increased from 95.5% for 2017 primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation costs under the expanded program resulting from the strategic investments made in 2018 as a result of the Tax Reform Law and the lag in operating cost reduction associated with improving the effectiveness of our chronic care management programs as compared to the timing of reduction in revenue. These items were partially offset by significant operating cost efficiencies in 2018 driven by productivity initiatives implemented in 2017. Individual Commercial Segment In 2018 , our Individual Commercial segment pretax income was $74 million , a decrease of $119 million , from a pretax income of $193 million in 2017 primarily due to the impact of favorable prior-period reserve development from the run-out of this business. We exited this business effective January 1, 2018. Other Businesses As previously disclosed, in the third quarter of 2018, we completed the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary KMG, as discussed further in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this 2018 Form 10-K. 52 Comparison of Results of Operations for 2017 and 2016 Certain financial data on a consolidated basis and for our segments was as follows for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 : Consolidated Change 2017 2016 Dollars Percentage (dollars in millions, except per common share results) Revenues: Premiums: Retail $ 44,626 $ 43,223 $ 1,403 3.2 % Group and Specialty 6,772 6,696 76 1.1 % Individual Commercial 947 3,064 (2,117 ) (69.1 )% Other Businesses 35 38 (3 ) (7.9 )% Total premiums 52,380 53,021 (641 ) (1.2 )% Services: Retail 10 6 4 66.7 % Group and Specialty 626 643 (17 ) (2.6 )% Healthcare Services 338 310 28 9.0 % Other Businesses 8 10 (2 ) (20.0 )% Total services 982 969 13 1.3 % Investment income 405 389 16 4.1 % Total revenues 53,767 54,379 (612 ) (1.1 )% Operating expenses: Benefits 43,496 45,007 (1,511 ) (3.4 )% Operating costs 6,567 7,173 (606 ) (8.4 )% Merger termination fee and related costs, net (936 ) 104 (1,040 ) (1,000.0 )% Depreciation and amortization 378 354 24 6.8 % Total operating expenses 49,505 52,638 (3,133 ) (6.0 )% Income from operations 4,262 1,741 2,521 144.8 % Interest expense 242 189 53 28.0 % Income before income taxes 4,020 1,552 2,468 159.0 % Provision for income taxes 1,572 938 634 67.6 % Net income $ 2,448 $ 614 $ 1,834 298.7 % Diluted earnings per common share $ 16.81 $ 4.07 $ 12.74 313.0 % Benefit ratio (a) 83.0 % 84.9 % (1.9 )% Operating cost ratio (b) 12.3 % 13.3 % (1.0 )% Effective tax rate 39.1 % 60.5 % (21.4 )% (a) Represents total benefits expense as a percentage of premiums revenue. (b) Represents total operating costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of total revenues less investment income. Summary 53 Net income was $2.4 billion , or $16.81 per diluted common share, in 2017 compared to $614 million , or $4.07 per diluted common share, in 2016 . Net income in 2017 includes a net gain of $4.31 per diluted common share associated with the terminated Merger Agreement consisting primarily of the break-up fee, and the beneficial effect of the lower effective tax rate in light of pricing and benefit design assumptions with the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee of $2.15 per diluted common share, excluding the Individual Commercial business impact. The year-over-year comparison was also favorably impacted by a write-off of $2.43 per diluted common share in receivables associated with the commercial risk corridor premium stabilization program, and the reserve strengthening for our non-strategic closed block of long-term care insurance business of $2.11 per common diluted share recorded in 2016. These items were partially offset by the impact of the tax reform law enacted on December 22, 2017, or the Tax Reform Law, which resulted in the reduction of our net income due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets at lower enacted corporate tax rates of $0.92 per diluted common share, $0.64 per common diluted share in charges associated with both voluntary and involuntary workforce reduction programs in 2017, as well as the estimated guaranty fund assessment expense to support the policyholder obligations of Penn Treaty (an unaffiliated long-term care insurance company) of $0.24 per diluted common share. Excluding the impacts of the items above, the increase in net income primarily was due to year-over-year improvements in earnings for our Individual Commercial, Retail, and Group and Specialty segments, partially offset by lower earnings in the Healthcare Services segment. Premiums Revenue Consolidated premiums decreased $641 million , or 1.2% , from 2016 to $52.4 billion for 2017 primarily due to lower premiums in the Individual Commercial segment, partially offset by higher premiums in the Retail segment, primarily resulting from growth in our Medicare Advantage business, and higher premiums in the Group and Specialty segment, as discussed in the detailed segment results discussion that follows. Services Revenue Consolidated services revenue increased $13 million , or 1.3% , from 2016 for 2017 primarily due to an increase in services revenue in the Healthcare Services segment, partially offset by a decrease in services revenue in the Group and Specialty segment as discussed in the detailed segment results discussion that follows. Investment Income Investment income totaled $405 million for 2017 , increasing $16 million , or 4.1% , from 2016 , primarily due to higher average invested balances and interest rates in 2017, partially offset by lower realized capital gains. Benefits Expense Consolidated benefits expense was $43.5 billion for 2017 , a decrease of $1.5 billion , or 3.4% , from 2016 reflecting $505 million in incremental benefits expense for the reserve strengthening in our non-strategic closed block of long-term care insurance policies recorded in 2016. Excluding the long-term care reserve strengthening in 2016, the decrease primarily was due to a decrease in the Individual Commercial segment benefits expense, partially offset by an increase in the Retail and Group and Specialty segments benefits expense as discussed in the detailed segment results discussion that follows. As more fully described herein under the section entitled Benefits Expense Recognition , actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience, which generally results in favorable reserve development, or reserves that are considered redundant. We experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of $483 million in 2017 and $582 million in 2016. The consolidated benefit ratio for 2017 was 83.0% , a decrease of 190 basis points from 2016 primarily due to the incremental benefits expense in 2016 for the reserve strengthening in our non-strategic closed block of long-term care insurance policies. Excluding the impact of the above, the decrease in the consolidated benefit ratio primarily was due to the decrease in the Individual Commercial segment benefit ratio, partially offset by the increase in the Retail and Group and Specialty segment benefit ratio as discussed in the segment results of operation discussion that follows. Favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development decreased the consolidated benefit ratio by approximately 90 basis points in 2017 versus approximately 110 basis points in 2016. 54 Operating Costs Our segments incur both direct and shared indirect operating costs. We allocate the indirect costs shared by the segments primarily as a function of revenues. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. Consolidated operating costs decreased $606 million , or 8.4% , from 2016 to $6.6 billion in 2017 primarily due to the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee for the calendar year 2017 and lower Individual Commercial membership. This was partially offset by charges associated with both voluntary and involuntary workforce reduction programs, an increase in employee compensation costs resulting from the continued strong performance, increased spending associated with the Medicare Annual Election Period, or AEP, as well as the estimated guaranty fund assessment expense recorded to support the policyholder obligations of Penn Treaty (an unaffiliated long-term care insurance company). The consolidated operating cost ratio for 2017 was 12.3% , decreasing 100 basis points from 2016 primarily due to the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee for the calendar year 2017, the write-off of receivables associated with the commercial risk corridor premium stabilization program in 2016, as well as operating cost efficiencies, partially offset by the loss of scale efficiency from market exits in the 2017 period associated with the Individual Commercial product, the estimated charges associated with both voluntary and involuntary workforce reduction programs recorded in 2017, increased employee compensation costs resulting from the continued strong performance, as well as the impact of the estimated guaranty fund assessment expense recorded to support the policyholder obligations of Penn Treaty (an unaffiliated long-term care insurance company). The non-deductible health insurance industry fee impacted the operating cost ratio by 170 basis points in 2016. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization for 2017 of $378 million was relatively unchanged from 2016 . Interest Expense Interest expense was $242 million for 2017 compared to $189 million for 2016 , an increase of $53 million , or 28.0% due to the issuance of $1.8 billion in senior notes, a portion of the proceeds which were used to redeem $800 million of senior notes scheduled to mature in 2018. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $17 million in December 2017 for the redemption of these senior notes, which is included in interest expense. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate during 2017 was 39.1% compared to the effective tax rate of 60.5% in 2016 primarily reflecting the suspension of the annual health insurance industry fee in 2017, as well as previously non-deductible transaction costs that, as a result of termination of the Merger Agreement, became deductible for tax purposes and were recorded as such in the first quarter of 2017, partially offset by the Tax Reform Law, which increased our effective tax rate due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets at lower enacted corporate tax rates. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate. 55 Retail Segment Change 2017 2016 Members Percentage Membership: Medical membership: Individual Medicare Advantage 2,860,800 2,837,600 23,200 0.8 % Group Medicare Advantage 441,400 355,400 86,000 24.2 % Medicare stand-alone PDP 5,308,100 4,951,400 356,700 7.2 % Total Retail Medicare 8,610,300 8,144,400 465,900 5.7 % State-based Medicaid 360,100 388,100 (28,000 ) (7.2 )% Medicare Supplement 235,900 218,800 17,100 7.8 % Total Retail medical members 9,206,300 8,751,300 455,000 5.2 % Change 2017 2016 Dollars Percentage (in millions) Premiums and Services Revenue: Premiums: Individual Medicare Advantage $ 32,720 $ 31,863 $ 857 2.7 % Group Medicare Advantage 5,155 4,283 872 20.4 % Medicare stand-alone PDP 3,702 4,009 (307 ) (7.7 )% Total Retail Medicare 41,577 40,155 1,422 3.5 % State-based Medicaid 2,571 2,640 (69 ) (2.6 )% Medicare Supplement 478 $ 428 50 11.7 % Total premiums 44,626 43,223 1,403 3.2 % Services 10 6 4 66.7 % Total premiums and services revenue $ 44,636 $ 43,229 $ 1,407 3.3 % Segment earnings $ 1,978 $ 1,690 $ 288 17.0 % Benefit ratio 85.6 % 85.1 % 0.5 % Operating cost ratio 9.6 % 10.8 % (1.2 )% Segment Earnings Retail segment earnings were $2.0 billion in 2017 , an increase of $288 million , or 17.0% , compared to 2016 primarily driven by the year-over-year improvement in our Medicare Advantage business. Enrollment Individual Medicare Advantage membership increased 23,200 members, or 0.8% , from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 reflecting net membership additions for Medicare beneficiaries including the effect of planned market and product exits in 2017. We decided certain markets and/or products were not meeting long term strategic and financial objectives. Additionally, membership growth was muted due to competitive actions including the uncertainty associated with the then-pending Merger transaction during last year's AEP. Group Medicare Advantage membership increased 86,000 members, or 24.2% , from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 reflecting the addition of a large account in January 2017. 56 Medicare stand-alone PDP membership increased 356,700 members, or 7.2% , from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 reflecting net membership additions, primarily for our Humana-Walmart plan offering, for the 2017 plan year. State-based Medicaid membership decreased 28,000 members, or 7.2% , from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 primarily driven by lower membership associated with our Florida contracts resulting from network realignments. Premiums revenue Retail segment premiums increased $1.4 billion , or 3.2% , from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to Medicare Advantage membership growth and increased per-member premiums for certain of the segment's products. Average group and individual Medicare Advantage membership increased 3.4% in 2017. Average membership is calculated by summing the ending membership for each month in a period and dividing the result by the number of months in a period. Premiums revenue reflects changes in membership and average per-member premiums. Items impacting average per-member premiums include changes in premium rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership, the mix of product offerings, and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership. Benefits expense The Retail segment benefit ratio of 85.6% for 2017 increased 50 basis points from 2016 primarily due to the impact of the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee for calendar year 2017 which was contemplated in the pricing and benefit design of our products, margin compression associated with the competitive environment in the group Medicare Advantage business and slightly lower favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development. These increases were partially offset by the impact of planned exits from certain Medicare Advantage markets that carried a higher benefit ratio than other markets as well as lower than expected medical costs as compared to the assumptions used in the pricing of our individual Medicare Advantage business. The Retail segment benefits expense for 2017 included the beneficial effect of $386 million in favorable prior-year medical claims reserve development versus $429 million in 2016 . This favorable prior-year medical claims reserve development decreased the Retail segment benefit ratio by approximately 90 basis points in 2017 versus approximately 100 basis points in 2016. Operating costs The Retail segment operating cost ratio of 9.6% for 2017 decreased 120 basis points from 2016 primarily due to the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee for calendar year 2017, partially offset by increased spending associated with AEP, investments in our integrated care delivery model, and the increase in employee compensation costs resulting from the continued strong performance. The non-deductible health insurance industry fee increased the operating cost ratio by approximately 170 basis points in 2016. 57 Group and Specialty Segment Change 2017 2016 Members Percentage Membership: Medical membership: Fully-insured commercial group 1,097,700 1,136,000 (38,300 ) (3.4 )% ASO 458,700 573,200 (114,500 ) (20.0 )% Military services 3,081,800 3,084,100 (2,300 ) (0.1 )% Total group medical members 4,638,200 4,793,300 (155,100 ) (3.2 )% Specialty membership (a) 6,986,000 6,961,200 24,800 0.4 % (a) Specialty products include dental, vision, voluntary benefit products and other supplemental health and financial protection products.

Enrollment Fully-insured commercial group medical membership decreased 38,300 members, or 3.4% from December 31, 2016 reflecting lower membership in small group accounts due in part to more small group accounts selecting ASO products in 2017. Group ASO commercial medical membership decreased 114,500 members, or 20.0% , from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 primarily due to the loss of certain large group accounts as a result of continued discipline in pricing of services for self-funded accounts amid a highly competitive environment, partially offset by more small group accounts selecting ASO products in 2017. Specialty membership increased 24,800 members, or 0.4% , from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 primarily due to strong growth in vision products marketed to employer groups. 58 Premiums revenue Group and Specialty segment premiums increased $76 million , or 1.1%, from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to an increase in group fully-insured commercial medical per-member premiums, partially offset by a decline in average group fully-insured commercial medical membership. Services revenue Group and Specialty segment services revenue decreased $17 million , or 2.6% , from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to a decline in revenue in our group ASO commercial medical business mainly due to membership declines partially offset by higher revenue from our military services business resulting from higher performance incentives earned under the TRICARE contract. Benefits expense The Group and Specialty segment benefit ratio increased 100 basis points from 78.2% in 2016 to 79.2% in 2017 primarily due to the impact of the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee for calendar year 2017 which was contemplated in the pricing of our products. The increase was further impacted by an increased proportion of small group members transitioning to community rated plans that carry a higher benefit ratio. These increases were partially offset by lower utilization for the fully-insured commercial medical business in 2017 , primarily associated with the large group business. The Group and Specialty segment benefits expense included the beneficial effect of $40 million in favorable prior-year medical claims reserve development in 2017 versus $46 million in 2016 . This favorable prior-year medical claims reserve development decreased the Group and Specialty segment benefit ratio by approximately 60 basis points in 2017 versus approximately 70 basis points in 2016 . Operating costs The Group and Specialty segment operating cost ratio of 21.4% for 2017 decreased 210 basis points from 23.5% for 2016 , primarily due to the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee for calendar year 2017 as well as operating cost efficiencies, partially offset by an increase in employee compensation costs resulting from the continued strong performance. The non-deductible health insurance industry fee increased the operating cost ratio by approximately 150 basis points in 2016 . 59 Healthcare Services Segment Change 2017 2016 Dollars Percentage (in millions) Revenues: Services: Clinical care services $ 181 $ 201 $ (20 ) (10.0 )% Provider services 77 78 (1 ) (1.3 )% Pharmacy solutions 80 31 49 158.1 % Total services revenues 338 310 28 9.0 % Intersegment revenues: Pharmacy solutions 20,881 21,952 (1,071 ) (4.9 )% Provider services 1,593 1,677 (84 ) (5.0 )% Clinical care services 1,111 1,343 (232 ) (17.3 )% Total intersegment revenues 23,585 24,972 (1,387 ) (5.6 )% Total services and intersegment revenues $ 23,923 $ 25,282 $ (1,359 ) (5.4 )% Income before income taxes $ 967 $ 1,096 $ (129 ) (11.8 )% Operating cost ratio 95.5 % 95.2 % 0.3 % Segment Earnings Healthcare Services segment earnings of $967 million for 2017 , a decrease of $129 million , or 11.8% , from 2016 primarily due to the impact of the optimization process associated with our chronic care management programs, as well as lower earnings in our provider services business reflecting lower Medicare rates year-over-year in geographies where our provider assets are primarily located. The reductions in pharmacy solutions intersegment revenues were offset by similar reductions in operating costs associated with the pharmacy solutions business. Script Volume Humana Pharmacy Solutions script volumes for the Retail and Group and Specialty segment membership increased to approximately 433 million in 2017 , up 2% versus scripts of approximately 426 million in 2016 . The increase primarily reflects growth associated with higher Medicare membership for 2017 than in 2016, partially offset by the decline in Individual Commercial membership. Services revenue Services revenue increased $28 million , or 9.0% , from 2016 to $338 million for 2017 primarily due to service revenue growth from our pharmacy solutions business. Intersegment revenues Intersegment revenues decreased $1.4 billion , or 5.6% , from 2016 to $23.6 billion for 2017 primarily due to care management programs discussed previously, as well as lower revenue in our provider services business reflecting lower Medicare rates year-over-year in geographies where our provider assets are primarily located. Our pharmacy solutions business revenues were impacted by improvements in net pharmacy costs driven by our pharmacy benefit manager and an increase in the generic dispensing rate. These items were partially offset by higher year-over-year script volume from growth in our Medicare Advantage and standalone PDP membership, partially offset by the impact of lower Individual Commercial membership. Our generic dispensing rate improved to 91.3% during 2017 from 90.5% during 2016. The higher generic dispensing rate 60 reduced revenues (and operating costs) for our pharmacy solutions business as generic drugs are generally priced lower than branded drugs. Operating costs The Healthcare Services segment operating cost ratio of 95.5% for 2017 was relatively unchanged from 95.2% for 2016. Individual Commercial Segment As announced on February 14, 2017, we exited our Individual Commercial medical business January 1, 2018. In 2017, our Individual Commercial segment pretax income was $193 million, an increase of $1.1 billion, from a pretax loss of $869 million in 2016 primarily due to the exit of certain markets in 2017, and per-member premium increases, as well as the reduction of premiums related to the write-off of receivables associated with the commercial risk corridor premium stabilization program. Individual commercial medical membership decreased 526,000 members, or 80.3%, from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 reflecting the decline in the number of counties we offered on-exchange coverage and the discontinuance of offering off-exchange products. The Individual Commercial segment benefit ratio of 57.4% for 2017 decreased from 107.7% in 2016 primarily due to the reduction of premiums related to the write-off of receivables associated with the commercial risk corridor premium stabilization program, as well as the planned exits in 2017 in certain markets that carried a higher benefit ratio and per-member premium increases. The Individual Commercial segment operating cost ratio of 21.2% for 2017 increased 160 basis points from 2016 primarily due to the loss of scale efficiency from market exits in 2017, partially offset by the write-off of receivables associated with the commercial risk corridor premium stabilization program and the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee for calendar year 2017. Other Businesses As previously disclosed, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we increased future policy benefits expense by approximately $505 million for reserve strengthening associated with our closed block of long-term care insurance policies. This increase primarily was driven by emerging experience indicating longer claims duration, a prolonged lower interest rate environment, and an increase in policyholder life expectancies as discussed further in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this 2018 Form 10-K. Liquidity Historically, our primary sources of cash have included receipts of premiums, services revenue, and investment and other income, as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, borrowings, and proceeds from sales of businesses. Our primary uses of cash historically have included disbursements for claims payments, operating costs, interest on borrowings, taxes, purchases of investment securities, acquisitions, capital expenditures, repayments on borrowings, dividends, and share repurchases. Because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months, our business normally should produce positive cash flows during periods of increasing premiums and enrollment. Conversely, cash flows would be negatively impacted during periods of decreasing premiums and enrollment. From period to period, our cash flows may also be affected by the timing of working capital items including premiums receivable, benefits payable, and other receivables and payables. Our cash flows are impacted by the timing of payments to and receipts from CMS associated with Medicare Part D subsidies for which we do not assume risk. The use of cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements of state departments of insurance (or comparable state regulators) which require, among other items, that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital and seek approval before paying dividends from the subsidiaries to the parent. Our use of cash flows derived from our non-insurance subsidiaries, such as in our Healthcare Services segment, is generally not restricted by state departments of insurance (or comparable state regulators). 61 For additional information on our liquidity risk, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors in this 2018 Form 10-K. Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $2.3 billion at December 31, 2018 from $4.0 billion at December 31, 2017 . The change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 is summarized as follows: 2018 2017 2016 (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,173 $ 4,051 $ 1,936 Net cash used in investing activities (3,087 ) (2,941 ) (1,362 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (785 ) (945 ) 732 (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,699 ) $ 165 $ 1,306 Cash Flow from Operating Activities The change in operating cash flows over the three year period primarily results from the corresponding change in the timing of working capital items, earnings, and enrollment activity as discussed below. The decrease in operating cash flows in 2018 primarily was due to the receipt of the merger termination fee in 2017, net of related expenses and taxes paid, funding the reinsurance of certain voluntary benefit and financial protection products to a third party in connection with the sale of KMG in 2018, and the timing of working capital items. The increase in operating cash flows in 2017 primarily was due to the receipt of the merger termination fee, net of related expenses and taxes paid, higher earnings and the timing of working capital items. The most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of payments of benefits expense and receipts for premiums. We illustrate these changes with the following summaries of benefits payable and receivables. 62 The detail of benefits payable was as follows at December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 : Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016 (in millions) IBNR (1) $ 3,361 $ 3,154 $ 3,422 $ 207 $ (268 ) $ (308 ) Reported claims in process (2) 617 614 654 3 (40 ) 54 Premium deficiency reserve (3) (176 ) Other benefits payable (4) 884 900 487 (16 ) 413 17 Total benefits payable $ 4,862 $ 4,668 $ 4,563 194 105 (413 ) Payables from disposition 58 Change in benefits payable per cash flow statement resulting in cash from operations $ 252 $ 105 $ (413 ) (1) IBNR represents an estimate of benefits payable for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) at the balance sheet date and includes unprocessed claim inventories. The level of IBNR is primarily impacted by membership levels, medical claim trends and the receipt cycle time, which represents the length of time between when a claim is initially incurred and when the claim form is received (i.e. a shorter time span results in a lower IBNR). (2) Reported claims in process represents the estimated valuation of processed claims that are in the post claim adjudication process, which consists of administrative functions such as audit and check batching and handling, as well as amounts owed to our pharmacy benefit administrator which fluctuate due to bi-weekly payments and the month-end cutoff. (3) Premium deficiency reserve recognized for our individual commercial medical business compliant with the Health Care Reform Law associated with the 2016 coverage year. (4) Other benefits payable include amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements. The increase in benefits payable in 2018 was primarily due to an increase in IBNR, mainly as a result of Medicare Advantage membership growth. The increase in benefits payable from 2016 to 2017 primarily was due to an increase in the amounts owed to providers under the capitated and risk sharing arrangements. This was partially offset by a decrease in IBNR primarily driven by declines in individual commercial medical membership in the 2017 period, partially offset by an increase in group Medicare Advantage membership. Benefits payable decreased in 2016 primarily due to a decrease in IBNR, as well as the application of 2016 results to the premium deficiency reserve liability recognized in 2015 associated with our individual commercial medical products compliant with the Health Care Reform Law for the 2016 coverage year. IBNR decreased during 2017 and 2016 primarily due to declines in individual and fully-insured group commercial membership. The decrease in IBNR during 2016 was also impacted by declines in group Medicare Advantage membership. 63 The detail of total net receivables was as follows at December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 : Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016 (in millions) Medicare $ 836 $ 511 $ 787 $ 325 $ (276 ) $ 101 Commercial and other 135 273 579 (138 ) (306 ) 39 Military services 123 166 32 (43 ) 134 (29 ) Allowance for doubtful accounts (79 ) (96 ) (118 ) 17 22 (3 ) Total net receivables $ 1,015 $ 854 $ 1,280 161 (426 ) 108 Reconciliation to cash flow statement: Provision for doubtful accounts 36 20 39 Change in receivables disposed from sale of business 3 11 Change in receivables per cash flow statement resulting in cash from operations $ 200 $ (406 ) $ 158 Medicare receivables are impacted by changes in revenue associated with individual and group Medicare membership changes as well as the timing of accruals and related collections associated with the CMS risk-adjustment model. The decrease in commercial and other receivables in 2018 as compared to 2017, as well as the decrease in 2017 as compared to 2016, was due primarily to a decrease in our receivable associated with the commercial risk adjustment provision of the Health Care Reform Law. This decrease corresponds with our exit from the Individual Commercial business. Military services receivables at December 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 primarily consist of administrative services only fees owed from the federal government for administrative services provided under our TRICARE contracts. The 2017 balance also includes transition-in receivables under our T2017 East Region contract collected in 2018. Many provisions of the Health Care Reform Law became effective in 2014, including the commercial risk adjustment, risk corridor, and reinsurance provisions as well as the non-deductible health insurance industry fee. The effect of the commercial risk adjustment, risk corridor, and reinsurance provisions of the Health Care Reform law, also known as the 3R's, has impacted our operating cash flows over the last three years, but more significantly in 2017 and 2016 as the temporary risk corridor and reinsurance program provisions phased out in 2016. The timing of payments and receipts associated with these provisions impacted our operating cash flows as we built receivables for each coverage year that were expected to be collected in subsequent coverage years. Net collections under the 3Rs associated with prior coverage years were $8 million in 2018, $440 million in 2017 and $383 million in 2016. The annual health insurance industry fee was suspended for the calendar year 2017, but resumed in calendar year 2018. The annual health insurance industry fee was also suspended for the calendar year 2019 and, under current law, is scheduled to resume in calendar year 2020. We paid the federal government annual health insurance industry fees of $1.04 billion in 2018 and $ 916 million in 2016 . In addition to the timing of payments of benefits expense, receipts for premiums and services revenues, and amounts due under the risk limiting and health insurance industry fee provisions of the Health Care Reform Law, other items impacting operating cash flows include income tax payments and the timing of payroll cycles. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our information technology initiatives, support of services in our provider services operations including medical and administrative facility improvements necessary for activities such as the provision of care to members, claims processing, billing and collections, wellness solutions, care 64 coordination, regulatory compliance and customer service. Total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were $612 million in 2018 , $524 million in 2017 , and $527 million in 2016 . In 2018, we completed the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary KMG to CGIC. Upon closing, we funded the transaction with approximately $190 million of parent company cash contributed into KMG, subject to customary adjustments, in addition to the transfer of approximately $160 million of statutory capital with the sale. Total cash and cash equivalents, including parent company funding, disposed at the time of sale, was $805 million. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data During 2018 we paid cash consideration of approximately $1.1 billion to acquire a 40% minority interest in Kindred at Home, $169 million to acquire the remaining interest in MCCI, and $185 million to acquire all of FPG, as discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows in investment securities, primarily investment-grade fixed income securities, totaling $221 million , $2.4 billion , and $828 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016 respectively. Cash Flow from Financing Activities Our financing cash flows are significantly impacted by the timing of claims payments and the related receipts from CMS associated with Medicare Part D claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk. Monthly prospective payments from CMS for reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid. Settlement of the reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year. Claims payments were $653 million higher than receipts from CMS associated with Medicare Part D claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk during 2018 . Receipts from CMS associated with Medicare Part D claims subsidies for which we do not assume risk were $1.9 billion higher than claims payments during 2017 and were $1.1 billion higher than claims payments during 2016. Our net payable for CMS subsidies and brand name prescription drug discounts was $331 million at December 31, 2018 compared to a net payable of $1.0 billion at December 31, 2017 . Under our administrative services only TRICARE contract, reimbursements from the federal government exceeded health care cost payments for which we do not assume risk by $38 million in 2018 and by $11 million in 2017 . Health care cost payments for which we do not assume risk exceeded reimbursements from the federal government by $25 million in 2016. Claims payments associated with cost sharing provisions of the Health Care Reform Law for which we do not assume risk were $25 million in 2018. There were no reimbursements from HHS in 2018. Claims payments associated with cost sharing provisions of the Health Care Reform Law for which we do not assume risk were higher than reimbursements from HHS by $44 million in 2017 and by $28 million in 2016. We repurchased common shares for $1.09 billion in 2018 and $3.37 billion in 2017 under share repurchase plans authorized by the Board of Directors and in connection with employee stock plans. We did not repurchase shares in 2016 due to restrictions under the Merger Agreement. As discussed further below, we paid dividends to stockholders of $265 million in 2018 , $220 million in 2017 , and $177 million in 2016 . We entered into a commercial paper program in October 2014. Net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper were $485 million in 2018 and the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during 2018 was $923 million . Net repayments of commercial paper were $153 million in 2017 and the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during 2017 was $500 million . Net repayments of commercial paper were $2 million in 2016 and the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during 2016 was $475 million . In December 2017, we issued $400 million of 2.50% senior notes due December 15, 2020 and $400 million of 2.90% senior notes due December 15, 2022. Our net proceeds, reduced for the underwriters' discount and commission and offering expenses paid as of December 31, 2017, were $794 million . We used the net proceeds, together with 65 available cash, to fund the redemption of our $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.30% senior notes maturing in August 2018 and our $500 million aggregate principal amount of 7.20% senior notes maturing in June 2018 at 100% of the principal amount plus applicable premium for early redemption and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, for cash totaling approximately $829 million . The remainder of the cash used in or provided by financing activities in 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 primarily resulted from proceeds from stock option exercises and the change in book overdraft. Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity Dividends For a detailed discussion of dividends to stockholders, please refer to Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Stock Repurchases For a detailed discussion of stock repurchases, please refer to Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Debt For a detailed discussion of our debt, including our senior notes, credit agreement and commercial paper program, please refer to Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Liquidity Requirements We believe our cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, and funds available under our credit agreement and our commercial paper program or from other public or private financing sources, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements, acquisitions, future expansion opportunities, and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months, as well as to refinance or repay debt, and repurchase shares. Adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future. Our investment-grade credit rating at December 31, 2018 was BBB+ according to Standard & Poor Rating Services, or S&P, and Baa3 according to Moody Investors Services, Inc., or Moody s. A downgrade by S&P to BB+ or by Moody to Ba1 triggers an interest rate increase of 25 basis points with respect to $250 million of our senior notes. Successive one notch downgrades increase the interest rate an additional 25 basis points, or annual interest expense by $1 million, up to a maximum 100 basis points, or annual interest expense by $3 million. In addition, we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry. Humana Inc., our parent company, is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries, most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions. We continue to maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our state-regulated operating subsidiaries. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at the parent company decreased to $578 million at December 31, 2018 from $688 million at December 31, 2017 . This decrease primarily reflects acquisitions, common stock repurchases, insurance subsidiaries' capital contributions and capital expenditures, partially offset by insurance subsidiaries dividends, non-insurance subsidiaries' profits and net proceeds from debt issuance. Our use of operating cash derived from our non-insurance subsidiaries, such as our Healthcare Services segment, is generally not restricted by Departments of Insurance (or comparable state regulatory agencies). Our regulated insurance subsidiaries paid dividends to the parent of $2.3 billion in 2018 , $1.4 billion in 2017 , and $0.8 billion in 2016 . Refer to our parent company financial statements and accompanying notes in Schedule I - Parent Company Financial Information. The amount of ordinary dividends that may be paid to our parent company in 2019 is approximately $1 billion , in the aggregate. Actual dividends paid may vary due to consideration of excess statutory 66 capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to, for example, premium volume and product mix. Regulatory Requirements For a detailed discussion of our regulatory requirements, including aggregate statutory capital and surplus as well as dividends paid from the subsidiaries to the parent, please refer to Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Contractual Obligations We are contractually obligated to make payments for years subsequent to December 31, 2018 as follows: Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years (in millions) Debt $ 6,097 $ 1,697 $ 400 $ 1,000 $ 3,000 Interest (1) 8,955 1,926 1,161 914 4,954 Operating leases (2) 519 147 210 112 50 Purchase obligations (3) 736 240 337 159 Future policy benefits payable and other long-term liabilities (4) 724 53 444 68 159 Total $ 17,031 $ 4,063 $ 2,552 $ 2,253 $ 8,163 (1) Interest includes the estimated contractual interest payments under our debt agreements. (2) We lease facilities, computer hardware, and other furniture and equipment under long-term operating leases that are noncancelable and expire on various dates through 2046 . We sublease facilities or partial facilities to third party tenants for space not used in our operations which partially mitigates our operating lease commitments. See also Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. (3) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase services, primarily information technology related services, or to make improvements to real estate, in each case that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum levels of service to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the appropriate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. (4) Includes future policy benefits payable ceded to third parties through 100% coinsurance agreements as more fully described in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We expect the assuming reinsurance carriers to fund these obligations and reflected these amounts as reinsurance recoverables included in other long-term assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Amounts payable in less than one year are included in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2018 , we were not involved in any special purpose entity, or SPE, transactions. For a detailed discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements, please refer to Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Guarantees and Indemnifications For a detailed discussion of our guarantees and indemnifications, please refer to Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 67 Government Contracts For a detailed discussion of our government contracts, including our Medicare, Military, and Medicaid contracts, please refer to Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies primarily related to benefits expense and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities, goodwill, and long-lived assets. These estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and, accordingly, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Benefits Expense Recognition Benefits expense is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported, or IBNR. IBNR represents a substantial portion of our benefits payable as follows: December 31, 2018 Percentage of Total December 31, 2017 Percentage of Total (dollars in millions) IBNR $ 3,361 69.1 % $ 3,154 67.6 % Reported claims in process 617 12.7 % 614 13.1 % Other benefits payable 884 18.2 % 900 19.3 % Total benefits payable $ 4,862 100.0 % $ 4,668 100.0 % Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards. For further discussion of our reserving methodology, including our use of completion and claims per member per month trend factors to estimate IBNR, refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 68 The completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the IBNR estimate. The portion of IBNR estimated using completion factors for claims incurred prior to the most recent two months is generally less variable than the portion of IBNR estimated using trend factors. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors assuming moderately adverse experience and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by reasonably likely changes in these factors based on December 31, 2018 data: Completion Factor (a): Claims Trend Factor (b): Factor Change (c) Decrease in Benefits Payable Factor Change (c) Decrease in Benefits Payable (dollars in millions) 0.70% $(258) (3.00)% $(224) 0.60% $(222) (2.75)% $(206) 0.50% $(185) (2.50)% $(187) 0.40% $(148) (2.25)% $(168) 0.30% $(111) (2.00)% $(150) 0.20% $(74) (1.75)% $(131) 0.10% $(37) (1.50)% $(112) (a) Reflects estimated potential changes in benefits payable at December 31, 2018 caused by changes in completion factors for incurred months prior to the most recent two months. (b) Reflects estimated potential changes in benefits payable at December 31, 2018 caused by changes in annualized claims trend used for the estimation of per member per month incurred claims for the most recent two months. (c) The factor change indicated represents the percentage point change. The following table provides a historical perspective regarding the accrual and payment of our benefits payable, excluding military services. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated benefits expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. Refer to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for Retail, Group and Specialty, and Individual Commercial segment tables including information about incurred and paid claims development as of December 31, 2018 , net of reinsurance, as well as cumulative claim frequency and the total of IBNR included within the net incurred claims amounts. 2018 2017 2016 (in millions) Balances at January 1 $ 4,668 $ 4,563 $ 4,976 Less: Premium deficiency reserve (176 ) Less: Reinsurance recoverables (70 ) (76 ) (85 ) Balances at January 1, net 4,598 4,487 4,715 Incurred related to: Current year 46,385 44,001 45,318 Prior years (503 ) (483 ) (582 ) Total incurred 45,882 43,518 44,736 Paid related to: Current year (41,736 ) (39,496 ) (40,852 ) Prior years (3,977 ) (3,911 ) (4,112 ) Total paid (45,713 ) (43,407 ) (44,964 ) Reinsurance recoverable 95 70 76 Balances at December 31 $ 4,862 $ 4,668 $ 4,563 69 The following table summarizes the changes in estimate for incurred claims related to prior years attributable to our key assumptions. As previously described, our key assumptions consist of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. The amounts below represent the difference between our original estimates and the actual benefits expense ultimately incurred as determined from subsequent claim payments. Favorable Development by Changes in Key Assumptions 2018 2017 2016 Amount Factor Change (a) Amount Factor Change (a) Amount Factor Change (a) (dollars in millions) Trend factors $ (229 ) (3.3 )% $ (279 ) (2.7 )% $ (316 ) (2.9 )% Completion factors (274 ) (0.8 )% (204 ) (0.7 )% (266 ) (0.9 )% Total $ (503 ) $ (483 ) $ (582 ) (a) The factor change indicated represents the percentage point change. As previously discussed, our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for claims. Actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience, which generally results in favorable reserve development, or reserves that are considered redundant. We experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of $503 million in 2018 , $483 million in 2017 , and $582 million in 2016 . The table below details our favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years by segment for 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 . Favorable Medical Claims Reserve Development Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 (in millions) Retail Segment $ (398 ) $ (386 ) $ (429 ) $ (12 ) $ 43 Group and Specialty Segment (46 ) (40 ) (46 ) (6 ) 6 Individual Commercial Segment (57 ) (56 ) (106 ) (1 ) 50 Other Businesses (2 ) (1 ) (1 ) (1 ) Total $ (503 ) $ (483 ) $ (582 ) $ (20 ) $ 99 The favorable medical claims reserve development for 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 primarily reflects the consistent application of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. Our favorable development for each of the years presented above is discussed further in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We continually adjust our historical trend and completion factor experience with our knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends and completion factors when establishing our reserves. Because our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions as required by actuarial standards, there is a reasonable possibility that variances between actual trend and completion factors and those assumed in our December 31, 2018 estimates would fall towards the middle of the ranges previously presented in our sensitivity table. 70 Benefits expense excluded from the previous table was as follows for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 : 2018 2017 2016 (in millions) Premium deficiency reserve for short-duration policies $ $ $ (176 ) Military services 8 Future policy benefits (22 ) 439 Total $ $ (22 ) $ 271 In 2016, we increased our existing premium deficiency reserve, initially recorded in 2015, for our individual commercial medical business compliant with the Health Care Reform Law associated with the 2016 coverage year. The higher benefits expense associated with future policy benefits payable during 2016 primarily relates to reserve strengthening for our closed block of long-term care insurance policies, which were sold in 2018, as more fully described below and in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Revenue Recognition We generally establish one-year commercial membership contracts with employer groups, subject to cancellation by the employer group on 30-day written notice. Our Medicare contracts with CMS renew annually. Our military services contracts with the federal government and certain contracts with various state Medicaid programs generally are multi-year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions. We receive monthly premiums from the federal government and various states according to government specified payment rates and various contractual terms. We bill and collect premium from employer groups and members in our Medicare and other individual products monthly. Changes in premium revenues resulting from the periodic changes in risk-adjustment scores derived from medical diagnoses for our membership are estimated by projecting the ultimate annual premium and recognized ratably during the year with adjustments each period to reflect changes in the ultimate premium. Premiums revenue is estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates. Premiums revenue is recognized as income in the period members are entitled to receive services, and is net of estimated uncollectible amounts, retroactive membership adjustments, and adjustments to recognize rebates under the minimum benefit ratios required under the Health Care Reform Law. We estimate policyholder rebates by projecting calendar year minimum benefit ratios for the small group and large group markets, as defined by the Health Care Reform Law using a methodology prescribed by HHS, separately by state and legal entity. Medicare Advantage products are also subject to minimum benefit ratio requirements under the Health Care Reform Law. Estimated calendar year rebates recognized ratably during the year are revised each period to reflect current experience. Retroactive membership adjustments result from enrollment changes not yet processed, or not yet reported by an employer group or the government. We routinely monitor the collectibility of specific accounts, the aging of receivables, historical retroactivity trends, estimated rebates, as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions, and reflect any required adjustments in current operations. Premiums received prior to the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. Medicare Risk-Adjustment Provisions CMS utilizes a risk-adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to Medicare Advantage, or MA, plans according to health severity. The risk-adjustment model, which CMS implemented pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997(BBA) and the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA), generally pays more for enrollees with predictably higher costs. Under the risk-adjustment methodology, all MA plans must collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, and physician providers to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The CMS risk-adjustment model uses this diagnosis data to calculate the risk-adjusted premium payment to MA plans. Rates paid to MA plans are established under an actuarial bid model, including a process that bases our payments on a comparison of our beneficiaries risk scores, derived from medical diagnoses, to those 71 enrolled in the government Medicare FFS program. We generally rely on providers, including certain providers in our network who are our employees, to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses, which we send to CMS as the basis for our payment received from CMS under the actuarial risk-adjustment model. We also rely on providers to appropriately document all medical data, including the diagnosis data submitted with claims. CMS is phasing-in the process of calculating risk scores using diagnoses data from the Risk Adjustment Processing System, or RAPS, to diagnoses data from the Encounter Data System, or EDS. The RAPS process requires MA plans to apply a filter logic based on CMS guidelines and only submit diagnoses that satisfy those guidelines. For submissions through EDS, CMS requires MA plans to submit all the encounter data and CMS will apply the risk adjustment filtering logic to determine the risk scores. For 2018, 15% of the risk score was calculated from claims data submitted through EDS. In 2019 and 2020 CMS will increase that percentage to 25% and 50%, respectively. The phase-in from RAPS to EDS could result in different risk scores from each dataset as a result of plan processing issues, CMS processing issues, or filtering logic differences between RAPS and EDS, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. We estimate risk-adjustment revenues based on medical diagnoses for our membership. The risk-adjustment model, including CMS changes to the submission process, is more fully described in Item 1. Business under the section titled Individual Medicare, and in Item 1A. - Risk Factors. 72 Investment Securities Investment securities totaled $10.4 billion , or 41% of total assets at December 31, 2018 , and $12.3 billion , or 45% of total assets at December 31, 2017 . Debt securities, detailed below, comprised this entire investment portfolio at December 31, 2018 and 2017 . The fair value of debt securities were as follows at December 31, 2018 and 2017 : 12/31/2018 Percentage of Total 12/31/2017 Percentage of Total (dollars in millions) U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government corporations and agencies: U.S. Treasury and agency obligations $ 417 4.0 % $ 531 4.3 % Mortgage-backed securities 2,544 24.4 % 1,610 13.1 % Tax-exempt municipal securities 2,771 26.5 % 3,889 31.6 % Mortgage-backed securities: Residential 55 0.5 % 26 0.2 % Commercial 523 5.0 % 456 3.7 % Asset-backed securities 985 9.4 % 408 3.3 % Corporate debt securities 3,142 30.2 % 5,382 43.8 % Total debt securities $ 10,437 100.0 % $ 12,302 100.0 % Approximately 97% of our debt securities were investment-grade quality, with a weighted average credit rating of AA by S&P at December 31, 2018 . Most of the debt securities that were below investment-grade were rated BB , the higher end of the below investment-grade rating scale. Our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types. Tax-exempt municipal securities included pre-refunded bonds of $118 million at December 31, 2018 and $222 million at December 31, 2017 . These pre-refunded bonds were secured by an escrow fund consisting of U.S. government obligations sufficient to pay off all amounts outstanding at maturity. The ratings of these pre-refunded bonds generally assume the rating of the government obligations at the time the fund is established. Tax-exempt municipal securities that were not pre-refunded were diversified among general obligation bonds of U.S. states and local municipalities as well as special revenue bonds. General obligation bonds, which are backed by the taxing power and full faith of the issuer, accounted for $1.4 billion of these municipals in the portfolio. Special revenue bonds, issued by a municipality to finance a specific public works project such as utilities, water and sewer, transportation, or education, and supported by the revenues of that project, accounted for $1.3 billion of these municipals. Our general obligation bonds are diversified across the U.S. with no individual state exceeding 9% . 73 Gross unrealized losses and fair values aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows at December 31, 2018 : Less than 12 months 12 months or more Total Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses (in millions) December 31, 2018 U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government corporations and agencies: U.S. Treasury and agency obligations $ 179 $ (1 ) $ 153 $ (2 ) $ 332 $ (3 ) Mortgage-backed securities 956 (16 ) 1,019 (38 ) 1,975 (54 ) Tax-exempt municipal securities 809 (9 ) 1,648 (28 ) 2,457 (37 ) Mortgage-backed securities: Residential 15 15 Commercial 372 (8 ) 133 (6 ) 505 (14 ) Asset-backed securities 824 (7 ) 40 864 (7 ) Corporate debt securities 1,434 (35 ) 1,439 (63 ) 2,873 (98 ) Total debt securities $ 4,574 $ (76 ) $ 4,447 $ (137 ) $ 9,021 $ (213 ) Under the other-than-temporary impairment model for debt securities held, we recognize an impairment loss in income in an amount equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value when we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis. However, if we do not intend to sell the debt security, we evaluate the expected cash flows to be received as compared to amortized cost and determine if a credit loss has occurred. In the event of a credit loss, only the amount of the impairment associated with the credit loss is recognized currently in income with the remainder of the loss recognized in other comprehensive income. When we do not intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position, potential other-than-temporary impairment is considered using a variety of factors, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security; payment structure of the security; changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies; the volatility of the fair value changes; and changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date. For debt securities, we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data. For example, with respect to mortgage and asset-backed securities, such data includes underlying loan level data and structural features such as seniority and other forms of credit enhancements. A decline in fair value is considered other-than-temporary when we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. We estimate the amount of the credit loss component of a debt security as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows of the security. The present value is determined using the best estimate of future cash flows discounted at the implicit interest rate at the date of purchase. The risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations, facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time, or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment. The determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment. The discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments. The status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment. There is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or other-than-temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods. 74 All issuers of securities we own that were trading at an unrealized loss at December 31, 2018 remain current on all contractual payments. After taking into account these and other factors previously described, we believe these unrealized losses primarily were caused by an increase in market interest rates in the current markets since the time the securities were purchased. At December 31, 2018 , we did not intend to sell the securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income, and it is not likely that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. As a result, we believe that the securities with an unrealized loss were not other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2018 . There were no material other-than-temporary impairments in 2018 , 2017 , or 2016 . Goodwill and Long-lived Assets At December 31, 2018 , goodwill and other long-lived assets represented 23% of total assets and 58% of total stockholders equity, compared to 19% and 52% , respectively, at December 31, 2017 with the increase due to our 2018 acquisitions. We are required to test at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit, and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. A reporting unit either is our operating segments or one level below the operating segments, referred to as a component, which comprise our reportable segments. A component is considered a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by management. We are required to aggregate the components of an operating segment into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition. We use the one-step process to review goodwill for impairment to determine both the existence and amount of goodwill impairment, if any. Our strategy, long-range business plan, and annual planning process support our goodwill impairment tests. These tests are performed, at a minimum, annually in the fourth quarter, and are based on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows. We rely on this discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair value. However outcomes from the discounted cash flow analysis are compared to other market approach valuation methodologies for reasonableness. We use discount rates that correspond to a market-based weighted-average cost of capital and terminal growth rates that correspond to long-term growth prospects, consistent with the long-term inflation rate. Key assumptions in our cash flow projections, including changes in membership, premium yields, medical and operating cost trends, and certain government contract extensions, are consistent with those utilized in our long-range business plan and annual planning process. If these assumptions differ from actual, including the impact of the Health Care Reform Law or changes in Government rates, the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected. Goodwill impairment tests completed in each of the last three years did not result in an impairment loss. The fair value of our reporting units with significant goodwill exceeded carrying amounts by a substantial margin. A 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would not have a significant impact on the amount of margin for any of our reporting units with significant goodwill, with the exception of our clinical and provider reporting units in our Healthcare Services segment. The margin on the clinical reporting unit would decline to less than 10% after factoring in a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate. The provider reporting unit, while not falling beneath this threshold, was closer than any of our other reporting units. The clinical and provider reporting units account for $524 million and $730 million, respectively, of goodwill. Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets. These assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life, and are subject to impairment reviews. We periodically review long-lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. In assessing recoverability, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist, and, if so, estimate fair value. We also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our long-lived assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life, including accelerating depreciation or amortization for these assets. There were no material impairment losses in the last three years. 75
