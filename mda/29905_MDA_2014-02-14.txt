ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition for the three years ended December 31, 2013 . The MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, particularly in Item 1A. Risk Factors and in the Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements preceding Part I of this Form 10-K. OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK Dover is a diversified global manufacturer focusing on innovative equipment and components, specialty systems, and support services provided through its four major operating segments: Energy, Engineered Systems, Printing & Identification, and Communication Technologies. The Company's entrepreneurial business model encourages, promotes, and fosters deep customer engagement, which has led to Dover's well-established and valued reputation for providing superior customer service and industry-leading product innovation. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references herein to Dover, the Company, and words such as we, us, and our include Dover Corporation and its subsidiaries. Our Energy segment provides highly-engineered solutions for the safe and efficient extraction and handling of oil and gas in the production, downstream and drilling markets. Our Engineered Systems segment is comprised of two platforms, Refrigeration & Industrial and Fluid Solutions, which are industry leaders in the refrigeration and food equipment, certain other industrial markets and fluids systems. Our Printing & Identification segment provides integrated printing, coding, and dispensing solutions for the fast moving consumer goods and industrial markets. Our Communication Technologies segment is engaged in the design and manufacture of innovative products and components in the consumer electronics, aerospace/defense, medical technology and telecommunication/other markets. We delivered solid growth during 2013, as our consolidated revenue increased 7.7%, representing organic growth of 2.9% and acquisition-related growth of 4.8%. The impact from foreign currency translation was negligible. Gross profit increased $232.7 million, or 7.5%, to $3.3 billion. We saw momentum in the second half of the year, as broad-based order and shipment activity was particularly strong at our businesses serving the refrigeration and food equipment, fast moving consumer goods, fluids, drilling and downstream energy markets. In the consumer electronics market, revenue growth was due to increased microelectronic mechanical ( MEMs ) microphone volumes resulting from new OEM product introductions and overall smartphone market growth. This growth was offset in part by the continued market decline of two OEM customers, principally affecting our speaker and receiver volumes. Overall, productivity initiatives and the leveraging of higher volumes, more than offset normal pricing concessions. For further discussion related to our consolidated and segment results, see "Consolidated Results of Operations" and "Segment Results of Operations", respectively, within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Bookings increased 8.2% over the prior year to $8.7 billion, representing growth across all segments, with strong growth of 12.7% in Engineered Systems, and increases of 5.9% in Communications Technologies, 5.5% in Energy and 2.4% in Printing & Identification. Overall, the book-to-bill of 1.00 slightly improved over the prior year. Backlog increased 4.6% to $1.6 billion. From a geographic perspective for the year, our North American markets were solid. Our European markets continued to show improvement throughout the year with incremental growth, driven by our short cycle business activity, complemented by project shipments. China and the rest of the world markets were strong. On May 23, 2013, Dover announced its Board of Directors approved a preliminary plan to spin-off certain of its communication technologies businesses into a stand-alone, publicly-traded company known as Knowles Corporation ("Knowles"). On February 6, 2014, Dover announced that its Board of Directors approved the separation of Knowles from Dover through the pro rata distribution by Dover of 100% of the common stock of Knowles to Dover's stockholders on February 28, 2014. In addition, on February 10, 2014, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission declared Knowles' Registration Statement on Form 10 effective. As a result, the following is expected to occur: (1) the distribution of Knowles' shares would be made on February 28, 2014 to Dover stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 19, 2014, the record date for the distribution, (2) on the distribution date, Dover stockholders will receive one share of Knowles common stock for every two shares of Dover 26 Table of Contents common stock held as of the record date, and (3) following the distribution, Knowles will be an independent, publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange (utilizing ticker symbol "KN") and Dover will retain no ownership interest in Knowles. The distribution has been structured to be tax-free to Dover and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The results of operations, financial condition and cash flows for the businesses to be transferred to Knowles and included in the spin-off are, and will continue to be, presented within Dover's consolidated financial statements as continuing operations within the Communication Technologies segment until the spin-off is complete (which is expected to occur on February 28, 2014), upon which the financial presentation of these businesses will be included within Dover's discontinued operations. One-time costs associated with the transaction are expected to be in the range of $60.0 to $70.0 million, of which $30.1 million has been incurred by Dover through December 31, 2013. Following the spin-off of Knowles, Dover expects to align its segment structure to ensure it is properly organized to execute its future growth plans. As previously disclosed, in the fourth quarter of 2012 in connection with our periodic review for our businesses' strategic fit within Dover, we announced our intention to divest DEK International and Everett Charles Technologies (including the Multitest business, collectively "ECT") within the Printing & Identification segment. These businesses were reclassified to discontinued operations, and in 2013, we recorded a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $54.5 million, as well as a $25.5 million tax benefit in the discontinued operations deferred income tax provision for 2013. The Company completed the sale of ECT in the fourth quarter of 2013 for total proceeds of $92.7 million, which resulted in an after-tax loss on sale of $2.8 million. In 2013, the Company signed a definitive agreement to sell DEK. Based on the anticipated proceeds from this sale, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $14.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Management intends to complete the sale of DEK in the first half of 2014. Other actions that we undertook in order to strengthen our position in 2014 and beyond included raising 300.0 million in the Euro debt market in 2013. Some of the proceeds were used to repay commercial paper of approximately $381.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. In addition, we expanded our competitive position with ten business acquisitions during the year for net cash consideration of approximately $323.0 million, notably in the fluids and downstream energy spaces. Dover expects additional acquisitions to be closed in the first quarter of 2014. Under our November 2012 $1.0 billion share repurchase program, we repurchased 6.0 million shares during the year for a total of $457.3 million. There is $292.6 million remaining under this program, and we expect to complete the balance of this program in the first quarter of 2014. In addition, we continued our history of increasing our annual dividend payments to shareholders by paying $247.8 million in dividends in 2013. Regarding our business activity, near term we expect: continued positive performance in Energy driven by expanding international activity, and the ongoing improvement in drilling; strong results in our Fluids markets from the benefits of our recent acquisitions and positive markets; solid results in our refrigeration and food equipment markets; and normal seasonality in our fast moving consumer goods markets. If global or domestic economic conditions accelerate or deteriorate, our operating results for 2014 could be materially different than currently projected. 27 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS As discussed in Note 4. Disposed and Discontinued Operations to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, in the fourth quarter of 2012, we reclassified certain businesses in the Printing & Identification segment to discontinued operations based on our decision to divest these businesses. The results of operations of these businesses have been removed from the results of continuing operations and are presented within results of discontinued operations for all periods presented.

The impact from foreign currency translation was negligible. Increased volume in 2013 across all segments drove a revenue increase of 3.0% as compared to 2012. We saw momentum in the second half of the year, as broad-based order and shipment activity was particularly strong at our businesses serving the refrigeration and food equipment, fast moving consumer goods, fluids, drilling and downstream energy markets. In the consumer electronics market, revenue growth was due to increased microelectronic mechanical ( MEMs ) microphone volumes resulting from new OEM product introductions and overall smartphone market growth. This growth was offset in part by the continued market decline of two OEM customers, principally affecting our speaker and receiver volumes. Overall, productivity initiatives and the leveraging of higher volumes, more than offset normal pricing concessions. The majority of the 4.8% acquisition-related revenue growth in 2013 as compared to the prior year was generated from acquisitions made in the second half of 2012 and the first half of 2013 within our Engineered Systems and Energy segments, including Anthony International, Power Soak, Ebsray Pumps, The Curotto-Can, Inc. and UPCO, Inc. These acquisitions accounted for approximately 80.0% of acquisition-related revenue growth as compared to the prior year. Our 2012 consolidated revenue increased 10.0% to $8.1 billion compared with 2011 , reflecting organic growth of 5.5%, growth from acquisitions of 5.8% and an unfavorable impact from currency translation of 1.3%. All four of our segments generated 2013 organic revenue growth, with the majority attributed to volume increases driven by strength in the energy, handset, refrigeration and food equipment, and many of the other industrial markets served by our Engineered Systems segment. Approximately 3.0% of our growth was generated by new products, particularly in our Communication Technologies segment, and geographic market expansion in our Energy segment. Pricing had a negligible impact to 2012 revenue, as price increases implemented to offset higher commodity costs, were partly offset by lower strategic pricing initiatives. Revenues generated outside of the U.S. increased by 9.0% compared with 2011, with growth in Canada and Asia offsetting weakness in Europe. Over 80.0% of the 2012 revenue growth from acquisitions was generated by Sound Solutions, Maag Pump Systems, and Production Control Services, three of our more significant recent acquisitions made in the second half of 2011 and first half of 2012. Gross Profit Our gross profit increased $ 232.7 million , or 7.5% , in 2013 compared with 2012 , reflecting the benefit of increased sales volumes, favorable net material costs, and benefits from productivity initiatives. The benefit from these factors were partly offset with higher depreciation and amortization expense of $52.2 million and higher restructuring costs of $8.2 million. Gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue remained at 38.3% year over year, with the operating leverage achieved by the higher volumes being offset by the impact of normal pricing concessions, business mix and higher labor costs across all segments. Our gross profit increased $262.3 million or 9.2% in 2012 compared with 2011 , reflecting the benefit of increased sales volumes, favorable net material costs, and benefits from productivity initiatives. Gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue contracted 30 basis points in 2012 to 38.3% from 38.6% in 2011 with the reduction in large part due to the integration of Sound Solutions, which generated lower than anticipated revenue in 2012, more than offsetting the operating leverage achieved by our other businesses. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased $ 144.2 million , or 7.8% , in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to general increases across the segments in support of higher volumes. The current year expense also included $30.1 million in one-time transaction costs related to the spin-off of Knowles and higher depreciation and amortization expense of $11.8 million. These expenses were partially offset by a $6.8 million gain associated with the sale of land in Switzerland in the first quarter of 2013 and a one-time pension curtailment gain of $4.4 million recognized in the third quarter of 2013 as a result of the Company's announcement to freeze future service benefits for the U.S. benefit plans after January 1, 2024. As a percentage of revenue, selling and administrative expenses remained constant at 22.7% , as the higher acquisition-related depreciation and amortization was more than offset by the leveraging of higher revenue volumes. 29 Table of Contents Selling and administrative expenses increased $120.7 million or 7.0% in 2012 compared with 2011 due primarily to general increases across the segments in support of higher volumes. As a percentage of revenue, selling and administrative expenses decreased to 22.7% in 2012 compared with 23.4% in 2011 . This 70 basis point improvement is largely a result of leverage from the higher revenue levels, which more than offset higher acquisition-related amortization and increased restructuring charges. Non-Operating Items Interest expense, net, decreased $0.4 million , or 0.3% , to $120.7 million in 2013 primarily due to lower average levels of cash on hand at reduced interest rates, which offset higher interest expense related to the euro-denominated debt issued in the fourth quarter of 2013. In 2012 , our interest expense, net, increased 4.9% to $121.1 million due primarily to lower average levels of cash on hand at reduced interest rates, leading to $4.4 million less of interest income in 2012 as compared with 2011. Other expense (income), net in 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 includes $6.1 million, $9.5 million, and $7.5 million, respectively, of net foreign exchange losses resulting from the remeasurement and settlement of foreign currency denominated balances. The 2013 net foreign exchange losses are more than offset by other nonrecurring items, including approximately $7.4 million related to insurance settlements for property damage, as well as several other miscellaneous items, none of which were individually significant. Other expense (income), net in 2012 and 2011 included royalty income and other miscellaneous non-operating gains and losses, none of which are individually significant. Income Taxes We operate globally, and 37.3% , 38.4% , and 42.9% of our pre-tax earnings in 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , respectively, were generated in foreign jurisdictions, where such earnings are generally subject to local country tax rates that are well below the 35.0% U.S. statutory rate. We also benefit from tax holidays and incentives in a number of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. As a result, our blended effective foreign or non-U.S. tax rate is typically significantly lower than the U.S. statutory rate. The 2013 effective tax rate on continuing operations was 21.9% compared to the 2012 rate of 26.8% . The 2013 rate was impacted by $77.0 million of favorable net discrete items, principally related to the conclusion of certain U.S. federal, state and international tax audits, a favorable court interpretation of tax law, certain cross-border tax consequences and the effect of the American Tax Relief Act of 2012 signed into law on January 2, 2013. The 2012 effective tax rate was impacted by other favorable net discrete items totaling $16.1 million, principally related to settlements with U.S. federal and state taxing authorities. After adjusting for discrete items, the effective tax rates were 28.2% for both 2013 and 2012 . We believe it is reasonably possible during the next twelve months that uncertain tax positions may be settled, which could result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits. This decrease may result in an income tax benefit. Due to the potential for resolution of federal, state, and foreign examinations, and the expiration of various statutes of limitation, our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months by a range of zero to $37.2 million. Some portion of such change may be reported as discontinued operations. We believe adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties. The 2011 effective tax rate on continuing operations was 23.5% . The effective tax rate in 2011 was favorably impacted by net discrete and other items totaling $40.7 million, arising principally from settlements with the U.S. federal and state taxing authorities. After adjusting for discrete and other items, the effective tax rate for 2011 was 27.5%. Earnings from Continuing Operations Earnings from continuing operations increased 15.9% to $965.8 million , or $5.57 diluted earnings per share ("EPS") in 2013 , compared with earnings from continuing operations of $833.1 million , or $4.53 EPS, in 2012 . The increase in 2013 earnings from continuing operations is primarily the result of higher revenues and benefits from productivity and cost containment initiatives, offset in part by higher labor costs across all segments, as well as higher acquisition-related expenses, including depreciation and amortization. The EPS increase reflects the increase in earnings, as well as the impact of lower weighted average shares outstanding for the 2013 period relative to 2012. 30 Table of Contents Earnings from continuing operations increased 7.8% to $833.1 million , or $4.53 EPS in 2012 , compared with earnings from continuing operations of $773.2 million , or $4.09 EPS, in 2011 . The increase in 2012 earnings from continuing operations is primarily the result of higher revenues and benefits from productivity and cost containment initiatives, offset in part by higher acquisition-related expenses and increased restructuring charges relative to 2011. The EPS increase reflects the increase in earnings, as well as the impact of lower weighted average shares outstanding for the 2012 period relative to 2011. Further, we repurchased incrementally more common shares in 2012 as compared to 2011. Discontinued Operations Management evaluates Dover's businesses periodically for their strategic fit within Dover's operations. Accordingly, in 2012, the Company announced its intention to divest DEK International and Everett Charles Technologies (including the Multitest business, collectively "ECT") within the Printing & Identification segment, which serve the electronic assembly and test markets. These businesses were reclassified to discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2012. The Company completed the sale of ECT in the fourth quarter of 2013 for total proceeds of $92.7 million. Additionally, in 2013, the Company signed a definitive agreement to sell DEK. Management plans to complete the sale of this business in the first half of 2014. Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the year ended December 31, 2013 totaled $37.3 million, which included a loss on sale of ECT, including impairments, of $35.5 million, net of tax, earnings from operations of the aforementioned businesses prior to sale of $17.9 million before tax, and an income tax benefit of $54.9 million. One-time impairment charges netting to $35.5 million included the following: a $2.8 million loss on the sale of ECT; a $44.2 million goodwill impairment charge resulting from the write-down of the carrying value to fair value, based on the current estimated sales price of ECT; a benefit of $25.5 million to the deferred income tax provision as a result of the elimination of certain deferred tax liabilities; and a $14.0 million impairment loss related to the expected proceeds for the anticipated sale of DEK, of which approximately $9.2 million represented a goodwill impairment charge, of which none is taxable. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the year ended December 31, 2012 totaled $22.0 million. Net earnings from operations of $28.8 million reflects net earnings from operations generated by these two businesses, as well as various expense and accrual adjustments relating to other discontinued operations. This activity was more than offset by a goodwill impairment charge determined in connection with the anticipated sale of ECT, at which time the Company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $63.8 million ( $51.9 million after tax), representing a write-down of the reporting unit's carrying value of goodwill to its fair value. Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the year ended December 31, 2011 totaled $122.1 million. In 2011, the Company sold three businesses, Paladin Brands, Crenlo LLC, and Heil Trailer International, that had operated within the Engineered Systems segment for total cash proceeds of $512.1 million. These businesses were reclassified to discontinued operations in the third and fourth quarters of 2011. The 2011 earnings from discontinued operations reflects net operating earnings generated by the two businesses discontinued in 2012 and the three business sold in 2011, coupled with tax benefits of $18.0 million relating primarily to discrete tax items settled or resolved during the year. Earnings from discontinued operations also includes a $4.7 million loss on the 2011 sale of the three businesses, inclusive of an after-tax goodwill impairment charge of $76.1 million, representing a write-down of the carrying value of the associated reporting unit's goodwill to its fair value. Refer to Note 4. Disposed and Discontinued Operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on disposed and discontinued operations. Restructuring Activities 2013 Restructuring Activities The Company incurred restructuring charges during 2013 totaling $25.9 million related to these programs, as follows: The Energy segment incurred a net restructuring benefit of $0.7 million , including a net gain on sale of three buildings, relating to facility consolidations within the production sector undertaken to optimize cost structure. The Engineered Systems segment incurred net restructuring charges of $6.6 million in connection with certain facility consolidations and optimizations and headcount reductions undertaken to optimize its cost structure. 31 Table of Contents The Printing & Identification segment incurred restructuring charges of $3.8 million relating to exit plans at targeted facilities, which included certain adjustments and offsets to previously recorded reserves. The Communication Technologies segment incurred restructuring charges of $16.3 million related principally to a facility consolidation in its capacitor business and headcount reductions in connection with integration activities within its consumer electronic business. We expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $5.0 million to $15.0 million in 2014 in connection with the above-mentioned projects, as well as certain other programs to be initiated during the year to rationalize headcount and optimize operations in a few select businesses. We anticipate that much of the benefit of the 2013 and 2014 programs will be realized over the remainder of 2014 and into 2015. We also expect to fund the remainder of the 2013 programs currently underway, as well those commenced in 2014 , over the next 12 to 18 months. In light of the economic uncertainty in certain of our end markets and our continued focus on improving our operating efficiency, it is possible that additional programs may be implemented throughout the remainder of 2014 . 2012 Restructuring Activities During 2012, we initiated restructuring actions relating to ongoing cost reduction efforts, including targeted facility consolidations and headcount reductions at certain businesses. As a result, in 2012, we incurred restructuring charges totaling $19.4 million related to these programs, as follows: The Energy segment incurred restructuring charges of $0.7 million, primarily representing costs for the integration of recent acquisitions and minor headcount reductions. The Engineered Systems segment incurred restructuring charges of $7.5 million, mainly relating to facility consolidations and other headcount reduction programs undertaken to optimize its cost structure. The Printing & Identification segment incurred restructuring charges of $5.7 million, principally relating to rationalization of global headcount within its marking and coding businesses to better align its footprint with present market conditions. The Communication Technologies segment incurred restructuring charges of $5.5 million, primarily relating to a facility consolidation and related headcount reductions within its operations that serve the telecom infrastructure market to better reflect the current market dynamics, along with headcount reductions undertaken to facilitate management changes and optimize the cost structure of its businesses serving the consumer electronics market. Restructuring initiatives in 2011 were limited to a few targeted facility consolidations. We incurred restructuring charges of $5.6 million relating to such activities. See Note 9. Restructuring Activities in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details regarding our recent restructuring activities. 32 Table of Contents SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of each of our four reportable operating segments (Energy, Engineered Systems, Printing & Identification, and Communication Technologies). Each of these segments is comprised of various product and service offerings that serve multiple end markets. See Note 17. Segment Information in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a reconciliation of segment revenue, earnings, and operating margin to our consolidated revenue, earnings from continuing operations, and operating margin. Segment EBITDA and segment EBITDA margin, which are presented in the segment discussion that follows, are non-GAAP measures and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income as a measure of operating performance. We believe that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors. For further information, see the Non-GAAP Disclosures at the end of this Item 7. Energy Our Energy segment serves the oil, gas and power generation industries, with products that promote the efficient and cost-effective drilling, extraction, storage and movement of oil and gas products, or constitute critical components for power generation equipment. The Energy segment operates through the following business lines: Production, which comprises products and components facilitating the extraction and movement of fuel from the ground; Downstream, which comprises systems and products that support the efficient, safe, and environmentally-sensitive handling of fuel, hazardous liquids, and dry-bulk commodities; and Drilling, which comprises products supporting the cost-effective drilling of oil and gas wells.

Acquisition-related growth was driven by the following: the Production Control Services and Upco, Inc., acquisitions that occurred in the second and fourth quarters of 2012; Klaus Enterprise, Ltd., and SPIRIT Global Energy Solutions that occurred in the second and third quarters of 2013; and Fibresec Holdings Ltd., Kungsors Plast AB (KPS) and Lianyungang Jump Equipment Co., Ltd. acquisitions that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2013. Production revenue (representing 53.5% of 2013 segment revenue) increased $45.5 million, or 3.8%, with 5.0% growth from acquisitions, partially offset by a 1.0% decline in organic revenue. Increased demand for artificial lift products, particularly outside North America and Europe, contributed to the increase in revenue, as well as the impact from recent acquisitions, while softer demand for winch products for the energy and recovery markets drove a partially offsetting decline in revenue. Downstream revenue (representing 28.0% of 2013 segment revenue) increased $62.0 million, or 10.7%, due to stronger demand for loading equipment and fuel delivery systems for the transportation and chemical/industrial markets. Drilling revenue (representing 18.5% of 2013 segment revenue) increased approximately $16.3 million, or 4.0% , compared to 2012 due to market share gains and expansion in international growth, especially within China. Energy earnings in 2013 increased $14.2 million , or 2.6% , primarily due to higher volume in the production and downstream sectors. Operating margin decreased 70 basis points due to unfavorable product mix and higher acquisition-related depreciation and amortization. Bookings for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased 5.5% compared to 2012 primarily due to strong international growth, offset in part by softer demand for winch products in the Production sector. Backlog at December 31, 2013 remained relatively stable as compared to the prior year, decreasing 0.5% . 2012 Versus 2011 Revenue generated by our Energy segment increased $271.9 million , or 14.3% , compared with 2011 . The increase was driven by organic revenue growth of 9.4% , growth from the acquisitions of Production Control Services (in April 2012) and Oil Lift (in September 2011) totaling 5.3% , and a negligible impact from foreign currency translation. Pricing actions, mainly in response to increased raw material costs, represented approximately 2.0% of the revenue increase. Production revenue (representing 54.4% of 2012 segment revenue) increased by $213.0 million , or 22.0% , with 12.0% due to organic growth and 10.0% from acquisitions. Organic growth was driven by an increased number of active U.S. oil wells and wells with natural gas liquids driving demand for artificial lift products, higher international sales, and increased demand for compressor related products and winch products serving the infrastructure and recovery markets. Downstream revenue (representing 26.8% of 2012 segment revenue) increased by $50.5 million, or 9.5%, reflecting increased demand for loading equipment for the rail, cargo tank and chemical/industrial markets, bearing products serving energy markets, and fuel delivery systems. Drilling revenue (representing 18.8% of 2012 segment revenue) increased by $8.3 million , or 2.1% , due to an essentially flat level of drilling activity compared to 2011, which moderated demand for the segment's drilling products. Our revenues in the drilling sector, and to a smaller extent in the production sector, are impacted by changes in the number of active North American drilling rigs. In 2012, the average North American drilling rig count declined 1.0% compared to the prior year. We expect the North American rig count growth to turn positive in the second half of 2013. Energy earnings increased $88.0 million , or 19.5% , primarily resulting from higher volume in the production and downstream sectors. Operating margin increased 110 basis points compared to the prior year due to improved operating leverage associated with higher volumes, strategic pricing, and productivity gains, which more than offset the impact of unfavorable product mix and higher acquisition-related depreciation and amortization. 34 Table of Contents Engineered Systems Our Engineered Systems segment is comprised of two platforms, Refrigeration & Industrial and Fluid Solutions. The Refrigeration & Industrial platform manufactures products and systems which serve two key end-markets: Refrigeration & Food Equipment and Other Industrial. The Fluid Solutions platform designs and manufactures pumps, compressors, and chemical proportioning and dispensing products.

Revenue of our Refrigeration & Industrial platform, which serves our refrigeration and food equipment and other industrial end-markets, increased $292.8 million , or 11.2% . Revenue derived from refrigeration and food equipment markets (representing 43.4% of 2013 segment revenue) increased $278.2 million , or 20.3% , over the prior year reflecting the favorable impact of recent acquisitions, most notably Anthony International, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2012. In addition, increased demand for refrigeration equipment and beverage can-making equipment attributed to the revenue increase as compared to 2012. These increases in revenue more than offset the unfavorable impact of reduced shipments to a key retail customer on a specific project in the refrigeration market. Revenue generated by our businesses serving other industrial markets (representing 32.9% of 2013 segment revenue) increased $14.6 million , or 1.2% , driven by the impact of a recent acquisition, higher demand for waste equipment for large regional haulers, and increased demand in markets serving vehicle service businesses, partially offset by lower demand for equipment serving the mining, utilities, military, and industrial automation machinery sectors. Revenue of our Fluid Solutions platform (representing 23.7% of 2013 segment revenue) increased by $84.6 million , or 10.4% , reflecting the favorable impact of recent acquisitions, organic growth of 2.0% primarily resulting from strength in our European markets and a 1.0% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Engineered Systems segment earnings in 2013 increased $73.9 million , or 14.7% compared with 2012 , due to the impact of recent acquisitions, favorable net material cost, productivity improvements and a favorable foreign currency impact, partially offset by weakened Europe markets and higher acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense. In addition, non-recurring gains in 2013 included a $6.8 million gain associated with the sale of land in Switzerland and settlements on insurance related to property damage totaling $4.4 million, that partially offset other miscellaneous non-recurring charges, none of which were individually significant. Operating margin increased 50 basis points compared to 2012 , as the aforementioned pricing and productivity benefits and favorable net material costs more than offset acquisition-related costs. Segment bookings for 2013 and backlog at December 31, 2013 increased compared to 2012 levels, primarily from higher pump equipment, refrigeration equipment and other industrial equipment orders. 2012 Versus 2011 Engineered Systems 2012 revenue increased $318.8 million , or 10.3% , driven by organic revenue growth of 5.6% and growth from recent acquisitions of 6.1% , offset by a 1.4% unfavorable foreign currency impact. Revenue of our Refrigeration & Industrial platform, which serves our refrigeration and food equipment and other industrial end-markets, increased $179.2 million , or 7.4% . Revenue derived from refrigeration and food equipment markets (representing 40.0% of 2012 segment revenue) increased $129.4 million or 10.4% , with approximately 2.0% of the revenue growth generated by the Anthony and Advansor acquisitions, and the remaining 9.0% of the growth reflecting solid demand for refrigeration systems fueled by remodel activity at major retail chains, as well as increased demand for foodservice equipment through dealer and direct channels and for beverage can-making equipment, especially in Asia. Revenue generated by our businesses serving other industrial markets (representing 36.1% of 2012 segment revenue) increased $49.9 million , or 4.2% . The increase was driven by higher demand for waste and recycling equipment and industrial automation machinery, along with increased demand for vehicle services in the important Asian markets and strong first-half demand for hydraulic equipment serving the mining and utility sectors. 36 Table of Contents Revenue of our Fluid Solutions platform (representing 23.9% of 2012 segment revenue) increased by $139.5 million or 20.6% reflecting the favorable impact of recent acquisitions, most notably Maag Pump Systems, which was acquired in the first quarter of 2012, partly offset by a 1.0% decline in organic revenue, primarily resulting from weakness in our European markets. Engineered Systems segment earnings in 2012 increased $56.8 million , or 12.8% , compared with 2011 , due to the impact of recent acquisitions, favorable net material cost, and productivity improvements, partially offset by weakened Europe markets and unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Operating margin increased 30 basis points compared to 2011 , as favorable pricing and productivity benefits more than offset acquisition-related costs and unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Printing & Identification Our Printing & Identification segment is a worldwide supplier of precision marking and coding, printing, dispensing, soldering and coating equipment and related consumables and services. The segment serves two broad global end- markets: Fast Moving Consumer Goods ("FMCG") and Industrial. As discussed previously, two businesses serving the electronic assembly and test markets, namely ECT and DEK, were reclassified to discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2012, as we expected to divest these businesses. The discussion that follows addresses only the remaining continuing operations of the segment.

FMCG revenue (representing 60.2% of 2013 segment revenue) increased $26.2 million or 4.5%, compared to the prior year. Revenue growth was favorably impacted by market improvements in Europe and developing markets, as well as a favorable foreign currency impact of 0.2%. 37 Table of Contents Industrial revenue (representing 39.8% of 2013 segment revenue) decreased 0.2% compared with the prior year, reflecting the continued softness in the bar code printing business, particularly in the first half of the year. Acquisition growth of 0.2% was offset by and unfavorable foreign currency impact of 0.2%. P rinting & Identification segment earnings increased $17.5 million , or 12.9% , in 2013 compared to 2012 , resulting in an operating margin increase of 130 basis points. The margin increase is primarily attributed to leveraging higher volumes and ongoing productivity improvements, including restructuring savings from actions taken earlier in 2013 and during 2012. Bookings for 2013 increased 2.4% as compared to 2012 , and backlog levels at increased 2.2% at December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year end, primarily driven by our FMCG end markets. 2012 Versus 2011 Printing & Identification segment revenue decreased $11.7 million or 1.2% compared to 2011 , attributable to 2.4% organic revenue growth, primarily driven by higher FMCG end market revenue, more than offset by a 3.6% unfavorable foreign currency impact. FMCG revenue (representing 59.1% of 2012 segment revenue) increased $7.7 million , or 1.3%, year-over-year, excluding a 4.0% unfavorable impact from foreign currency. Despite economic weakness in Europe, growth was driven by continued market acceptance of our new products and added sales and service resources in key regional markets. Industrial revenue (representing 40.9% of 2012 segment revenue) contracted 4.5% compared with the prior year, excluding a 4.0% unfavorable impact from foreign currency, reflecting weaker European and slowing Asia markets. P rinting & Identification segment earnings decreased $6.4 million , or 4.5% , in 2012 compared to 2011 , resulting in an operating margin decline of 40 basis points. The margin decline is primarily attributed to lower industrial end market volumes, key strategic investments for growth and restructuring expenses recognized in the first half of 2012, partially offset by ongoing productivity improvements and a partial year of restructuring savings. 38 Table of Contents Communication Technologies Our Communication Technologies segment is engaged in the design and manufacture of innovative products and components which serve the following key markets: Consumer Electronics, Aerospace/Defense, Medical Technology, and Telecom/Other.

The overall increase in revenue was mainly due to increased microelectronic mechanical ( MEMs ) microphone volumes resulting from new OEM product introductions and overall smartphone market growth. This growth was partially offset by the continued market decline of two OEM customers, affecting our speaker and receiver volumes, and normal industry pricing concessions for our communications, medical and telecommunications products. Revenue was favorably impacted by foreign currency translation by 0.2%. Our revenue in the consumer electronics market (representing 49.6% of 2013 segment revenue) increased $93.0 million or 13.1% , due to solid demand for components serving the handset market driven by new product releases by major OEM customers serving the smart phone market. This growth was tempered in part by market share losses for two key handset OEM customers, as well as delays in launches of certain OEM products and specification changes. Overall, our MEMs microphones remain well positioned to capitalize on this market's growth as we have continued to invest in capacity to meet the growing market demands. Revenue derived from our aerospace/defense market (representing 25.4% of 2013 segment revenue) decreased $3.7 million, or 0.9% , mainly due to weakness in the domestic defense market resulting from governmental funding uncertainties, offset in part by the continued increase in build rates of commercial aircraft driving demand in the aerospace market. 39 Table of Contents Our medical technology revenue (representing 15.3% of 2013 segment revenue) increased by $2.5 million , or 1.0% , due to solid demand for medical coupling and connector products, partially offset by strategic pricing initiatives in hearing health. Revenue derived from our telecom/other market (representing 9.7% of 2013 segment revenue) increased $7.9 million , or 5.3% , driven by higher demand from telecom customers serving the anticipated build-out of wireless infrastructure in China, coupled with improved demand for coupling and connector products serving the industrial markets. Communication Technologies earnings in 2013 increased $18.7 million , or 8.6% , compared with 2012 , with an increase in operating margin of 30 basis points. The earnings and margin increases were driven by strong conversion on higher MEMs volumes, savings from productivity programs and recent restructuring actions. These increases more than offset the following: higher depreciation and amortization expense of $15.9 million related to recent capital investments to support the growth in the handset market; higher restructuring charges of $10.7 million; fixed asset impairment and inventory charges of $5.2 million related to more mature product lines; and normal industry pricing concessions corresponding to normal product life cycle maturities. Bookings increased 5.9% for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to 2012, reflecting continued strength in our consumer electronics market and improved demand for medical coupling and connector products, which more than offset reduced demand in our defense and hearing health markets. Backlog at December 31, 2013 decreased 3.7% compared to the prior year primarily due to the timing of new orders associated with marine hydraulics in the defense market. 2012 Versus 2011 Revenue generated by our Communication Technologies segment increased $156.5 million or 11.5% compared with 2011 . The overall increase in revenue resulted primarily from increased MEMs microphone volumes resulting from new product introductions and overall smart phone market growth, combined with a full year of revenue for Sound Solutions in 2012 compared to six months of revenue in 2011. Our MEMs revenue grew in excess of 25.0% over the 2011 level. The 2012 revenue increase was partially offset by strategic pricing initiatives for our communications and telecommunication products, corresponding to normal product life cycle maturities, and reduced volumes in certain end markets. Our revenue in the consumer electronics market (representing 46.7% of 2012 segment revenue) increased $165.8 million or 30.6% , due to solid demand for components serving the handset market. This growth was tempered in part by delays in the launches of certain OEM products and operational challenges in the Sound Solutions business impacting its product rollouts which led to lower volume for this portion of the business. Our aerospace/defense revenue (representing 27.3% of 2012 segment revenue) increased $13.7 million , or 3.4% , mainly due to continued increase in build rates of commercial aircraft and the timing and funding of key defense programs in which we participate. The defense market in Europe continues to be impacted by the weak macro-economic environment. Our medical technology revenue (representing 16.1% of segment revenue) increased by $11.0 million , or 4.7% , due to increased hearing aid demand. Revenue derived from other medical products was unfavorably impacted by weakened European and Asian economic conditions. Our telecom/other revenue (representing 9.9% of 2012 segment revenue) decreased $34.0 million , or 18.5% , due to weakened demand in the global telecom markets, driven in part by continued deferred industry investment due to service provider consolidation. Communication Technologies 2012 earnings decreased 3.3% compared with 2011 , with a decrease in operating margin of 220 basis points. The earnings and margin decreases were mainly due to lower margins from the integration of Sound Solutions including a full year of incremental depreciation and amortization compared to six months in 2011, new product ramp up costs and restructuring charges related to cost reduction activities, offset in part by productivity initiatives, leverage on higher MEMs volume, and the absence of one-time acquisition related costs associated with the Sound Solutions. 40 Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Significant factors affecting liquidity are: cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, dividends, repurchase of outstanding shares, adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit, and the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms. We generate substantial cash from the operations of our businesses and remain in a strong financial position, with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions. Cash Flow Summary The following table is derived from our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Years Ended December 31, Cash Flows from Continuing Operations (in thousands) 2013 2012 2011 Net Cash Flows Provided By (Used In): Operating activities $ 1,178,685 $ 1,261,160 $ 948,864 Investing activities (463,051 ) (1,345,888 ) (1,012,430 ) Financing activities (678,542 ) (342,942 ) (50,501 ) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities in 2013 decreased $82.5 million relative to 2012. This decline was driven by higher investments in working capital of $131.7 million in 2013 relative to the prior year due primarily to the impact of timing of customer and vendor payments and higher revenue levels. Additionally, we made higher long-term and annual incentive compensation payouts in 2013, which drove reductions in compensation accruals of nearly $66.7 million year over year. Increased tax payments of $57.4 million further reduced operating cash flow as these payments exceeded the 2013 tax provision, thereby reducing income tax accruals. Offsetting these declines to operating cash flow were higher continuing earnings before depreciation and amortization of $196.7 million, which were the results of higher sales volumes and acquisition activity during the year. Cash provided by operating activities in 2012 increased $312.3 million as compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased net earnings in 2012 and reduced investment in working capital relative to 2011. Higher sales volume increased 2012 net earnings before depreciation and amortization by $127.0 million as compared with 2011. Our net cash flow increased $128.6 million on the change in working capital year over year, as we converted working capital of approximately $30.9 million to cash in 2012, while we invested $97.7 million in working capital in 2011. Additionally, 2012 cash flow increased $76.7 million from the year-over-year change in income tax accruals due to the timing of tax payments. Pension and Post-Retirement Activity. Post-retirement costs relating to pension and other employee-related defined benefit plans affect results in all segments, as well as corporate. We recorded net periodic benefit costs of $45.5 million , $43.9 million , and $40.0 million in 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , respectively, relating to our benefit plans (including our defined benefit, supplemental, and post-retirement plans). The main drivers of fluctuations in expense from year to year are assumptions in formulating our long-term estimates, including discount rates used to value plan obligations, expected returns on plan assets, the service and interest costs, and the amortization of actuarial gains and losses. The funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of market interest rates, and the level of funding. In 2013, we announced that the U.S. qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans will be closed to new employees beginning in 2014 and that service benefits would be frozen effective 2024. Consequently, the net funded status of the U.S. qualified defined benefit plan increased nearly $125.0 million in 2013 relative to the prior year due to a reduction in expected future obligations and increased returns on plan assets. We contribute cash to our plans at our discretion, subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements. Cash contributions to the U.S. qualified defined benefit plan totaled $9.0 million, $18.0 million, and $42.0 million in 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , respectively. Due to the recent amendments to the U.S. defined benefit plan, the Company expects to make minimal contributions to this plan in the near term. Our significant international pension plans maintained a net unfunded status of $95.6 million at December 31, 2013 as certain of these plans are located in regions where it is not economically advantageous to pre-fund the plans due to local regulations. 41 Table of Contents The majority of the international obligations relate to defined benefit plans operated by our businesses in Germany, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland. Total cash contributions to the international defined benefit pension plans in 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 totaled $11.4 million, $10.2 million, and $7.3 million, respectively. In 2014, we expect to contribute approximately $8.9 million to our non-U.S. plans. See Note 15. Employee Benefit Plans in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding our post-retirement plans. Adjusted Working Capital. In 2013 , Adjusted Working Capital (a non-GAAP measure calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable) increased from 2012 by $146.2 million, or 10.1%, to $1.6 billion, which reflected an increase in receivables of $133.2 million, an increase in net inventory of $54.2 million, and an increase in accounts payable of $41.2 million, generally due to the impact of timing of customer and vendor payments in 2013. Excluding acquisitions and the effects of foreign exchange translation of $3.0 million, Adjusted Working Capital would have increased by $94.3 million, or 6.5%. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities are derived from cash outflows for capital expenditures and acquisitions, partially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses, property, plant and equipment, and short-term investments. The majority of the activity in investing activities was comprised of the following: Acquisitions . In 2013 , we deployed $322.8 million to acquire ten businesses, including $142.2 million for Finder Pompe, a European acquisition in our Fluid Solutions platform. In comparison, in 2012 , we acquired seven business for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately $1.0 billion including $265.8 million for Maag Pump Systems, $119.4 million for PCS, and $603.2 million for Anthony International. Cash paid for the 2012 acquisitions is net of $45.0 million received as final payment for settlement of purchase price adjustments for post-acquisition contingencies relating to the 2011 Sound Solutions acquisition by our Communication Technologies segment, which comprised the majority of the $1.4 billion of acquisition spend in 2011. See Note 3. Acquisitions in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information with respect to recent acquisitions. Capital spending. Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation, and cost savings, were $236.8 million in 2013 , $297.0 million in 2012 , and $262.7 million in 2011 . Our capital expenditures were approximately $60.2 million lower in the 2013 period as compared to 2012 , due to capacity expansions made within our high-growth businesses in the prior year to support initiatives in the handset market, as well as the energy and fluid solutions end markets. We expect 2014 capital expenditures to approximate 2.5% of revenue. Proceeds from sale of businesses. In 2013, we generated cash proceeds of $76.5 million , primarily from the sale of Everett Charles Technologies, an operating company within the Printing & Identification segment. In 2011, we generated cash of $516.9 million, primarily from the sale of Paladin Brands, Crenlo, and Heil Trailer, three businesses that had operated in our Engineered Systems segment. Short-term investments. We held no short-term investments during 2012 or 2013. In 2011, we generated proceeds of $124.4 million from the sale of short-term investments, which were liquidated to provide cash for 2011 acquisitions. We anticipate that capital expenditures and any acquisitions we make through the remainder of 2014 will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and, if necessary, through the issuance of commercial paper, the use of established lines of credit, or accessing the public debt or equity markets. 42 Table of Contents Financing Activities Our cash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends, offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from exercise of stock options. The majority of financing activity was attributed to the following: Long-term debt and notes payable . In December 2013, the Company issued 300.0 million of 2.125% euro-denominated notes due 2020. The proceeds of $403.8 million from the sale of the notes, net of discounts and issuance costs, were primarily used to repay commercial paper, which primarily accounted for the $381.0 million cash outflow during the year, as well as fund business acquisitions. In the 2012 period, we had negligible reductions in long-term debt, but increased borrowings of $607.5 million from commercial paper issuances principally to fund acquisitions in the period. In the 2011 period, we received proceeds of $789.0 million from the issuance of 4.3% 10-year notes due 2021 and 5.375% 30-year notes due 2041. These proceeds were used to fund acquisitions and repay $400.0 million of other borrowings which came due during the period. Treasury purchases . In November 2012, Dover's Board of Directors approved a $1.0 billion stock repurchase program to drive additional shareholder value. We used $457.3 million in 2013 to purchase 6.0 million shares and $250.1 million in 2012 to purchase 4.0 million shares under this facility. Additionally, 8.3 million shares or $493.0 million of share repurchases in 2012 were made under the previous repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors. These share repurchases are typically made to offset the dilutive impact of shares issued under our equity compensation plans. In addition, 2012 repurchases were intended offset the dilutive impact of shares issued for the acquisition of PCS. In 2011, we repurchased approximately 4.0 million shares for $242.5 million . Dividend payments . Total dividend payments to common shareholders were $247.8 million in 2013 , $241.0 million in 2012 and $219.2 million in 2011 . Our dividends per common share increased 9% to $1.45 per share in 2013 compared to $1.33 per share in 2012 . This represents the 58th consecutive year that our dividend has increased. Proceeds from the exercise of stock options . We received $7.6 million from employee exercises of stock options in 2013 , as compared to $43.1 million in 2012 and $39.8 million in 2011 . These proceeds have declined in the current period as the number of stock options are diminishing and a larger number of cashless exercises of equity awards have occurred. Cash Flows from Discontinued Operations In 2013 , our businesses reported as discontinued operations used cash flow of $30.0 million as compared to cash generated of $4.9 million and $117.3 million in 2012 and 2011 , respectively. The 2011 amounts reflect cash flows generated from from the three businesses sold in 2011 (Paladin Brands, Crenlo, and Heil Trailer), as well as cash flows from the two businesses reclassified as held for sale in 2012 (DEK and Everett Charles Technologies). Cash flows from discontinued operations in 2013 and 2012 reflect only those businesses classified as held for sale in 2012. Higher investments in working capital in 2013 led to the decline in cash flows from discontinued operations relative to the prior year, due primarily to the timing of customer and vendor payments. Liquidity and Capital Resources Free Cash Flow In addition to measuring our cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating, investing, and financing classifications included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we also measure free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure). We believe that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to repay debt, pay dividends, fund acquisitions, and repurchase our common stock. For further information, see the Non-GAAP Disclosures at the end of this Item 7. 43 Table of Contents The following table reconciles our free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities: Years Ended December 31, Free Cash Flow (dollars in thousands) 2013 2012 2011 Cash flow provided by operating activities $ 1,178,685 $ 1,261,160 $ 948,864 Less: Capital expenditures (236,833 ) (297,012 ) (262,676 ) Free cash flow $ 941,852 $ 964,148 $ 686,188 Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue 10.8 % 11.9 % 9.3 % For 2013 , we generated free cash flow of $941.9 million , representing 10.8% of revenue and 97.5% of earnings from continuing operations. Free cash flow in 2012 was $964.1 million or 11.9% of revenue, compared to $686.2 million , or 9.3% of revenue in 2011 . The full year decrease in 2013 free cash flow reflects a higher investment in working capital year over year, offset by higher earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization and lower capital expenditures. We expect to generate free cash flow in 2014 of approximately 11.0% of revenue, consistent with recent performance. The 2012 increase in free cash flow compared to 2011 reflects higher earnings from continuing operations and lower investment in working capital, partially offset by higher tax payments and increased capital expenditures in 2012 . Net Debt to Net Capitalization We utilize the net debt to net capitalization calculation (a non-GAAP measure) to assess our overall financial leverage and capacity and believe the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason. The following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to net capitalization to the most directly comparable GAAP measures: Net Debt to Net Capitalization Ratio (dollars in thousands) December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 Current maturities of long-term debt $ 2,778 $ 3,266 $ 1,022 Commercial paper 226,500 607,500 Long-term debt 2,599,201 2,189,350 2,186,230 Total debt 2,828,479 2,800,116 2,187,252 Less: Cash and cash equivalents (803,882 ) (800,076 ) (1,206,755 ) Net debt 2,024,597 2,000,040 980,497 Add: Stockholders' equity 5,377,396 4,919,230 4,930,555 Net capitalization $ 7,401,993 $ 6,919,270 $ 5,911,052 Net debt to net capitalization 27.4 % 28.9 % 16.6 % Our net debt to net capitalization ratio decreased slightly at December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year-end due to the significant increase in equity levels driven by current net earnings, offset in part by $28.4 million of additional net borrowings. We replaced commercial paper borrowings in 2013 with the issuance of 300.0 million of 2.125% euro-denominated notes due 2020, from which we received proceeds of approximately $403.8 million . Our net debt to net capitalization ratio increased at December 31, 2012 compared to the 2011 year end primarily due to the use of cash and borrowings to fund acquisitions totaling $1.0 billion during the year. Total borrowings were higher by $612.9 million at December 31, 2012 , primarily due to commercial paper issued in the fourth quarter to fund acquisitions. We use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions and the repurchase of our common stock. We currently maintain an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks which permits borrowings up to $1.0 billion and expires on November 10, 2016. This facility is used primarily as liquidity back-up for our commercial paper program. We have not drawn down any loans under this facility nor do we anticipate doing so. If we were to draw down a loan, at our election, the loan would bear interest at a Eurodollar or Sterling rate based on LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.565% to 1.225% (subject to adjustment based on the rating accorded our senior unsecured debt by S&P and Moody s) or at a base rate pursuant to a formula defined in the facility. Under this facility, we are required to maintain an interest coverage ratio of EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 3.0 to 1. We were in compliance with 44 Table of Contents this covenant and our other long-term debt covenants at December 31, 2013 and had a coverage ratio of 13.2 to 1.0. We are not aware of any potential impairment to our liquidity and expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants. We also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the SEC with remaining capacity of $1.0 billion (which we intend to renew) that allows for the issuance of additional debt securities that may be utilized in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, capital expenditures, and acquisitions. At December 31, 2013 , our cash and cash equivalents totaled $803.9 million , of which approximately $638.9 million was held outside the United States. We typically invest cash in excess of near-term requirements in short-term investments. We held no short-term investments during 2012 or 2013. In 2011, we generated proceeds of $124.4 million from the sale of short-term investments, which were liquidated to provide cash for 2011 acquisitions. If our cash held outside of the U.S. were to be repatriated, under current law, it would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. The cash that our foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments, including acquisitions. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated, and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting U.S. income tax liability. Management believes that it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its cash needs, including its cash needs in the United States. Our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable risk-based interest rates is partly a function of our existing cash-flow-to-debt and debt-to-capitalization levels as well as our current credit standing. Our credit ratings, which are independently developed by the respective rating agencies, were as follows as of December 31, 2013 : Short Term Rating Long Term Rating Outlook Moody's P-1 A2 Stable Standard & Poor's A-1 A Stable Fitch F1 A Stable Short-term ratings of "P-1," "A-1" and "F1" are defined as a strong or superior ability to repay short-term debt obligations. A long-term rating of "A" or "A2" is defined as a strong capacity to meet financial commitments, but susceptible to adverse business or economic conditions. We believe that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future. Acquisition spending and/or share repurchases could potentially increase our debt. Operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements, including acquisitions and capital expenditures. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2013 , we had approximately $137.7 million outstanding in letters of credit with financial institutions, which expire at various dates in 2014 through 2018 . These letters of credit are primarily maintained as security for insurance, warranty and other performance obligations. In general, we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations, the probability of which we believe is remote. We have also provided typical indemnities in connection with sales of certain businesses and assets, including representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental, health and safety, tax, and employment matters. We do not have any material liabilities recorded for these indemnifications and are not aware of any claims or other information that would give rise to material payments under such indemnities. 45 Table of Contents A summary of our consolidated contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2013 and the years when these obligations are expected to be due is as follows: Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Other (5) Long-term debt (1) $ 2,601,979 $ 2,778 $ 299,638 $ 348,598 $ 1,950,965 $ Interest expense (2) 1,759,394 126,549 235,426 208,747 1,188,672 Rental commitments 347,683 77,344 103,629 69,101 97,609 Purchase obligations (3) 67,188 58,595 8,593 Capital leases 9,416 5,793 2,726 366 531 Supplemental & post-retirement benefits (4) 112,637 13,369 21,131 21,226 56,911 Uncertain tax positions (5) 103,881 1,105 102,776 Total obligations $ 5,002,178 $ 285,533 $ 671,143 $ 648,038 $ 3,294,688 $ 102,776 _________ (1 ) See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts represent total long-term debt, including current maturities. (2 ) Amounts represent estimate of future interest payments on long-term debt using the interest rates in effect at December 31, 2013. (3 ) Amount includes purchase obligations totaling $11.0 million relating to businesses reported within discontinued operations at December 31, 2013. (4 ) Amounts represent estimated benefit payments under our unfunded supplemental and post-retirement benefit plans and our unfunded non-U.S. qualified defined benefit plans. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also expect to contribute approximately $8.9 million to our non-U.S. qualified defined benefit plans in 2014, which amount is not reflected in the above table. (5 ) Amount in "Other" column includes $17.4 million reported within discontinued operations at December 31, 2013. Due to the uncertainty of the potential settlement of future uncertain tax positions, we are unable to estimate the timing of the related payments, if any, that will be made subsequent to 2014. These amounts do not include the potential indirect benefits resulting from deductions or credits for payments made to other jurisdictions. Financial Instruments and Risk Management The diverse nature of our businesses activities necessitates the management of various financial and market risks, including those related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and commodity prices. We periodically use derivative financial instruments to manage some of these risks. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as our policy is to contract with highly-rated, diversified counterparties. Interest Rate Exposure We may from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2013 , we did not have any open interest rate swap contracts. We issue commercial paper, which exposes us to changes in variable interest rates; however, maturities are typically three months or less so a change in rates over this period would have an immaterial impact on our pre-tax earnings. We consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates to be minimal since our debt is largely long-term and fixed-rate in nature. Generally, the fair market value of fixed-interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the 2013 year-end fair value of our long-term debt by approximately $229.5 million. However, since we have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their maturities, the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our long-term debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position. 46 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Exposure We conduct business in various non-U.S. countries, primarily in Canada, Mexico, substantially all of the European countries, Brazil, Argentina, Malaysia, China, India, and other Asian countries. Therefore, we have foreign currency risk relating to receipts from customers, payments to suppliers, and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies. We will occasionally use derivative financial instruments to offset such risks, when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities. We have formal policies to mitigate risk in this area by using fair value and/or cash flow hedging programs. Changes in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we operate affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows when translated into U.S. dollars, our reporting currency. The strengthening of the U.S dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars. We have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to our investment in non-U.S. operations. We may, from time to time, for a specific exposure, enter into fair value hedges, and at December 31, 2013 , we had one outstanding floating-to-floating cross currency swap agreement for a total notional amount of $50.0 million in exchange for CHF 65.1 million , which matures on October 15, 2015. This transaction hedges a portion of our net investment in non-U.S. operations. The agreement qualifies as a net investment hedge and changes in the fair value are reported within the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive earnings, with any hedge ineffectiveness being recognized in current earnings. The fair values at December 31, 2013 and 2012 reflected cumulative losses of $23.7 million and $22.7 million , respectively, due to the strengthening of the Swiss franc relative to the U.S. dollar over the term of this arrangement. Additionally, the Company has designated the 300.0 million of euro-denominated notes issued December 4, 2013 as a hedge of a portion of the its net investment in euro-denominated operations. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the exposure being hedged, fluctuations in the value of the euro-denominated debt due to exchange rate changes are offset by changes in the net investment. Accordingly, changes in the value of the euro-denominated debt are recognized in the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive income to offset changes in the value of the net investment in euro-denominated operations. The loss recognized from the euro net investment hedge in other comprehensive income totaled $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 . Commodity Price Exposure Certain of our businesses are exposed to volatility in the prices of certain commodities, such as aluminum, steel, copper, and various precious metals, among others. Our primary exposure to commodity pricing volatility relates to the use of these materials in purchased component parts or the purchase of raw materials. When possible, we maintain long-term fixed price contracts on raw materials and component parts; however, we are prone to exposure as these contracts expire. We may, from time to time, for a specific exposure, enter into cash flow hedges to mitigate our risk to commodity pricing; however, such contracts outstanding at December 31, 2013 were not significant. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ). GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments, and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense amounts we report. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our public disclosures, including information regarding contingencies, risk, and our financial condition. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . The accounting assumptions and estimates discussed in the section below are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and estimates. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conforms to GAAP and is consistently applied. We review valuations based on estimates for reasonableness on a consistent basis. Revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, b) price is fixed or determinable, c) collectability is reasonably assured, and d) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered. The majority of our revenue is generated through the manufacture and sale of a broad range of specialized products and components, with revenue recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss, which is generally upon shipment. Service revenue represents less than 10% of our total revenue and is recognized as the services are 47 Table of Contents performed. In limited cases, our revenue arrangements with customers require delivery, installation, testing, certification, or other acceptance provisions to be satisfied before revenue is recognized. We do not have significant multiple deliverable arrangements. Inventories for the majority of our subsidiaries, including all international subsidiaries, are stated at the lower of cost, determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis, or market. Other domestic inventories are stated at cost, determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis, which is less than market value. Under certain market conditions, estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventories are employed by us to properly value inventories. Businesses within our Communication Technologies and Printing & Identification segments tend to experience somewhat higher levels of inventory value fluctuations, particularly given the relatively high rate of product obsolescence over relatively short periods of time. We have significant tangible and intangible assets on our balance sheet that include goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and amortization lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates. The testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to the identification of reporting units and the determination of fair market value. Our assets and reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or, when indicators of impairment exist, such as a significant sustained change in the business climate, or when a significant portion of a reporting unit is to be reclassified to discontinued operations, during the interim periods. We estimate fair value using discounted cash flow analyses (i.e. an income approach) which incorporate management assumptions relating to future growth and profitability. Changes in business or market conditions could impact the future cash flows used in such analyses. We believe that our use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting principles. We performed the annual impairment testing of our 16 identified reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2013 , and the fair value of 15 of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value by at least 50% and, in most cases, significantly more. If the fair value of each of these reporting units was decreased by 10%, the resulting fair value would still have exceeded the carrying value and no impairment would have been recognized. The testing of the goodwill of our DEK business within discontinued operations in the fourth quarter resulted in impairment on the basis of the fair value assumptions predicated on an anticipated sale. As a result, we calculated goodwill impairment of $9.2 million that was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2013 within the results of discontinued operations. The valuation of our pension and other post-retirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assets/liabilities. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates, investment returns, projected salary increases and benefits, and mortality rates. Annually, we review the actuarial assumptions used in our pension reporting and compare them with external benchmarks to ensure that they accurately account for our future pension obligations. Changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on our pension expense and related funding requirements. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual returns, economic trends and portfolio allocation. Our discount rate assumption is determined by developing a yield curve based on high quality corporate bonds with maturities matching the plans expected benefit payment streams. The plans expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting year-by-year spot rates. As disclosed in Note 15. Employee Benefit Plans to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the 2013 weighted-average discount rates used to measure our qualified defined benefit, supplemental, and other post-retirement obligations ranged from 3.53% to 4.90%, an increase from the 2012 rates, which ranged from 3.31% to 4.05%. The higher 2013 discount rates are reflective of the increase in global market interest rates over these periods. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rates used for these plans would have increased the post retirement benefit obligations by approximately $36.7 million from the amount recorded in the financial statements at December 31, 2013 . Our pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. A decrease of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return on assets would have increased our defined benefit pension expense by approximately $1.3 million. We have significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly. These assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies. Changes in 2013 to certain employee benefit plans and an increase in the discount rate used to measure the obligations, as discussed in Note 15. Employee Benefit Plans , resulted in a significant decrease to the related deferred tax assets. Reserves are also estimated, using more likely than not criteria, for ongoing audits regarding federal, state, and international issues that are currently unresolved. We routinely monitor the potential impact of these situations and 48 Table of Contents believe that we have established the proper reserves. Reserves related to tax accruals and valuations related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax codes and rulings, changes in statutory tax rates, and our future taxable income levels. The provision for uncertain tax positions provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosure requirements regarding uncertainties in income tax positions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of our provision for income taxes. We have significant accruals and reserves related to the self-insured portion of our risk management program. These accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability. We estimate losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions, our experience, and relevant industry data. We review these factors quarterly and consider the current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and experience. We have established liabilities for environmental and legal contingencies at both the business and corporate levels. A significant amount of judgment and the use of estimates are required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters. The valuation of liabilities for these contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure that we have accrued the proper level of expense. The liability balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional liabilities for emerging issues. While we believe that the amount accrued to-date is adequate, future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations. Occasionally, we will establish liabilities for restructuring activities at an operation, in accordance with appropriate accounting principles. These liabilities, for both severance and exit costs, require the use of estimates. Though we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs, actual results may be different than the estimated amounts. We will from time to time discontinue certain operations for various reasons. Estimates are used to adjust, if necessary, the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations, including goodwill, to their estimated fair market value. These estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of the sale. Fair value is established using internal valuation calculations along with market analysis of similar-type entities. The adjustments to fair market value of these operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold. Changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially require future adjustments to these estimates. We recognized total goodwill impairment charges of $63.8 million in 2013 and $63.8 million 2012 for certain reporting units included in discontinued operations based on the reduction in fair value implied in the anticipated selling price. We will continue to evaluate impairment each reporting period for the remaining business held for sale at December 31, 2013 . We are required to recognize in our consolidated statements of earnings the expense associated with all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock, and performance share awards. We use the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of SARs and stock options granted to employees. The model requires that we estimate the expected life of the SAR or option, expected forfeitures and the volatility of our stock using historical data. We use the Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate fair value of performance share awards which also require us to estimate the volatility of our stock and the volatility of returns on the stock of our peer group as well as the correlation of the returns between the companies in the peer group. For additional information related to the assumptions used, see Note 15. Employee Benefit Plans to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04 which was issued to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. ASU 2011-04 changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for Level 3 fair value measurements. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2012 and its adoption did not significantly impact the Company's consolidated financial statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05 which provides new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in 49 Table of Contents stockholders equity and instead requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this ASU only requires a change in the format of the current presentation. The Company adopted this guidance for its 2011 year-end reporting, presenting other comprehensive earnings in a separate statement following the statement of earnings. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08 which provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two-step test for goodwill impairment. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. This standard became effective for the Company on January 1, 2012. Its adoption did not impact the Company's consolidated financial statements. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-09 which requires enhanced disclosures around an employer participation in multiemployer pension plans. The standard is intended to provide more information about an employer financial obligations to a multiemployer pension plan to help financial statement users better understand the financial health of the significant plans in which the employer participates. This guidance became effective for the Company for its fiscal 2011 year-end reporting. Its adoption did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02, which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test of an indefinite-lived intangible asset. Per the terms of this ASU, an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset unless the entity determines, based on qualitative assessment, that it is not more likely than not, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. The revised standard was effective for Dover for its annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. Its adoption did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02 which requires additional disclosures regarding the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income. ASU 2013-02 requires an entity to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period. This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2013. The Company's adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-05, which permits an entity to release cumulative translation adjustments into net income when a reporting entity (parent) ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a business within a foreign entity. Accordingly, the cumulative translation adjustment should be released into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided, or, if a controlling financial interest is no longer held. The revised standard is effective for Dover for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2013; however, early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect adoption of this ASU to significantly impact its consolidated financial statements. In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, which provides that an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion thereof, should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, except to the extent that a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date to settle any additional income taxes that would result from disallowance of a tax position, or the tax law does not require the entity to use, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, then the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented as a liability. This standard is effective for Dover for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2013. The Company does not expect adoption of this ASU to significantly impact its consolidated financial statements. 50 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Disclosures In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we also disclose non-GAAP information which we believe provides useful information to investors. Segment EBITDA, segment EBITDA margin, free cash flow, net debt, total debt, net capitalization, the net debt to net capitalization ratio, adjusted working capital, earnings adjusted for non-recurring items, effective tax rate adjusted for discrete and other items, revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities, debt or equity, earnings, revenue, or working capital as determined in accordance with GAAP, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We believe that segment EBITDA and segment EBITDA margin are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors. Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to segment earnings. Segment margin is calculated as segment EBITDA divided by segment revenue. We believe the net debt to net capitalization ratio and free cash flow are important measures of operating performance and liquidity. Net debt to net capitalization is helpful in evaluating our capital structure and the amount of leverage we employ. Free cash flow provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions, pay dividends, repay debt, and repurchase our common stock. Reconciliations of free cash flow, total debt, and net debt can be found above in this Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. We believe that reporting our effective tax rate adjusted for discrete and other items is useful to management and investors as it facilitates comparisons of our ongoing tax rate to prior and future periods and our peers. We believe that reporting adjusted working capital (also sometimes called working capital ), which is calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable, provides a meaningful measure of our operational results by showing the changes caused solely by revenue. We believe that reporting adjusted working capital and revenues at constant currency, which excludes the positive or negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, provides a meaningful measure of our operational changes, given the global nature of our businesses. We believe that reporting organic revenue and organic revenue growth, which exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, provides a useful comparison of our revenue performance and trends between periods.
