Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW The following discussion and analysis is intended to help you understand us, our operations and our financial performance. It should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, which are included elsewhere in this report. We are one of the largest branded apparel companies in the world, with a history going back over 135 years. Our brand portfolio consists of nationally and internationally recognized brand names, including CALVIN KLEIN, Tommy Hilfiger, Van Heusen, IZOD, ARROW, Speedo (licensed in perpetuity for North America and the Caribbean from Speedo International Ltd.), Warner s, Olga and Eagle . We also license brands from third parties primarily for use on dress shirts and neckwear offered in the United States and Canada. Our business strategy is to sell our brands at multiple price points and in multiple channels of distribution and regions. This enables us to offer products to a broad range of consumers, while minimizing competition among our brands and reducing our reliance on any one demographic group, merchandise preference, price point, distribution channel or region. We also license our brands to third parties and joint ventures for product categories and in jurisdictions where we believe our partners expertise can better serve our businesses. Our revenue was $8.203 billion in 2016, of which approximately 50% was generated outside of the United States. Our global designer lifestyle brands, Tommy Hilfiger and CALVIN KLEIN , together generated over 80% of our revenue. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operations Overview We generate net sales from (i) the wholesale distribution to retailers, franchisees, licensees and distributors of dress shirts, neckwear, sportswear, jeanswear, performance apparel, intimate apparel, underwear, swim products, handbags, accessories, footwear and other related products under owned and licensed trademarks, including through digital commerce sites operated by our wholesale partners and pure play digital commerce retailers, and (ii) the sale of certain of these products through (a) approximately 1,600 Company-operated free-standing retail store locations worldwide under our CALVIN KLEIN , Tommy Hilfiger and certain of our heritage brands, (b) over 1,150 Company-operated concessions/shop-in-shops worldwide under our CALVIN KLEIN and Tommy Hilfiger trademarks, and (c) digital commerce sites in certain countries under our CALVIN KLEIN and Tommy Hilfiger trademarks and in North America through our SpeedoUSA .com digital commerce site. Additionally, we generate royalty, advertising and other revenue from fees for licensing the use of our trademarks. On January 24, 2017, we announced that the license for the Tommy Hilfiger men tailored clothing business in North America with Marcraft Clothes, Inc. will be terminated effective December 31, 2017 (the TH men tailored license termination ). Beginning January 1, 2018, the license will move to Peerless Clothing International, Inc. in order to consolidate our men tailored businesses for all of our brands in North America under one partner. We recorded a pre-tax charge of $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 in connection with the TH men tailored license termination. On November 30, 2016, we formed a joint venture in Mexico, PVH Mexico, in which we own a 49% economic interest. The joint venture was formed by merging our wholly owned subsidiary that principally operated and managed our Calvin Klein business in Mexico with a wholly owned subsidiary of Grupo Axo, S.A.P.I. de C.V. ( Grupo Axo ) that distributes certain Tommy Hilfiger brand products in Mexico. In connection with the formation of PVH Mexico, we deconsolidated our wholly owned subsidiary. We recorded a pre-tax noncash loss of $82 million in 2016 in connection with the Mexico deconsolidation. On June 29, 2016, we, along with Arvind formed a joint venture in Ethiopia, PVH Ethiopia, in which we own a 75% interest. We have consolidated the joint venture in our consolidated financial statements. PVH Ethiopia was formed to operate a manufacturing facility that will produce finished products for us for distribution primarily in the United States. We expect the manufacturing facility will begin operations in the first half of 2017. On June 20, 2016, we issued 350 million euro-denominated principal amount of 3 5/8% senior notes due July 15, 2024. Please see Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion. 30 On April 13, 2016, we completed the acquisition of the 55% of the ownership interests in TH China, our former joint venture for Tommy Hilfiger in China, that we did not already own. As a result of the TH China acquisition, we now operate directly our Tommy Hilfiger business in this high-growth market. The total consideration for the acquisition was $161 million (including the elimination of a $3 million pre-acquisition receivable owed to us by TH China), net of cash acquired of $105 million. We recorded a net pre-tax gain of $70 million in 2016, including a noncash gain of $153 million to write-up our existing equity investment to fair value and costs of $83 million, which were primarily noncash and related to valuation adjustments and amortization of short-lived assets. On February 1, 2016, we entered into a licensing agreement with G-III for the design, production and wholesale distribution of Tommy Hilfiger womenswear in the United States and Canada, which resulted in the discontinuation of our directly operated Tommy Hilfiger North America womenswear wholesale business in the fourth quarter of 2016. We recorded pre-tax charges of $4 million and $3 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, in connection with the G-III license. We recorded pre-tax debt modification and extinguishment charges in 2016 and 2014 that totaled $16 million and $93 million, respectively. We recorded pre-tax charges principally in connection with the acquisition of Warnaco and the related integration and restructuring that totaled $10 million, $73 million and $146 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We implemented initiatives to rationalize the Heritage Brands business, including the exit from our Izod retail business (completed in the third quarter of 2015) and the discontinuation of several licensed product lines in the dress furnishings business. We recorded pre-tax charges of $10 million in 2015 and $21 million in 2014, including $18 million of noncash impairment charges, in connection with the operation of and exit from our Izod retail business. We recorded pre-tax charges of $3 million and $17 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, principally in connection with the discontinuation of several licensed product lines in the dress furnishings business. We expect to incur additional pre-tax charges of approximately $110 million during 2017, consisting of (i) approximately $55 million in connection with the agreements entered into in March 2017 for a transaction, which is expected to close July 1, 2017, to restructure our supply chain relationship with Li & Fung, which establishes a new strategic partnership with Li & Fung to provide services to us and also provides for the termination of our non-exclusive buying agency agreement with Li & Fung, pursuant to which we are obligated to source certain Calvin Klein Jeans products and at least 54% of certain Tommy Hilfiger products through Li & Fung (the Li & Fung termination ); (ii) approximately $25 million in connection with the TH China acquisition, primarily consisting of noncash amortization of short-lived assets; (iii) approximately $20 million in connection with the relocation of our Tommy Hilfiger office in New York, New York, including noncash depreciation expense; and (iv) approximately $10 million in connection with the noncash settlement of certain benefit obligations related to our retirement plans as a result of an annuity purchase for certain participants, under which such obligations were transferred to an insurer. Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses each have substantial international components that expose us to significant foreign exchange risk. Amounts recorded in local foreign currencies are translated back to United States dollars using an average exchange rate over the representative period. Our international revenue and earnings are unfavorably impacted during times of a strengthening United States dollar against the foreign currencies in which we generate significant revenue and earnings and favorably impacted during times of a weakening United States dollar against those currencies. In 2016, approximately 50% of our revenue was subject to foreign currency translation. Beginning in the latter part of 2014, the United States dollar strengthened against most major currencies, resulting in a negative impact on our results of operations for 2015 and 2016. To hedge against a portion of this exposure, we entered into several foreign currency option contracts during 2016. These contracts represent our purchase of euro put/United States dollar call options. We currently expect the strength of the United States dollar and resulting unfavorable impact on our revenue and earnings to continue in 2017, although to a lesser degree than in 2015 and 2016. Additionally, there is a transaction impact on our financial results because inventory typically is purchased in United States dollars by our foreign subsidiaries. As with translation, during times of a strengthening United States dollar, our results of operations will be negatively impacted by these transactions as the increased local currency value of inventory results in a higher local currency cost of goods when the goods are sold. We use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge against a portion of the exposure related to this transaction impact. The contracts cover at least 70% of the projected inventory purchases in United States dollars by our foreign subsidiaries. These contracts are generally entered into 12 months in advance of the related inventory purchases. Therefore, the unfavorable impact of a strengthening United States dollar on the cost of inventory purchases covered by these contracts may be realized in our earnings in the year following their inception, as the underlying inventory hedged by the contracts is sold. As such, the unfavorable impact of a strengthening United States dollar against most major currencies in the latter part of 2014 and through 2015, particularly the euro, negatively 31 impacted our gross margin during 2016, and is expected to have a negative impact, to a much lesser extent, on our earnings in 2017. Retail comparable store sales discussed below refer to sales for retail stores that have been open for at least 12 months. Sales for retail stores that are closed during the year are excluded from the calculation of retail comparable store sales. Sales for retail stores that are either relocated, materially altered in size or closed for a certain number of consecutive days for renovation are also excluded from the calculation of retail comparable store sales until such stores have been in their new location or in their newly renovated state for at least 12 months. Sales from our Company-operated digital commerce sites are included within retail comparable store sales for those businesses and regions that have operated the related digital commerce site for at least 12 months. Retail comparable store sales are based on comparable weeks and local currencies. The following table summarizes our income statements in 2016, 2015 and 2014: 2016 2015 2014 (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 7,791 $ 7,605 $ 7,849 Royalty revenue 321 325 300 Advertising and other revenue 91 90 92 Total revenue 8,203 8,020 8,241 Gross profit 4,370 4,162 4,327 % of total revenue 53.3 % 51.9 % 52.5 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 3,637 3,418 3,714 % of total revenue 44.3 % 42.6 % 45.1 % Debt modification and extinguishment costs 16 93 Other noncash gain, net 71 Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates 0 17 10 Income before interest and taxes 789 761 530 Interest expense 121 117 144 Interest income 6 4 5 Income before taxes 674 647 391 Income tax expense (benefit) 125 75 (48 ) Net income 549 572 439 Less: Net loss attributable to redeemable non-controlling interest 0 0 Net income attributable to PVH Corp. $ 549 $ 572 $ 439 Total Revenue Total revenue was $8.203 billion in 2016, $8.020 billion in 2015 and $8.241 billion in 2014. The increase in revenue of $183 million in 2016 as compared to 2015 was due principally to the net effect of the following items: The addition of an aggregate of $213 million of revenue attributable to our Calvin Klein North America and Calvin Klein International segments, which included a reduction of approximately $53 million related to the impact of foreign currency translation. Revenue in the Calvin Klein North America segment increased 3% (including a 1% negative foreign currency impact) primarily driven by strong growth in the wholesale business, partially offset by a revenue decrease due to the Mexico deconsolidation and a 4% decrease in comparable store sales, primarily driven by declines in traffic and consumer spending in Calvin Klein United States stores located in international tourist locations. Calvin Klein International segment revenue increased 12% (including a 3% negative foreign currency impact) due principally to significant growth in Europe and China. Calvin Klein International segment comparable store sales increased 6%. The net addition of $141 million of revenue attributable to our Tommy Hilfiger North America and Tommy Hilfiger International segments, which included a reduction of approximately $43 million related to the impact of foreign currency translation. Revenue in the Tommy Hilfiger North America segment decreased 4% principally due to a 9% decline in comparable store sales, driven by weak traffic and consumer spending in Tommy Hilfiger United States stores located in international tourist locations, and the discontinuation of our directly operated womenswear 32 wholesale business in the United States and Canada in connection with the G-III license. Tommy Hilfiger International segment revenue increased 11% (including a 2% negative foreign currency impact) driven principally by strong growth across Europe, including a 9% increase in comparable store sales, and the inclusion of the revenue of the China business after completion of the TH China acquisition in April 2016. The reduction of an aggregate of $171 million of revenue attributable to our Heritage Brands Retail and Heritage Brands Wholesale segments. The decrease was primarily due to the business rationalization initiatives discussed in the section entitled Operations Overview above, partially offset by a 7% increase in comparable store sales. The decrease in revenue of $221 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 was due principally to the net effect of the following items: The net addition of $64 million of revenue attributable to our Calvin Klein North America and Calvin Klein International segments, which included a reduction of approximately $199 million related to the impact of foreign currency translation. Revenue in the Calvin Klein North America segment increased 5% (including a 3% negative foreign currency impact). The Calvin Klein North America retail business experienced solid growth due to square footage expansion in Company-operated stores, including the conversion of IZOD stores to Calvin Klein Accessory and Calvin Klein Underwear stores, and a 2% increase in comparable store sales despite the decreased traffic and consumer spending trends in Calvin Klein United States stores located in international tourist locations, while the wholesale business experienced modest growth. Revenue in the Calvin Klein International segment decreased 2% (including a 13% negative foreign currency impact). Revenue of the segment would have increased if not for the negative foreign currency impact. This was attributable to the strong performance in Europe, where we experienced growth in most markets, and an increase in Asia, partially due to the benefit of the Chinese New Year, as the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2015 included the peak wholesale selling seasons before the Chinese New Year, while fiscal 2014 did not include a peak selling season before the holiday. International comparable store sales increased 5%. The reduction of an aggregate of $212 million of revenue attributable to our Tommy Hilfiger North America and Tommy Hilfiger International segments, which included a reduction of approximately $341 million related to the impact of foreign currency translation resulting principally from a weaker euro. Revenue in the Tommy Hilfiger North America segment decreased 1% (including a 2% negative foreign currency impact) due principally to a 5% decrease in comparable store sales primarily as a result of the decline in traffic and consumer spending trends in Tommy Hilfiger United States stores located in international tourist locations. Revenue in the Tommy Hilfiger International segment decreased 10% (including a 15% negative foreign currency impact). Revenue of the segment would have increased if not for the negative foreign currency impact, principally as a result of 8% comparable store sales growth in Europe and a mid-single digit percentage increase in wholesale revenue. The reduction of an aggregate of $72 million of revenue attributable to our Heritage Brands Wholesale and Heritage Brands Retail segments, as a 10% increase in comparable store sales in the Van Heusen retail business was more than offset by the revenue decrease attributable to the business rationalization initiatives discussed in the section entitled Operations Overview above. We currently expect that revenue will increase 2% in 2017 compared to 2016, inclusive of a negative impact of approximately 2% related to foreign currency translation. Negatively impacting revenue in 2017 as compared to 2016 are decreases from (i) the Mexico deconsolidation, which resulted in us no longer recognizing revenues from a directly operated business in Mexico, and (ii) the G-III license, which resulted in the discontinuation of our directly operated womenswear wholesale business in the United States and Canada in the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue for our Calvin Klein business is projected to increase approximately 5% compared to 2016, inclusive of a negative impact of approximately 2% related to foreign currency translation, as well as the negative impact of the Mexico deconsolidation. Revenue for our Tommy Hilfiger business is expected to increase approximately 1% compared to 2016, inclusive of a negative impact of approximately 3% related to foreign currency translation, as well as the negative impact of the G-III license. Revenue for our Heritage Brands business is expected to decrease approximately 1% compared to 2016. 33 Gross Profit Gross profit is calculated as total revenue less cost of goods sold and gross margin is calculated as gross profit divided by total revenue. Included as cost of goods sold are costs associated with the production and procurement of product, such as inbound freight costs, purchasing and receiving costs and inspection costs. Also included as costs of goods sold are the amounts recognized on foreign currency forward exchange contracts as the underlying inventory hedged by such forward exchange contracts is sold. Warehousing and distribution expenses are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. All of our royalty, advertising and other revenue is included in gross profit because there is no cost of goods sold associated with such revenue. As a result, our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities. The following table shows our revenue mix between net sales and royalty, advertising and other revenue, as well as our gross margin for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 : 2016 2015 2014 Components of revenue: Net sales 95.0 % 94.8 % 95.2 % Royalty, advertising and other revenue 5.0 5.2 4.8 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Gross margin 53.3 % 51.9 % 52.5 % Gross profit in 2016 was $4.370 billion, or 53.3% of total revenue, compared to $4.162 billion, or 51.9% of total revenue, in 2015. The 140 basis point increase in gross margin was principally driven by (i) a favorable mix of business due to revenue growth in our higher-margin Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses and revenue contraction in our lower-margin Heritage Brands business, (ii) the addition of TH China, which achieved a significantly higher gross margin than the average gross margin for our overall business, and (iii) gross margin improvements in our North American businesses, principally in the second half of the year, due to decreased promotional selling resulting from lower inventory levels as compared to the prior year. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger United States dollar on our international businesses that purchase inventory in United States dollars, particularly our European businesses, as the increased local currency value of inventory resulted in higher cost of goods in local currency when the goods were sold. Gross profit in 2015 was $4.162 billion, or 51.9% of total revenue, compared to $4.327 billion, or 52.5% of total revenue, in 2014. The 60 basis point decrease in gross margin was principally driven by (i) a decline in gross margin in the Tommy Hilfiger North America segment due to the decline in traffic and consumer spending trends in our United States stores located in international tourist locations, which drove more promotional selling compared to 2014, (ii) the stronger United States dollar, which caused our Calvin Klein International and Tommy Hilfiger International segments, which generally carry higher gross margins than our North American segments, to be translated to United States dollars at lower average exchange rates, (iii) the stronger United States dollar, which further negatively impacted our international businesses that purchase inventory in United States dollars, particularly the Tommy Hilfiger European business, as the increased local currency value of inventory resulted in higher cost of goods in local currency when the goods were sold, and (iv) costs incurred principally in connection with the discontinuation of several licensed product lines in the Heritage Brands dress furnishings business. These declines were partially offset by overall gross margin improvements in our Calvin Klein European and Asian businesses as a result of higher average unit retail selling prices, as well as an increase in our royalty, advertising and other revenue as a percentage of total revenue, as there is no cost of goods sold associated with such revenue. We currently expect that gross margin in 2017 will increase as compared to 2016 due to (i) the impact of expected faster growth in our Calvin Klein International and Tommy Hilfiger International segments than in our North American segments, as our International segments generally carry higher gross margins and (ii) gross margin improvements in our North American businesses principally resulting from decreased promotional selling compared to 2016. We currently expect that these gross margin increases will be partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger United States dollar on our international businesses that purchase inventory in United States dollars. 34 Selling, General and Administrative ( SG&A ) Expenses Our SG&A expenses were as follows: 2016 2015 2014 (Dollars in millions) SG&A expenses $ 3,637 $ 3,418 $ 3,714 % of total revenue 44.3 % 42.6 % 45.1 % SG&A expenses in 2016 were $3.637 billion, or 44.3% of total revenue, as compared to $3.418 billion, or 42.6% of total revenue in 2015. The 170 basis point increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue was principally attributable to (i) the costs incurred in connection with the TH China acquisition, primarily consisting of noncash valuation adjustments and amortization of short-lived assets, (ii) an unfavorable mix of business due to the revenue growth in our higher-expense Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses and revenue contraction in our lower-expense Heritage Brands business, and (iii) an increase in marketing expenditures and investments associated with the recent CALVIN KLEIN creative team leadership changes. These increases were partially offset by (i) a reduction of costs incurred in connection with the Warnaco integration and related restructuring compared to 2015 and (ii) a decrease in retirement plan expense resulting from an increase in the actuarial gain recorded in 2016 compared to 2015 (please see Note 12 , Retirement and Benefit Plans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for a further discussion). SG&A expenses in 2015 were $3.418 billion, or 42.6% of total revenue, as compared to $3.714 billion, or 45.1% of total revenue in 2014. The 250 basis point decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue was principally attributable to (i) a decrease due to lower retirement plan expense resulting from an actuarial gain in 2015, as compared to an actuarial loss in 2014, (ii) a reduction of costs incurred in connection with the Warnaco integration and related restructuring compared to 2014 and (iii) a decrease attributable to the results of our Calvin Klein International and Tommy Hilfiger International segments, which generally carry higher SG&A percentages of total revenue than our North American segments, being translated to United States dollars at lower average exchange rates. These decreases were partially offset by (i) the impact of contraction in our lower-expense Heritage Brands business and (ii) an increase in corporate expenses mainly attributable to associate-related benefits. We currently expect that SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2017 will increase compared to 2016 due to (i) the impact of expected faster growth in our Calvin Klein International and Tommy Hilfiger International segments than in our North American segments, as our International segments generally carry higher SG&A percentages of total revenue, (ii) costs related to the Li & Fung termination and (iii) costs related to the relocation of our Tommy Hilfiger office in New York, New York, including noncash depreciation expense. Additionally, our expectation of 2017 SG&A expenses includes a $10 million actuarial loss expected to be incurred in the first quarter associated with the noncash settlement of certain benefit obligations related to our retirement plans as a result of an annuity purchase for certain participants, under which such obligations were transferred to an insurer, while our 2016 SG&A expenses included a $39 million actuarial gain recorded in the fourth quarter. These increases will be partially offset by lower costs expected to be incurred in 2017 as compared to 2016 in connection with the TH China acquisition. Our actual 2017 SG&A expenses may be significantly different than our projections because of expenses associated with our retirement plans. Retirement plan expenses recorded throughout the year are calculated using actuarial valuations that incorporate assumptions and estimates about financial market, economic and demographic conditions. Differences between estimated and actual results give rise to gains and losses that are recorded immediately in earnings, generally in the fourth quarter of the year, which can create volatility in our operating results. Debt Modification and Extinguishment Costs We incurred costs totaling $16 million in 2016 in connection with the amendment of our senior secured credit facilities. Please see the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion. We incurred costs totaling $93 million in 2014 in connection with the amendment and restatement of our senior secured credit facilities and the related redemption of our 7 3/8% senior notes due 2020. Please see the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion. 35 Other Noncash Gain, Net We recorded a pre-tax noncash gain of $153 million in 2016 to write-up our equity investment in TH China to fair value in connection with the TH China acquisition. Please see Note 2, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for a further discussion. We recorded a pre-tax noncash loss of $82 million in 2016 in connection with the Mexico deconsolidation. Please see Note 5 , Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for a further discussion. Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliates The equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates decreased to $100,000 in 2016 compared to $17 million during 2015 and $10 million during 2014. These amounts relate to our share of income (loss) from our joint ventures for the Tommy Hilfiger brand in China (the 55% that we did not own was acquired on April 13, 2016), India and Brazil, for the CALVIN KLEIN brand in India, for the Tommy Hilfiger , CALVIN KLEIN and Van Heusen brands in Australia, and for the CALVIN KLEIN , Tommy Hilfiger , Warner , Olga and Speedo brands in Mexico (since its formation on November 30, 2016). Also included is our share of income (loss) from our investments in the parent company of the Karl Lagerfeld brand ( Karl Lagerfeld ) and, beginning in the third quarter of 2016, in Gazal Corporation Limited ( Gazal ). Our investments in the continuing joint ventures, Karl Lagerfeld and Gazal are being accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Please see the section entitled Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates within Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion. The equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates in 2016 included a one-time expense of $6 million recorded on our equity investment in TH China prior to the acquisition closing. The equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates in 2015 included a one-time gain of $2 million on our equity investment in Karl Lagerfeld. Interest Expense, Net Net interest expense increased to $115 million in 2016 from $113 million in 2015 as the positive impacts from debt repayments made during 2016 and 2015 and the amendment of our senior secured credit facilities in the second quarter of 2016 were more than offset by the negative impact of the interest rate swap that commenced in February 2016 to convert a portion of our variable rate debt under our term loans to fixed rate debt and the issuance of 350 million of 3 5/8% senior notes in June 2016. Please see the section entitled Financing Arrangements within Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion. Net interest expense decreased to $113 million in 2015 from $139 million in 2014 due to lower average debt balances and the effect of the amendment and restatement of our senior secured credit facilities and the related redemption of our 7 3/8% senior notes due 2020 in the first quarter of 2014. Please see the section entitled Financing Arrangements within Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion. Net interest expense in 2017 is currently expected to be approximately $120 million compared to $115 million in 2016, primarily due to the net impact of the issuance of 350 million of 3 5/8% senior notes in June 2016, partially offset by debt repayments made during 2016 and expected to be made in 2017 and the amendment of our senior secured credit facilities in the second quarter of 2016. Income Taxes Income tax expense was as follows: 2016 2015 2014 (Dollars in millions) Income tax expense (benefit) $ 125 $ 75 $ (48 ) Income tax expense (benefit) as a % of pre-tax income 18.6 % 11.6 % (12.1 )% The effective income tax rate for 2016 was 18.6% compared with 11.6% in 2015 and (12.1)% in 2014. The volatility in our effective income tax rate in the last three years is due in large part to adjustments to our liabilities for uncertain tax positions. 36 The effective income tax rate for 2016 was lower than the United States statutory rate due to the benefit of overall lower tax rates in certain international jurisdictions where we file tax returns. Also contributing to the lower effective income tax rate for 2016 was the benefit of discrete items, including the lower tax rate applicable to the pre-tax gain recorded to write-up our existing equity investment in TH China to fair value. The effective income tax rate for 2015 was lower than the United States statutory rate principally due to the benefit of lower tax rates in certain international jurisdictions where we file tax returns and the benefits primarily related to the favorable resolution of uncertain tax positions and the impact of tax law and tax rate changes on deferred taxes, as well as the expiration of the statute of limitations related to other uncertain tax positions. The effective income tax rate in 2014 was a benefit to income principally due to a reduction of $94 million in our estimate for uncertain tax positions, which provided a 24% benefit to our tax rate. This benefit resulted from the favorable resolutions of uncertain tax positions in certain international jurisdictions, as well as the expiration of the statute of limitations related to other uncertain tax positions. We currently expect that our effective income tax rate in 2017 will be approximately 17%, which is lower than the United States statutory rate principally due to the benefit of overall lower tax rates in certain international jurisdictions where we file tax returns. Our tax rate is affected by many factors, including the mix of international and domestic pre-tax earnings, discrete events arising from specific transactions, and audits by tax authorities or the receipt of new information, any of which can cause us to change our estimate for uncertain tax positions. Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest We have consolidated the results of PVH Ethiopia, in which we own a 75% interest, in our consolidated financial statements. The net loss attributable to the redeemable non-controlling interest was immaterial for 2016. We currently expect that the net loss attributable to the redeemable non-controlling interest for 2017 will be immaterial. Please refer to Note 6 , Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for a further discussion. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow Summary Cash and cash equivalents at January 29, 2017 was $730 million, an increase of $174 million from the amount at January 31, 2016 of $556 million. The change in cash and cash equivalents included the impact of $390 million of net proceeds from our issuance of 350 million principal amount of 3 5/8% senior notes in June 2016, offset by (i) $350 million of debt repayments, (ii) $315 million of common stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program, (iii) a $158 million payment (net of cash acquired of $105 million) in connection with the TH China acquisition and (iv) a $100 million contribution to our defined benefit pension plans. Cash flow in 2017 will be impacted by various factors in addition to those noted below in this Liquidity and Capital Resources section, including expected debt repayments of at least $250 million and common stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program of $200 million to $250 million in 2017. As of January 29, 2017 , approximately $395 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by international subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested. Our intent is to continue to reinvest these funds in international operations. If management decides at a later date, or is required under changes to United States tax law, to repatriate these funds to the United States, we may be required to pay taxes on these amounts based on the then applicable United States tax rates, net of foreign taxes already paid. Operations Cash provided by operating activities was $955 million in 2016 compared to $900 million in 2015. The increase in cash provided by operating activities as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by changes in working capital, principally favorable changes related to inventory and accrued expenses, partially offset by an increase in contributions to our defined benefit pension plans. 37 Capital Expenditures Our capital expenditures in 2016 were $247 million compared to $264 million in 2015. Capital expenditures in 2016 primarily included investments in new stores and store expansions, as well as continued investments in operations and infrastructure, including system improvements. We currently expect that capital expenditures for 2017 will be approximately $400 million, which includes a shift into 2017 of expenditures originally expected to occur in 2016. Capital expenditures in 2017 will primarily include expenditures related to the relocation of our Tommy Hilfiger office in New York, New York, as well as significant investments in operations and infrastructure, including upgrading and enhancing our digital commerce platforms and systems related to our supply chain and logistics operations. Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates During the fourth quarter of 2016, we and Grupo Axo formed a joint venture, PVH Mexico, in which we own a 49% economic interest. PVH Mexico licenses from certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries the rights to distribute and sell certain CALVIN KLEIN , Tommy Hilfiger , Warner , Olga and Speedo brand products in Mexico. PVH Mexico was formed by merging our wholly owned subsidiary that principally operated and managed the Calvin Klein business in Mexico (the Mexico business ) with a wholly owned subsidiary of Grupo Axo that distributes certain Tommy Hilfiger brand products in Mexico. In connection with the formation of PVH Mexico, we deconsolidated the Mexico business and began accounting for our 49% interest under the equity method of accounting in the fourth quarter of 2016. We made payments of $ 7 million to PVH Mexico during 2016 to contribute our 49% share of the joint venture funding. Please see Note 5 , Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. In 2014, we acquired an economic interest of approximately 10% in Karl Lagerfeld for $19 million. During 2016, a third party acquired a minority stake in Karl Lagerfeld, diluting our economic interest to approximately 8%. In 2013, we formed with Gazal a joint venture, PVH Brands Australia Pty. Limited ( PVH Australia ), in which we own a 50% economic interest. PVH Australia has licensed from one of our subsidiaries since the first quarter of 2014 the rights to distribute and sell certain CALVIN KLEIN brand products in Australia, New Zealand and other island nations in the South Pacific. As part of the transaction, we contributed to PVH Australia our subsidiaries that were operating the Calvin Klein Jeans businesses in Australia and New Zealand. In 2015, we completed a transaction in which the Tommy Hilfiger and Van Heusen trademarks were licensed for certain product categories to subsidiaries of PVH Australia for use in Australia, New Zealand and, in the case of Tommy Hilfiger , other island nations in the South Pacific. The Tommy Hilfiger trademarks had previously been licensed to a third party and the Van Heusen trademarks had previously been licensed to Gazal. Additionally, subsidiaries of PVH Australia license other trademarks for certain product categories. We made net payments of $21 million (of which $20 million was placed into an escrow account prior to the end of 2014) and $7 million to PVH Australia during 2015 and 2014, respectively, to contribute our 50% share of the joint venture funding for the periods. We received a $1 million dividend from PVH Australia during 2016. During 2016, we acquired approximately 10% of Gazal outstanding capital stock, which is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, for $9 million. In 2013, we acquired a 51% economic interest in a Calvin Klein joint venture in India, which is now known as Calvin Klein Arvind Fashion Private Limited ( CK India ). CK India licenses from one of our subsidiaries the rights to the CALVIN KLEIN trademarks in India for certain product categories. During the first quarter of 2014, Arvind purchased our prior joint venture partners shares in CK India and, as a result of the entry into a shareholder agreement with different governing arrangements between us and Arvind than those with our prior partners, we were no longer deemed to hold a controlling interest in the joint venture. CK India was deconsolidated as a result and we began reporting our 51% interest as an equity method investment in the first quarter of 2014. We made payments of $2 million and $4 million to CK India during 2016 and 2015, respectively, to contribute our 51% share of the joint venture funding for the periods. In 2012, we formed a joint venture, Tommy Hilfiger do Brasil S.A. ( TH Brazil ), in Brazil, in which we own a 40% economic interest. TH Brazil licenses from one of our subsidiaries the rights to the Tommy Hilfiger trademarks in Brazil for certain product categories. We made payments of $2 million to TH Brazil in both 2016 and 2015 to contribute our 40% share of the joint venture funding for the periods. During the third quarter of 2016, we issued a note receivable due April 2, 2017 to TH Brazil for $12 million, of which $6 million was repaid during the fourth quarter of 2016. As of January 29, 2017, the interest rate on the note was 13.00% and the outstanding balance, including accrued interest, was $7 million. 38 Loan to a Supplier Wuxi Jinmao Foreign Trade Co., Ltd. ( Wuxi ), one of our finished goods inventory suppliers, has a wholly owned subsidiary with which we entered into a loan agreement in 2016. Under the agreement, Wuxi subsidiary borrowed a principal amount of $14 million for the development and operation of a fabric mill. Principal payments are due in semi-annual installments through November 29, 2026. The outstanding principal balance of the loan bears interest at a rate of (i) 4.50% per annum until the sixth anniversary of the closing date of the loan and (ii) a rate of LIBOR plus 4.00% thereafter. As of January 29, 2017, the outstanding balance, including accrued interest, was $14 million. Acquisition of TH China We acquired on April 13, 2016 the 55% of the ownership interests in TH China that we did not already own. Prior to April 13, 2016, we accounted for our 45% interest in TH China under the equity method of accounting. We paid $158 million, net of cash acquired of $105 million, as cash consideration for this transaction. Please see Note 2, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion.

Acquisition of Calvin Klein Performance Retail Businesses in Hong Kong and China In 2014, we acquired for $7 million the Calvin Klein Performance retail businesses in Hong Kong and China from a former CALVIN KLEIN sublicensee. The adjustment to the purchase price was finalized during 2015. Tommy Hilfiger India Contingent Purchase Price Payments We reacquired in 2011 the rights in India to the Tommy Hilfiger trademarks that had been subject to a perpetual license previously granted to GVM International Limited. We are required to make annual contingent purchase price payments based on a percentage of sales of Tommy Hilfiger products in India in excess of an agreed upon threshold during each of six consecutive 12-month periods. Such payments are subject to a $25 million aggregate maximum and are due within 60 days following each one-year period. We made contingent purchase price payments of approximately $1 million in each of 2016, 2015 and 2014. The estimated fair value of future contingent purchase price payments was $2 million as of January 29, 2017. Calvin Klein Contingent Purchase Price Payments In connection with our acquisition of Calvin Klein in 2003, we are obligated to pay Mr. Calvin Klein contingent purchase price payments based on 1.15% of total worldwide net sales (as defined in the acquisition agreement, as amended) of products bearing any of the CALVIN KLEIN brands with respect to sales made through February 12, 2018. A significant portion of the sales on which the payments to Mr. Klein are made are wholesale sales by us and our licensees and other partners to retailers. Such contingent purchase price payments totaled $53 million, $51 million and $51 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Based upon current exchange rates, we currently expect that such payments will be approximately $54 million in 2017. Dividends Our common stock currently pays annual dividends totaling $0.15 per share. Dividends on common stock totaled $12 million in each of 2016, 2015 and 2014. We currently project that cash dividends on our common stock in 2017 will be approximately $12 million based on our current dividend rate, the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of January 29, 2017 , our estimate of stock to be issued during 2017 under our stock incentive plans and our estimate of stock repurchases during 2017. 39 Acquisition of Treasury Shares Our Board of Directors authorized a $500 million three-year stock repurchase program effective June 3, 2015. On March 21, 2017, the Board of Directors authorized a $750 million increase to the program and extended it to June 3, 2020. Repurchases under the program may be made from time to time over the period through open market purchases, accelerated share repurchase programs, privately negotiated transactions or other methods, as we deem appropriate. Purchases are made based on a variety of factors, such as price, corporate requirements and overall market conditions, applicable legal requirements and limitations, restrictions under our debt arrangements, trading restrictions under our insider trading policy and other relevant factors. The program may be modified by the Board of Directors, including to increase or decrease the repurchase limitation or extend, suspend, or terminate the program, at any time, without prior notice. During 2016 and 2015, we purchased 3.2 million shares and 1.3 million shares, respectively, of our common stock under the program in open market transactions for $315 million and $126 million, respectively. The repurchased shares were held as treasury stock and $59 million of the authorization remained available for future share repurchases as of January 29, 2017. Treasury stock activity also includes shares that were withheld principally in conjunction with the settlement of vested restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units to satisfy tax withholding requirements.

We also have the ability to draw revolving borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities as discussed in the section entitled 2016 Senior Secured Credit Facilities below. As of January 29, 2017, we had no borrowings outstanding under these facilities. The maximum amount of revolving borrowings outstanding under these facilities during 2016 was $15 million. Capital Lease Obligations Our cash payments for capital lease obligations totaled $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 2014 Senior Secured Credit Facilities On March 21, 2014, we entered into an amendment to our senior secured credit facilities (as amended, the 2014 facilities ). Among other things, the amendment provided for an additional $350 million principal amount of loans under the Term Loan A facility and an additional $250 million principal amount of loans under the Term Loan B facility. On March 21, 2014, we borrowed the additional principal amounts described above and used the proceeds to redeem all of our outstanding 7 3/8% senior notes, as discussed below in the section entitled 7 3/8% Senior Notes Due 2020.

On May 19, 2016, we amended the 2014 facilities, as discussed in the following section. 2016 Senior Secured Credit Facilities On May 19, 2016 (the Amendment Date ), we entered into an amendment (the Amendment ) to the 2014 facilities (as amended by the Amendment, the 2016 facilities ). Among other things, the Amendment provided for (i) us to borrow an additional $582 million principal amount of loans under the Term Loan A facility, (ii) the repayment of all outstanding loans under the Term Loan B facility with the proceeds of the additional loans under the Term Loan A facility, and (iii) the termination of the Term Loan B facility.

There were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facilities. A portion of each of the United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facilities is also available for the making of swingline loans. The issuance of such letters of credit and the making of any swingline loan reduces the amount available under the applicable revolving credit facility. So long as certain conditions are satisfied, we may add one or more term loan facilities or increase the commitments under the revolving credit facilities by an aggregate amount not to exceed the sum of (1) the sum of (x) $1.350 billion plus (y) the aggregate amount of all voluntary prepayments of loans under the Term Loan A and the revolving credit facilities (to the extent, in the case of voluntary prepayments of loans under the revolving credit facilities, there is an equivalent permanent reduction of the revolving commitments) plus (z) an amount equal to the aggregate revolving commitments of any defaulting lender (to the extent the commitments with respect thereto have been terminated) and (2) an additional unlimited amount as long as the ratio of our senior secured net debt to consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (in each case calculated as set forth in the documentation relating to the 2016 facilities) would not exceed 3 to 1 after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such increase. The lenders under the 2016 facilities are not required to provide commitments with respect to such additional facilities or increased commitments. The terms of the Term Loan A facility require us to make quarterly repayments of amounts outstanding under the 2016 facilities, which commenced with the calendar quarter ended June 30, 2016. Such amounts equal 5.00% per annum of the principal amount outstanding on the Amendment Date for the first eight calendar quarters following the Amendment Date, 7.50% per annum of the principal amount for the four calendar quarters thereafter and 10.00% per annum of the principal amount for the remaining calendar quarters, in each case paid in equal installments and in each case subject to certain customary adjustments, with the balance due on the maturity date of the Term Loan A facility. We made payments of $350 million, $350 million and $425 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, on our term loans under the 2016 and 2014 facilities. As a result of the voluntary repayments we made, as of January 29, 2017 we are not required to make a long-term debt repayment until September 2018. We had term loans outstanding of $2.040 billion, net of original issue discounts and debt issuance costs, as of January 29, 2017. Our obligations under the 2016 facilities are guaranteed by substantially all of our existing and future direct and indirect United States subsidiaries, with certain exceptions. Obligations of the European borrower under the 2016 facilities are guaranteed by us, substantially all of our existing and future direct and indirect United States subsidiaries (with certain exceptions) and Tommy Hilfiger Europe B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of ours. We and our United States subsidiary guarantors have pledged certain of our assets as security for the obligations under the 2016 facilities. 42 The outstanding borrowings under the 2016 facilities are prepayable at any time without penalty (other than customary breakage costs). The terms of the 2016 facilities require us to repay certain amounts outstanding thereunder with (a) net cash proceeds of the incurrence of certain indebtedness, (b) net cash proceeds of certain asset sales or other dispositions (including as a result of casualty or condemnation) that exceed certain thresholds, to the extent such proceeds are not reinvested or committed to be reinvested in the business in accordance with customary reinvestment provisions, and (c) a percentage of excess cash flow that exceeds the voluntary debt payments we have made during the applicable year, which percentage is based upon our net leverage ratio during the relevant fiscal period. The United States dollar-denominated borrowings under the 2016 facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, as determined at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the greater of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the United States federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1.00% and (iii) a one-month adjusted Eurocurrency rate plus 1.00% or (b) an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the 2016 facilities. The Canadian dollar-denominated borrowings under the 2016 facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, as determined at our option, either (a) a Canadian prime rate determined by reference to the greater of (i) the rate of interest per annum that Royal Bank of Canada establishes at its main office in Toronto, Ontario as the reference rate of interest in order to determine interest rates for loans in Canadian dollars to its Canadian borrowers and (ii) the sum of (x) the average of the rates per annum for Canadian dollar bankers acceptances having a term of one month that appears on the display referred to as CDOR Page of Reuters Monitor Money Rate Services as of 10:00 a.m. (Toronto time) on the date of determination, as reported by the administrative agent (and if such screen is not available, any successor or similar service as may be selected by the administrative agent), and (y) 0.75% , or (b) an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the 2016 facilities. The borrowings under the 2016 facilities in currencies other than United States dollars or Canadian dollars bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the 2016 facilities. The current applicable margin with respect to the Term Loan A facility and each revolving credit facility is 1.50% for adjusted Eurocurrency rate loans and 0.50% for base rate loans, respectively. After the date of delivery of the compliance certificate and financial statements with respect to each of our fiscal quarters, the applicable margin for borrowings under the Term Loan A facility and the revolving credit facilities is subject to adjustment based upon our net leverage ratio. The 2016 facilities contain customary events of default, including but not limited to nonpayment; material inaccuracy of representations and warranties; violations of covenants; certain bankruptcies and liquidations; cross-default to material indebtedness; certain material judgments; certain events related to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended; certain events related to certain of the guarantees by us and certain of our subsidiaries, and certain pledges of our assets and those of certain of our subsidiaries, as security for the obligations under the 2016 facilities; and a change in control (as defined in the 2016 facilities). During the second quarter of 2014, we entered into an interest rate cap agreement for an 18-month term commencing on August 18, 2014. The agreement was designed with the intended effect of capping the interest rate on an initial notional amount of $514 million of our variable rate debt obligation under the 2014 facilities or any replacement facility with similar terms. Under the terms of this agreement, the one-month LIBOR that we paid was capped at a rate of 1.50% . Therefore, the maximum amount of interest that we would have paid on the then-outstanding notional amount was at the 1.50% capped rate, plus the current applicable margin. The agreement expired on February 17, 2016. During the second quarter of 2014, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a two-year term commencing on February 17, 2016. The agreement was designed with the intended effect of converting an initial notional amount of $683 million of our variable rate debt obligation under the 2014 facilities or any replacement facility with similar terms, including the 2016 facilities, to fixed rate debt. Such agreement remains outstanding with a notional amount of $925 million as of January 29, 2017, and is now converting a portion of our variable rate debt obligation under the 2016 facilities to fixed rate debt. Under the terms of the agreement for the then-outstanding notional amount, our exposure to fluctuations in the one-month LIBOR is eliminated and we will pay a weighted average fixed rate of 1.924% , plus the current applicable margin. During the second quarter of 2013, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a three-year term commencing on August 19, 2013. The agreement was designed with the intended effect of converting an initial notional amount of $1.229 billion of our variable rate debt obligation under our previously outstanding facilities or any replacement facility with similar terms, including the 2016 facilities, to fixed rate debt. Under the terms of the agreement for the then-outstanding notional 43 amount, our exposure to fluctuations in the one-month LIBOR was eliminated and we paid a fixed rate of 0.604% , plus the current applicable margin. The agreement expired on August 17, 2016. The notional amount of any outstanding interest rate swap will be adjusted according to a pre-set schedule during the term of the applicable swap agreement such that, based on our projections for future debt repayments, our outstanding debt under the Term Loan A facility is expected to always equal or exceed the combined notional amount of the then-outstanding interest rate swaps. The 2016 facilities also contain covenants that restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, to take advantage of other business opportunities that may be in our interest or to satisfy our obligations under our other outstanding debt. These covenants restrict our ability to, among other things: incur or guarantee additional debt or extend credit; make restricted payments, including paying dividends or making distributions on, or redeeming or repurchasing, our capital stock or certain debt; make acquisitions and investments; dispose of assets; engage in transactions with affiliates; enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends; create liens on our assets or engage in sale/leaseback transactions; and effect a consolidation or merger, or sell, transfer, or lease all or substantially all of our assets. The 2016 facilities require us to comply with certain financial covenants, including minimum interest coverage and maximum net leverage. A breach of any of these operating or financial covenants would result in a default under the applicable facility. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts then outstanding, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable, which would result in acceleration of our other debt. If we were unable to repay any such borrowings when due, the lenders could proceed against their collateral, which also secures some of our other indebtedness. 7 3/8% Senior Notes Due 2020 On May 6, 2010, we issued $600 million principal amount of 7 3/8% senior notes due May 15, 2020. On March 24, 2014, in connection with an amendment to our senior secured credit facilities discussed above in the section entitled 2014 Senior Secured Credit Facilities, we redeemed all of our outstanding 7 3/8% senior notes and, pursuant to the indenture under which the notes were issued, paid a make whole premium of $68 million to the holders of the notes. We also recorded costs of $14 million to write-off previously capitalized debt issuance costs associated with these notes. 4 1/2% Senior Notes Due 2022 On December 20, 2012, we issued $700 million principal amount of 4 1/2% senior notes due December 15, 2022. We paid $16 million of fees during 2013 in connection with the issuance of these notes, which are amortized over the term of the notes. We may redeem some or all of these notes at any time prior to December 15, 2017 by paying a make whole premium plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, we may redeem some or all of these notes on or after December 15, 2017 at specified redemption prices plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Our ability to pay cash dividends and make other restricted payments is limited, in each case, over specified amounts as defined in the indenture governing the notes. 7 3/4% Debentures Due 2023 We have outstanding $100 million of debentures due November 15, 2023 that accrue interest at the rate of 7 3/4%. Pursuant to the indenture governing the debentures, we must maintain a certain level of stockholders equity in order to pay cash dividends and make other restricted payments, as defined in the indenture governing the debentures. 3 5/8% Euro Senior Notes Due 2024 On June 20, 2016, we issued 350 million euro-denominated principal amount of 3 5/8% senior notes due July 15, 2024. Interest on the notes is payable in euros. We paid 6 million (approximately $7 million based on exchange rates in effect on the payment date) of fees during the second quarter of 2016 in connection with the issuance of these notes, which are amortized over the term of the notes. We may redeem some or all of these notes at any time prior to April 15, 2024 by paying a 44 make whole premium plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, we may redeem some or all of these notes on or after April 15, 2024 at their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. As of January 29, 2017, we were in compliance with all applicable financial and non-financial covenants under our financing arrangements. As of January 29, 2017, our corporate credit was rated Ba1 by Moody with a stable outlook and our issuer credit was rated BB+ by Standard & Poor with a stable outlook. In assessing our credit strength, we believe that both Moody and Standard & Poor considered, among other things, our capital structure and financial policies as well as our consolidated balance sheet, our historical acquisition activity and other financial information, as well as industry and other qualitative factors. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes, as of January 29, 2017 , our contractual cash obligations by future period: Payments Due by Period Description Total Obligations 2017 2018-2019 2020-2021 Thereafter (In millions) Long-term debt (1) $ 3,223 $ $ 289 $ 1,760 $ 1,174 Interest payments on long-term debt 543 109 196 157 81 Short-term borrowings 19 19 Operating and capital leases (2) 2,384 462 729 491 702 Inventory purchase commitments (3) 1,016 1,016 Minimum contractual royalty payments (4) 48 15 24 8 1 Non-qualified supplemental defined benefit plans (5) 12 1 3 2 6 Sponsorship and model payments (6) 17 8 8 1 Total contractual cash obligations $ 7,262 $ 1,630 $ 1,249 $ 2,419 $ 1,964 ______________________ (1) At January 29, 2017 , we had outstanding $2.049 billion under a senior secured Term Loan A facility, which requires mandatory payments through May 19, 2021 (according to the mandatory repayment schedules), $700 million of 4 1/2% senior unsecured notes due December 15, 2022, $100 million of 7 3/4% debentures due November 15, 2023 and $374 million of 3 5/8% senior unsecured euro notes due July 15, 2024. (2) Includes retail store, warehouse, showroom, office and equipment operating leases, as well as capital leases. Retail store operating leases generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts listed include future minimum lease payments and exclude such direct operating costs. Please see Note 16 , Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information. (3) Represents contractual commitments that are enforceable and legally binding for goods on order and not received or paid for as of January 29, 2017 . Inventory purchase commitments also include fabric commitments with our suppliers, which secure a portion of our material needs for future seasons. Substantially all of these goods are expected to be received and the related payments are expected to be made within six months of our year end. This amount does not include foreign currency exchange forward contracts that we have entered into to manage our exposure to exchange rate changes with respect to certain of these purchases. Please see Note 10 , Derivative Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information. (4) Our minimum contractual royalty payments arise under numerous license agreements we have with third parties, each of which has different terms. Agreements typically require us to make minimum payments to the licensors of the licensed trademarks based on expected or required minimum levels of sales of licensed products, as well as additional royalty payments based on a percentage of sales when our sales exceed such minimum sales. Certain of our license agreements require that we pay a specified percentage of net sales to the licensor for advertising and promotion of the licensed products, in some cases requiring a minimum amount to be paid. Any advertising payments, with the exception of minimum payments to licensors, are excluded from the minimum contractual royalty payments shown in the table. There is no guarantee that we will exceed the minimum payments under any of these license agreements. However, given our projected sales levels for products covered under these agreements, we currently anticipate that 45 future payments required under our license agreements on an aggregate basis will exceed the contractual minimums shown in the table. (5) We have an unfunded, non-qualified supplemental defined benefit plan covering certain retired executives under which the participants will receive a predetermined amount during the 10 years following the attainment of age 65, provided that prior to the termination of employment with us, the participant has been in such plan for at least 10 years and has attained age 55. (6) Represents payment obligations for sponsorships. We have agreements relating to our sponsorship of the Barclays Center, the Brooklyn Nets and certain other professional sports teams and athletes and other similar sponsorships, as well as agreements with models and stylists. Not included in the above table are contingent purchase price payments we are obligated to pay Mr. Calvin Klein based on 1.15% of total worldwide net sales, as defined in the agreement (as amended) governing the Calvin Klein acquisition, of products bearing any of the CALVIN KLEIN brands. Such payments are required to be made with respect to sales made through February 12, 2018. A significant portion of the sales on which the payments to Mr. Klein are made are wholesale sales by us and our licensees and other partners to retailers. Such contingent purchase price payments totaled $53 million, $51 million and $51 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Not included in the above table are contingent purchase price payments we are obligated to pay GVM International Limited into 2017 based on a percentage of sales of Tommy Hilfiger products in India in excess of an agreed upon threshold. Such payments are subject to a $25 million aggregate maximum and are due within 60 days following each one-year period. We made contingent purchase price payments of approximately $600,000 during each of 2016, 2015, and 2014. The estimated fair value of future contingent purchase price payments was $2 million as of January 29, 2017. Not included in the above table are contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans, or payments to employees and retirees in connection with our unfunded supplemental executive retirement, supplemental pension and postretirement health plans. Contractual cash obligations for these plans cannot be determined due to the number of assumptions required to estimate our future benefit obligations, including return on assets, discount rate and future compensation increases. The liabilities associated with these plans, together with the liability for the non-qualified supplemental defined benefit plans included in the above table, are presented in Note 12 , Retirement and Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. Currently, we do not expect to make any material contributions to our pension plans in 2017. Our actual contributions may differ from our planned contributions due to many factors, including changes in tax and other benefit laws, or significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates. Not included in the above table are $263 million of net potential cash obligations associated with uncertain tax positions due to the uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows associated with such obligations. Please see Note 9 , Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information related to uncertain tax positions. Not included in the above table are $22 million of asset retirement obligations related to leased office and retail store locations due to the uncertainty of timing of future cash outflows associated with such obligations. Please see Note 21 , Other Comments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information related to asset retirement obligations. Not included in the above table are obligations related to our non-exclusive buying agency agreement with Li & Fung due to uncertainty of the timing and amounts of future cash outflows associated with such obligations. In March 2017, we entered into agreements for a transaction to restructure our supply chain relationship with Li & Fung. The transaction establishes a new strategic partnership with Li & Fung to provide services to us and also provides for the termination of our non-exclusive buying agency agreement with Li & Fung, pursuant to which we are obligated to source certain Calvin Klein Jeans products and at least 54% of certain Tommy Hilfiger products through Li & Fung. The transaction is expected to close July 1, 2017. Not included in the above table are contractual royalty obligations related to our perpetual license agreement with Speedo International Limited. Under the terms of the agreement, our contractual minimum payments each year are $1 million, which is subject to annual increases based on the Consumer Price Index. 46 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect, or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect, on our financial position, changes in financial position, revenue, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. MARKET RISK Financial instruments held by us as of January 29, 2017 include cash and cash equivalents, short-term borrowings, long-term debt, foreign currency forward exchange and foreign currency option contracts and interest rate swap agreements. Note 11 , Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report outlines the fair value of our financial instruments as of January 29, 2017 . Cash and cash equivalents held by us are affected by short-term interest rates, which are currently low. Due to the currently low rates of return we are receiving on our cash equivalents, the potential for a significant decrease in short-term interest rates is low and, therefore, a further decrease would not have a material impact on our interest income. However, there is potential for a more significant increase in short-term interest rates, which could have a more material impact on our interest income. Given our balance of cash and cash equivalents at January 29, 2017 , the effect of a 10 basis point change in short-term interest rates on our interest income would be approximately $700,000 annually. Borrowings under our 2016 facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus a variable rate. As such, our credit facilities expose us to market risk for changes in interest rates. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements for the intended purpose of reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility. As of January 29, 2017 , after taking into account the effect of our interest rate swap agreement that was in effect at such date, approximately 65% of our long-term debt was at a fixed interest rate, with the remainder at variable interest rates. Given our debt position at January 29, 2017 , the effect of a 10 basis point change in interest rates on our interest expense would be approximately $1 million annually. Please see the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources above for a further discussion of our credit facilities and interest rate swap agreements. Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses each have substantial international components that expose us to significant foreign exchange risk. Our Heritage Brands business also has international components, but those components are not significant to the business. Changes in exchange rates between the United States dollar and other currencies can impact our financial results in two ways: a translation impact and a transaction impact. The translation impact refers to the impact that changes in exchange rates can have on our financial results, as our operating results in local foreign currencies are translated into United States dollars using an average exchange rate over the representative period. Accordingly, the impact of a strengthening United States dollar, particularly against the euro, the Brazilian real, the Japanese yen, the Korean won, the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the Indian rupee, the Russian ruble and the Chinese yuan renminbi, will have a negative impact on our reported results of operations. To hedge against a portion of this exposure, we entered into several foreign currency option contracts during 2016. These contracts represent our purchase of euro put/United States dollar call options. The changes in the fair value of these foreign currency option contracts are recognized immediately in earnings. This mitigates, to an extent, the effect of a strengthening United States dollar against the euro on the reporting of our euro-denominated operating results. We expect reductions in revenue and, absent material changes in the fair value of these foreign currency option contracts, in net income in 2017 due to the foreign exchange translation impact of approximately $150 million and $20 million, respectively, based on current exchange rates. The transaction impact on financial results is common for apparel companies operating outside the United States that purchase goods in United States dollars, as is the case with most of our foreign operations. As with translation, during times of a strengthening United States dollar, our results of operations will be negatively impacted from these transactions as the increased local currency value of inventory results in higher cost of goods sold in local currency when the goods are sold. We also have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to certain intercompany transactions and, to a lesser extent, SG&A expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of a particular entity. We currently use and plan to continue to use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to mitigate the cash flow or market value risks associated with these inventory and intercompany transactions, but we are unable to entirely eliminate these risks. We expect a reduction in net income in 2017 due to the foreign exchange transaction impact of approximately $10 million, based on current exchange rates. Included in the calculations of expense and liabilities for our pension plans are various assumptions, including return on assets, discount rates, mortality rates and future compensation increases. Actual results could differ from these assumptions, which would require adjustments to our balance sheet and could result in volatility in our future pension expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.25% increase or decrease in the assumed discount rate would decrease or increase, respectively, 2017 net pension expense by approximately $25 million. 47 SEASONALITY Our business generally follows a seasonal pattern. Our wholesale businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the first and third quarters, while our retail businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the fourth quarter. Royalty, advertising and other revenue tends to be earned somewhat evenly throughout the year, although the third quarter has the highest level of royalty revenue due to higher sales by licensees in advance of the holiday selling season. We expect this seasonal pattern will generally continue. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued in April 2015 an update to accounting guidance related to debt issuance costs. The update requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts. We adopted this update during the first quarter of 2016 on a retrospective basis, which resulted in decreases to prepaid expenses and other assets of $ 8 million and $ 15 million, respectively, as of January 31, 2016 with corresponding decreases in long-term debt. The FASB issued in April 2015 an update to accounting guidance related to retirement benefits. This update provides a practical expedient which allows a company with fiscal years that do not fall on a calendar month-end to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the month end that is closest to the company fiscal year end. If elected, this update should be applied consistently from year to year for all plans. The update became effective for us in the first quarter of 2016. Prospective application is required. We have not elected to change our measurement date under this update. Accounting Guidance Issued But Not Adopted as of January 29, 2017 The FASB issued in May 2014 guidance that supersedes most of the current revenue recognition requirements. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. New disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers are also required. In August 2015, the FASB approved a one year delay to the required adoption date of the standard, which makes it effective for us no later than the first quarter of 2018, with adoption in 2017 permitted. In 2016, the FASB issued several amendments to clarify various aspects of the implementation guidance. The new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period (full retrospective method) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized as an adjustment to opening retained earnings at the date of initial adoption (modified retrospective method). We formed a global, cross-functional project team to analyze the impacts of the guidance across all of our revenue streams. This included review of current accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences that would result from applying the guidance. The majority of our revenue is generated from sales of finished products, which will continue to be recognized when control is transferred to the customer. Our assessment included an evaluation of the impact that the guidance will have on our accounting for royalty and advertising revenue, loyalty programs and gift cards. Under the guidance, our royalty and advertising revenue will continue to be recognized over time. However, we are still assessing the impact of decisions reached by the FASB Transition Resource Group in November 2016 on the treatment of minimum guarantees in licensing arrangements, which may affect the timing of our recognition of royalty and advertising revenue. For loyalty programs, we record costs associated with such programs ratably as a cost of goods sold based on enrolled customers spending. Under the guidance, the revenue associated with the loyalty award will be initially deferred when the loyalty awards are earned and recognized, along with the related cost of goods sold, as the loyalty awards are redeemed or expire. Revenue for the unredeemed portion of gift cards, which is currently recognized when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote, will be recognized under the guidance proportionately over the estimated customer redemption period, subject to the constraint that it must be highly probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. While our assessment of the impacts of the guidance is still in process, the adoption of the guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We plan to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective method. The FASB issued in July 2015 an update to accounting guidance to simplify the measurement of inventory. Currently, all inventory is measured at the lower of cost or market. The update requires an entity to measure inventory within the scope of 48 the guidance at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The update does not apply to inventory measured using last-in, first-out or the retail inventory methods. This update will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2017. Prospective adoption is required. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The FASB issued in January 2016 an update to accounting guidance for the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The update requires equity investments that are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting to be measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income and updates certain presentation and disclosure requirements. The update will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2018 with limited early adoption permitted. The adoption is not expected to have any impact on our consolidated financial statements as we do not currently have such investments. The FASB issued in February 2016 a new accounting standard on leases. The new standard, among other changes, will require lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability in the balance sheet for most leases. The lease liability will be measured at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. The right-of-use asset will be measured at the lease liability amount, adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives received and the lessee initial direct costs ( e.g ., commissions). The guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2019 with early adoption permitted. The adoption will require a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest period presented. We are currently evaluating the standard to determine the impact of the adoption on our consolidated financial statements but expect that it will result in a significant increase to our other assets and other liabilities. The FASB issued in March 2016 an update to accounting guidance to simplify several aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including the accounting for forfeitures, income taxes and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification of these transactions in the statement of cash flows. The update will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2017. We have elected not to continue estimating expected forfeitures in determining compensation expense. With respect to the accounting for income taxes, this update requires, on a prospective basis, recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (resulting from an increase or decrease in the fair value of an award from grant date to the vesting or exercise date) in the provision for income taxes as a discrete item in the quarterly period in which they occur. Currently, excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies are recognized in equity as a component of additional paid in capital. As such, the adoption of this update is expected to impact our Consolidated Income Statements and Balance Sheets on a prospective basis. We recognized, in equity, a tax deficiency of $7 million and a tax benefit of $5 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. These amounts may not be indicative of future amounts that may be recognized subsequent to the adoption of this update, as any excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies recognized will be dependent upon unpredictable future events, including the timing of exercises, the value realized upon the vesting or exercise of shares versus the fair value of the shares when they were granted and applicable tax rates. In addition, these excess tax benefits and deficiencies will be classified as an operating activity in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows instead of as a financing activity, and such classification will be applied on a retrospective basis to all periods presented. The update also requires that the value of shares withheld from employees upon vesting of stock awards in order to satisfy any applicable tax withholding requirements are to be presented within financing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, which is consistent with our current presentation, and will therefore have no impact to us. The FASB issued in August 2016 an update to accounting guidance to clarify and provide specific guidance on how certain cash receipts and cash payments are classified in the statement of cash flows with the objective of reducing existing diversity in practice with respect to these items. Among the types of cash flows addressed are payments for costs related to debt prepayments or extinguishments, payments of contingent consideration after a business combination and distributions from equity method investees. The update will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted. Retrospective adoption is required. Upon adoption, contingent purchase price payments that are currently classified as cash flows from investing activities will be classified as cash flows from operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Otherwise, the adoption of the update is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The FASB issued in October 2016 an update to accounting guidance to simplify income tax accounting on intercompany sales or transfers of assets other than inventory. The existing guidance requires entities to defer the income tax effect of intercompany transfers of assets until the asset has been sold to an outside party or otherwise recognized. The update requires companies to immediately recognize in their income statement the income tax effects of an intercompany sale or transfer of an asset other than inventory. The update will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an annual period. Entities are required to apply the update using a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative catch-up adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption. As of January 29, 2017, we had deferred charges of $8 million related to intercompany sales and transfers of assets recorded in other assets. Upon 49 adoption of this update, other assets will be reduced by the then current amount of deferred charges with a corresponding adjustment to opening retained earnings. The FASB issued in November 2016 an update to accounting guidance to clarify and provide specific guidance on the cash flow classifications and presentation of changes in restricted cash. The update requires that restricted cash be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown in the statement of cash flows. The update will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted. Retrospective adoption is required. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The FASB issued in January 2017 an update to accounting guidance to revise the definition of a business. The update requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of identifiable assets, the set of assets would not represent a business. Also, in order to be considered a business, an acquisition would have to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to produce outputs. Under the update, fewer sets of assets are expected to be considered businesses. The update will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted. We will apply this update to applicable transactions after the adoption date. The impact on our consolidated financial statements will depend on the facts and circumstances of any specific future transactions. The FASB issued in January 2017 an update to the accounting guidance to simplify the testing for goodwill impairment. The update eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any, under the second step of the current goodwill impairment test. Under the update, the goodwill impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The update will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. Prospective adoption is required. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are outlined in Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. We believe that the following are the more critical judgmental areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial position and results of operations: Sales allowances and returns We have arrangements with many of our department and specialty store customers to support their sales of our products. We establish accruals which, based on a review of the individual customer arrangements and the expected performance of our products in their stores, we believe will be required to satisfy our sales allowance obligations. We also establish accruals, which are based on historical data and authorized amounts, that we believe are necessary to provide for sales allowances and inventory returns. It is possible that the accrual estimates could vary from actual results, which would require adjustment to the allowance and returns accruals. Inventories Inventories are comprised principally of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost for principally all wholesale inventories in North America and certain wholesale and retail inventories in Asia and Latin America is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Cost for all other inventories is determined using the weighted average cost method. We review current business trends, inventory agings and discontinued merchandise categories to determine adjustments which we estimate will be needed to liquidate existing clearance inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market. We believe that all inventory writedowns required at January 29, 2017 have been recorded. If market conditions were to change, it is possible that the required level of inventory reserves would need to be adjusted. Asset impairments During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we determined that the long-lived assets in certain of our retail stores were not recoverable, which resulted in us recording impairment charges. In order to calculate the impairment charges, we estimated the undiscounted future cash flows and the related fair value of each asset. The undiscounted future cash flows for each asset were estimated using current sales trends and other factors. If different assumptions had been used for future sales trends, the recorded impairment charges could have been significantly higher or lower. Note 11 , Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report includes a further discussion of the circumstances surrounding the impairments and the assumptions related to the impairment charges. 50 Allowance for doubtful accounts Trade receivables, as presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, are net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable and assessments of collectibility based on historic trends, the financial condition of our customers and an evaluation of economic conditions. Because we cannot predict future changes in economic conditions and in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates and could impact our allowance for doubtful accounts. Income taxes Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. FASB guidance on accounting for income taxes requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors. The actual realization of deferred tax assets may differ significantly from the amounts we have recorded. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Accounting for income taxes requires a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the tax position will be fully sustained upon review by taxing authorities, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For tax positions that are 50 percent or less likely of being sustained upon audit, we do not recognize any portion of that benefit in the financial statements. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Our actual results could differ materially from our current estimates. Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, at the beginning of the third quarter of each fiscal year, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment, called a component. However, two or more components of an operating segment will be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. FASB guidance allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a more detailed quantitative impairment test for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. We may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative test for any reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets. Qualitative factors that we consider as part of our assessment include a change in our market capitalization and its implied impact on reporting unit fair value, industry and market conditions, macroeconomic conditions, trends in product costs and financial performance of our businesses. If we perform the quantitative test for any reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets, we generally use a discounted cash flow method to estimate fair value. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of projected cash flows. Assumptions used in these cash flow projections are generally consistent with our internal forecasts. The estimated cash flows are discounted using a rate that represents the weighted average cost of capital. The weighted average cost of capital is based on a number of variables, including the equity-risk premium and risk-free interest rate. Management believes the assumptions used for the impairment tests are consistent with those that would be utilized by a market participant performing similar analysis and valuations. Adverse changes in future market conditions or weaker operating results compared to our expectations may impact our projected cash flows and estimates of weighted average cost of capital, which could result in a potential impairment charge if we are unable to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets. For the 2016 annual goodwill impairment test, we elected to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it was necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. In evaluating whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, we assessed relevant events and circumstances including, the change in our market capitalization and our implied impact on reporting unit fair value, industry and market conditions, macroeconomic conditions, trends in product costs and financial performance of our businesses. After assessing these events and circumstances, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount and concluded that the quantitative goodwill impairment test was not required. 51 During 2016, and subsequent to the 2016 annual goodwill impairment test, we formed a joint venture in Mexico by merging our wholly owned subsidiary that principally operated and managed the Calvin Klein business in Mexico with a wholly owned subsidiary of the joint venture partner, which resulted in the deconsolidation of our wholly owned subsidiary, including goodwill assigned to the business. This transaction was a triggering event that indicated that the amount of remaining goodwill allocated to the Calvin Klein North America Wholesale, Calvin Klein North America Retail and Heritage Brands Wholesale reporting units could be impaired, prompting the need for us to perform a goodwill impairment test for these reporting units in 2016. No goodwill impairment resulted from this interim test in 2016. For the 2015 annual goodwill impairment test, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test using a discounted cash flow method to estimate fair value. Our annual goodwill impairment test during 2015 yielded estimated fair values in excess of the carrying amounts for all of our reporting units and therefore the second step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test was not required. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we announced our plan to exit the Izod retail business in 2015 (which was completed in the third quarter of 2015). The decision to exit this business was a triggering event that indicated that the amount of goodwill allocated to the Heritage Brands Retail reporting unit could be impaired, prompting the need for us to perform a goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit in 2014. As a result of this interim test in 2014, the goodwill allocated to the Heritage Brands Retail reporting unit was determined to be impaired and an impairment charge of $ 12 million was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually, at the beginning of the third quarter of each fiscal year, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. FASB guidance allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a more detailed quantitative impairment test for its indefinite-lived intangible assets. We may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. When performing the quantitative test, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, which is generally determined using the estimated discounted cash flows associated with the asset use. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment along with other long-lived assets. For the 2016 and 2015 annual impairment tests of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets, we elected to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of any asset was less than its carrying amount. In performing this evaluation, we assessed relevant events and circumstances including industry and market conditions, macroeconomic conditions, trends in product costs and financial performance of our businesses. After assessing these events and circumstances, the Company determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of these certain indefinite-lived intangible assets were less than their carrying amount and concluded that the quantitative impairment test was not required. For certain other indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test using a discounted cash flow method to estimate fair value. No impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted from any of our annual impairment tests in 2016 and 2015. If different assumptions for our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests had been applied, significantly different outcomes could have resulted. There can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing performed in 2016 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. For example, if general macroeconomic conditions deteriorate or otherwise vary from current assumptions (including changes in the weighted average cost of capital), industry or market conditions deteriorate, business conditions or strategies for a specific reporting unit change from current assumptions, including cost increases or loss of major customers, our businesses do not perform as projected, or there is an extended period of a significant decline in our stock price, this could be an indicator that the excess fair value of our reporting units could be lessened and the chance of an impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets could be raised. Pension benefits Included in the calculations of expense and liabilities for our pension plans are various assumptions, including return on assets, discount rates, mortality rates and future compensation increases. During 2016 and 2014, we revised the mortality assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations of our pension plans based on recently published mortality tables. These changes in life expectancy resulted in changes to the period for which we expect benefits to be paid. In 2016, the decrease in life expectancy decreased our benefit obligations and future expense and in 2014, the increase in life expectancy increased our benefit obligations and future expense. Note 12 , Retirement and Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report sets forth certain significant rate assumptions used in performing calculations related to our pension plans. Actual results could differ from these assumptions, which would require adjustments to our balance sheet and could result in volatility in our future pension expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 1% increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return on assets would decrease or increase, respectively, 2017 net 52 benefit cost by approximately $6 million. Likewise, a 0.25% increase or decrease in the assumed discount rate would decrease or increase, respectively, 2017 net periodic pension expense by approximately $25 million. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in our operating results in the year in which they occur. These gains and losses are measured at least annually at the end of our fiscal year and, as such, are generally recorded during the fourth quarter of each year. Stock-based compensation Accounting for stock-based compensation requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock options. This model uses assumptions that include the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of the options. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of our stock options and restricted stock units is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures. The fair value of contingently issuable performance shares that are not based on market conditions is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced for the present value of any dividends expected to be paid on our common stock during the performance cycle, as the contingently issuable performance shares do not accrue dividends prior to the completion of the performance cycle. We record expense for contingently issuable performance shares that are not based on market conditions based on our current expectations of the probable number of shares that will ultimately be issued. The fair value of contingently issuable performance shares that are subject to market conditions is established using a Monte Carlo simulation model. We record expense for the awards that are subject to market conditions ratably over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures, regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class and historical experience. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. Actual results and future estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates.
