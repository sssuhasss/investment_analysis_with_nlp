These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as expects, anticipates, believes, estimates, targets, intends, plans, goal and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as will, may, might, should, would and could. The forward-looking statements made represent the current expectations, plans or forecasts of the Corporation regarding the Corporation future results and revenues, and future business and economic conditions more generally, including statements concerning: expectations regarding actions to be taken by the Federal Reserve; transfers of servicing rights scheduled to occur in stages over the course of 2013 with the delinquent loans scheduled to be transferred after the current loans; that the criteria for inclusion in the Legacy Assets & Servicing portfolios will continue to be evaluated over time; the expectation that approximately $200 million in servicing fees recognized per quarter related to servicing transferred will decrease throughout 2013 as the servicing is transferred and that over time the impact on earnings will be negligible as expenses are expected to also decrease after servicing is transferred, especially the loans which are 60 days or more past due; the expectation that liability management actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2012 will result in pre-tax net interest income benefit of approximately $350 million in 2013; effects of the FNMA Settlement and 2013 IFR Acceleration Agreement; the achievement of cost savings in certain noninterest expense categories as workflows continue to be streamlined, processes simplified and expenses aligned with the overall strategic plan and operating principles; projected New BAC Phase 1 annualized cost savings of more than $5 billion by the fourth quarter of 2013 with the full impact expected to be realized in 2014; the expectation that New BAC Phase 2 will result in an additional $3 billion of annualized cost savings by mid-2015; that the Corporation may conduct additional redemptions, tender offers, exercises and other transactions in the future depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity, regulatory and other factors; the expectation that the Corporation would record a charge to income tax expense of approximately $800 million if the income tax rate were reduced to 21 percent by 2014 as suggested in U.K. Treasury announcements and assuming no change in the deferred tax asset balance; the goal to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital; that the sale of the GWIM international wealth management business and the Japanese brokerage joint venture are not expected to have a significant impact on the Corporation balance sheet, results of operations or capital ratios; the expectation that the Corporation will make at least $319 million of contributions to pension plans during 2013; the expectation that unresolved repurchase claims related to private-label securitization trustees and third-party securitization sponsors will continue to increase; the resolution of representations and warranties repurchase and other claims; the final resolution of the BNY Mellon Settlement; the estimates of liability and range of possible loss for representations and warranties repurchase claims; the possibility that future representations and warranties losses may occur in excess of the amounts recorded for those exposures; that the expiration and mutual non-renewal of certain contractual delivery commitments and variances with Fannie Mae will not have a material impact on our CRES business, as the Corporation expects to rely on other sources of liquidity to actively extend mortgage credit to customers including continuing to deliver such products into Freddie Mac mortgage-backed securities pools; that there will likely be additional requests from monolines for loan files in the future leading to repurchase claims; the belief that increases in requests for loan files from certain private-label securitization trustees and requests for tolling agreements to toll the applicable statutes of limitation related to representations and warranties repurchase claims will likely lead to an increase in repurchase claims from private-label securitization trustees with standing to bring such claims; the disposition and resolution of servicing matters; that implementation of uniform servicing standards is expected to contribute to elevated costs associated with the servicing process but is not expected to result in material delays or dislocation in the performance of the mortgage servicing obligations including the completion of foreclosures; beliefs and expectations concerning the impact of the National Mortgage Settlement; the Corporation belief that the decline in default-related servicing costs will continue to accelerate in 2013; that swap dealers will continue to become subject to additional CFTC rules as and when such rules take effect; that the proposed rule regarding credit risk retention would likely have an adverse impact on the Corporation s ability to engage in many types of the MBS and ABS securitizations conducted in CRES, Global Markets and other business segments, impose additional operational and compliance costs and negatively influence the value, liquidity and transferability of ABS or MBS, loans and other assets; that the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Financial Reform Act) will continue to have a significant and negative impact on earnings through fee reductions, higher costs and new restrictions as well as reductions to available capital; the substance and timing of the final rules implementing Basel 3; the expectation that the Corporation will comply with the final Basel 3 rules when issued and effective; that estimates under the Basel 3 Advanced Approach will be refined over time as a result of further rulemaking or clarification by U.S. banking regulators and as its understanding and interpretation of the rules evolve; that the final rules when adopted and fully implemented are likely to influence regulatory capital and liquidity planning processes and may impose additional operational and compliance costs on the Corporation; the expectation that the Liquidity Coverage Ratio requirement will be implemented in January 2015 and the Net Stable Funding Ratio requirement in January 2018, following an observation period that began in 2011; the goal to seek to maintain safety and soundness at all times, including under adverse conditions, to take advantage of organic growth opportunities, maintain ready access to financial markets, continue to serve as a credit intermediary, remain a source of strength for the Corporation subsidiaries, and satisfy current and future regulatory capital requirements; the goal of mitigating refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of borrowings that will likely mature within any month or quarter; the objective of maintaining high-quality credit ratings; that, if the Corporation analytical models for capital measurement under Basel 3 are not approved by the U.S. regulatory Bank of America 2012 23 agencies, it would likely lead to an increase in the Corporation risk-weighted assets, which in some cases could be significant; that the Market Risk Final Rule and the Basel 3 Advanced Approach, if adopted as proposed, are expected to substantially increase the Corporation capital requirements; that results from using stress scenario assumptions provided by the Federal Reserve will be received from the Federal Reserve on March 14, 2013; that funding trading activities in broker/dealer subsidiaries is more cost-efficient and less sensitive to changes in credit ratings than unsecured financing; that VaR model results will be supplemented if risks associated with positions that are illiquid and/or unobservable are material; the cost and availability of unsecured funding; the Corporation s belief that it can quickly obtain cash for certain securities even in stressed market conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales; the Corporation belief that a portion of structured liability obligations will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date; the Corporation anticipation that debt levels will continue to decline, primarily due to maturities, through 2013; that, of the loans in the pay option portfolio at December 31, 2012 that have not already experienced a payment reset, one percent are expected to reset in 2013 and approximately 23 percent thereafter, and that seven percent are expected to prepay and 69 percent are expected to default prior to being reset, most of which were severely delinquent as of December 31, 2012 ; effects of the ongoing debt crisis in Europe, including the expectation of continued volatility as long as challenges remain, the expectation that the Corporation will continue to support client activities in the region and that exposures may vary over time as the Corporation monitors the situation and manages its risk profile; the expectation that, absent unexpected deterioration in the economy, reductions in the allowance for loan and lease losses, excluding the valuation allowance for PCI loans, will continue in the near term, though at a slower pace than in 2012; the goal of mitigating market risk exposures by using techniques that encompass a variety of financial instruments in both the cash and derivatives markets; the accuracy of forward-looking forecasts of net interest income used in interest rate risk management; and other matters relating to the Corporation and the securities that it may offer from time to time. The foregoing is not an exclusive list of all forward-looking statements the Corporation makes. These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond the Corporation control. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should consider the following uncertainties and risks, as well as the risks and uncertainties more fully discussed elsewhere in this report, under Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report and in any of the Corporation subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission filings: the Corporation ability to resolve representations and warranties repurchase claims made by monolines and private-label and other investors, including as a result of any adverse court rulings, and the chance that the Corporation could face related servicing, securities, fraud, indemnity or other claims from one or more of the monolines or private-label and other investors; the Corporation resolution of remaining differences with the government-sponsored enterprises regarding representations and warranties repurchase claims, including in some cases with respect to mortgage insurance rescissions and foreclosure delays if future representations and warranties losses occur in excess of the Corporation recorded liability and estimated range of possible loss for its representations and warranties exposures; uncertainties about the financial stability of several countries in the EU, the increasing risk that those countries may default on their sovereign debt or exit the EU and related stresses on financial markets, the Euro and the EU and the Corporation exposures to such risks, including direct, indirect and operational; the uncertainty regarding the timing and final substance of any capital or liquidity standards, including the final Basel 3 requirements and their implementation for U.S. banks through rulemaking by the Federal Reserve, including anticipated requirements to hold higher levels of regulatory capital, liquidity and meet higher regulatory capital ratios as a result of final Basel 3 or other capital or liquidity standards; the negative impact of the Financial Reform Act on the Corporation businesses and earnings, including as a result of additional regulatory interpretation and rulemaking and the success of the Corporation actions to mitigate such impacts; the Corporation s satisfaction of its borrower assistance programs under the National Mortgage Settlement with federal agencies and state Attorneys General and under the acceleration agreement with the OCC and the Federal Reserve; adverse changes to the Corporation credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies; estimates of the fair value of certain of the Corporation assets and liabilities; unexpected claims, damages and fines resulting from pending or future litigation and regulatory proceedings; the Corporation ability to fully realize the cost savings and other anticipated benefits from Project New BAC, including in accordance with currently anticipated timeframes; and other similar matters. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Corporation undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statement was made.

Bank of America 2012 25 2012 Economic and Business Environment The U.S. economy began 2012 with momentum in consumer spending, led by stronger vehicle sales and supported by larger private payroll gains. However, over the course of the year, consumer spending slowed and business spending continued to weaken following the expiration of 2011 tax incentives and ongoing uncertainties surrounding fiscal issues in the U.S. and Europe. Payroll gains steadied to a moderate pace, while business profits and cash flows continued to rise throughout the year. The unemployment rate ended the year at 7.8 percent. Equity markets were volatile but finished with appreciable gains in 2012 . The housing sector improved as new and existing home sales rose, home prices increased and residential building activity ended the year with its seventh consecutive quarterly rise. After briefly rising early in the year, bond yields fell as the U.S. economy slowed and economic uncertainties in Europe intensified. The low bond yields also reflected the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) monetary easing and related efforts to keep bond yields low. In December 2012 , the Federal Reserve announced that it would purchase an additional $45 billion per month of long-term U.S. Treasury securities, in addition to its $40 billion per month in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) purchases, and that any policy rate increase would be tied to a 6.5 percent unemployment rate target as long as inflation did not exceed 2.5 percent. Europe experienced financial market turmoil, numerous policy interventions and spreading recession in 2012 . The European Central Bank (ECB) long-term refinancing operations helped calm markets for a time but proved insufficient as emerging stresses generated renewed turmoil. In response to sharply rising sovereign bond yields, the ECB announced its willingness to intervene in sovereign debt markets under specified conditions which calmed markets and pushed down sovereign bond yields. Near year end, the benefits of structural reform, such as lower labor costs and smaller structural budget deficits, were becoming evident in select nations while sovereign spreads stabilized at lower levels. However, widespread recession persisted. Although the Asian economy continued to expand in 2012 , several key nations slowed during the year. China economic growth remained subdued in 2012 , adversely impacting international trade and overall Asian economic performance. Japan economy expanded in the first half of the year but returned to recession in the second half of the year. Recent Events Fannie Mae Settlement On January 6, 2013, we entered into an agreement with Fannie Mae (FNMA) to resolve substantially all outstanding and potential repurchase and certain other claims relating to the origination, sale and delivery of residential mortgage loans originated and sold directly to FNMA from January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2008 by entities related to legacy Countrywide Financial Corporation (Countrywide) and Bank of America, N.A. (BANA). This agreement covers loans with an aggregate original principal balance of approximately $1.4 trillion . Unresolved repurchase claims submitted by FNMA for alleged breaches of selling representations and warranties with respect to these loans totaled $12.2 billion at December 31, 2012. This agreement extinguished substantially all of those unresolved repurchase claims, as well as substantially all future representations and warranties repurchase claims associated with the loans, subject to certain exceptions which we do not expect to be material. In January 2013, we made a cash payment to FNMA of $3.6 billion and also repurchased for $6.6 billion certain residential mortgage loans that had previously been sold to FNMA, which we have valued at less than the purchase price. This agreement also clarified the parties obligations with respect to mortgage insurance, including establishing timeframes for certain payments and other actions, setting parameters for potential bulk settlements and providing for cooperation in future dealings with mortgage insurers. In addition, pursuant to a separate agreement, we settled substantially all of FNMA outstanding and future claims for compensatory fees arising out of past foreclosure delays. Collectively, these agreements are the FNMA Settlement. For additional information, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Representations and Warranties on page 54 and Note 8 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Independent Foreclosure Review Acceleration Agreement On January 7, 2013, Bank of America and other mortgage servicing institutions entered into an agreement with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Reserve to cease the Independent Foreclosure Review (IFR) that had commenced pursuant to a consent order entered into by Bank of America with the Federal Reserve and by BANA with the OCC on April 13, 2011 (2011 OCC Consent Order) and replace it with an accelerated remediation process (2013 IFR Acceleration Agreement). Under the 2013 IFR Acceleration Agreement, the mortgage servicing institutions agreed to make aggregate cash payments totaling $3.8 billion and provide $6.0 billion of other assistance to help borrowers, such as loan modifications and forgiveness of deficiency judgments. The 2013 IFR Acceleration Agreement requires us to make a cash payment of $1.1 billion and provide $1.8 billion of borrower assistance in the form of loan modifications and other foreclosure prevention actions. For additional information, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Other Mortgage-related Matters on page 61 . Sales of Mortgage Servicing Rights On January 6, 2013, Bank of America entered into definitive agreements with two different counterparties, and on February 19, 2013 with an additional counterparty to sell the servicing rights on certain residential mortgage loans serviced for FNMA, Freddie Mac (FHLMC), the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) and private-label securitizations, with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of approximately $317 billion. The sales involve approximately 2.1 million loans currently serviced by us, including approximately 234,000 residential mortgage loans and approximately 24,000 home equity loans that were 60 days or more past due at December 31, 2012. The transfers of servicing rights are scheduled to occur in stages throughout 2013 and are subject to the approval or consent of certain third parties. There is no assurance that all the required approvals and consents will be obtained, and accordingly, some of these transfers may not be consummated. We may conduct additional sales of mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) in the future. 26 Bank of America 2012 At December 31, 2012, we included a positive $342 million in the valuation of our MSRs based on information in the offers we had received on portions of our MSR portfolio. We will recognize as gain on sale any additional increases over the book value of the MSR asset in future periods at the time of the servicing transfers. Our ability to recognize such expected additional increases is subject to the consummation of these servicing transfers and the amount of such benefit will be dependent upon certain factors such as interest rates. Capital and Liquidity Related Matters In the fourth quarter of 2012, we repurchased certain of our debt and trust preferred securities with an aggregate carrying value of $5.2 billion for $5.3 billion in cash resulting in a loss of $110 million upon redemption, partially offset by a related pre-tax net interest income benefit of $57 million. We expect that these liability management actions will result in a pre-tax net interest income benefit of approximately $350 million in 2013. We may conduct additional redemptions, tender offers, exercises and other transactions in the future depending on prevailing market conditions, capital, liquidity and other factors. Performance Overview Net income was $4.2 billion , or $0.25 per diluted share in 2012 compared to $1.4 billion , or $0.01 per diluted share in 2011 . Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis decreased $4.0 billion to $41.6 billion for 2012 compared to 2011 . The most significant driver of the decline was lower consumer loan balances and yields partially offset by ongoing reductions in long-term debt. Noninterest income decreased $6.2 billion to $42.7 billion . The most significant drivers of the decline included a decrease of $5.3 billion in equity investment income, negative fair value adjustments of $5.1 billion on structured liabilities in 2012 compared to positive fair value adjustments of $3.3 billion in 2011 and debit valuation adjustment (DVA) losses on derivatives of $2.5 billion , net of hedges, compared to DVA gains on derivatives of $1.0 billion , net of hedges, in 2012 and 2011 , respectively. These declines were partially offset by significantly lower representations and warranties provision of $3.9 billion in 2012 compared to $15.6 billion in 2011 . The provision for credit losses decreased $5.2 billion in 2012 to $8.2 billion . The decline was primarily in the home loans portfolio due to improved portfolio trends and increasing home prices. Noninterest expense decreased $8.2 billion to $72.1 billion . The most significant drivers of the decline were the absence of goodwill impairment charges in 2012 compared to $3.2 billion in 2011 , and declines of $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion in litigation and personnel expenses, respectively. These declines were partially offset by a provision of $1.1 billion in 2012 related to the 2013 IFR Acceleration Agreement. Included in the income tax benefit for 2012 was a $1.7 billion tax benefit related to the recognition of certain foreign tax credits. For summary information on the Corporation results, see Executive Summary Financial Highlights below and Business Segment Results on page 32 . Table 2 Summary Income Statement (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 Net interest income (FTE basis) (1) $ 41,557 $ 45,588 Noninterest income 42,678 48,838 Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis) (1) 84,235 94,426 Provision for credit losses 8,169 13,410 Goodwill impairment 3,184 All other noninterest expense 72,093 77,090 Income before income taxes 3,973 742 Income tax benefit (FTE basis) (1) (215 ) (704 ) Net income 4,188 1,446 Preferred stock dividends 1,428 1,361 Net income applicable to common shareholders $ 2,760 $ 85 Per common share information Earnings $ 0.26 $ 0.01 Diluted earnings 0.25 0.01 (1) FTE basis is a non-GAAP financial measure. For additional information on this measure, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 35 , and for a corresponding reconciliation to a GAAP financial measure, see Statistical Table XV. Financial Highlights Net Interest Income Net interest income on a FTE basis decreased $4.0 billion to $41.6 billion for 2012 compared to 2011 . The decline was primarily due to lower consumer loan balances and yields, the asset and liability management (ALM) portfolio recouponing to a lower yield and decreased commercial loan yields. Lower trading-related net interest income also negatively impacted 2012 results. These were partially offset by ongoing reductions in long-term debt and lower rates paid on deposits. The net interest yield on a FTE basis decreased 13 basis points (bps) to 2.35 percent for 2012 compared to 2011 as the yield continued to be under pressure due to the aforementioned items and the low rate environment. Noninterest Income Table 3 Noninterest Income (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 Card income $ 6,121 $ 7,184 Service charges 7,600 8,094 Investment and brokerage services 11,393 11,826 Investment banking income 5,299 5,217 Equity investment income 2,070 7,360 Trading account profits 5,870 6,697 Mortgage banking income (loss) 4,750 (8,830 ) Insurance income (loss) (195 ) 1,346 Gains on sales of debt securities 1,662 3,374 Other income (loss) (1,839 ) 6,869 Net impairment losses recognized in earnings on AFS debt securities (53 ) (299 ) Total noninterest income $ 42,678 $ 48,838 Bank of America 2012 27 Noninterest income decreased $6.2 billion to $42.7 billion for 2012 compared to 2011 . The following highlights the significant changes. Card income decreased $1.1 billion primarily driven by the implementation of interchange fee rules under the Durbin Amendment, which became effective on October 1, 2011. Service charges decreased $494 million primarily due to the impact of lower accretion on acquired portfolios and reduced reimbursed merchant processing fees. Investment and brokerage services income decreased $433 million primarily driven by lower transactional volumes. Equity investment income decreased $5.3 billion . The results for 2012 included $1.6 billion of gains which primarily related to the sales of certain equity and strategic investments. The results for 2011 included $6.5 billion of gains on the sale of China Construction Bank (CCB) shares, $836 million of CCB dividends and a $377 million gain on the sale of our investment in BlackRock, Inc. (BlackRock), partially offset by $1.1 billion of impairment charges on our merchant services joint venture. Trading account profits decreased $827 million . Net DVA losses on derivatives were $2.5 billion in 2012 compared to net DVA gains of $1.0 billion in 2011 . Excluding net DVA, trading account profits increased $2.7 billion in 2012 compared to 2011 due to an improved market environment. Mortgage banking income increased $13.6 billion primarily due to an $11.7 billion decrease in the representations and warranties provision. The 2012 results included $2.5 billion in provision related to the FNMA Settlement, a $500 million provision for obligations to FNMA related to mortgage insurance rescissions, partially offset by an increase in servicing income of $1.1 billion due to improved MSR results. The 2011 results included $15.6 billion in representations and warranties provision related to the agreement to resolve nearly all legacy Countrywide-issued first-lien non-government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) repurchase exposures and other non-GSE exposures. Insurance income decreased $1.5 billion driven by the impact of the sale of the Balboa Insurance Company lender-placed insurance business (Balboa) in 2011 and an increase to the provision related to payment protection insurance in the U.K. in 2012 . Other income decreased $8.7 billion due to negative fair value adjustments on our structured liabilities of $5.1 billion compared to positive fair value adjustments of $3.3 billion in 2011 . In addition, 2012 included $1.6 billion of gains related to debt repurchases and exchanges of trust preferred securities compared to gains of $1.2 billion in the prior year. The prior year also included a net gain of $752 million on the sale of Balboa. Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses decreased $5.2 billion to $8.2 billion for 2012 compared to 2011 . The provision for credit losses was $6.7 billion lower than net charge-offs for 2012 , resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses driven by improved portfolio trends and increasing home prices in consumer real estate products, lower bankruptcy filings and delinquencies affecting the Card Services portfolio, and improvement in overall credit quality within the core commercial portfolio (total commercial products excluding U.S. small business). Absent unexpected deterioration in the economy, we expect reductions in the allowance for credit losses, excluding the valuation allowance for purchase credit-impaired (PCI) loans, to continue in the near term, though at a slower pace than in 2012 . For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Provision for Credit Losses on page 109 . Net charge-offs totaled $14.9 billion , or 1.67 percent of average loans and leases for 2012 compared to $20.8 billion , or 2.24 percent for 2011 . Included in 2012 net charge-offs was $596 million related to the impact of new regulatory guidance regarding the treatment of loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and $435 million related to loans forgiven as a part of the National Mortgage Settlement. The decrease in net charge-offs was primarily driven by fewer delinquent loans and lower bankruptcy filings in the Card Services portfolio, as well as lower net charge-offs in the consumer real estate and core commercial portfolios in 2012 . Noninterest Expense Table 4 Noninterest Expense (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 Personnel $ 35,648 $ 36,965 Occupancy 4,570 4,748 Equipment 2,269 2,340 Marketing 1,873 2,203 Professional fees 3,574 3,381 Amortization of intangibles 1,264 1,509 Data processing 2,961 2,652 Telecommunications 1,660 1,553 Other general operating 18,274 21,101 Goodwill impairment 3,184 Merger and restructuring charges 638 Total noninterest expense $ 72,093 $ 80,274 Noninterest expense decreased $8.2 billion to $72.1 billion for 2012 compared to 2011 with the decrease primarily driven by the absence of goodwill impairment charges in 2012 compared to $3.2 billion in 2011 , a $2.8 billion decrease in other general operating expense primarily related to lower litigation expense and mortgage-related assessments, waivers and similar costs related to foreclosure delays, partially offset by a provision of $1.1 billion in 2012 related to the 2013 IFR Acceleration Agreement. Personnel expense decreased $1.3 billion in 2012 as we continued to streamline processes and achieve cost savings. Partially offsetting the decreases were increases in professional fees and data processing expenses due to continuing default management activities in Legacy Assets & Servicing. The prior year also included $638 million in merger and restructuring charges. In connection with Project New BAC, we expect to continue to achieve cost savings in certain noninterest expense categories as we continue to further streamline workflows, simplify processes and align expenses with our overall strategic plan and operating principles. During 2012, we continued implementation of Phase 1 initiatives, completed Phase 2 evaluations and began implementation of certain Phase 2 initiatives. With regard to Phase 1, we expect to realize more than $5 billion of annualized cost savings by the fourth quarter of 2013 with the full impact expected to be realized in 2014. We expect that Phase 2 will result in an additional $3 billion of annualized cost savings by mid-2015. 28 Bank of America 2012 Income Tax Benefit The income tax benefit was $1.1 billion on pre-tax income of $3.1 billion for 2012 compared to an income tax benefit of $1.7 billion on the pre-tax loss of $230 million for 2011 . Included in the income tax benefit for 2012 was a $1.7 billion tax benefit attributable to the excess of foreign tax credits recognized in the U.S. upon repatriation of the earnings of certain subsidiaries over the related U.S. tax liability. Also included in the income tax benefit was a $788 million charge to reduce the carrying value of certain U.K. deferred tax assets due to the two percent U.K. corporate income tax rate reduction enacted in 2012. Our effective tax rate for 2012 excluding these two items was a benefit of seven percent and differed from the statutory rate due to the impact of our recurring tax preference items (e.g., affordable housing credits and tax-exempt income) on the level of pre-tax earnings. The income tax benefit for 2011 was driven by our recurring tax preference items, a $1.0 billion benefit from the release of the remaining valuation allowance applicable to the Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (Merrill Lynch) capital loss carryover deferred tax asset and a benefit of $823 million for planned realization of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets related to the tax basis in certain subsidiaries. These benefits were partially offset by a $782 million charge for the two percent U.K. corporate income tax rate reduction enacted in 2011. The $3.2 billion of goodwill impairment charges recorded during 2011 were non-deductible. On July 17, 2012, the U.K. 2012 Finance Bill was enacted, which reduced the U.K. corporate income tax rate by two percent to 23 percent. The first one percent reduction was effective April 1, 2012 and the second will be effective April 1, 2013. These reductions favorably affect income tax expense on future U.K. earnings, but also required us to remeasure our U.K. net deferred tax assets using the lower tax rates. If the corporate income tax rate were to be reduced to 21 percent by 2014 as suggested in U.K. Treasury announcements and assuming no change in the deferred tax asset balance, we would record a charge to income tax expense of approximately $800 million in the period of enactment, which we expect to be in 2013. Balance Sheet Overview Table 5 Selected Balance Sheet Data December 31 Average Balance (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 2012 2011 Assets Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell $ 219,924 $ 211,183 $ 236,042 $ 245,069 Trading account assets 237,226 169,319 182,359 187,340 Debt securities 336,387 311,416 337,653 337,120 Loans and leases 907,819 926,200 898,768 938,096 Allowance for loan and lease losses (24,179 ) (33,783 ) (29,843 ) (37,623 ) All other assets 532,797 544,711 566,377 626,320 Total assets $ 2,209,974 $ 2,129,046 $ 2,191,356 $ 2,296,322 Liabilities Deposits $ 1,105,261 $ 1,033,041 $ 1,047,782 $ 1,035,802 Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase 293,259 214,864 281,899 272,375 Trading account liabilities 73,587 60,508 78,554 84,689 Commercial paper and other short-term borrowings 30,731 35,698 36,501 51,894 Long-term debt 275,585 372,265 316,393 421,229 All other liabilities 194,595 182,569 194,550 201,238 Total liabilities 1,973,018 1,898,945 1,955,679 2,067,227 Shareholders equity 236,956 230,101 235,677 229,095 Total liabilities and shareholders equity $ 2,209,974 $ 2,129,046 $ 2,191,356 $ 2,296,322 At December 31, 2012 , total assets were $2.2 trillion , an increase of $80.9 billion , or four percent , from December 31, 2011 . Average total assets decreased $105.0 billion , or five percent , in 2012 compared to 2011 . At December 31, 2012 , total liabilities were $2.0 trillion , an increase of $74.1 billion , or four percent , from December 31, 2011 . Average total liabilities decreased $111.5 billion , or five percent , in 2012 compared to 2011 . Year-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management activities, primarily involving our portfolios of highly liquid assets, that are designed to ensure the adequacy of capital while enhancing our ability to manage liquidity requirements for the Corporation and for our customers, and to position the balance sheet in accordance with the Corporation risk appetite. The execution of these activities requires the use of balance sheet and capital-related limits including spot, average and risk-weighted asset limits, particularly within the market-making activities of our trading businesses. One of our key regulatory metrics, Tier 1 leverage ratio, is calculated based on adjusted quarterly average total assets. Bank of America 2012 29 Assets Federal Funds Sold and Securities Borrowed or Purchased Under Agreements to Resell Federal funds transactions involve lending reserve balances on a short-term basis. Securities borrowed and securities purchased under agreements to resell are utilized to accommodate customer transactions, earn interest rate spreads, and obtain securities for settlement and for collateral. Year-end federal funds sold and securities borrowed under agreements to resell increased $8.7 billion due to increases in client short positions and increased collateral requirements. Average federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell decreased $9.0 billion attributable to changes in the investment composition of excess liquidity. Trading Account Assets Trading account assets consist primarily of fixed-income securities including government and corporate debt, and equity and convertible instruments. Year-end trading account assets increased $67.9 billion primarily due to a strategic decision to increase U.S. Treasuries and agency securities. Debt Securities Debt securities primarily include U.S. Treasury and agency securities, MBS, principally agency MBS, foreign bonds, corporate bonds and municipal debt. We use the debt securities portfolio primarily to manage interest rate and liquidity risk and to take advantage of market conditions that create more economically attractive returns on these investments. Year-end balances of debt securities increased $25.0 billion primarily due to net purchases of agency MBS. For additional information on debt securities, see Note 4 Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Loans and Leases Year-end and average loans and leases decreased $18.4 billion and $39.3 billion . The decreases were primarily due to continued run-off in targeted portfolios partially offset by growth in non-U.S. commercial and U.S. commercial loans. For a more detailed discussion of the loan portfolio, see Credit Risk Management on page 79 . Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Year-end and average allowance for loan and lease losses decreased $9.6 billion and $7.8 billion primarily due to the impact of the improving economy and reserve reductions in the PCI portfolio mostly related to the National Mortgage Settlement. For a more detailed discussion, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 109 . All Other Assets Year-end other assets decreased $11.9 billion driven by lower cash and cash equivalent balances. Average other assets decreased $59.9 billion primarily driven by asset sales, lower derivative dealer assets and a reduction in loans held-for-sale (LHFS). Liabilities Deposits Year-end and average deposits increased $72.2 billion and $12.0 billion . The increases were attributable to growth in our noninterest-bearing deposits driven by higher client balances. Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Loaned or Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase Federal funds transactions involve borrowing reserve balances on a short-term basis. Securities loaned and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are collateralized borrowing transactions utilized to accommodate customer transactions, earn interest rate spreads and finance assets on the balance sheet. Year-end and average federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase increased $78.4 billion and $9.5 billion primarily due to funding of trading inventory resulting from customer demand. Trading Account Liabilities Trading account liabilities consist primarily of short positions in fixed-income securities including government and corporate debt, equity and convertible instruments. Year-end trading account liabilities increased $13.1 billion primarily due to higher trading activity in equity securities. Average trading account liabilities decreased $6.1 billion primarily due to a decrease in basis trading on government debt. Commercial Paper and Other Short-term Borrowings Commercial paper and other short-term borrowings provide an additional funding source. Year-end and average commercial paper and other short-term borrowings decreased $5.0 billion and $15.4 billion due to planned reductions in wholesale borrowings. For additional information on Commercial Paper and Other Short-term Borrowings, see Note 11 Federal Funds Sold, Securities Borrowed or Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and Short-term Borrowings to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Long-term Debt Year-end and average long-term debt decreased $96.7 billion and $104.8 billion . The decreases were attributable to planned reductions in long-term debt. For additional information on long-term debt, see Note 12 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements . All Other Liabilities Year-end all other liabilities increased $12.0 billion primarily driven by an increase in customer margin credits. Average all other liabilities decreased $6.7 billion primarily driven by decreases in bank acceptances outstanding and accrued interest payable. Shareholders Equity Year-end and average shareholders equity increased $6.9 billion and $6.6 billion . The increases were primarily driven by earnings, an increase in unrealized gains on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities in other comprehensive income (OCI), and common stock issued under employee plans and in connection with exchanges of preferred stock and trust preferred securities. 30 Bank of America 2012 Cash Flows Overview The Corporation operating assets and liabilities support our global markets and lending activities. We believe that cash flows from operations, available cash balances and our ability to generate cash through short- and long-term debt are sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs. Our investing activities primarily include the AFS securities portfolio and other short-term investments. Our financing activities reflect cash flows primarily related to increased customer deposits and net long-term debt reductions. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $9.4 billion during 2012 due to net purchases of debt securities and planned reductions in long-term debt partially offset by higher federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase and growth in our deposits. Cash and cash equivalents increased $11.7 billion during 2011 due to sales of non-core assets and net sales of debt securities partially offset by repayment and maturities of certain long-term debt. During 2012 , net cash used in operating activities was $13.9 billion . The more significant adjustments to net income to arrive at cash used in operating activities included the net increase in trading and derivative instruments and the provision for credit losses. During 2011 , net cash provided by operating activities was $64.4 billion . The more significant adjustments to net income to arrive at cash provided by operating activities included the net decrease in trading and derivative instruments and the provision for credit losses. During 2012 , net cash used in investing activities was $37.2 billion primarily driven by net purchases of debt securities. During 2011 , net cash provided by investing activities was $52.4 billion primarily driven by net sales of debt securities. During 2012 , net cash provided by financing activities of $42.4 billion primarily reflected an increase in federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase and growth in deposits partially offset by planned reductions in long-term debt as maturities outpaced new issuances. During 2011 , the net cash used in financing activities of $104.7 billion primarily reflected planned reductions in long-term debt as maturities outpaced new issuances as well as the decrease in federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase partially offset by growth in deposits. Bank of America 2012 31 Business Segment Results The following discussion provides an overview of the results of our business segments and All Other for 2012 compared to 2011 . For additional information on these results, see Business Segment Operations on page 37 .

For more information on this measure, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 35 , and for a corresponding reconciliation to a GAAP financial measure, see Statistical Table XVI. CBB net income decreased compared to the prior year. Revenue decreased driven by lower average loan balances, the continued low rate environment, the full-year impact of the Durbin Amendment, lower gains on sales of portfolios and the impact of charges related to our consumer protection products. The provision for credit losses increased as portfolio trends stabilized during 2012. Noninterest expense declined due to lower Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in litigation expense. CRES net loss decreased compared to the prior year. Revenue increased due to a significantly lower representations and warranties provision, an increase in servicing income and core production income, partially offset by a decrease in insurance income. The provision for credit losses decreased due to improved portfolio trends and increasing home prices in both the non-PCI and PCI home equity loan portfolios. Noninterest expense decreased due to a decline in litigation expense, the absence of a goodwill impairment charge and lower mortgage-related assessments, waivers and similar costs related to foreclosure delays, partially offset by higher default-related servicing costs and a provision for the 2013 IFR Acceleration Agreement. Global Banking net income decreased compared to the prior year. Revenue decreased primarily driven by lower investment banking fees, lower net interest income as a result of spread compression and the benefit in the prior year from higher accretion on acquired portfolios, partially offset by the impact of higher average loan and deposit balances and gains from certain legacy portfolios. The provision for credit losses increased as a result of stabilization of asset quality, core commercial loan growth and the impact of a higher volume of loan resolutions in the commercial real estate portfolio in the prior year. Noninterest expense decreased primarily due to lower personnel and operating expenses. Global Markets net income increased compared to the prior year. Sales and trading revenue decreased due to net DVA losses compared to net DVA gains in the prior year. Excluding net DVA, sales and trading revenue increased primarily driven by our fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) business as a result of improved performance in our rates and currencies, and credit-related businesses due to an improved global economic climate, and a gain on the sale of an equity investment. Noninterest expense decreased largely due to a reduction in personnel-related expenses. GWIM net income increased compared to the prior year. Revenue was relatively unchanged as higher asset management fees were offset by lower transactional revenue and lower net interest income driven by the impact of the continued low rate environment. The provision for credit losses decreased driven by lower delinquencies and improving portfolio trends within the residential mortgage portfolio. Noninterest expense decreased due to lower FDIC expense, lower litigation costs and other expense reductions, partially offset by higher production-related expenses. All Other decreased to a net loss compared to net income in the prior year. The change was primarily due to negative fair value adjustments on structured liabilities compared to positive fair value adjustments in the prior year, a decrease in equity investment income and lower gains on sales of debt securities. Partially offsetting these items were a reduction in the provision for credit losses, net gains resulting from the repurchase of certain debt and trust preferred securities and a net income tax benefit related to the recognition of certain foreign tax credits. 32 Bank of America 2012 Table 7 Five Year Summary of Selected Financial Data (In millions, except per share information) 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 Income statement Net interest income $ 40,656 $ 44,616 $ 51,523 $ 47,109 $ 45,360 Noninterest income 42,678 48,838 58,697 72,534 27,422 Total revenue, net of interest expense 83,334 93,454 110,220 119,643 72,782 Provision for credit losses 8,169 13,410 28,435 48,570 26,825 Goodwill impairment 3,184 12,400 Merger and restructuring charges 638 1,820 2,721 935 All other noninterest expense (1) 72,093 76,452 68,888 63,992 40,594 Income (loss) before income taxes 3,072 (230 ) (1,323 ) 4,360 4,428 Income tax expense (benefit) (1,116 ) (1,676 ) 915 (1,916 ) 420 Net income (loss) 4,188 1,446 (2,238 ) 6,276 4,008 Net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders 2,760 85 (3,595 ) (2,204 ) 2,556 Average common shares issued and outstanding 10,746 10,143 9,790 7,729 4,592 Average diluted common shares issued and outstanding (2) 10,841 10,255 9,790 7,729 4,596 Performance ratios Return on average assets 0.19 % 0.06 % n/m 0.26 % 0.22 % Return on average common shareholders equity 1.27 0.04 n/m n/m 1.80 Return on average tangible common shareholders equity (3) 1.94 0.06 n/m n/m 4.72 Return on average tangible shareholders equity (3) 2.60 0.96 n/m 4.18 5.19 Total ending equity to total ending assets 10.72 10.81 10.08 % 10.38 9.74 Total average equity to total average assets 10.75 9.98 9.56 10.01 8.94 Dividend payout 15.86 n/m n/m n/m n/m Per common share data Earnings (loss) $ 0.26 $ 0.01 $ (0.37 ) $ (0.29 ) $ 0.54 Diluted earnings (loss) (2) 0.25 0.01 (0.37 ) (0.29 ) 0.54 Dividends paid 0.04 0.04 0.04 0.04 2.24 Book value 20.24 20.09 20.99 21.48 27.77 Tangible book value (3) 13.36 12.95 12.98 11.94 10.11 Market price per share of common stock Closing $ 11.61 $ 5.56 $ 13.34 $ 15.06 $ 14.08 High closing 11.61 15.25 19.48 18.59 45.03 Low closing 5.80 4.99 10.95 3.14 11.25 Market capitalization $ 125,136 $ 58,580 $ 134,536 $ 130,273 $ 70,645 (1) Excludes merger and restructuring charges and goodwill impairment charges.

We believe managing the business with net interest income on a FTE basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. Certain performance measures including the efficiency ratio and net interest yield utilize net interest income (and thus total revenue) on a FTE basis. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield measures the bps we earn over the cost of funds. We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents an adjusted shareholders equity or common shareholders equity amount which has been reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders equity (ROTE) as key measures to support our overall growth goals. These ratios are as follows: Return on average tangible common shareholders equity measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted common shareholders equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted common shareholders equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTE measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted total shareholders equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Table 7 and Statistical Table XII. In addition, in Table 8 and Statistical Table XIV, we have excluded the impact of goodwill impairment charges of $3.2 billion and $12.4 billion recorded in 2011 and 2010 when presenting certain of these metrics. Accordingly, these are non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, we evaluate our business segment results based on measures that utilize return on average economic capital, a non-GAAP financial measure, including the following: Return on average economic capital for the segments is calculated as net income, adjusted for cost of funds and earnings credits and certain expenses related to intangibles, divided by average economic capital. Economic capital represents allocated equity less goodwill and a percentage of intangible assets (excluding MSRs). In 2009, Common Equivalent Securities (CES) were reflected in our reconciliations given the expectation that the underlying Common Equivalent Junior Preferred Stock, Series S would convert into common stock following shareholder approval of additional authorized shares. Shareholders approved the increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock and the Common Equivalent Stock converted into common stock on February 24, 2010. Statistical Tables XV, XVI and XVII on pages 145 , 146 and 148 provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures with GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation and our segments. Other companies may define or calculate these measures and ratios differently.

Bank of America 2012 35 Net Interest Income Excluding Trading-related Net Interest Income We manage net interest income on a FTE basis and excluding the impact of trading-related activities. As discussed in Global Markets on page 48 , we evaluate our sales and trading results and strategies on a total market-based revenue approach by combining net interest income and noninterest income for Global Markets . An analysis of net interest income, average earning assets and net interest yield on earning assets, all of which adjust for the impact of trading-related net interest income from reported net interest income on a FTE basis, is shown below. We believe the use of this non-GAAP presentation in Table 9 provides additional clarity in assessing our results. Table 9 Net Interest Income Excluding Trading-related Net Interest Income (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 Net interest income (FTE basis) As reported (1) $ 41,557 $ 45,588 Impact of trading-related net interest income (2) (3,308 ) (3,690 ) Net interest income excluding trading-related net interest income (3) $ 38,249 $ 41,898 Average earning assets As reported $ 1,769,969 $ 1,834,659 Impact of trading-related earning assets (2) (449,660 ) (445,574 ) Average earning assets excluding trading-related earning assets (3) $ 1,320,309 $ 1,389,085 Net interest yield contribution (FTE basis) As reported (1) 2.35 % 2.48 % Impact of trading-related activities (2) 0.55 0.54 Net interest yield on earning assets excluding trading-related activities (3) 2.90 % 3.02 % (1) For 2012 and 2011, net interest income and net interest yield include fees earned on overnight deposits placed with the Federal Reserve and, for 2012 , fees earned on deposits, primarily overnight, placed with certain non-U.S. central banks, of $189 million and $186 million . (2) Represents the impact of trading-related amounts included in Global Markets . (3) Represents a non-GAAP financial measure. Net interest income excluding trading-related net interest income decreased $3.6 billion to $38.2 billion for 2012 compared to 2011 . The decline was primarily due to lower consumer loan balances and yields, the ALM portfolio recouponing to a lower yield and decreased commercial loan yields, partially offset by ongoing reductions in long-term debt and lower interest rates paid on deposits. Average earning assets excluding trading-related earning assets decreased $68.8 billion to $1,320.3 billion for 2012 compared to 2011 . The decrease was primarily due to declines in consumer loans, securities purchased under agreement to resell, time deposits placed and LHFS, partially offset by an increase in commercial loans. Net interest yield on earning assets excluding trading-related activities decreased 12 bps to 2.90 percent for 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the factors noted above for net interest income. The yield curve flattened significantly in 2012 with long-term rates near historical lows. This has resulted in net interest yield compression as assets have repriced down and liability yields have declined less significantly due to the absolute low level of short-end rates. 36 Bank of America 2012 Business Segment Operations Segment Description and Basis of Presentation We report the results of our operations through five business segments: CBB, CRES, Global Banking, Global Markets and GWIM , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other . We prepare and evaluate segment results using certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional information, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 35 . The management accounting and reporting process derives segment and business results by utilizing allocation methodologies for revenue and expense. The net income derived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an activity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other methodologies and assumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the business. Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on a FTE basis and noninterest income. The adjustment of net interest income to a FTE basis results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies that are utilized to determine net income. The net interest income of the businesses includes the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. For presentation purposes, in segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, we allocate assets to match liabilities. Net interest income of the business segments also includes an allocation of net interest income generated by certain of our ALM activities. Our ALM activities include an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of various derivatives and cash instruments to manage fluctuations in earnings and capital that are caused by interest rate volatility. Our goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital. The majority of our ALM activities are allocated to the business segments and fluctuate based on performance. ALM activities include external product pricing decisions including deposit pricing strategies, the effects of our internal funds transfer pricing process and the net effects of other ALM activities. Certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific business segment are allocated to the segments. The most significant of these expenses include data and item processing costs and certain centralized or shared functions. Data processing costs are allocated to the segments based on equipment usage. Item processing costs are allocated to the segments based on the volume of items processed for each segment. The costs of certain other centralized or shared functions are allocated based on methodologies that reflect utilization. We allocate economic capital to the business segments and related businesses using a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment credit, market, interest rate, strategic and operational risk components. See Managing Risk on page 66 and Strategic Risk Management on page 70 for more information on the nature of these risks. A business segment allocated equity includes this economic capital allocation and also includes the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the business segment. We benefit from the diversification of risk across these components which is reflected as a reduction to allocated equity for each segment. The risk-adjusted methodology is periodically refined and such refinements are reflected as changes to allocated equity in each segment. For more information on the business segments and reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income (loss) and year-end total assets, see Note 26 Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

Our customers and clients have access to a franchise network that stretches coast to coast through 32 states and the District of Columbia. The franchise network includes approximately 5,500 banking centers, 16,300 ATMs, nationwide call centers, and online and mobile platforms. The Federal Reserve adopted a final rule with respect to the Durbin Amendment, which became effective October 1, 2011, that established the maximum allowable interchange fees a bank can receive for a debit card transaction. The interchange fee rules resulted in a reduction of debit card revenue of approximately $1.7 billion in 2012 compared to a $430 million reduction in 2011. For more information on the Durbin Amendment and the final interchange rules, see Regulatory Matters on page 64 . CBB Results Net income for CBB decreased $2.1 billion to $5.3 billion in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to lower revenue and higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Net interest income decreased $2.3 billion to $19.1 billion due to lower average loan balances primarily in Card Services as well as compressed deposit spreads due to the continued low rate environment. Noninterest income decreased $1.6 billion to $9.9 billion primarily due to a decline in Card Services. The provision for credit losses increased $451 million to $3.9 billion with the increase largely in Card Services. Noninterest expense decreased $926 million to $16.8 billion primarily due to lower FDIC and operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in litigation expense. The return on average economic capital decreased primarily due to lower net income. For more information regarding economic capital, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 35 . 38 Bank of America 2012 Deposits Deposits includes the results of consumer deposit activities which consist of a comprehensive range of products provided to consumers and small businesses. Our deposit products include traditional savings accounts, money market savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, noninterest- and interest-bearing checking accounts, as well as investment accounts and products. Deposit products provide a relatively stable source of funding and liquidity for the Corporation. We earn net interest spread revenue from investing this liquidity in earning assets through client-facing lending and ALM activities. The revenue is allocated to the deposit products using our funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. Deposits also generates fees such as account service fees, non-sufficient funds fees, overdraft charges and ATM fees, as well as investment and brokerage fees from Merrill Edge accounts. Merrill Edge is an integrated investing and banking service targeted at clients with less than $250,000 in investable assets. Merrill Edge provides investment advice and guidance, brokerage services, a self-directed online investing platform and key banking capabilities including access to the Corporation network of banking centers and ATMs. Deposits includes the net impact of migrating customers and their related deposit balances between Deposits and GWIM as well as other client-managed businesses. For more information on the migration of customer balances to or from GWIM , see GWIM on page 50 . Net income for Deposits decreased $300 million to $917 million in 2012 primarily driven by lower net interest income, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Net interest income declined $615 million to $7.9 billion driven by compressed deposit spreads due to the continued low rate environment, partially offset by growth in deposit balances, a customer shift to higher spread liquid products and continued pricing discipline. Noninterest income of $4.2 billion remained relatively unchanged. Noninterest expense decreased $191 million to $10.4 billion as lower FDIC expense was partially offset by higher operating and litigation expenses. Average deposits increased $13.2 billion to $434.3 billion in 2012 driven by a customer shift to more liquid products in a low rate environment as checking, traditional savings and money market savings grew $23.9 billion. Growth in liquid products was partially offset by a decline in average time deposits of $10.7 billion. As a result of the shift in the mix of deposits and our continued pricing discipline, the rate paid on average deposits declined by seven bps to 20 bps.

Mobile banking customers increased 2.8 million in 2012 reflecting a change in our customers banking preferences. The number of banking centers declined 224 and ATMs declined 1,409 as we continue to improve our cost-to-serve and optimize our consumer banking network. Card Services Card Services is one of the leading issuers of credit and debit cards to consumers and small businesses in the U.S. In addition to earning net interest spread revenue on its lending activities, Card Services generates interchange revenue from credit and debit card transactions as well as annual credit card fees and other miscellaneous fees. Net income for Card Services decreased $1.8 billion to $4.1 billion in 2012 primarily driven by a decrease in revenue and an increase in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Net interest income decreased $1.5 billion to $10.0 billion driven by lower average loan balances and yields. The net interest yield decreased 11 bps to 8.93 percent due to charge-offs and paydowns of higher interest rate products. Noninterest income decreased $1.4 billion to $5.2 billion primarily due to lower interchange fees as a result of implementing the Durbin Amendment, lower gains on sales of portfolios and the impact of charges related to our consumer protection products. The provision for credit losses increased $380 million to $3.5 billion in 2012 as portfolio trends stabilized during 2012. For more information, see Provision for Credit Losses on page 109 . Noninterest expense decreased $465 million to $5.5 billion primarily due to lower personnel and operating expenses. Average loans decreased $14.4 billion to $111.6 billion in 2012 driven by the impact of portfolio sales, charge-offs and continued run-off of non-core portfolios.

During 2012 , U.S. credit card purchase volumes increased $1.1 billion to $193.5 billion reflecting higher levels of consumer spending, partially offset by the impact of portfolio sales. Debit card purchase volumes increased $7.8 billion to $258.4 billion reflecting higher levels of consumer spending. Bank of America 2012 39 Business Banking Business Banking provides a wide range of lending-related products and services, integrated working capital management and treasury solutions to clients through our network of offices and client relationship teams along with various product partners. Our clients include U.S.-based companies generally with annual sales of $1 million to $50 million. Our lending products and services include commercial loans, lines of credit and real estate lending. Our capital management and treasury solutions include treasury management, foreign exchange and short-term investing options. Business Banking also includes the results of our merchant services joint venture. Net income for Business Banking decreased $76 million to $343 million in 2012 primarily driven by lower revenue and an increase in the provision for credit losses, largely offset by lower noninterest expense. Net interest income decreased $183 million to $1.2 billion driven by lower average loan balances. Noninterest income decreased $172 million to $492 million primarily due to the transfer of certain processing activities to our merchant services joint venture in 2012. The provision for credit losses increased $36 million to $281 million primarily driven by a slower pace of improvement in credit quality than in the prior year. Noninterest expense decreased $270 million to $888 million driven by lower FDIC and merchant processing expenses. Average loans decreased $3.1 billion to $23.8 billion in 2012 primarily driven by the net transfer of certain loans to other businesses, higher prepayments and continued run-off of non-core portfolios. Average deposits increased $2.2 billion to $42.8 billion in 2012 due to the current client preference for liquidity and the net transfer of certain deposits from other businesses. 40 Bank of America 2012 Consumer Real Estate Services Home Loans Legacy Assets & Servicing Total Consumer Real Estate Services (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 % Change Net interest income (FTE basis) $ 1,361 $ 1,828 $ 1,598 $ 1,379 $ 2,959 $ 3,207 (8 )% Noninterest income: Mortgage banking income (loss) 3,284 2,312 2,247 (10,505 ) 5,531 (8,193 ) (168 ) Insurance income 6 750 6 750 (99 ) All other income (loss) (5 ) 971 268 111 263 1,082 (76 ) Total noninterest income (loss) 3,285 4,033 2,515 (10,394 ) 5,800 (6,361 ) (191 ) Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis) 4,646 5,861 4,113 (9,015 ) 8,759 (3,154 ) n/m Provision for credit losses 72 233 1,370 4,291 1,442 4,524 (68 ) Goodwill impairment 2,603 2,603 (100 ) All other noninterest expense 3,171 4,563 14,135 14,625 17,306 19,188 (10 ) Income (loss) before income taxes 1,403 1,065 (11,392 ) (30,534 ) (9,989 ) (29,469 ) (66 ) Income tax expense (benefit) (FTE basis) 511 396 (3,993 ) (10,400 ) (3,482 ) (10,004 ) (65 ) Net income (loss) $ 892 $ 669 $ (7,399 ) $ (20,134 ) $ (6,507 ) $ (19,465 ) (67 ) Net interest yield (FTE basis) 2.41 % 2.59 % 2.45 % 1.63 % 2.43 % 2.07 % Efficiency ratio (FTE basis) 68.25 77.85 n/m n/m n/m n/m Balance Sheet Average Total loans and leases $ 50,023 $ 54,663 $ 54,731 $ 65,157 $ 104,754 $ 119,820 (13 ) Total earning assets 56,581 70,488 65,288 84,402 121,869 154,890 (21 ) Total assets 57,550 71,508 89,055 118,859 146,605 190,367 (23 ) Allocated equity n/a n/a n/a n/a 13,687 16,202 (16 ) Economic capital n/a n/a n/a n/a 13,687 14,852 (8 ) Year end Total loans and leases $ 47,742 $ 52,371 $ 48,230 $ 59,988 $ 95,972 $ 112,359 (15 ) Total earning assets 54,394 58,819 53,892 73,562 108,286 132,381 (18 ) Total assets 55,463 59,647 76,925 104,065 132,388 163,712 (19 ) n/m = not meaningful n/a = not applicable CRES operations include Home Loans and Legacy Assets & Servicing. Home Loans is responsible for ongoing loan production activities and the CRES home equity loan portfolio not selected for inclusion in the Legacy Assets & Servicing owned portfolio. Legacy Assets & Servicing is responsible for all of our mortgage servicing activities related to loans serviced for others and loans held by the Corporation, including loans that have been designated as the Legacy Assets & Servicing Portfolios. The Legacy Assets & Servicing Portfolios (both owned and serviced), herein referred to as the Legacy Owned and Legacy Serviced Portfolios, respectively, (together, the Legacy Portfolios), and as further defined below, include those loans that would not have been originated under our underwriting standards as of December 31, 2010. For additional information on our Legacy Portfolios , see page 43 . In addition, Legacy Assets & Servicing is responsible for managing legacy exposures related to CRES (e.g., representations and warranties). This alignment allows CRES management to lead the ongoing Home Loans business while also providing greater focus on legacy mortgage issues and servicing activities. CRES , primarily through Home Loans operations, generates revenue by providing an extensive line of consumer real estate products and services to customers nationwide. CRES products offered by Home Loans include fixed- and adjustable-rate first-lien mortgage loans for home purchase and refinancing needs, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) and home equity loans. First mortgage products are either sold into the secondary mortgage market to investors, while we generally retain MSRs and the Bank of America customer relationships, or are held on the balance sheet in All Other for ALM purposes. Home Loans is compensated for loans held for ALM purposes on a management accounting basis with the corresponding offset in All Other . Newly originated HELOCs and home equity loans are retained on the CRES balance sheet in Home Loans. CRES includes the impact of transferring customers and their related loan balances between GWIM and CRES . For more information on the migration of customer balances, see GWIM on page 50 . CRES Results The net loss for CRES decreased $13.0 billion to $6.5 billion for 2012 compared to 2011 primarily driven by mortgage banking income of $5.5 billion in 2012 compared to a loss of $8.2 billion in 2011 . Also contributing to the decrease in the net loss was lower provision for credit losses and a decline in noninterest expense, partially offset by lower insurance income and other income. Mortgage banking income increased $13.7 billion due to an $11.7 billion decrease in representations and warranties provision, and higher servicing income and core production revenue. The provision for credit losses decreased $3.1 billion driven by improved portfolio trends and increasing home prices in Bank of America 2012 41 both the non-PCI and PCI home equity loan portfolios. Noninterest expense decrease d $4.5 billion primarily due to a decline in litigation expense, the absence of a goodwill impairment charge in 2012 compared to $2.6 billion in 2011 , a decline in production and insurance expenses in Home Loans and a reduction in Legacy Assets & Servicing expenses. Average economic capital decrease d eight percent primarily due to a reduction in operational risk driven by the sale of Balboa and a reduction in credit risk. For more information regarding economic capital, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 35 . Home Loans Home Loans products are available to our customers through our retail network of approximately 5,500 banking centers, mortgage loan officers in 375 locations and a sales force offering our customers direct telephone and online access to our products. These products were also offered through our correspondent lending channel which we exited in the second half of 2011 and the reverse mortgage origination business which we exited in the first half of 2011. These strategic changes were made to allow greater focus on our direct-to-consumer channels, deepen relationships with existing customers and use mortgage products to acquire new relationships. Home Loans also included the Balboa insurance operations through June 30, 2011, when the ongoing insurance business was transferred to CBB following the sale of Balboa. Net income for Home Loans increase d $223 million to $892 million primarily driven by a decrease in noninterest expense and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by a decline in revenue. The $1.2 billion decline in revenue was the result of a decrease of $744 million in insurance income as a result of the Balboa sale in 2011 and a $467 million decline in net interest income primarily driven by lower LHFS balances due to our exit from the correspondent lending channel and lower home equity balances. In addition, a net gain of $752 million on the sale of Balboa in 2011 contributed to the decline in revenue. These declines were partially offset by an increase of $972 million in mortgage banking income as higher retail margins more than offset lower originations. The $161 million decline in the provision for credit losses was driven by improved portfolio trends and increasing home prices. The $1.4 billion decline in noninterest expense was primarily due to lower insurance expense as a result of the sale of Balboa, lower production expense driven by lower retail originations and our exit from the correspondent lending channel. Legacy Assets & Servicing Legacy Assets & Servicing is responsible for all of our servicing activities related to the residential, home equity and discontinued real estate loan portfolios, including owned loans and loans serviced for others (collectively, the mortgage serviced portfolio). A portion of this portfolio has been designated as the Legacy Serviced Portfolio, which represents 39 percent, 42 percent and 49 percent of the total mortgage serviced portfolio, as measured by unpaid principal balance, at December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010, respectively. Legacy Assets & Servicing results reflect the net cost of legacy exposures that are included in the results of CRES , including representations and warranties provision, litigation costs, financial results of the CRES home equity portfolio selected as part of the Legacy Owned Portfolio, the financial results of the servicing operations and the results of MSR activities, including net hedge results. The financial results of the servicing operations reflect certain revenues and expenses on loans serviced for others, including owned loans serviced for Home Loans, GWIM and All Other. Servicing activities include collecting cash for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers, and disbursing customer draws for lines of credit and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors and escrow payments to third parties along with responding to customer inquiries. Our home retention efforts, including single point of contact resources, are also part of our servicing activities, along with supervising foreclosures and property dispositions. In an effort to help our customers avoid foreclosure, Legacy Assets & Servicing evaluates various workout options prior to foreclosure sales which, combined with our temporary halt of foreclosures announced in October 2010, has resulted in elongated default timelines. Although we have resumed foreclosure proceedings in all states, there continues to be significant inventory levels in judicial states. For additional information on our servicing activities, including the impact of foreclosure delays, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Other Mortgage-related Matters on page 61 . The net loss for Legacy Assets & Servicing decreased $12.7 billion to $7.4 billion driven by an improvement in mortgage banking income, a decrease in noninterest expense and a decrease in the provision for credit losses. The $12.8 billion increase in mortgage banking income was primarily due to a decrease of $11.7 billion in representations and warranties provision. The 2012 representations and warranties provision of $3.9 billion included $2.5 billion in provision related to the FNMA Settlement and $500 million for obligations to FNMA related to mortgage insurance rescissions. The 2011 representations and warranties provision of $15.6 billion included $8.6 billion in provision and other costs related to the settlement with Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon Settlement) to resolve nearly all of the legacy Countrywide-issued first-lien non-GSE repurchase exposures, and $7.0 billion in provision related to other non-GSE, and to a lesser extent, GSE exposures. The provision for credit losses decreased $2.9 billion due to improved portfolio trends and increasing home prices in both the non-PCI and PCI home equity loan portfolios. Noninterest expense decrease d $3.1 billion primarily due to a $3.0 billion decline in litigation expense, the absence of a goodwill impairment charge in 2012 compared to $2.6 billion in 2011, and $1.0 billion lower mortgage-related assessments, waivers and similar costs related to foreclosure delays. These declines were partially offset by an increase of $2.4 billion in default-related servicing expenses and a $1.1 billion provision for the 2013 IFR Acceleration Agreement. For more information on the 2013 IFR Acceleration Agreement, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Servicing Matters and Foreclosure Processes on page 61 . The increase in default-related servicing expenses was due to resources needed to implement new servicing standards mandated for the industry, including as part of the National Mortgage Settlement, other operational changes and costs due to delayed foreclosures. 42 Bank of America 2012 Legacy Portfolios The Legacy Portfolios (both owned and serviced) include those loans that would not have been originated under our underwriting standards at December 31, 2010. The Countrywide PCI portfolio as well as certain loans that met a pre-defined delinquency status or probability of default threshold as of January 1, 2011 are also included in the Legacy Portfolios. Since determining the pool of loans to be included in the Legacy Portfolios as of January 1, 2011, the criteria have not changed for these portfolios, but will continue to be evaluated over time. Legacy Owned Portfolio The Legacy Owned Portfolio includes those loans that met the criteria as described above and are on the balance sheet of the Corporation. The home equity loan portfolio is held on the balance sheet of Legacy Assets & Servicing; whereas, the residential mortgage and discontinued real estate loan portfolios are held on the balance sheet of All Other. The financial results of the on-balance sheet loans are reported in the segment that owns the loans or in All Other . During 2012, the total loans in the Legacy Owned Portfolio decreased $23.8 billion to $131.1 billion at December 31, 2012 , of which $48.2 billion was reflected on the Legacy Assets & Servicing balance sheet and the remainder was held on the balance sheet of All Other . The decline was primarily related to paydowns and payoffs, but also reflects forgiveness of loans in connection with the National Mortgage Settlement, and charge-offs recorded on loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy under new regulatory guidance implemented during 2012. For more information on the National Mortgage Settlement and the new regulatory guidance, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 80 . Legacy Serviced Portfolio The Legacy Serviced Portfolio includes the Legacy Owned Portfolio and those loans serviced for outside investors that met the criteria as described above. The following table summarizes the balances of the residential mortgage and discontinued real estate loans included in the Legacy Serviced Portfolio (collectively, the Legacy Residential Mortgage Serviced Portfolio) representing 39 percent, 41 percent and 48 percent of the total residential mortgage serviced portfolio, as measured by unpaid principal balance, of $1.2 trillion, $1.6 trillion and $1.9 trillion at December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. The decline in the Legacy Residential Mortgage Serviced Portfolio was primarily related to servicing transfers, paydowns and payoffs.

(2) Includes discontinued real estate loans. Mortgage Banking Income CRES mortgage banking income (loss) is categorized into production and servicing income. Core production income is comprised of revenue from the fair value gains and losses recognized on our interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and LHFS, the related secondary market execution, and costs related to representations and warranties in the sales transactions along with other obligations incurred in the sales of mortgage loans. Ongoing costs related to representations and warranties and other obligations that were incurred in the sales of mortgage loans in prior periods are also included in production income. Servicing income includes income earned in connection with servicing activities and MSR valuation adjustments, net of results from risk management activities used to hedge certain market risks of the MSRs. The costs associated with our servicing activities are included in noninterest expense. Bank of America 2012 43 The table below summarizes the components of mortgage banking income (loss).

(2) Includes gains (losses) on sales of MSRs. (3) Includes the effect of transfers of mortgage loans from CRES to the ALM portfolio in All Other . CRES first mortgage loan originations declined $80.8 billion , or 58 percent , primarily as a result of our exit from the correspondent lending channel in 2011. CRES retail first mortgage loan originations were $58.5 billion in 2012 compared to $67.8 billion in 2011 , excluding correspondent lending, reflecting a drop in estimated retail market share as the overall market for mortgages increased. Our decline in market share was primarily due to our decision to price loan products in order to manage our fulfillment capacity. Core production revenue increase d $933 million to $3.7 billion as the impact of our exit from the correspondent lending channel and the decline in retail originations were more than offset by higher retail margins. On an industry-wide basis margins increased as historically low mortgage rates drove strong consumer demand for refinance transactions at a time when most lenders had capacity constraints which, combined with our pricing strategy, contributed to higher retail margins. In addition, a higher proportion of refinance transactions, particularly Home Affordable Refinance Programs (HARP), contributed to higher margins. During 2012 , 84 percent of our first mortgage production volume was for refinance originations and 16 percent was for purchase originations compared to 60 percent and 40 percent in 2011 . The representations and warranties provision decrease d $11.7 billion to $3.9 billion as described earlier in this section. Net servicing income increased $1.1 billion to $5.7 billion primarily due to $1.2 billion in improved MSR results, net of hedges, and $1.1 billion in reduced impact of customer payments driven by a lower MSR asset, partially offset by a $1.3 billion decrease in servicing fees primarily due to a reduction in the size of the servicing portfolio.

(2) Servicing of residential mortgage loans, HELOCs, home equity loans and discontinued real estate mortgage loans. (3) The mortgage serviced portfolio at December 31, 2010 was $2,057 billion. Retail first mortgage loan originations for the total Corporation were $75.1 billion for 2012 compared to $80.3 billion for 2011 , excluding correspondent lending. The decrease was primarily driven by our decision to price loan products in order to manage our fulfillment capacity. Home equity production was $3.6 billion for 2012 compared to $4.4 billion for 2011 primarily due to our decision to exit the reverse mortgage business. 44 Bank of America 2012 Mortgage Servicing Rights At December 31, 2012 , the consumer MSR balance was $5.7 billion , which represented 55 bps of the related unpaid principal balance compared to $7.4 billion or 54 bps of the related unpaid principal balance at December 31, 2011 . The consumer MSR balance decreased $1.7 billion during 2012 primarily driven by lower mortgage rates, which resulted in higher forecasted prepayment speeds and the change in the MSR asset value due to customer payments received during the period. During 2012 , the fair value changes of MSRs, net of results from risk management activities used to hedge certain market risks of the MSRs, were a positive $1.8 billion as the positive hedge results more than offset the impact of the market valuation decline on the MSR balance. The hedges outperformed the MSRs due to significant upward price movements in the MBS market in the later part of 2012. For additional information on our servicing activities, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Servicing Matters and Foreclosure Processes on page 61 . For additional information on MSRs, see Note 24 Mortgage Servicing Rights to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Sales of Mortgage Servicing Rights On January 6, 2013, Bank of America entered into definitive agreements with two different counterparties, and on February 19, 2013 with an additional counterparty to sell the servicing rights on certain residential mortgage loans serviced for others, with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of approximately $317 billion. The sales involve approximately 2.1 million loans currently serviced by us, including approximately 234,000 residential mortgage loans and approximately 24,000 home equity loans that were 60 days or more past due at December 31, 2012 . The transfers of servicing rights are scheduled to occur in stages throughout 2013 with the delinquent loans scheduled to be transferred after the current loans. Currently, we recognize approximately $200 million in servicing revenues per quarter associated with these loans, which is expected to decrease throughout 2013 as we transfer the servicing rights. Over time we expect the impact on earnings to be negligible as we expect expenses to also decrease after we transfer the servicing rights, especially for loans that are 60 days or more past due. For additional information on servicing sales, see Recent Events Sale of Mortgage Servicing Rights on page 26 .

Our lending products and services include commercial loans, leases, commitment facilities, trade finance, real estate lending, asset-based lending and direct/indirect consumer loans. Our treasury solutions business includes treasury management, foreign exchange and short-term investing options. We also work with our clients to provide investment banking products such as debt and equity underwriting and distribution, and merger-related and other advisory services. Underwriting debt and equity issuances, fixed-income and equity research, and certain market-based activities are executed through our global broker/dealer affiliates which are our primary dealers in several countries. Within Global Banking, Global Commercial Banking clients generally include middle-market companies, commercial real estate firms, auto dealerships, not-for-profit companies, federal and state governments, and municipalities. Global Corporate Banking includes large global corporations, financial institutions and leasing clients. Net income for Global Banking decreased $321 million to $5.7 billion in 2012 compared to 2011 driven by an increase in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Revenue decreased $105 million in 2012 primarily due to lower investment banking fees, lower net interest income as a result of spread compression and the benefit in the prior year from higher accretion on acquired portfolios, partially offset by the impact of higher average loan and deposit balances and gains from certain legacy portfolios. The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $103 million in 2012 compared to a benefit of $1.1 billion in 2011 . The $1.0 billion reduction in benefit was primarily as a result of stabilization of asset quality, core commercial loan growth and the impact of a higher volume of loan resolutions in the commercial real estate portfolio in the prior year. Noninterest expense decreased $576 million in 2012 primarily due to lower personnel and operating expenses. Average loans and leases increased $7.1 billion in 2012 primarily driven by growth in U.S. and non-U.S. commercial and industrial loans in large corporate and middle-market segments, specialized industries and trade finance, partially offset by managed reductions in commercial real estate. Average deposits increased $12.0 billion in 2012 as balances continued to grow from client liquidity, growth in international balances and limited alternative investment options. The return on average economic capital increased in 2012 as a decrease in average economic capital was partially offset by lower net income. Average economic capital decreased primarily due to a reduction in credit risk driven by decreases in reservable 46 Bank of America 2012 criticized balances and NPAs.

Global Treasury Services revenue increased $122 million in Global Corporate Banking and $72 million in Global Commercial Banking in 2012 as growth in U.S. and non-U.S. deposit balances and higher service charges offset the impact of the low rate environment. Business Lending revenue in Global Corporate Banking remained relatively unchanged in 2012 compared to 2011 as lower net interest income impacted by the low rate environment and lower accretion on acquired portfolios was offset by growth in the loan portfolio and gains on fair value option loans. Business Lending revenue decreased $411 million in Global Commercial Banking as managed reductions of commercial real estate criticized assets, run-off of a liquidating auto loan portfolio and lower accretion on acquired portfolios were partially offset by increases in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio. Average loans and leases in Global Corporate and Global Commercial Banking increased three percent in 2012 driven by growth in U.S. and non-U.S. commercial and industrial loans from greater client demand, partially offset by managed reductions of commercial real estate criticized assets and run-off of a liquidating auto loan portfolio. Average deposits in Global Corporate and Global Commercial Banking increased five percent in 2012 compared to 2011 as balances continued to grow due to client liquidity, international growth and limited alternative investment options. Investment Banking Client teams and product specialists underwrite and distribute debt, equity and other loan products, and provide advisory services and tailored risk management solutions. The economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Banking and Global Markets based on the contribution by and involvement of each segment. To provide a complete discussion of our consolidated investment banking fees, the table below presents total Corporation investment banking fees as well as the portion attributable to Global Banking. Investment Banking Fees Global Banking Total Corporation (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 2012 2011 Products Advisory $ 995 $ 1,183 $ 1,066 $ 1,248 Debt issuance 1,385 1,287 3,362 2,878 Equity issuance 407 591 1,026 1,459 Gross investment banking fees $ 2,787 $ 3,061 $ 5,454 $ 5,585 Self-led (42 ) (164 ) (155 ) (368 ) Total investment banking fees $ 2,745 $ 2,897 $ 5,299 $ 5,217 Total Corporation investment banking fees, excluding self-led deals remained relatively unchanged in 2012 compared to 2011 as higher debt issuance fees partially offset lower equity issuance and advisory fees.

Global Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both the primary and secondary markets. Global Markets provides market-making, financing, securities clearing, settlement and custody services globally to our institutional investor clients in support of their investing and trading activities. We also work with our commercial and corporate clients to provide risk management products using interest rate, equity, credit, currency and commodity derivatives, foreign exchange, fixed-income and mortgage-related products. As a result of our market-making activities in these products, we may be required to manage risk in government securities, equity and equity-linked securities, high-grade and high-yield corporate debt securities, commercial paper, MBS, commodities and asset-backed securities (ABS). In addition, the economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Markets and Global Banking based on the activities performed by each segment. Global Banking originates certain deal-related transactions with our corporate and commercial clients that are executed and distributed by Global Markets . For additional information on investment banking fees on a consolidated basis, see page 47 . Net income for Global Markets increased $66 million to $1.1 billion in 2012 compared to 2011 . In 2012 , net DVA losses were $2.4 billion compared to net DVA gains of $1.0 billion in 2011 . Excluding net DVA, net income increased $2.2 billion to $2.6 billion primarily driven by higher sales and trading revenue. Noninterest expense decreased $1.4 billion to $10.8 billion due to a reduction in personnel-related expenses, brokerage, clearing and exchange fees, and other operating expenses. The income tax expense in 2012 included a $781 million charge for remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets due to decreases in the U.K. corporate tax rate compared to a similar charge of $774 million in 2011 . Year-end assets increased $113.4 billion in 2012 to $615.3 billion at December 31, 2012 largely driven by increased client-facing activity in the equity business as well as increases in trading-related assets and securities borrowed transactions. Average economic capital decreased due to a decline in the risk composition of trading-related balances. The return on average economic capital increased primarily due to higher net income and a decline in average economic capital. For more information regarding economic capital, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 35 . 48 Bank of America 2012 Sales and Trading Revenue Sales and trading revenue includes unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading and other assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. The table below and related discussion present total sales and trading revenue, substantially all of which is in Global Markets with the remainder in Global Banking . Sales and trading revenue is segregated into fixed income (government debt obligations, investment and non-investment grade corporate debt obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities, RMBS and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)), currencies (interest rate and foreign exchange contracts), commodities (primarily futures, forwards, swaps and options) and equity income from equity-linked derivatives and cash equity activity. Sales and Trading Revenue (1, 2) (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 Sales and trading revenue Fixed income, currencies and commodities $ 8,812 $ 8,897 Equities 3,014 3,957 Total sales and trading revenue $ 11,826 $ 12,854 Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA (3) Fixed income, currencies and commodities $ 11,007 $ 8,103 Equities 3,267 3,750 Total sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA $ 14,274 $ 11,853 (1) Includes FTE adjustments of $219 million and $204 million for 2012 and 2011 . For additional information on sales and trading revenue, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) Includes Global Banking sales and trading revenue of $521 million and $270 million for 2012 and 2011 . (3) Sales and trading revenue, excluding DVA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Net DVA losses included in FICC revenue and equities revenue were $2.2 billion and $253 million in 2012 compared to net DVA gains of $794 million and $207 million in 2011 . FICC revenue, including net DVA, remained relatively unchanged in 2012 compared to 2011 . Excluding net DVA, FICC revenue increased $2.9 billion to $11.0 billion driven by our rates and currencies business as a result of stronger client flows and improved positioning, a gain on the sale of an equity investment, an improved global economic climate resulting in tightening of spreads in credit markets as well as higher trading volume reflecting an increase in investor confidence. This was partially offset by our exit from the stand-alone proprietary trading business in June 2011. Equities revenue, including net DVA, decreased $943 million to $3.0 billion . Excluding net DVA, equities revenue decreased $483 million to $3.3 billion as equity market volumes remained at low levels impacting commissions. Sales and trading revenue included total commissions and brokerage fee revenue of $1.8 billion in 2012 compared to $2.2 billion in 2011 , substantially all from equities in both years. The $429 million decrease in commissions and brokerage fee revenue was primarily due to lower equity market volumes.

MLGWM advisory business provides a high-touch client experience through a network of financial advisors focused on clients with over $250,000 in total investable assets. MLGWM provides tailored solutions to meet our clients needs through a full set of brokerage, banking and retirement products. U.S. Trust, together with MLGWM Private Banking & Investments Group, provides comprehensive wealth management solutions targeted to wealthy and ultra-wealthy clients with investable assets of more than $5 million, as well as customized solutions to meet clients wealth structuring, investment management, trust and banking needs, including specialty asset management services. In 2012, the Corporation entered into an agreement to sell the GWIM International Wealth Management (IWM) businesses based outside of the U.S., subject to regulatory approval in multiple jurisdictions, and the first of a series of closings occurred in February 2013. Also, in late 2012, the Corporation sold its investment in a Japanese brokerage joint venture which resulted in a gain of approximately $370 million. The IWM businesses and the Japanese brokerage joint venture had combined client balances of approximately $115 billion. These transactions will not have a significant impact on the Corporation balance sheet, results of operations or capital ratios. As a result of these actions, the results of these businesses were moved to All Other and the prior periods have been reclassified. Net income increased $505 million to $2.2 billion in 2012 compared to 2011 driven by lower noninterest expense and lower provision for credit losses. Revenue was relatively unchanged as higher asset management fees due to long-term assets under management (AUM) flows and higher market levels were offset by lower transactional revenue and lower net interest income driven by the impact of the continued low rate environment. The provision for credit losses decreased $132 million to $266 million driven by lower delinquencies and improving portfolio trends within the residential mortgage portfolio. Noninterest expense decreased $628 million to $12.8 billion due to lower FDIC expense, lower litigation costs and other expense reductions, partially offset by higher production-related expenses. In 2012 , revenue from MLGWM was $13.8 billion , up one percent , due to higher noninterest income. Revenue from U.S. Trust was $2.6 billion , down four percent , driven by lower net interest income. The return on average economic capital increased as higher net income offset the increase in average economic capital. Average economic capital was higher primarily due to loan growth. For more information regarding economic capital, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 35 . 50 Bank of America 2012 Migration Summary GWIM results are impacted by the migration of clients and their related deposit and loan balances to or from CBB , CRES and the ALM portfolio, as presented in the table below. Migration in 2011 included the movement of balances to Merrill Edge, which is included in CBB . Subsequent to the date of the migration, the associated net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense are recorded in the business to which the clients migrated. Migration Summary (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 Average Total deposits GWIM from / (to) CBB $ 407 $ (2,032 ) Total loans GWIM to CRES and the ALM portfolio (225 ) (174 ) Year end Total deposits GWIM from / (to) CBB $ 1,170 $ (2,918 ) Total loans GWIM to CRES and the ALM portfolio (335 ) (299 ) Client Balances The table below presents client balances which consist of AUM, brokerage assets, assets in custody, deposits, and loans and leases.

The increase of $136.2 billion , or seven percent , in client balances was primarily driven by higher market levels and inflows into long-term AUM, as well as increases in deposits and loans.

Such allocated assets were $520.5 billion and $496.1 billion for 2012 and 2011 , and $554.4 billion and $492.3 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . (2) Represents the economic capital assigned to All Other as well as the remaining portion of equity not specifically allocated to the business segments. Allocated equity increased due to the disposition of certain assets, as previously disclosed. n/m = not meaningful All Other consists of ALM activities, equity investments, liquidating businesses and other. ALM activities encompass the whole-loan residential mortgage portfolio and investment securities, interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities including the residual net interest income allocation, gains/losses on structured liabilities, and the impact of certain allocation methodologies and accounting hedge ineffectiveness. For more information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for Nontrading Activities on page 117 . Equity investments include Global Principal Investments (GPI) which is comprised of a diversified portfolio of equity, real estate and other alternative investments. These investments are made either directly in a company or held through a fund with related income recorded in equity investment income. Equity investments also include strategic investments, which include our investment in CCB in which we currently hold approximately one percent of the outstanding common shares, and certain other investments. Other includes certain residential mortgage and discontinued real estate loans that are managed by Legacy Assets & Servicing. In 2012, the Corporation entered into an agreement to sell the GWIM IWM businesses based outside of the U.S. and sold its Japanese brokerage joint venture. As a result of these actions, the IWM businesses and the Japanese brokerage joint venture results were moved from GWIM to All Other and the prior periods have been reclassified. 52 Bank of America 2012 The net loss for All Other of $3.6 billion in 2012 compared to net income of $4.7 billion in 2011 was primarily due to negative fair value adjustments on structured liabilities of $5.1 billion related to the improvement in our credit spreads during 2012 compared to $3.3 billion of positive fair value adjustments in 2011 , a $6.0 billion decrease in equity investment income and $1.6 billion of lower gains on sales of debt securities. Partially offsetting these items were a $3.6 billion reduction in the provision for credit losses, $1.6 billion of net gains resulting from repurchases of certain debt and trust preferred securities in 2012 and a net income tax benefit of $1.7 billion related to the recognition of certain foreign tax credits. Equity investment income decreased as 2011 included a $6.5 billion gain on the sale of a portion of our investment in CCB, an $836 million CCB dividend and a $377 million gain on the sale of our investment in BlackRock. Partially offsetting these items were an impairment write-down of $1.1 billion on our merchant services joint venture in 2011 and a $370 million gain related to the sale of the Japanese brokerage joint venture in 2012. The provision for credit losses decreased $3.6 billion to $2.6 billion in 2012 primarily driven by continued improvement in credit quality in the residential mortgage portfolio and reserve reductions in 2012 compared to reserve additions in 2011 in the Countrywide PCI discontinued real estate and residential mortgage portfolios driven by an improved home price outlook. All other noninterest expense increased $1.1 billion to $6.1 billion due to higher litigation expense primarily related to the costs associated with the settlement of a class action lawsuit during 2012 brought on behalf of investors who purchased or held Bank of America equity securities at the time we announced plans to acquire Merrill Lynch and other litigation, partially offset by a decrease in personnel expense. Excluding litigation expense, all other noninterest expense decreased compared to 2011 . There were no merger and restructuring expenses for 2012 compared to $638 million in 2011 . A goodwill impairment charge of $581 million was recorded during 2011 as a result of a change in the estimated value of the European consumer card business. The income tax benefit was $5.9 billion in 2012 compared to a benefit of $1.0 billion in 2011 . Included in the income tax benefit for 2012 was a $1.7 billion tax benefit attributable to the excess of foreign tax credits recognized in the U.S. upon repatriation of the earnings of certain subsidiaries over the related U.S. tax liability, and 2011 included the release of a valuation allowance applicable to a Merrill Lynch capital loss carryforward deferred tax asset. The tables below present the components of equity investments in All Other at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , and also a reconciliation to the total consolidated equity investment income for 2012 and 2011 . Equity Investments December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 Global Principal Investments $ 3,470 $ 5,659 Strategic and other investments 2,038 1,439 Total equity investments included in All Other $ 5,508 $ 7,098 Equity Investment Income (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 Global Principal Investments $ 589 $ 399 Strategic and other investments 546 6,706 Total equity investment income included in All Other 1,135 7,105 Total equity investment income included in the business segments 935 255 Total consolidated equity investment income $ 2,070 $ 7,360 Equity investments included in All Other decreased $1.6 billion to $5.5 billion during 2012 , with the decrease due to sales in the GPI portfolio. In connection with the Corporation strategy to reduce risk-weighted assets, we sold certain investments, including related commitments. GPI had unfunded equity commitments of $224 million at December 31, 2012 compared to $710 million at December 31, 2011 . The increase in equity investment income in the business segments for 2012 was primarily driven by gains on the sale of an equity investment in Global Markets . At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , we owned 2.0 billion shares representing approximately one percent of CCB. Sales restrictions on these shares continue until August 2013. Because the sales restrictions on these shares will expire within one year, these securities are accounted for as AFS marketable equity securities and are carried at fair value with the after-tax unrealized gain reflected in accumulated OCI. As a result, a pre-tax unrealized gain of $718 million, or $452 million after-tax, was reflected in accumulated OCI. At December 31, 2012 , the cost basis was $716 million and the carrying value and the fair value were $1.4 billion . During 2011, we sold 23.6 billion common shares of our investment in CCB and recorded a pre-tax gain of $6.5 billion . For additional information, see Note 4 Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Bank of America 2012 53 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. Obligations that are legally binding agreements whereby we agree to purchase products or services with a specific minimum quantity at a fixed, minimum or variable price over a specified period of time are defined as purchase obligations. Included in purchase obligations are commitments to purchase loans of $1.3 billion and vendor contracts of $23.2 billion . The most significant vendor contracts include communication services, processing services and software contracts. Other long-term liabilities include our contractual funding obligations related to the Qualified Pension Plans, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans (collectively, the Plans). Obligations to the Plans are based on the current and projected obligations of the Plans, performance of the Plans assets and any participant contributions, if applicable. During 2012 and 2011 , we contributed $381 million and $287 million to the Plans, and we expect to make at least $319 million of contributions during 2013 . Debt, lease, equity and other obligations are more fully discussed in Note 12 Long-term Debt and Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The Plans are more fully discussed in Note 18 Employee Benefit Plans to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We enter into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and commercial letters of credit to meet the financing needs of our customers. For a summary of the total unfunded, or off-balance sheet, credit extension commitment amounts by expiration date, see the table in Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Table 10 includes certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2012 .

Forecasts are based on the contractual maturity dates of each liability, and are net of derivative hedges. Representations and Warranties We securitize first-lien residential mortgage loans generally in the form of MBS guaranteed by the GSEs or by GNMA in the case of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed and Rural Housing Service-guaranteed mortgage loans. In addition, in prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations (in certain of these securitizations, monolines or financial guarantee providers insured all or some of the securities) or in the form of whole loans. In connection with these transactions, we or certain of our subsidiaries or legacy companies make or have made various representations and warranties. Breaches of these representations and warranties may result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage loans or to otherwise make whole or provide other remedies to the GSEs, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) with respect to FHA-insured loans, VA, whole-loan investors, securitization trusts, monoline insurers or other financial guarantors (collectively, repurchases). In all such cases, we would be exposed to any credit loss on the repurchased mortgage loans after accounting for any mortgage insurance (MI) or mortgage guarantee payments that we may receive. Subject to the requirements and limitations of the applicable sales and securitization agreements, these representations and warranties can be enforced by the GSEs, HUD, VA, the whole-loan investor, the securitization trustee or others as governed by the applicable agreement or, in certain first-lien and home equity securitizations where monoline insurers or other financial guarantee providers have insured all or some of the securities issued, by the monoline insurer or other financial guarantor, where the contract so provides. In the case of loans sold to parties other than the GSEs or GNMA, the contractual liability to repurchase typically arises only if there is a breach of the representations and warranties that materially and adversely affects the interest of the investor, or investors, or of the monoline insurer or other financial guarantor (as applicable) in the loan. Contracts with the GSEs do not contain equivalent language, while GNMA generally limits repurchases to loans that are not insured or guaranteed as required. For additional information about accounting for representations and warranties and our representations and warranties repurchase claims and exposures, see Note 8 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees and Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors . 54 Bank of America 2012 Representations and Warranties Bulk Settlement Actions We have settled, or entered into agreements to settle, certain bulk representations and warranties claims (1) with a trustee (the Trustee) for certain legacy Countrywide private-label securitization trusts (the BNY Mellon Settlement); (2) with two monoline insurers, Assured Guaranty Ltd. and subsidiaries (the Assured Guaranty Settlement), and Syncora Guarantee Inc. and Syncora Holdings, Ltd. (the Syncora Settlement), (3) with each of the GSEs in 2010 (2010 GSE Agreements), and (4) with FNMA pursuant to the FNMA Settlement in 2013. We have vigorously contested any request for repurchase when we conclude that a valid basis for repurchase does not exist and will continue to do so in the future. However, in an effort to resolve these legacy mortgage-related issues, we have reached bulk settlements, or agreements for bulk settlements, including settlement amounts which have been material, with the above-referenced counterparties in lieu of a loan-by-loan review process. We may reach other settlements in the future if opportunities arise on terms we believe to be advantageous. However, there can be no assurance that we will reach future settlements or, if we do, that the terms of past settlements can be relied upon to predict the terms of future settlements. These bulk settlements generally did not cover all transactions with the relevant counterparties or all potential claims that may arise, including in some instances securities law, fraud and servicing claims, and our liability in connection with the transactions and claims not covered by these settlements could be material. For a summary of the larger bulk settlement actions taken in the past few years and the related impact on the representations and warranties provision and liability, see Note 8 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees and Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements . FNMA Settlement and 2010 GSE Agreements On January 6, 2013 , we entered into the FNMA Settlement to resolve substantially all outstanding and potential repurchase and certain other claims relating to the origination, sale and delivery of residential mortgage loans originated and sold directly to FNMA from January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2008 by entities related to legacy Countrywide and BANA. The FNMA Settlement covers loans with an aggregate original principal balance of approximately $1.4 trillion and an aggregate outstanding principal balance of approximately $300 billion . Unresolved repurchase claims submitted by FNMA for alleged breaches of selling representations and warranties with respect to these loans totaled $12.2 billion of unpaid principal balance at December 31, 2012 . The FNMA Settlement extinguished substantially all of those unresolved repurchase claims, as well as substantially all future representations and warranties repurchase claims associated with such loans, subject to certain exceptions which we do not expect to be material. In January 2013, we made a cash payment to FNMA of $3.6 billion and also repurchased for $6.6 billion certain residential mortgage loans that had previously been sold to FNMA, which we have valued at less than the purchase price. The FNMA Settlement also clarified the parties obligations with respect to MI including establishing timeframes for certain payments and other actions, setting parameters for potential bulk settlements and providing for cooperation in future dealings with mortgage insurers. For additional information, see Open Mortgage Insurance Rescission Notices on page 57 . In addition, we settled substantially all of FNMA outstanding and future claims for compensatory fees arising out of past foreclosure delays. For additional information, see Other Mortgage-related Matters Impact of Foreclosure Delays on page 63 . On December 31, 2010, we entered into the 2010 GSE Agreements, which extinguished certain claims arising out of alleged breaches of selling representations and warranties related to loans sold directly by legacy Countrywide to the GSEs. The FHLMC agreement extinguished all such claims for loans sold to FHLMC through 2008, subject to certain exceptions, while the FNMA agreement substantially resolved the existing pipeline of such claims outstanding as of September 20, 2010. Monoline Settlements On July 17, 2012, we entered into a settlement with a monoline insurer, Syncora Guarantee Inc. and Syncora Holdings, Ltd. (Syncora), to resolve all of Syncora outstanding and potential claims related to alleged representations and warranties breaches involving eight first- and six second-lien private-label securitization trusts where it provided financial guarantee insurance. The settlement covers private-label securitization trusts that had an original principal balance of first-lien mortgages of approximately $9.6 billion and second-lien mortgages of approximately $7.7 billion . The settlement provided for a cash payment of $375 million to Syncora and other transactions to terminate certain other relationships among the parties. On April 14, 2011 , Bank of America, including our legacy Countrywide affiliates, entered into an agreement with Assured Guaranty Ltd. and subsidiaries (Assured Guaranty), to resolve all of the monoline insurer outstanding and potential repurchase claims related to alleged representations and warranties breaches involving 21 first- and eight second-lien RMBS trusts where Assured Guaranty provided financial guarantee insurance. BNY Mellon Settlement The BNY Mellon Settlement is subject to final court approval and certain other conditions. On August 10, 2012, the Court issued an order setting a schedule for discovery and other proceedings, and setting May 30, 2013 as the date for the final court hearing on the settlement to begin. We are not a party to the proceeding. If final court approval is not obtained by December 31, 2015 , we and legacy Countrywide may withdraw from the BNY Mellon Settlement, if the Trustee consents. The BNY Mellon Settlement also provides that if trusts among the 525 legacy Countrywide first-lien and five second-lien non-GSE securitization trusts (Covered Trusts) holding loans with an unpaid principal balance exceeding a specified amount are excluded from the final BNY Mellon Settlement, based on investor objections or otherwise, we and legacy Countrywide have the option to withdraw from the BNY Mellon Settlement pursuant to the terms of the BNY Mellon Settlement agreement. It is not currently possible to predict how many parties will ultimately object to the BNY Mellon Settlement, whether the objections will prevent receipt of final court approval or the ultimate outcome of the court approval process, which can include appeals and could take a substantial period of time. In particular, any appeals could take a substantial period of time and these factors could materially delay the timing of final court approval. Accordingly, it is not possible to predict when the court approval process will be completed. Bank of America 2012 55 There can be no assurance that final court approval of the BNY Mellon Settlement will be obtained, that all conditions to the BNY Mellon Settlement will be satisfied or, if certain conditions to the BNY Mellon Settlement permitting withdrawal are met, that we and legacy Countrywide will not withdraw from the settlement. If final court approval is not obtained or if we and legacy Countrywide withdraw from the BNY Mellon Settlement in accordance with its terms, our future representations and warranties losses could be substantially different than existing accruals and the estimated range of possible loss over existing accruals. For more information about the risks associated with the BNY Mellon Settlement, see Item 1A. Risk Factors . Unresolved Claims Status Unresolved Repurchase Claims Prior to the FNMA Settlement on January 6, 2013 , the total notional amount of our unresolved representations and warranties repurchase claims was approximately $28.3 billion at December 31, 2012 compared to $12.6 billion at December 31, 2011 . These repurchase claims do not include any repurchase claims related to the Covered Trusts. Unresolved repurchase claims represent the notional amount of repurchase claims made by counterparties, typically the outstanding principal balance or the unpaid principal balance at the time of default. In the case of first-lien mortgages, the claim amount is often significantly greater than the expected loss amount due to the benefit of collateral and, in some cases, MI or mortgage guarantee payments. Claims received from a counterparty remain outstanding until the underlying loan is repurchased, the claim is rescinded by the counterparty or the claim is otherwise resolved. When a claim is denied and we do not receive a response from the counterparty, the claim remains in the unresolved repurchase claims balance until resolution. The notional amount of unresolved GSE repurchase claims totaled $13.5 billion at December 31, 2012 compared to $6.2 billion at December 31, 2011. As a result of the FNMA Settlement, $12.2 billion of GSE repurchase claims outstanding at December 31, 2012 were resolved in January 2013. The notional amount of unresolved monoline repurchase claims totaled $2.4 billion at December 31, 2012 compared to $3.1 billion at December 31, 2011 . The decrease in unresolved repurchase claims was driven by resolution of claims through the Syncora Settlement. We have had limited loan-level repurchase claims experience with monoline insurers due to ongoing litigation. We have reviewed and declined to repurchase substantially all of the unresolved repurchase claims at December 31, 2012 based on an assessment of whether a breach exists that materially and adversely affected the insurer interest in the mortgage loan. Further, in our experience, the monolines have been generally unwilling to withdraw repurchase claims, regardless of whether and what evidence was offered to refute a claim. Substantially all of the unresolved monoline claims pertain to second-lien loans and are currently the subject of litigation. The notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims from private-label securitization trustees, third-party securitization sponsors, whole-loan investors and others increased to $12.3 billion at December 31, 2012 compared to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2011 . The increase in the notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims is primarily due to increases in the submission of claims by private-label securitization trustees and a third-party securitization sponsor; the level of detail, support and analysis which impacts overall claim quality and, therefore, claims resolution; and the lack of an established process to resolve disputes related to these claims. We anticipated an increase in aggregate non-GSE claims at the time of the BNY Mellon Settlement in June 2011, and such increase in aggregate non-GSE claims was taken into consideration in developing the increase in our representations and warranties liability at that time. We expect unresolved repurchase claims related to private-label securitizations to continue to increase as claims continue to be submitted by private-label securitization trustees and third-party securitization sponsors and there is not an established process for the ultimate resolution of claims on which there is a disagreement. During 2012 , we received $22.4 billion in new repurchase claims, including $10.3 billion submitted by FNMA and covered by the FNMA Settlement, $2.3 billion submitted by the GSEs for both legacy Countrywide and legacy Bank of America originations not covered by the 2010 GSE Agreements or the FNMA Settlement, $8.0 billion submitted by private-label securitization trustees, $1.5 billion from whole-loan investors, primarily third-party securitization sponsors, and $295 million submitted by monolines. During 2012 , $6.6 billion in claims were resolved, primarily with the GSEs and through the Syncora Settlement. Of the resolved claims, $4.6 billion were resolved through rescissions and $2.0 billion were resolved through mortgage repurchases and make-whole payments. For more information on repurchase claims received from the GSEs, monoline insurers, private-label securitization trustees, whole-loan investors and others, the resolution of such claims and for a table of unresolved repurchase claims, see Note 8 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements . In addition to the total unresolved repurchase claims, we have received repurchase demands from private-label securitization investors and a master servicer where we believe the claimants have not satisfied the contractual thresholds to direct the securitization trustee to take action and/or that these demands are otherwise procedurally or substantively invalid. The total amounts outstanding of such demands were $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . At December 31, 2011, the $1.7 billion of demands outstanding were related to Covered Trusts in the BNY Mellon Settlement of which $1.4 billion were subsequently resolved through the July 2012 dismissal of a lawsuit brought by Walnut Place (11 entities with the common name Walnut Place, including Walnut Place LLC, and Walnut Place II LLC through Walnut Place XI LLC). Additional demands totaling $1.3 billion were received during 2012 . We do not believe that the $1.6 billion in demands outstanding at December 31, 2012 are valid repurchase claims, and therefore it is not possible to predict the resolution with respect to such demands. 56 Bank of America 2012 Open Mortgage Insurance Rescission Notices In addition to repurchase claims, we receive notices from mortgage insurance companies of claim denials, cancellations or coverage rescission (collectively, MI rescission notices) and the number of such notices has remained elevated. By way of background, mortgage insurance compensates lenders or investors for certain losses resulting from borrower default on a mortgage loan. When there is disagreement with the mortgage insurer as to the resolution of a MI rescission notice, meaningful dialogue and negotiation between the mortgage insurance company and the Corporation are generally necessary to reach a resolution on an individual notice. The level of engagement of the mortgage insurance companies varies and ongoing litigation involving some of the mortgage insurance companies over individual and bulk rescissions or claims for rescission limits our ability to engage in constructive dialogue leading to resolution. For loans sold to GSEs or private-label securitization trusts (including those wrapped by the monoline bond insurers), when we receive a MI rescission notice from a mortgage insurance company, it may give rise to a claim for breach of the applicable representations and warranties from the GSEs or private-label securitization trusts, depending on the governing sales contracts. In those cases where the governing contract contains MI-related representations and warranties, which upon rescission require us to repurchase the affected loan or indemnify the investor for the related loss, we realize the loss without the benefit of MI. See below for a discussion of the impact of the FNMA Settlement. In addition, mortgage insurance companies have in some cases asserted the ability to curtail MI payments as a result of alleged foreclosure delays, which if successful, would reduce the MI proceeds available to reduce the loss on the loan. At December 31, 2012 , we had approximately 110,000 open MI rescission notices compared to 90,000 at December 31, 2011 , including 49,000 pertaining principally to first-lien mortgages serviced for others, 11,000 pertaining to loans held-for-investment (HFI), and 50,000 pertaining to ongoing litigation for second-lien mortgages. Approximately 27,000 of the open MI rescission notices pertaining to first-lien mortgages serviced for others are related to loans sold to FNMA. As of December 31, 2012 , 32 percent of the MI rescission notices received have been resolved. Of those resolved, 20 percent were resolved through our acceptance of the MI rescission, 58 percent were resolved through reinstatement of coverage or payment of the claim by the mortgage insurance company, and 22 percent were resolved on an aggregate basis through settlement, policy commutation or similar arrangement. As of December 31, 2012 , 68 percent of the MI rescission notices we have received have not yet been resolved. Of those not yet resolved, 46 percent are implicated by ongoing litigation where no loan-level review is currently contemplated nor required to preserve our legal rights. In this litigation, the litigating mortgage insurance companies are also seeking bulk rescission of certain policies, separate and apart from loan-by-loan denials or rescissions. We are in the process of reviewing 37 percent of the remaining open MI rescission notices, and we have reviewed and are contesting the MI rescission with respect to 63 percent of these remaining open MI rescission notices. Of the remaining open MI rescission notices, 40 percent are also the subject of ongoing litigation; although, at present, these MI rescissions are being processed in a manner generally consistent with those not affected by litigation. In addition to the discussion above, the FNMA Settlement resolved significant representations and warranties exposures including unresolved and potential repurchase claims from FNMA resulting solely from MI rescission notices relating to loans covered by the FNMA Settlement. Our pipeline of unresolved repurchase claims from the GSEs resulting solely from MI rescission notices increased to $2.3 billion at December 31, 2012 from $1.2 billion at December 31, 2011 . The FNMA Settlement resolved approximately $1.9 billion of such unresolved repurchase claims. In 2011, FNMA issued an announcement requiring servicers to report all MI rescission notices with respect to loans sold to FNMA and confirmed FNMA view of its position that a mortgage insurance company issuance of a MI rescission notice in and of itself constitutes a breach of the lender representations and warranties and permits FNMA to require the lender to repurchase the mortgage loan or promptly remit a make-whole payment covering FNMA loss even if the lender is contesting the MI rescission notice. We had informed FNMA that we did not believe that the new policy was valid under our contracts with FNMA. The parties resolved this and other MI-related issues as part of the FNMA Settlement, which clarified the parties obligations with respect to MI including establishing timeframes for certain payments and other actions, setting parameters for potential bulk settlements and providing for cooperation in future dealings with mortgage insurers. As a result, we will be required to remit to FNMA the amount of certain MI coverage as a result of MI claims rescissions in advance of collection from the mortgage insurance companies and, in certain cases, we may not ultimately collect all such amounts from the mortgage insurance companies. For additional information, see Note 8 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Representations and Warranties Liability The liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Corporation Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related provision is included in mortgage banking income (loss). Our estimate of the liability for representations and warranties exposure and the corresponding range of possible loss is based on currently available information, significant judgment and a number of factors and assumptions that are subject to change. For additional information, see the Estimated Range of Possible Loss section below and Note 8 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements and, for information related to the sensitivity of the assumptions used to estimate our liability for obligations under representations and warranties, see Complex Accounting Estimates Representations and Warranties on page 126 . The liability for obligations under representations and warranties and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss for these representations and warranties exposures do not consider any losses related to litigation matters, including litigation brought by monoline insurers, nor do they include any separate foreclosure costs and related costs, assessments and compensatory fees or any other possible losses related to potential claims for breaches of performance of servicing obligations, except as such losses are included as potential costs of the BNY Mellon Settlement, potential securities law or fraud claims or potential indemnity or other claims against us, including claims related to loans insured by the FHA. We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any possible loss with respect to any such servicing, securities law, fraud or other claims against us, except to the extent reflected in the aggregate range of possible Bank of America 2012 57 loss for litigation and regulatory matters disclosed in Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements ; however, such loss could be material. At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees was $19.0 billion and $15.9 billion . For 2012 , the provision for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees was $3.9 billion compared to $15.6 billion for 2011 . The provision in 2012 included $2.5 billion in provision related to the FNMA Settlement and $500 million for obligations to FNMA related to MI rescissions. The provision in 2011 included $8.6 billion in provision and other expenses related to the BNY Mellon Settlement to resolve nearly all of the legacy Countrywide-issued first-lien non-GSE repurchase exposures, and $7.0 billion in provision related to other non-GSE, and to a lesser extent, GSE exposures. Estimated Range of Possible Loss Our estimated liability at December 31, 2012 for obligations under representations and warranties is necessarily dependent on, and limited by, a number of factors, including for private-label securitizations, the implied repurchase experience based on the BNY Mellon Settlement, as well as certain other assumptions and judgmental factors. Accordingly, future provisions associated with obligations under representations and warranties may be materially impacted if actual experiences are different from historical experience or our understandings, interpretations or assumptions. In the case of non-GSE exposures, including private-label securitizations, our estimate of the representations and warranties liability and the corresponding range of possible loss considers, among other things, repurchase experience based on the BNY Mellon Settlement, adjusted to reflect differences between the Covered Trusts and the remainder of the population of private-label securitizations, and assumes that the conditions to the BNY Mellon Settlement will be met. Where relevant, we also take into account more recent experience, such as increased claims and other facts and circumstances, such as bulk settlements, as we believe appropriate. The representations and warranties liability represents our best estimate of probable incurred losses as of December 31, 2012 . However, it is reasonably possible that future representations and warranties losses may occur in excess of the amounts recorded for these exposures. In addition, we have not recorded any representations and warranties liability for certain potential private-label securitization and whole-loan exposures where we have little to no claim experience. We currently estimate that the range of possible loss for representations and warranties exposures could be up to $4 billion over accruals at December 31, 2012 compared to up to $5 billion over accruals at December 31, 2011 for only non-GSE representations and warranties exposures. The range of possible loss at December 31, 2012 reflects the impact of the FNMA Settlement and, as a result, addresses principally non-GSE exposures. The reduction in the range of possible loss from December 31, 2011 is the net impact of, among other changes, updated assumptions and other developments. The estimated range of possible loss related to these representations and warranties exposures does not represent a probable loss, and is based on currently available information, significant judgment and a number of assumptions that are subject to change. For additional information about the methodology used to estimate the representations and warranties liability and the corresponding range of possible loss, see Note 8 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Future provisions and/or ranges of possible loss for representations and warranties may be significantly impacted if actual experiences are different from our assumptions in our predictive models, including, without limitation, ultimate resolution of the BNY Mellon Settlement, estimated repurchase rates, economic conditions, estimated home prices, consumer and counterparty behavior, and a variety of other judgmental factors. Adverse developments with respect to one or more of the assumptions underlying the liability for representations and warranties and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss could result in significant increases to future provisions and/or the estimated range of possible loss. For example, if courts, in the context of claims brought by private-label securitization trustees, were to disagree with our interpretation that the underlying agreements require a claimant to prove that the representations and warranties breach was the cause of the loss, it could significantly impact the estimated range of possible loss. Additionally, if recent court rulings related to monoline litigation, including one related to us, that have allowed sampling of loan files instead of requiring a loan-by-loan review to determine if a representations and warranties breach has occurred, are followed generally by the courts in future monoline litigation, private-label securitization counterparties may view litigation as a more attractive alternative compared to a loan-by-loan review. For additional information regarding these issues, see MBIA litigation in Litigation and Regulatory Matters in Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Finally, although we believe that the representations and warranties typically given in non-GSE transactions are less rigorous and actionable than those given in GSE transactions, we do not have significant experience resolving loan-level claims in non-GSE transactions to measure the impact of these differences on the probability that a loan will be required to be repurchased. Government-sponsored Enterprises Experience Prior to the FNMA Settlement, our repurchase claims experience with the GSEs had been concentrated in the 2004 through 2008 vintages where we believed that our exposure to representations and warranties liability was most significant. Our repurchase claims experience related to loans originated prior to 2004 has not been significant and we believe that changes made to our operations and underwriting policies reduced our exposure related to loans originated after 2008 . Bank of America and legacy Countrywide sold approximately $1.1 trillion of loans originated from 2004 through 2008 to the GSEs. As of December 31, 2012 , 12 percent of the original funded balance of loans in these vintages had defaulted or were 180 days or more past due (severely delinquent). As of December 31, 2012 , we had received $43.5 billion in repurchase claims associated with these vintages, representing approximately four percent of the original funded balance of loans sold to the GSEs in these vintages. Prior to the FNMA Settlement, we had resolved $29.6 billion of these claims with a net loss experience of approximately 29 percent , after considering the effect of collateral. Our collateral loss severity rate on approved repurchases had averaged approximately 55 percent . The FNMA Settlement in January 2013 resolved an additional $12.2 billion in repurchase claims outstanding at December 31, 2012 , primarily related to loans originated from 2004 through 2008 . 58 Bank of America 2012 We and our subsidiaries have an established history of working with the GSEs on repurchase claims. In 2012 , we continued to experience elevated levels of claims from FNMA, including claims on loans on which borrowers have made a significant number of payments (e.g., at least 25 payments) and, to a lesser extent, loans that defaulted more than 18 months prior to the repurchase request. The FNMA Settlement resolved substantially all of the claims with respect to loans originated and sold to FNMA between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2008, as well as substantially all future representations and warranties repurchase claims associated with these loans. Table 11 highlights our experience with the GSEs related to loans originated from 2004 through 2008 . Table 11 Overview of GSE Balances 2004-2008 Originations Legacy Originator (Dollars in billions) Countrywide Other Total Percent of Total Original funded balance $ 846 $ 272 $ 1,118 Principal payments (508 ) (177 ) (685 ) Defaults (77 ) (14 ) (91 ) Total outstanding balance at December 31, 2012 $ 261 $ 81 $ 342 Outstanding principal balance 180 days or more past due (severely delinquent) $ 34 $ 8 $ 42 Defaults plus severely delinquent 111 22 133 Payments made by borrower Less than 13 $ 15 11 % 13-24 31 23 25-36 34 26 More than 36 53 40 Total payments made by borrower $ 133 100 % Unresolved GSE representations and warranties repurchase claims (all vintages) As of December 31, 2011 $ 6.2 As of December 31, 2012 13.5 As of December 31, 2012 (pro forma reflecting the FNMA Settlement) 1.3 Cumulative GSE representations and warranties losses (2004-2008 vintages) 9.8 Beginning in February 2012, we stopped delivering purchase money and non-Making Home Affordable (MHA) refinance first-lien residential mortgage products into FNMA MBS pools because of the expiration and mutual non-renewal of certain contractual delivery commitments and variances that permit efficient delivery of such loans to FNMA. While we continue to have a valid agreement with FNMA permitting the delivery of purchase money and non-MHA refinance first-lien residential mortgage products without such contractual variances, the delivery of such products without contractual delivery commitments and variances would involve time and expense to implement the necessary operational and systems changes and otherwise presents practical operational issues. We do not expect this change to have a material impact on our CRES business, as we expect to rely on other sources of liquidity to actively extend mortgage credit to our customers including continuing to deliver such products into FHLMC MBS pools. Additionally, we continue to deliver MHA refinancing products into FNMA MBS pools. Experience with Investors Other than Government-sponsored Enterprises In prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans originated from 2004 through 2008 with an original principal balance of $963 billion to investors other than GSEs (although the GSEs are investors in certain private-label securitizations), of which approximately $530 billion in principal has been paid and $244 billion has defaulted or is severely delinquent at December 31, 2012 . As it relates to private-label securitizations, a contractual liability to repurchase mortgage loans generally arises only if counterparties prove there is a breach of the representations and warranties that materially and adversely affects the interest of the investor or all investors in a securitization trust or of the monoline insurer or other financial guarantor (as applicable). We believe that the longer a loan performs, the less likely it is that an alleged representations and warranties breach had a material impact on the loan performance or that a breach even exists. Because the majority of the borrowers in this population would have made a significant number of payments if they are not yet 180 days or more past due, we believe that the principal balance at the greatest risk for repurchase claims in this population of private-label securitizations are loans that have already defaulted and those that are currently severely delinquent. Additionally, only counterparties with the contractual right to demand repurchase of a loan can present valid repurchase claims (in the case of private-label securitization trust investors, they generally have to meet certain contractual thresholds in order to require trustees to present repurchase claims). While we believe the agreements for private-label securitizations generally contain less rigorous representations and warranties and place higher burdens on investors seeking repurchases than the explicit provisions of the comparable agreements with the GSEs without regard to any variations that may have arisen as a result of dealings with the GSEs, the agreements generally include a representation that underwriting practices were prudent and customary. Any amounts paid related to repurchase claims from a monoline insurer are paid to the securitization trust and are applied in accordance with the terms of the governing securitization documents, which may include use by the securitization trust to repay any outstanding monoline advances or reduce future advances from the monolines. To the extent that a monoline has Bank of America 2012 59 not advanced funds or does not anticipate that it will be required to advance funds to the securitization trust, the likelihood of receiving a repurchase claim from a monoline may be reduced as the monoline would receive limited or no benefit from the payment of repurchase claims. Moreover, some monolines are not currently performing their obligations under the financial guaranty policies they issued which may, in certain circumstances, impact their ability to present repurchase claims; although in those circumstances, trustees can bring repurchase claims, including at the direction of investors if contractual thresholds are met. Table 12 details the population of loans originated between 2004 and 2008 and the population of loans sold as whole loans or in non-agency securitizations by entity and product together with the defaulted and severely delinquent loans stratified by the number of payments the borrower made prior to default or becoming severely delinquent as of December 31, 2012 . We believe many of the defaults observed in these securitizations have been, and continue to be, driven by external factors like the substantial depreciation in home prices, persistently high unemployment and other negative economic trends, diminishing the likelihood that any loan defect (assuming one exists at all) was the cause of a loan default. As of December 31, 2012 , approximately 25 percent of the loans sold to non-GSEs that were originated between 2004 and 2008 have defaulted or are severely delinquent. Of the original principal balance for Countrywide, $409 billion is included in the BNY Mellon Settlement and of this amount $112 billion was defaulted or severely delinquent at December 31, 2012 .

(2) Includes exposures on third-party sponsored transactions related to legacy entity originations. Monoline Insurers Legacy companies sold $184.5 billion of loans originated between 2004 and 2008 into monoline-insured securitizations, which are included in Table 12 , including $103.9 billion of first-lien mortgages and $80.6 billion of second-lien mortgages. Of these balances, $48.9 billion of the first-lien mortgages and $51.8 billion of the second-lien mortgages have been paid in full and $35.1 billion of the first-lien mortgages and $17.6 billion of the second-lien mortgages have defaulted or are severely delinquent at December 31, 2012 . At least 25 payments have been made on approximately 56 percent of the defaulted and severely delinquent loans. Of the first-lien mortgages sold, $39.1 billion , or 38 percent , were sold as whole loans to other institutions which subsequently included these loans with those of other originators in private-label securitization transactions in which the monolines insured one or more securities. As of December 31, 2012 , we have received $6.0 billion of representations and warranties repurchase claims associated with these vintages from the monoline insurers related to the monoline-insured transactions, predominately second-lien transactions. Of these repurchase claims, $2.4 billion were resolved through the Assured Guaranty and Syncora Settlements, $816 million were resolved through repurchase or indemnification with losses of $649 million , and $302 million were rescinded by the monoline insurers or paid in full. Our limited experience with most of the monoline insurers has varied in terms of process, and experience with these counterparties has not been predictable. Our limited claims experience with the monoline insurers in the repurchase process is a result of these monoline insurers having instituted litigation against legacy Countrywide and/or Bank of America, which impacts our ability to enter into constructive dialogue with these monolines to resolve the open claims. At December 31, 2012 , for loans originated between 2004 and 2008 , the unpaid principal balance of loans related to unresolved monoline repurchase claims was $2.4 billion , substantially all of which we have reviewed and declined to repurchase based on an assessment of whether a material breach exists. At December 31, 2012 , the unpaid principal balance of loans in these vintages for which the monolines had requested loan files for review but for which no repurchase claim had been received was $5.3 billion , excluding loans that had been paid in full or resolved through settlements. Of these file requests, $4.0 billion are aged and subject to ongoing litigation. There will likely be additional requests for loan files in the future leading to repurchase claims. In addition, we have received claims from private-label securitization trustees and a third-party securitization sponsor related to first-lien third-party sponsored securitizations that include monoline insurance. 60 Bank of America 2012 It is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate probable future repurchase obligations with respect to those monolines with whom we have limited repurchase experience and, therefore, no representations and warranties liability has been recorded in connection with these monolines, other than a liability for repurchase claims where we have determined that there are valid loan defects and determined that there is a breach of a representation and warranty and that any other requirements for repurchase have been met. Outside of the standard quality control process that is an integral part of our loan origination process, we do not generally review loan files until we receive a repurchase claim, including with respect to monoline exposures. Our estimated range of possible loss related to representations and warranties exposures as of December 31, 2012 does not include possible losses related to these monoline insurers. For additional information, see Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Whole Loans and Private-label Securitizations Legacy entities, and to a lesser extent Bank of America, sold loans to investors as whole loans or via private-label securitizations. The majority of the loans sold were included in private-label securitizations, including third-party sponsored transactions. We provided representations and warranties to the whole-loan investors and these investors may retain those rights even when the whole loans were aggregated with other collateral into private-label securitizations sponsored by the whole-loan investors. The loans sold with a total principal balance of $778.2 billion , included in Table 12 , were originated between 2004 and 2008 , of which $429.0 billion have been paid in full and $191.4 billion are defaulted or severely delinquent at December 31, 2012 . At least 25 payments have been made on approximately 64 percent of the defaulted and severely delinquent loans. We have received approximately $19.4 billion of representations and warranties repurchase claims from whole-loan investors, including third-party sponsors, and private-label securitization investors and trustees related to these vintages, including $10.5 billion from private-label securitization trustees, $8.0 billion from whole-loan investors and $815 million from one private-label securitization counterparty. In private-label securitizations, certain presentation thresholds need to be met in order for investors to direct a trustee to assert repurchase claims. Recent increases in new private-label claims are primarily related to repurchase requests received from trustees and third-party sponsors for private-label securitization transactions not included in the BNY Mellon Settlement, including claims related to first-lien third-party sponsored securitizations that include monoline insurance. Over time, there has been an increase in requests for loan files from certain private-label securitization trustees, as well as requests for tolling agreements to toll the applicable statutes of limitation relating to representations and warranties repurchase claims, and we believe it is likely that these requests will lead to an increase in repurchase claims from private-label securitization trustees with standing to bring such claims. We have resolved $7.3 billion of the claims received from whole-loan investors and private-label securitization investors and trustees with losses of $1.6 billion . The majority of these resolved claims were from third-party whole-loan investors. Approximately $2.9 billion of these claims were resolved through repurchase or indemnification and $4.4 billion were rescinded by the investor. At December 31, 2012 , for loans originated between 2004 and 2008 , the notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims submitted by private-label securitization trustees and whole-loan investors was $12.2 billion . We have performed an initial review with respect to $10.9 billion of these claims and do not believe a valid basis for repurchase has been established by the claimant and are still in the process of reviewing the remaining $1.3 billion of these claims. Certain whole-loan investors have engaged with us in a consistent repurchase process and we have used that and other experience to record a liability related to existing and future claims from such counterparties. The BNY Mellon Settlement and subsequent activity with certain counterparties led to the determination that we had sufficient experience to record a liability related to our exposure on certain private-label securitizations but did not provide sufficient experience related to certain private-label securitizations sponsored by third-party whole-loan investors. As it relates to the other private-label securitizations sponsored by third-party whole-loan investors and certain other whole loan sales, it is not possible to determine whether a loss has occurred or is probable; and therefore, no representations and warranties liability has been recorded in connection with these transactions. Until we receive a repurchase claim, we generally have not reviewed loan files related to private-label securitizations sponsored by third-party whole-loan investors (and are not required by the governing documents to do so). Our estimated range of possible loss related to representations and warranties exposures as of December 31, 2012 included possible losses related to these whole loan sales and private-label securitizations sponsored by third-party whole-loan investors. Private-label securitization investors generally do not have the contractual right to demand repurchase of loans directly or the right to access loan files. We have received repurchase demands totaling $1.6 billion from private-label securitization investors and a master servicer where in each case we believe the claimant has not satisfied the contractual thresholds to direct the securitization trustee to take action and/or that the demands are otherwise procedurally or substantively invalid. Other Mortgage-related Matters Servicing Matters and Foreclosure Processes We service a large portion of the loans we or our subsidiaries have securitized and also service loans on behalf of third-party securitization vehicles and other investors. Our servicing obligations are set forth in servicing agreements with the applicable counterparty. These obligations may include, but are not limited to, loan repurchase requirements in certain circumstances, indemnifications, payment of fees, advances for foreclosure costs that are not reimbursable, or responsibility for losses in excess of guarantees for VA loans. Servicing agreements with the GSEs generally provide the GSEs with broader rights relative to the servicer than are found in servicing agreements with private investors. For example, each GSE typically claims the right to demand that the servicer repurchase loans that breach the seller representations and warranties made in connection with the initial sale of the loans even if the servicer was not the seller. The GSEs claim that they have the contractual right to demand indemnification or loan repurchase for certain servicing breaches. In addition, the GSEs first-lien mortgage seller/servicer guides provide for timelines to resolve delinquent loans through workout efforts or liquidation, if necessary, and purport to require the imposition of compensatory fees if those deadlines are not satisfied except for reasons beyond Bank of America 2012 61 the control of the servicer; although, we believe that the governing contracts, our course of dealing, and collective past practices and understandings should inform resolution of these matters. In addition, many non-agency RMBS and whole-loan servicing agreements state that the servicer may be liable for failure to perform its servicing obligations in keeping with industry standards or for acts or omissions that involve willful malfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of, or reckless disregard of, the servicer duties. It is not possible to reasonably estimate our liability with respect to potential servicing-related claims. While we have recorded certain accruals for servicing-related claims, the amount of potential liability in excess of existing accruals could be material. In October 2010, we voluntarily stopped taking residential mortgage foreclosure proceedings to judgment in states where foreclosure requires a court order following a legal proceeding (judicial states) and stopped foreclosure sales in all states in order to complete an assessment of related business processes. We have resumed foreclosure sales in all states, but our progress on foreclosure sales in judicial states has been much slower than in states where foreclosure does not require a court order (non-judicial states). 2011 OCC Consent Order and 2013 IFR Acceleration Agreement We entered into the 2011 OCC Consent Order on April 13, 2011 . This consent order required servicers to make several enhancements to their servicing operations, including implementation of a single point of contact model for borrowers throughout the loss mitigation and foreclosure processes, adoption of measures designed to ensure that foreclosure activity is halted once a borrower has been approved for a modification unless the borrower fails to make payments under the modified loan and implementation of enhanced controls over third-party vendors that provide default servicing support services. In addition, the 2011 OCC Consent Order required that we retain an independent consultant, approved by the OCC, to conduct a review of all foreclosure actions pending, or foreclosure sales that occurred, between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2010 and submit a plan to the OCC to remediate all financial injury to borrowers caused by any deficiencies identified through the review. On January 7, 2013 , we and other mortgage servicing institutions entered into the 2013 IFR Acceleration Agreement with the Federal Reserve and the OCC to cease the case-by-case IFR program created by the 2011 OCC Consent Order and replace it with an accelerated remediation process. The 2013 IFR Acceleration Agreement requires us to make a cash payment of $1.1 billion and provide $1.8 billion of borrower assistance in the form of loan modifications and other foreclosure prevention actions. The borrower assistance program is not expected to result in any incremental credit provision, as we believe that the existing allowance for credit losses is adequate to absorb any costs that have not already been recorded as charge-offs. National Mortgage Settlement In March 2012, we entered into settlement agreements (collectively, the National Mortgage Settlement) with (1) the U.S. Department of Justice, various federal regulatory agencies and 49 state Attorneys General to resolve federal and state investigations into certain residential mortgage origination, servicing and foreclosure practices, (2) HUD to resolve certain claims relating to the origination of FHA-insured mortgage loans, primarily by Countrywide prior to and for a period following our acquisition of that lender, and (3) each of the Federal Reserve and the OCC regarding civil monetary penalties related to conduct that was the subject of consent orders entered into with the banking regulators in April 2011. The National Mortgage Settlement was entered by the court as a consent judgment on April 5, 2012. The National Mortgage Settlement provided for the establishment of certain uniform servicing standards, upfront cash payments of approximately $1.9 billion to the state and federal governments and for borrower restitution, approximately $7.6 billion in borrower assistance in the form of, among other things, credits earned for principal reduction, short sales, deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure and approximately $1.0 billion of credits earned for interest rate reduction modifications. In addition, the settlement with HUD provided for an upfront cash payment of $500 million to settle certain claims related to FHA-insured loans. We will also be obligated to provide additional cash payments of up to $850 million if we fail to earn an additional $850 million of credits stemming from incremental first-lien principal reductions over a three-year period. The borrower assistance program did not result in any incremental credit provision during 2012 , as we believe that the existing allowance for credit losses is adequate to absorb any costs that have not already been recorded as charge-offs. The interest rate modification program consisted of interest rate reductions on first-lien loans originated prior to January 1, 2009 that have a current loan-to-value (LTV) ratio greater than 100 percent and that meet certain eligibility criteria, including the requirement that all payments due for the last twelve months have been made in a timely manner. This program commits us to forego future interest payments that we may not otherwise have agreed to forego, and no loss has been recognized in the financial statements related to such forgone interest. Modifications of approximately 7,500 loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $2.1 billion providing for an average interest rate reduction of approximately two percent were completed as of December 31, 2012 , resulting in an estimated decrease in fair value of the modified loans of approximately $242 million . The interest rate modification program is expected to include approximately 20,000 to 25,000 loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $5.4 billion to $6.8 billion . Assuming an average interest rate reduction of approximately two percent , the modifications are expected to result in a reduction of annual interest income of approximately $100 million to $130 million when the program is complete. Assuming a weighted-average loan life of approximately eight years, the fair value of loans in the program is expected to decrease by approximately $600 million to $800 million as a result of the interest rate reductions. The financial impact will vary depending on final terms of modifications offered and the rate of borrower acceptance. We do not expect loans modified under the program to be accounted for as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). If the program is expanded to include loans that do not meet specified underwriting criteria, such as maximum debt-to-income ratios or minimum FICO scores, the modifications of such loans will be accounted for as TDRs. We could be required to make additional payments if we fail to meet our borrower assistance and rate reduction modification commitments over a three-year period, in an amount equal to 125 percent to 140 percent of the shortfall, dependent on the two- and three-year commitment target. We also entered into agreements with several states under which we committed to perform certain 62 Bank of America 2012 minimum levels of principal reduction and related activities within those states in connection with the National Mortgage Settlement, and under which we could be required to make additional payments if we fail to meet such minimum levels. We believe that it is likely that we will meet all borrower assistance, rate reduction modification and principal reduction commitments required under the National Mortgage Settlement and, therefore, do not expect to be required to make additional cash payments. Although it is possible that the cost of fulfilling the commitments could increase, leading to an incremental credit provision, the amount of any such incremental provision is not reasonably estimable. Although we may incur additional operating costs such as servicing costs to implement parts of the National Mortgage Settlement in future periods, we do not expect that those costs will be material. Under the terms of the National Mortgage Settlement, the federal and participating state governments agreed to release us from further liability for certain alleged residential mortgage origination, servicing and foreclosure deficiencies. In settling origination issues related to FHA-guaranteed loans originated on or before April 30, 2009, we received a release from further liability for all origination claims with respect to such loans if an insurance claim had been submitted to the FHA prior to January 1, 2012 and a release of multiple damages and penalties, but not single damages, if no such claim had been submitted. In addition, provided we meet our assistance and remediation commitments, the OCC agreed not to assess, and we will not be obligated to pay to the Federal Reserve, any civil monetary penalties. The National Mortgage Settlement does not cover certain claims arising out of origination, securitization (including representations made to investors with respect to MBS), criminal claims, private claims by borrowers, claims by certain states for injunctive relief or actual economic damages to borrowers related to the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS), and claims by the GSEs (including repurchase demands), among other items. Additionally, we continue to be subject to additional borrower and non-borrower litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny related to our past and current origination, servicing and foreclosure activities, including those claims not covered by the National Mortgage Settlement. This scrutiny may extend beyond our pending foreclosure matters to issues arising out of alleged irregularities with respect to previously completed foreclosure activities. The current environment of heightened regulatory scrutiny may subject us to inquiries or investigations that could significantly adversely affect our reputation and result in material costs to us. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. Mortgage notes, assignments or other documents are often required to be maintained and are often necessary to enforce mortgage loans. There has been significant public commentary regarding the common industry practice of recording mortgages in the name of MERS, as nominee on behalf of the note holder, and whether securitization trusts own the loans purported to be conveyed to them and have valid liens securing those loans. We currently use the MERS system for a substantial portion of the residential mortgage loans that we originate, including loans that have been sold to investors or securitization trusts. A component of the OCC consent order requires significant changes in the manner in which we service loans that identify MERS as the mortgagee. Additionally, certain local and state governments have commenced legal actions against us, MERS and other MERS members, questioning the validity of the MERS model. Other challenges have also been made to the process for transferring mortgage loans to securitization trusts, asserting that having a mortgagee of record that is different than the holder of the mortgage note could break the chain of title and cloud the ownership of the loan. In order to foreclose on a mortgage loan, in certain cases it may be necessary or prudent for an assignment of the mortgage to be made to the holder of the note, which in the case of a mortgage held in the name of MERS as nominee would need to be completed by a MERS signing officer. As such, our practice is to obtain assignments of mortgages from MERS prior to instituting foreclosure. If certain required documents are missing or defective, or if the use of MERS is found not to be valid, we could be obligated to cure certain defects or in some circumstances be subject to additional costs and expenses. Our use of MERS as nominee for the mortgage may also create reputational risks for us. Impact of Foreclosure Delays Foreclosure delays impact our default-related servicing costs. We believe default-related servicing costs peaked during the third quarter of 2012 and began to decline in the fourth quarter of 2012 , and we anticipate that this decline will accelerate in 2013 . However, unexpected foreclosure delays in 2013 could impact the rate of decline. Default-related servicing costs include costs related to resources needed for implementing new servicing standards mandated for the industry, including as part of the National Mortgage Settlement, other operational changes and operational costs due to delayed foreclosures and do not include mortgage-related assessments, waivers and similar costs related to foreclosure delays. Other areas of our operations are also impacted by foreclosure delays. In 2012, we recorded $867 million of mortgage-related assessments, waivers and similar costs related to foreclosure delays, including $258 million related to compensatory fees as part of the FNMA Settlement. It is also possible that the delays in foreclosure sales may result in additional costs and expenses, including costs associated with the maintenance of properties or possible home price declines while foreclosures are delayed. Finally, the time to complete foreclosure sales may continue to be protracted, which may result in a greater number of nonperforming loans and increased servicing advances, and may impact the collectability of such advances and the value of our MSR asset, MBS and real estate owned properties. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of disagreements with counterparties, delays in foreclosure sales beyond those currently anticipated, and any issues that may arise out of alleged irregularities in our foreclosure process could significantly increase the costs associated with our mortgage operations. Mortgage-related Settlements Servicing Matters In connection with the BNY Mellon Settlement, BANA has agreed to implement certain servicing changes. The Trustee and BANA have agreed to clarify and conform certain servicing standards related to loss mitigation. In particular, the BNY Mellon Settlement clarifies that it is permissible to apply the same loss mitigation strategies to the Covered Trusts as are applied to BANA affiliates Bank of America 2012 63 HFI portfolios. This portion of the agreement was effective in the second quarter of 2011 and is not conditioned on final court approval. BANA also agreed to transfer the servicing rights related to certain high-risk loans to qualified subservicers on a schedule that began with the signing of the BNY Mellon Settlement. This servicing transfer protocol will reduce the servicing fees payable to BANA in the future. Upon final court approval of the BNY Mellon Settlement, failure to meet the established benchmarking standards for loans not in subservicing arrangements can trigger the payment of agreed-upon fees. Additionally, we and legacy Countrywide have agreed to work to resolve with the Trustee certain mortgage documentation issues related to the enforceability of mortgages in foreclosure and to reimburse the related Covered Trust for any loss if BANA is unable to foreclose on the mortgage and the Covered Trust is not made whole by a title policy because of these issues. These agreements will terminate if final court approval of the BNY Mellon Settlement is not obtained, although we could still have exposure under the pooling and servicing agreements related to the mortgages in the Covered Trusts for these issues. In connection with the National Mortgage Settlement, BANA has agreed to implement certain additional servicing changes. The uniform servicing standards established under the National Mortgage Settlement are broadly consistent with the residential mortgage servicing practices imposed by the 2011 OCC Consent Order; however, they are more prescriptive and cover a broader range of our residential mortgage servicing activities. These standards are intended to strengthen procedural safeguards and documentation requirements associated with foreclosure, bankruptcy, and loss mitigation activities, as well as addressing the imposition of fees and the integrity of documentation, with a goal of ensuring greater transparency for borrowers. These uniform servicing standards also obligate us to implement compliance processes reasonably designed to provide assurance of the achievement of these objectives. Compliance with the uniform servicing standards will be assessed by a monitor based on the measurement of outcomes with respect to these objectives. Implementation of these uniform servicing standards is expected to contribute to elevated costs associated with the servicing process, but is not expected to result in material delays or dislocation in the performance of our mortgage servicing obligations, including the completion of foreclosures. Regulatory Matters See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding regulatory matters and risks. Financial Reform Act The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Financial Reform Act), which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, enacted sweeping financial regulatory reform and has altered and will continue to alter the way in which we conduct certain businesses, increase our costs and reduce our revenues. Many aspects of the Financial Reform Act remain subject to final rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the precise impact on the Corporation, our customers or the financial services industry. Debit Interchange Fees On June 29, 2011, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule with respect to the Durbin Amendment effective on October 1, 2011 which, among other things, established a regulatory cap for many types of debit interchange transactions to equal no more than 21 cents plus five bps of the value of the transaction. The Federal Reserve also adopted a rule to allow a debit card issuer to recover one cent per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraud-related requirements, with which we are currently in compliance. The Federal Reserve also approved rules governing routing and exclusivity, requiring issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product, which became effective April 1, 2012. For additional information on the impact to revenue, see CBB on page 38 . Limitations on Proprietary Trading; Sponsorship and Investment in Hedge Funds and Private Equity Funds On October 11, 2011, the Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), representing four of the five regulatory agencies charged with promulgating regulations implementing limitations on proprietary trading as well as the sponsorship of or investment in hedge funds and private equity funds (the Volcker Rule) established by the Financial Reform Act, released for comment proposed implementing regulations. On January 11, 2012, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the fifth agency, released for comment its proposed regulations under the Volcker Rule. The proposed regulations include clarifications to the definition of proprietary trading and distinctions between permitted and prohibited activities. However, in light of the complexity of the proposed regulations and the large volume of comments received (the proposal requested comments on over 1,300 questions on 400 different topics), it is not possible to predict the content of the final regulations or when they will be issued. The statutory provisions of the Volcker Rule became effective on July 21, 2012 and gave financial institutions two years from the effective date, with the possibility for extensions for certain investments, to bring activities and investments into compliance with the statutory provisions and final regulations. Although Global Markets exited its stand-alone proprietary trading business as of June 30, 2011 in anticipation of the Volcker Rule and to further our initiative to optimize our balance sheet, the ultimate impact of the Volcker Rule on us remains uncertain as the regulations implementing the Volcker Rule are not final. However, based on the contents of the proposed regulations, it is possible the Volcker Rule implementation could limit or restrict our remaining trading activities. If exemptions in the Volcker Rule and the proposed regulations are not available, the Volcker Rule could also limit or restrict our ability to sponsor and hold ownership interests in hedge funds, private equity funds, commodity pools and other subsidiary operations. Additionally, the Volcker Rule could increase our operational and compliance costs, reduce our trading revenues, and adversely affect our results of operations. The date on which final regulations will be issued is currently uncertain. For additional information about our trading business, see Global Markets on page 48 . 64 Bank of America 2012 Derivatives The Financial Reform Act includes measures to broaden the scope of derivative instruments subject to regulation by requiring clearing and exchange trading of certain derivatives; imposing new capital, margin, reporting, registration and business conduct requirements for certain market participants; and imposing position limits on certain over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. The Financial Reform Act grants the CFTC and the SEC substantial new authority and requires numerous rulemakings by these agencies. Swap dealers conducting dealing activity with U.S. persons above a specified dollar threshold were required to register with the CFTC on or before December 31, 2012. We registered BANA, Merrill Lynch Commodities Inc., Merrill Lynch Capital Services Inc., Merrill Lynch Financial Markets Inc., Merrill Lynch International and Merrill Lynch International Bank Limited as swap dealers on December 31, 2012. Upon registration, swap dealers became subject to additional CFTC rules relating to business conduct and reporting, and will continue to become subject to additional CFTC rules as and when such rules take effect. Those rules include, but are not limited to, measures that require clearing and exchange trading of certain derivatives, new capital and margin requirements for certain market participants, and additional reporting requirements for derivatives under the jurisdiction of the CFTC. The CFTC also granted relief from some of the rules that would have become effective during the fourth quarter of 2012, either completely suspending or delaying the application of some requirements. While the CFTC has provided temporary exemptive relief from application of derivatives requirements of the Financial Reform Act for certain non-U.S. derivatives activity, there remains some uncertainty as to how the derivatives requirements of the Financial Reform Act will apply to non-U.S. derivatives activity because the CFTC has not yet adopted final cross-border guidance. The CFTC has completed much of its other rulemakings, with the exception of final margin, capital and exchange trading rules, while the SEC has finalized a small number of clearing-related rules. The ultimate impact of the derivatives regulations that have not yet been finalized and the time it will take to comply remain uncertain. The final regulations will impose additional operational and compliance costs on us and may require us to restructure certain businesses and may negatively impact our results of operations. FDIC Deposit Insurance Assessments The FDIC has broad discretionary authority to increase assessments on large and highly complex institutions on a case by case basis. Any future increases in required deposit insurance premiums or other bank industry fees could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Resolution Planning The Federal Reserve and the FDIC require that the Corporation and other bank holding companies (BHCs) with assets of $50 billion or more, as well as companies designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, submit annually their plans for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. A resolution plan is intended to be a detailed roadmap for the orderly resolution of the BHC and material entities pursuant to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code under one or more hypothetical scenarios assuming no extraordinary government assistance. If the FDIC and the Federal Reserve determine that our plan is not credible and we fail to cure the deficiencies in a timely manner, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth, activities or operations of the Corporation. We submitted our initial plan in 2012, which is to be updated annually. Similarly, in the U.K., the Financial Services Authority (FSA) has issued proposed rules requiring the submission of significant information about certain U.K. incorporated subsidiaries and other financial institutions, as well as branches of non-U.K. banks located in the U.K. (including information on intra-group dependencies, legal entity separation and barriers to resolution) to allow the FSA to develop resolution plans. As a result of the FSA review, we could be required to take certain actions over the next several years which could impose operational costs and potentially result in the restructuring of certain business and subsidiaries. Orderly Liquidation Authority Under the Financial Reform Act, when a systemically important financial institution such as the Corporation is in default or danger of default, the FDIC may be appointed receiver in order to conduct an orderly liquidation of such systemically important financial institution. In the event of such appointment, the FDIC could invoke a new form of resolution authority, the orderly liquidation authority, instead of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, if the Secretary of the Treasury makes certain financial distress and systemic risk determinations. The orderly liquidation authority is modeled in part on the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, but also adopts certain concepts from the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The orderly liquidation authority contains certain differences from the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Macroprudential systemic protection is the primary objective of the orderly liquidation authority, subject to minimum threshold protections for creditors. Accordingly, in certain circumstances under the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC could permit payment of obligations it determines to be systemically significant (e.g., short-term creditors or operating creditors) in lieu of paying other obligations (e.g., long-term creditors) without the need to obtain creditors consent or prior court review. The insolvency and resolution process could also lead to a large reduction or total elimination of the value of a BHC outstanding equity. For example, the FDIC could follow a single point of entry approach and replace a distressed BHC with a bridge holding company, which could continue operations and result in an orderly resolution of the underlying bank, but whose equity is held solely for the benefit of creditors of the original BHC. Additionally, under the orderly liquidation authority, amounts owed to the U.S. government generally receive a statutory payment priority . Credit Risk Retention On March 29, 2011, federal regulators jointly issued a proposed rule regarding credit risk retention that would, among other things, require sponsors to retain at least five percent of the credit risk of the assets underlying certain ABS and MBS securitizations and would limit the ability to transfer or hedge that credit risk. The proposed rule as currently written would likely have an adverse impact on our ability to engage in many types of the MBS and ABS securitizations conducted in CRES , Global Markets and other business segments, impose additional operational and compliance costs on us, and negatively influence the value, liquidity and transferability of ABS or MBS, loans and other assets. However, it remains unclear what requirements will be included in Bank of America 2012 65 the final rule and what the ultimate impact of the final rule will be on our CRES , Global Markets and other business segments or on our results of operations. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau The Financial Reform Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which principally regulates the offering of consumer financial products or services under federal consumer financial laws, and which has commenced its supervisory oversight. Certain federal consumer financial laws to which the Corporation is subject including, but not limited to, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Electronic Fund Transfers Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Truth in Lending and Truth in Savings Acts are enforced by the CFPB, subject to certain statutory limitations. Through its rulemaking authority, the CFPB has promulgated several proposed and final rules that will affect our consumer businesses. Among these initiatives is a recently-issued final rule implementing sections of the Financial Reform Act establishing ability to repay and qualified mortgage standards under the Truth in Lending Act. In addition, the CFPB issued a final rule establishing mortgage loan servicing standards through amendments to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. The CFPB has also proposed rules addressing items such as remittance transfer services, appraisal requirements and loan originator compensation requirements. The Corporation is evaluating the various CFPB rules and proposals and devoting substantial compliance, legal and operational business resources to facilitate compliance with these rules by their respective effective dates. In addition, the Corporation has cooperated with the CFPB on several industry-related information collection requests involving consumer financial products and services, including overdraft fees and practices. Certain Other Provisions The Financial Reform Act also expands the role of state regulators in enforcing consumer protection requirements over banks and disqualifies trust preferred securities and other hybrid capital securities from Tier 1 capital. Many of the provisions under the Financial Reform Act have only begun to be implemented or remain to be implemented in the future and will be subject both to further rulemaking and the discretion of applicable regulatory bodies. For additional information regarding regulatory capital and other rules proposed by federal regulators, see Capital Management Regulatory Capital Changes on page 72 . The Financial Reform Act will continue to have an adverse impact on our earnings through fee reductions, higher costs and imposition of new restrictions on us. The Financial Reform Act may also continue to have a material adverse impact on the value of certain assets and liabilities held on our balance sheet. The ultimate impact of the Financial Reform Act on our businesses will depend on regulatory interpretation and rulemaking, as well as the success of any of our actions to mitigate the negative impact of certain provisions. Transactions with Affiliates The terms of certain of our OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements of the Corporation provide that upon the occurrence of certain specified events, such as a change in our credit ratings, Merrill Lynch and other non-bank affiliates may be required to provide additional collateral or to provide other remedies, or our counterparties may have the right to terminate or otherwise diminish our rights under these contracts or agreements. In the event of further downgrades of the credit ratings of the Corporation and other non-bank affiliates, we may engage in discussions with certain derivative and other counterparties regarding their rights under these agreements, including potentially naming new counterparties. Our ability to substitute or make changes to these agreements to meet counterparties requests may be subject to certain limitations, including counterparty willingness, regulatory limitations on naming BANA as the new counterparty, and the type or amount of collateral required. It is possible that such limitations on our ability to substitute or make changes to these agreements, including naming BANA as the new counterparty, could adversely affect our results of operations. Other Matters The Corporation has established guidelines and policies for managing capital across its subsidiaries. The guidance for the Corporation subsidiaries with regulatory capital requirements, including branch operations of banking subsidiaries, requires each entity to maintain satisfactory capital levels. This includes setting internal capital targets for the U.S. bank subsidiaries to exceed well-capitalized levels. The U.K. has adopted increased capital and liquidity requirements for local financial institutions, including regulated U.K. subsidiaries of non-U.K. BHCs and other financial institutions as well as branches of non-U.K. banks located in the U.K. In addition, the U.K. has proposed the creation and production of recovery and resolution plans, commonly referred to as living wills, by significant regulated legal entities. Managing Risk Overview Risk is inherent in every material business activity that we undertake. Our business exposes us to strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. We must manage these risks to maximize our long-term results by ensuring the integrity of our assets and the quality of our earnings. Strategic risk is the risk that results from adverse business decisions, ineffective or inappropriate business plans, or failure to respond to changes in the competitive environment, business cycles, customer preferences, product obsolescence, regulatory environment, business strategy execution, and/or other inherent risks of the business including reputational risk. Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from a borrower or counterparty inability to meet its obligations. Market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as interest rate movements. Liquidity risk is the inability to meet contractual and contingent financial obligations, on- or off-balance sheet, as they come due. Compliance risk is the risk that arises from the failure to adhere to laws, rules, regulations, or internal policies and procedures. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or external events. Reputational risk is the potential that negative publicity regarding an organization conduct or business practices will adversely affect its profitability, operations or customer base, or result in costly litigation or require other measures. Reputational risk is evaluated along with all of the risk categories and throughout the risk management process, and as such is not discussed separately herein. The following sections, Strategic Risk 66 Bank of America 2012 Management and Capital Management both on page 70 , Liquidity Risk on page 75 , Credit Risk Management on page 79 , Market Risk Management on page 113 , Compliance Risk Management and Operational Risk Management both on page 120 , address in more detail the specific procedures, measures and analyses of the major categories of risk that we manage. In choosing when and how to take risks, we evaluate our capacity for risk and seek to protect our brand and reputation, our financial flexibility, the value of our assets and the strategic potential of the Corporation. We intend to maintain a strong and flexible financial position. We also intend to focus on maintaining our relevance and value to customers, employees and shareholders. As part of our efforts to achieve these objectives, we continue to build a comprehensive risk management culture and to implement governance and control measures to strengthen that culture. We take a comprehensive approach to risk management. We have a defined risk framework and clearly articulated risk appetite which is approved annually by the Corporation Board of Directors (the Board). Risk management planning is integrated with strategic, financial and customer/client planning so that goals and responsibilities are aligned across the organization. Risk is managed in a systematic manner by focusing on the Corporation as a whole as well as managing risk across the enterprise and within individual business units, products, services and transactions, and across all geographic locations. We maintain a governance structure that delineates the responsibilities for risk management activities, as well as governance and oversight of those activities. Executive management assesses, with Board oversight, the risk-adjusted returns of each business segment. Management reviews and approves strategic and financial operating plans, and recommends to the Board for approval a financial plan annually. By allocating economic capital to and establishing a risk appetite for a business segment, we seek to effectively manage the ability to take on risk. Economic capital is assigned to each business segment using a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment stand-alone credit, market, interest rate and operational risk components, and is used to measure risk-adjusted returns. We regularly evaluate these allocations as part of our overall governance processes as the businesses and the economic environment in which we operate continue to evolve. In addition to reputational considerations, businesses operate within their credit, market, compliance and operational risk standards and limits in order to adhere to the risk appetite. These limits are based on analyses of risk and reward in each business. Executive management is responsible for tracking and reporting performance measurements as well as any exceptions to guidelines or limits. The Board, and its committees when appropriate, monitor financial performance, execution of the strategic and financial operating plans, compliance with the risk appetite and the adequacy of internal controls. The Board has completed its review of the Risk Framework and the Risk Appetite Statement for the Corporation, and both the Risk Framework and Risk Appetite Statement were approved in January 2013. The Risk Framework defines the accountability of the Corporation and its employees and the Risk Appetite Statement defines the parameters under which we will take risk. Both documents are intended to enable us to maximize our long-term results and ensure the integrity of our assets and the quality of our earnings. The Risk Framework is designed to be used by our employees to understand risk management activities, including their individual roles and accountabilities. It also defines how risk management is integrated into our core business processes, and it defines the risk management governance structure, including management involvement. The risk management responsibilities of the businesses, governance and control functions, and Corporate Audit are also clearly defined. The risk management process includes four critical elements: identify and measure risk, mitigate and control risk, monitor and test risk, and report and review risk, and is applied across all business activities to enable an integrated and comprehensive review of risk consistent with the Risk Appetite Statement. Risk Management Processes and Methods To support our corporate goals and objectives, risk appetite, and business and risk strategies, we maintain a governance structure that delineates the responsibilities for risk management activities, as well as governance and oversight of those activities, by management and the Board. All employees have accountability for risk management. Each employee risk management responsibilities falls into one of three major categories: businesses, governance and control, and Corporate Audit. Business managers and employees are accountable for identifying, managing and escalating attention to all risks in their business units, including existing and emerging risks. Business managers must ensure that their business activities are conducted within the risk appetite defined by management and approved by the Board. The limits and controls for each business must be consistent with the Risk Appetite Statement. Employees in client and customer facing businesses are responsible for day-to-day business activities, including developing and delivering profitable products and services, fulfilling customer requests and maintaining desirable customer relationships. These employees are accountable for conducting their daily work in accordance with policies and procedures. It is the responsibility of each employee to protect the Corporation and defend the interests of the shareholders. Governance and control functions are comprised of Global Risk Management, Global Compliance, Legal and the enterprise control functions and are tasked with independently overseeing and managing risk activities. Global Compliance (which includes Regulatory Relations) and Legal report to the Chief Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Relations Executive. Enterprise control functions consist of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Group, Global Technology and Operations, Global Human Resources, and Global Marketing and Corporate Affairs. Global Risk Management is led by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO). The CRO leads senior management in managing risk, is independent from the Corporation businesses and enterprise control functions, and maintains sufficient autonomy to develop and implement meaningful risk management measures. This position serves to protect the Corporation and its shareholders. The CRO reports to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and is the management team lead or a participant in Board-level risk governance committees. The CRO has the mandate to ensure that appropriate risk management practices are in place, and are effective and consistent with our overall business strategy and risk appetite. Global Risk Management is comprised of two types of risk teams, Enterprise risk teams and independent business risk teams, which report to the CRO and are independent from the business and enterprise control functions. Bank of America 2012 67 Enterprise risk teams are responsible for setting and establishing enterprise policies, programs and standards, assessing program adherence, providing enterprise-level risk oversight, and reporting and monitoring systemic and emerging risk issues. In addition, the enterprise risk teams are responsible for monitoring and ensuring that risk limits are reasonable and consistent with the risk appetite. These risk teams also carry out risk-based oversight of the enterprise control functions. Independent business risk teams are responsible for establishing policies, limits, standards, controls, metrics and thresholds within the defined corporate standards for the businesses to which they are aligned. The independent business risk teams are also responsible for ensuring that risk limits and standards are reasonable and consistent with the risk appetite. Enterprise control functions are independent of the businesses and have risk governance and control responsibilities for enterprise programs. In this role, they are responsible for setting policies, standards and limits; providing risk reporting; monitoring systemic risk issues including existing and emerging; and implementing procedures and controls at the enterprise and business levels for their respective control functions. The Corporate Audit function maintains independence from the businesses and governance and control functions by reporting directly to the Audit Committee of the Board. Corporate Audit provides independent assessment and validation through testing of key processes and controls across the Corporation. Corporate Audit also provides an independent assessment of the Corporation management and internal control systems. Corporate Audit activities are designed to provide reasonable assurance that resources are adequately protected; significant financial, managerial and operating information is materially complete, accurate and reliable; and employees actions are in compliance with the Corporation policies, standards, procedures, and applicable laws and regulations. To assist the Corporation in achieving its goals and objectives, risk appetite, and business and risk strategies, we utilize a risk management process that is applied across the execution of all business activities. This risk management process, which is an integral part of our Risk Framework, enables the Corporation to review risk in an integrated and comprehensive manner across all risk categories and make strategic and business decisions based on that comprehensive view. Corporate goals and objectives are established by management, and management reflects these goals and objectives in our risk appetite which is approved by the Board and serves as a key driver for setting business and risk strategy. One of the key tools of the risk management process is the use of Risk and Control Self Assessments (RCSAs). RCSAs are the primary method for facilitating the management of business environment and internal control factor data. The end-to-end RCSA process incorporates risk identification and assessment of the control environment; monitoring, reporting and escalating risk; quality assurance and data validation; and integration with the risk appetite. The RCSA process also incorporates documentation by either the business or governance and control functions of the business environment, risks, controls, and monitoring and reporting. This results in a comprehensive risk management view that enables understanding of and action on operational risks and controls for all of our processes, products, activities and systems. The formal processes used to manage risk represent a part of our overall risk management process. Corporate culture and the actions of our employees are also critical to effective risk management. Through our Code of Ethics, we set a high standard for our employees. The Code of Ethics provides a framework for all of our employees to conduct themselves with the highest integrity. We instill a strong and comprehensive risk management culture through communications, training, policies, procedures, and organizational roles and responsibilities. Additionally, we continue to strengthen the link between the employee performance management process and individual compensation to encourage employees to work toward enterprise-wide risk goals. Enterprise-wide Stress Testing As a part of our core risk management practices, we conduct enterprise-wide stress tests on a periodic basis to better understand balance sheet, earnings, capital and liquidity sensitivities to certain economic and business scenarios, including economic and market conditions that are more severe than anticipated. These enterprise-wide stress tests provide illustrative hypothetical potential impacts from our risk profile on our balance sheet, earnings, capital and liquidity and serve as a key component of our capital, liquidity and risk management practices. Scenarios are selected by the Asset Liability and Market Risk Committee (ALMRC) and approved by the CFO and the CRO. Impacts to each business from each scenario are then determined and analyzed, primarily by leveraging the models and processes utilized in everyday management routines. Impacts are assessed along with potential mitigating actions that may be taken. Analysis from such stress scenarios is compiled for and reviewed through our Chief Financial Officer Risk Committee (CFORC), ALMRC and the Board Enterprise Risk Committee. Contingency Planning Routines We have developed and maintain contingency plans that prepare us in advance to respond in the event of potential adverse outcomes and scenarios. These contingency planning routines include capital contingency planning, liquidity contingency funding plans, recovery planning and enterprise resiliency, and provide for monitoring, escalation routines, and response plans. Contingency response plans are designed to enable us to increase capital, access funding sources, and reduce risk through consideration of potential actions that includes asset sales, business sales, capital or debt issuances, and other de-risking strategies. Board Oversight of Risk The Board, comprised of a substantial majority of independent directors, including an independent Chairman of the Board, oversees the management of the Corporation through a governance structure that includes Board committees and management committees. The Board standing committees that oversee the management of the majority of the risks faced by the Corporation include the Audit and Enterprise Risk Committees, comprised of independent directors, and the Credit Committee, comprised of non-management directors. This governance structure is designed to align the interests of the Board and management with those of our stockholders and to foster integrity throughout the Corporation. 68 Bank of America 2012 The chart below illustrates the inter-relationship among the Board, Board committees and management committees with the majority of risk oversight responsibilities for the Corporation. (1) Chart is not comprehensive; there may be additional subcommittees not represented in this chart. This presentation does not include committees for other legal entities. (2) Reports through the Audit Committee for compliance and through the Enterprise Risk Committee for operational and reputational risk. (3) Reports to the CEO and CFO with oversight by the Audit Committee. Our Board Audit, Credit and Enterprise Risk Committees have the principal responsibility for assisting the Board with enterprise-wide oversight of the Corporation management and handling of risk. Our Audit Committee assists the Board in the oversight of, among other things, the integrity of our consolidated financial statements, our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and the overall effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Our Audit Committee also, taking into consideration the Board allocation of the review of risk among various committees of the Board, discusses with management guidelines and policies to govern the process by which risk assessment and risk management are undertaken, including the assessment of our major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. Our Credit Committee oversees, among other things, the identification and management of our credit exposures on an enterprise-wide basis, our responses to trends affecting those exposures, the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and our credit related policies. Our Enterprise Risk Committee oversees, among other things, our identification of, management of and planning for material risks on an enterprise-wide basis, including market risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and reputational risk. Our Enterprise Risk Committee also oversees our capital management and liquidity planning. Each of these committees regularly reports to our Board on risk-related matters within the committee responsibilities, which collectively provides our Board with integrated, thorough insight about our management of our enterprise-wide risks. At meetings of our Audit, Credit and Enterprise Risk Committees and our Board, directors receive updates from management regarding enterprise risk management, including our performance against our risk appetite. Executive management develops for Board approval the Corporation Risk Framework, Risk Appetite Statement and financial operating plans. Management monitors, and the Board oversees, through the Credit, Enterprise Risk and Audit Committees, financial performance, execution of the strategic and financial operating plans, compliance with the risk appetite and the adequacy of internal controls. Bank of America 2012 69 Strategic Risk Management Strategic risk is embedded in every business and is one of the major risk categories along with credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. It is the risk that results from adverse business decisions, ineffective or inappropriate business plans, or failure to respond to changes in the competitive environment, business cycles, customer preferences, product obsolescence, regulatory environment, business strategy execution and/or other inherent risks of the business. Other inherent risks of the business include reputational and operational risk. In the financial services industry, strategic risk is elevated due to changing customer, competitive and regulatory environments. Our appetite for strategic risk is assessed within the context of the strategic plan, with strategic risks selectively and carefully considered in the context of the evolving marketplace. Strategic risk is managed in the context of our overall financial condition and assessed, managed and acted on by the CEO and executive management team. Significant strategic actions, such as material acquisitions or capital actions, require review and approval by the Board. Executive management approves a strategic plan each year. Annually, executive management develops a financial operating plan that implements the strategic goals for that year, which is reviewed and approved by the Board. With oversight by the Board, executive management ensures consistency is applied while executing the Corporation strategic plan, core operating tenets and risk appetite. The following are assessed in their reviews: forecasted earnings and returns on capital, the current risk profile, current capital and liquidity requirements, staffing levels and changes required to support the plan, stress testing results, and other qualitative factors such as market growth rates and peer analysis. At the business level, as we introduce new products, we monitor their performance to evaluate expectations (e.g., for earnings and returns on capital). With oversight by the Board, executive management performs similar analyses throughout the year, and evaluates changes to the financial forecast or the risk, capital or liquidity positions as deemed appropriate to balance and optimize between achieving the targeted risk appetite, shareholder returns and maintaining the targeted financial strength. We use proprietary models to measure the capital requirements for credit, country, market, operational and strategic risks. The economic capital assigned to each business is based on its unique risk exposures. With oversight by the Board, executive management assesses the risk-adjusted returns of each business in approving strategic and financial operating plans. The businesses use economic capital to define business strategies, price products and transactions, and evaluate client profitability. For additional information on how this measure is calculated, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 35 . Capital Management The Corporation manages its capital position to maintain sufficient capital to support our business activities and maintain capital, risk and risk appetite commensurate with one another. Additionally, we seek to maintain safety and soundness at all times including under adverse conditions, take advantage of organic growth opportunities, maintain ready access to financial markets, continue to serve as a credit intermediary, remain a source of strength for our subsidiaries, and satisfy current and future regulatory capital requirements. To determine the appropriate level of capital, we assess the results of our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), the current economic and market environment, and feedback from key stakeholders including investors, rating agencies and regulators. Based upon this analysis, we set guidelines for capital ratios to maintain an adequate capital position, including in severe adverse economic scenarios. Management and the Board annually approve a comprehensive capital plan which documents the ICAAP and related results, analysis and support for the capital guidelines, and planned capital actions. The ICAAP incorporates capital forecasts, stress test results, economic capital, qualitative risk assessments and assessment of regulatory changes. Throughout the year, we generate regulatory capital and economic capital forecasts that are aligned to the most recent earnings, balance sheet and risk forecasts. We utilize quarterly stress tests to assess the potential impacts to our balance sheet, earnings, capital and liquidity of a variety of stress scenarios. We perform qualitative risk assessments to identify and assess material risks not fully captured in the forecasts, stress tests or economic capital. We regularly assess the capital impacts of proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements. Management regularly assesses ICAAP results and provides documented quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the capital guidelines and capital position to the Board or its committees. Capital management is integrated into our risk and governance processes, as capital is a key consideration in the development of the strategic plan, risk appetite and risk limits. Economic capital is allocated to each business unit and used to perform risk-adjusted return analyses at the business unit, client relationship and transaction levels. Regulatory Capital As a financial services holding company, we are subject to the risk-based capital guidelines (Basel 1) issued by federal banking regulators. At December 31, 2012 , we operated banking activities primarily under two charters: BANA and FIA Card Services, N.A. (FIA). Under these guidelines, the Corporation and its affiliated banking entities measure capital adequacy based on Tier 1 common capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital). Capital ratios are calculated by dividing each capital amount by risk-weighted assets. Additionally, Tier 1 capital is divided by adjusted quarterly average total assets to derive the Tier 1 leverage ratio. Tier 1 capital is calculated as the sum of core capital elements, the principal components of which are qualifying common shareholders equity and qualifying non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. Also included in Tier 1 capital are qualifying trust preferred securities (Trust Securities), hybrid securities and qualifying noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries which are subject to the rules governing restricted core capital elements. Goodwill, other disallowed intangible assets, disallowed deferred tax assets and the cumulative changes in fair value of all financial liabilities accounted for under the fair value option that are included in retained earnings and are attributable to changes in the company own creditworthiness are deducted from the sum of the core capital elements. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 plus supplementary Tier 2 capital elements such as qualifying subordinated debt, a limited portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses, and a portion of net unrealized gains on AFS marketable equity securities. Tier 1 common capital is not 70 Bank of America 2012 an official regulatory ratio, but was introduced by the Federal Reserve during the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program in 2009. Tier 1 common capital is Tier 1 capital less preferred stock, Trust Securities, hybrid securities and qualifying noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries. Risk-weighted assets are calculated for credit risk for all on- and off-balance sheet credit exposures and for market risk on trading assets and liabilities, including derivative exposures. Credit risk-weighted assets are calculated by assigning a prescribed risk-weight to all on-balance sheet assets and to the credit equivalent amount of certain off-balance sheet exposures. The risk-weight is defined in the regulatory rules based upon the obligor or guarantor type and collateral if applicable. Off-balance sheet exposures include financial guarantees, unfunded lending commitments, letters of credit and derivatives. Market risk-weighted assets are calculated using risk models for the trading account positions, including all foreign exchange and commodity positions regardless of the applicable accounting guidance. Under Basel 1 there are no risk-weighted assets calculated for operational risk. Any assets that are a direct deduction from the computation of capital are excluded from risk-weighted assets and adjusted average total assets consistent with regulatory guidance. Certain corporate-sponsored trust companies which issue Trust Securities are not consolidated. In accordance with Federal Reserve guidance effective March 31, 2011, Trust Securities continue to qualify as Tier 1 capital with revised quantitative limits. As a result, the Corporation includes Trust Securities in Basel 1 Tier 1 capital. The Financial Reform Act includes a provision under which Trust Securities will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital. Under one of three notices of proposed rulemaking on Basel 3 issued by U.S. banking regulatory agencies, the Corporation previously issued and outstanding Trust Securities in the aggregate qualifying amount of $6.2 billion (approximately 51 bps of Tier 1 capital) at December 31, 2012 , will not qualify as Tier 1 capital. While not yet final, the proposed rules provide a three-year transition period in which the exclusion of Trust Securities from Tier 1 capital will be phased in incrementally each year. The Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and requests for capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). The CCAR is the central element to the Federal Reserve approach to ensuring large BHCs have adequate capital and robust processes for managing their capital. In January 2012, we submitted our 2012 capital plan, and received results on March 13, 2012. The Federal Reserve stress scenario projections for the Corporation, based on the 2012 capital plan, estimated a minimum Basel 1 Tier 1 common capital ratio of 5.9 percent under severe adverse economic conditions with all proposed capital actions through the end of 2013, exceeding the five percent reference rate for all institutions involved in the CCAR. The capital plan submitted by the Corporation to the Federal Reserve did not include a request to return capital to stockholders in 2012 above the current dividend rate. The Federal Reserve did not object to our 2012 capital plan. On January 7, 2013, we submitted our 2013 capital plan and related supervisory stress tests. The Federal Reserve has announced its intention to notify the 2013 CCAR participants of the supervisory stress test results on March 7, 2013 and the capital plan on March 14, 2013. For additional information on these and other regulatory requirements, see Note 17 Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Capital Composition and Ratios Under Basel 1, Tier 1 common capital increased $6.7 billion in 2012 to $133.4 billion at December 31, 2012 . The increase was primarily driven by earnings eligible to be included in capital, which positively impacted the Tier 1 common capital ratio by approximately 59 bps, including the impact of repurchases of certain of our debt and Trust Securities. The Tier 1 common capital ratio also benefited seven bps from the issuance of common stock in lieu of cash for a portion of employee incentive compensation. Total capital decreased $18.4 billion in 2012 to $196.7 billion at December 31, 2012 primarily due to a reduction in subordinated debt as a result of redemptions and a reduction in Trust Securities from redemptions and exchanges. Risk-weighted assets decreased $78.5 billion in 2012 to $1,206 billion at December 31, 2012 . The decrease was primarily driven by decreases in derivatives, letters of credit and other assets. These decreases positively impacted Tier 1 common, Tier 1 and Total capital ratios by 64 bps, 78 bps and 102 bps, respectively. The Tier 1 leverage ratio decreased 16 bps in 2012 primarily driven by the decrease in Tier 1 capital. Table 13 presents Bank of America Corporation capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 1 at December 31, 2012 and 2011 .

Regulatory Capital Changes At December 31, 2012, we measured and reported our capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 1. We manage regulatory capital to adhere to internal capital guidelines and regulatory standards of capital adequacy based on our current understanding of the rules and the application of such rules to our business as currently conducted. See Capital Management on page 70 for additional information. In June 2012, U.S. banking regulators issued the Market Risk Final Rule that amends the Basel 1 Market Risk rules (Market Risk Final Rule) effective January 1, 2013. The Market Risk Final Rule introduces new measures of market risk, a charge related to a stressed Value-at-Risk (VaR), an incremental risk charge and a comprehensive risk measure, as well as other technical modifications. As of December 31, 2012, the estimated impact of the Market Risk Final Rule would have been a 68 bps decrease in the Tier 1 common capital ratio to 10.38 percent as a result of a $78.8 billion increase in risk-weighted assets for market risk exposures. The regulatory capital rules continue to expand and evolve. In December 2007, U.S. banking regulators published final Basel 2 rules (Basel 2). We measure and report our capital ratios and related information under Basel 2 on a confidential basis to U.S. banking regulators during the required parallel period, during which we provide the U.S. banking regulators both Basel 1 and Basel 2 related information in parallel. The parallel period will continue until we receive regulatory approval to exit parallel reporting and subsequently begin publicly reporting our Basel 2 regulatory capital results and related disclosures. In June 2012, U.S. banking regulators issued three notices of proposed rulemaking (collectively, the Basel 3 NPRs) which, if adopted as proposed, would materially change Tier 1 common, Tier 1 and Total capital calculations. The Basel 3 NPRs also introduce new minimum capital ratios and buffer requirements, expand and modify the calculation of risk-weighted assets for credit and market risk (the Advanced Approach) and introduce a Standardized Approach for the calculation of risk-weighted assets, which would replace Basel 1 and provide a floor for minimum, adequately capitalized regulatory capital requirements under the Prompt Corrective Action framework. The Prompt Corrective Action framework establishes categories of capitalization, including well-capitalized, based on regulatory ratio requirements. U.S. banking regulators are required to take certain mandatory actions depending on the category of capitalization. No mandatory actions are required under the Prompt Corrective Action framework for well-capitalized banking entities. Under the Basel 3 NPRs, Trust Securities will be phased out of Tier 1 capital in equal annual installments over a three-year transition period. Many of the changes to the composition of regulatory capital are subject to a transition period where the impact is recognized in 20 percent increments, phased in incrementally each year over a five-year period. The phase-in period for the new minimum capital requirements and related buffers is proposed to occur from the effective date of the Basel 3 NPRs through 2019. On November 9, 2012, U.S. banking regulators announced that they did not expect any of the Basel 3 NPRs to become effective January 1, 2013. Final rules for Basel 3 have not yet been issued by U.S. banking regulators. Under the Basel 3 NPRs we will be subject to the Advanced Approach for measuring risk-weighted assets (Basel 3 Advanced Approach) when finalized and implemented. The Basel 3 Advanced Approach also requires approval by the U.S. regulatory agencies of analytical models used as part of capital measurement. If these models are not approved, it would likely lead to an increase in our risk-weighted assets, which in some cases could be significant. The Basel 3 Advanced Approach, if adopted as proposed, is expected to substantially increase our capital requirements as discussed below. 72 Bank of America 2012 In 2011, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee) issued proposed guidance on capital requirements for global, systemically important financial institutions, of which we are one, including the methodology for measuring systemic importance, the additional capital required (the SIFI buffer), and the arrangements by which the guidance will be phased in. As proposed, the SIFI buffer would increase minimum capital requirements for Tier 1 common capital from one percent to 2.5 percent , and in certain circumstances, 3.5 percent . As of December 31, 2012, we estimate our SIFI buffer would have been 1.5 percent, in line with the Financial Stability Board report, Update of Group of Global Systemically Important Banks, issued on November 1, 2012. U.S. banking regulators have not yet issued proposed or final rules related to the SIFI buffer. On December 20, 2011, the Federal Reserve issued proposed rules to implement enhanced supervisory and prudential requirements, and the early remediation requirements established under the Financial Reform Act. The enhanced standards include liquidity standards, requirements for overall risk management, single-counterparty credit limits, stress test requirements and a debt-to-equity limit for certain companies determined to pose a threat to financial stability. The final rules, when adopted and fully implemented, are likely to influence our regulatory capital and liquidity planning process, and may impose additional operational and compliance costs on us. Preparing for the implementation of the new capital rules is a top strategic priority, and we expect to comply with the final rules when issued and effective. Based on Basel 2, the Market Risk Final Rule and our current understanding of the Basel 3 Advanced Approach issued by U.S. banking regulators, we estimated our Basel 3 Advanced Approach Tier 1 common capital ratio, on a fully phased-in basis, to be 9.25 percent at December 31, 2012 . As of December 31, 2012 , we estimated that our Tier 1 common capital would be $128.6 billion and total risk-weighted assets would be $1,391 billion , also on a fully phased-in basis. This assumes approval by U.S. banking regulators of our internal analytical models, but does not include the benefit of the removal of the surcharge applicable to the Comprehensive Risk Measure (CRM). The CRM is used to determine the risk-weighted assets for correlation trading positions. Under the Basel 3 NPRs, Tier 1 common capital includes components that exhibit heightened sensitivity to changes in interest rates, such as the cumulative change in the fair value of AFS debt securities and at least 10 percent of the fair value of MSRs recognized on the Corporation Consolidated Balance Sheet. Important differences between Basel 1 and Basel 3 include capital deductions related to our MSRs, deferred tax assets and defined benefit pension assets, and the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on debt and equity securities recognized in accumulated OCI, each of which will be impacted by future changes in interest rates, overall earnings performance or other Corporate actions. Our estimates under the Basel 3 Advanced Approach will be refined over time as a result of further rulemaking or clarification by U.S. banking regulators and as our understanding and interpretation of the rules evolve. Basel 3 regulatory capital metrics are non-GAAP measures until they are fully adopted and required by U.S. banking regulators. Table 15 presents a reconciliation of our Basel 1 Tier 1 common capital and risk-weighted assets to our Basel 3 estimates at December 31, 2012 , assuming fully phased-in measures according to the Basel 3 Advanced Approach.

The Tier 1 leverage ratio decreased six bps to 8.59 percent at December 31, 2012 compared to December 31, 2011 . The increase in the Tier 1 capital ratio was driven by earnings eligible to be included in capital of $12.3 billion and a decrease in risk-weighted assets of $69.1 billion compared to the prior year, largely offset by dividends paid to the Corporation of $14.1 billion during 2012 . The decrease in the Total capital ratio was driven by a $12.0 billion decrease in qualifying subordinated debt, partially offset by the net impact of earnings eligible to be included in capital and a decrease in risk-weighted assets. The decrease in the Tier 1 leverage ratio was driven by a decrease in Tier 1 capital, partially offset by a decrease in adjusted quarterly average total assets. FIA Tier 1 capital ratio decreased 29 bps to 17.34 percent and the Total capital ratio decreased 37 bps to 18.64 percent at December 31, 2012 compared to December 31, 2011 . The Tier 1 leverage ratio decreased 55 bps to 13.67 percent at December 31, 2012 compared to December 31, 2011 . The decrease in the Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios was driven by returns of capital of $6.6 billion to the Corporation during 2012 , partially offset by earnings eligible to be included in capital of $4.2 billion and a decrease in risk-weighted assets primarily due to a decrease in loans. The decrease in the Tier 1 leverage ratio was driven by the decrease in Tier 1 capital, partially offset by a decrease in adjusted quarterly average total assets of $12.0 billion. Broker/Dealer Regulatory Capital The Corporation principal U.S. broker/dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith (MLPF&S) and Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp (MLPCC). MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of MLPF&S and provides clearing and settlement services. Both entities are subject to the net capital requirements of SEC Rule 15c3-1. Both entities are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to the CFTC Regulation 1.17. MLPF&S has elected to compute the minimum capital requirement in accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirement as permitted by SEC Rule 15c3-1. At December 31, 2012 , MLPF&S regulatory net capital as defined by Rule 15c3-1 was $10.3 billion and exceeded the minimum requirement of $683 million by $9.7 billion. MLPCC net capital of $2.1 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $236 million by $1.8 billion. In accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirements, MLPF&S is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion, net capital in excess of $500 million and notify the SEC in the event its tentative net capital is less than $5.0 billion. At December 31, 2012 , MLPF&S had tentative net capital and net capital in excess of the minimum and notification requirements. Economic Capital Our economic capital measurement process provides a risk-based measurement of the capital required for unexpected credit, market and operational losses over a one-year time horizon at a 99.97 percent confidence level. Economic capital is allocated to each business unit and is used for capital adequacy, performance measurement and risk management purposes. The strategic planning process utilizes economic capital with the goal of allocating risk appropriately and measuring returns consistently across all businesses and activities. Economic capital allocation plans are incorporated into the Corporation financial plan which is approved by the Board on an annual basis. Credit Risk Capital Economic capital for credit risk captures two types of risks: default risk, which represents the loss of principal due to outright default or the borrower inability to repay an obligation in full, and migration risk, which represents potential loss in market value due to credit deterioration over a one-year capital time horizon. Credit risk is assessed and modeled for all on- and off-balance sheet credit exposures within sub-categories for commercial, retail, counterparty and investment securities. The economic capital methodology captures dimensions such as concentration and country risk and originated securitizations. The economic capital methodology is based on the probability of default, loss given default (LGD), exposure at default (EAD) and maturity for each credit exposure, and the portfolio correlations across exposures. See page 79 for more information on Credit Risk Management . 74 Bank of America 2012 Market Risk Capital Market risk reflects the potential loss in the value of financial instruments or portfolios due to movements in interest and currency exchange rates, equity and futures prices, the implied volatility of interest rates, credit spreads, and other economic and business factors. The Corporation primary market risk exposures are in its trading portfolio, equity investments, MSRs and the interest rate exposure of our core balance sheet. Economic capital is determined by utilizing the same models we use to manage these risks including, for example, VaR, simulation, stress testing and scenario analysis. See page 113 for additional information on Market Risk Management . Operational Risk Capital We calculate operational risk capital at the business unit level using actuarial-based models and historical loss data. We supplement the calculations with scenario analysis and risk control assessments. See Operational Risk Management on page 120 for more information. Common Stock Dividends For a summary of our declared quarterly cash dividends on common stock during 2012 and through February 28, 2013 , see Note 14 Shareholders Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Liquidity Risk Funding and Liquidity Risk Management We define liquidity risk as the potential inability to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations, on- or off-balance sheet, as they come due. Our primary liquidity objective is to provide adequate funding for our businesses throughout market cycles, including periods of financial stress. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk, maintain excess liquidity and access diverse funding sources including our stable deposit base. We define excess liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our funding requirements as those obligations arise. Global funding and liquidity risk management activities are centralized within Corporate Treasury. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity risk management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. The Enterprise Risk Committee approves the Corporation liquidity policy and contingency funding plan, including establishing liquidity risk tolerance levels. The ALMRC monitors our liquidity position and reviews the impact of strategic decisions on our liquidity. ALMRC is responsible for managing liquidity risks and maintaining exposures within the established tolerance levels. ALMRC delegates additional oversight responsibilities to the CFORC, which reports to the ALMRC. The CFORC reviews and monitors our liquidity position, cash flow forecasts, stress testing scenarios and results, and implements our liquidity limits and guidelines. For more information, see Board Oversight of Risk on page 68 . Under this governance framework, we have developed certain funding and liquidity risk management practices which include: maintaining excess liquidity at the parent company and selected subsidiaries, including our bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries; determining what amounts of excess liquidity are appropriate for these entities based on analysis of debt maturities and other potential cash outflows, including those that we may experience during stressed market conditions; diversifying funding sources, considering our asset profile and legal entity structure; and performing contingency planning. Global Excess Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets We maintain excess liquidity available to Bank of America Corporation, or the parent company, and selected subsidiaries in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. These assets, which we call our Global Excess Liquidity Sources, serve as our primary means of liquidity risk mitigation. Our cash is primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve and central banks outside of the U.S. We limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS and a select group of non-U.S. government and supranational securities. We believe we can quickly obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed market conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold our Global Excess Liquidity Sources in entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities. Our Global Excess Liquidity Sources were $372 billion and $378 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011 and were maintained as presented in Table 17 . Table 17 Global Excess Liquidity Sources December 31 Average for Three Months Ended December 31 2012 (Dollars in billions) 2012 2011 Parent company $ 103 $ 125 $ 99 Bank subsidiaries 247 222 264 Broker/dealers 22 31 25 Total global excess liquidity sources $ 372 $ 378 $ 388 As shown in Table 17 , parent company Global Excess Liquidity Sources totaled $103 billion and $125 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . The decrease in parent company liquidity was primarily due to reductions in long-term debt, partially offset by dividends and capital repayments from subsidiaries. Typically, parent company cash is deposited overnight with BANA. Global Excess Liquidity Sources available to our bank subsidiaries totaled $247 billion and $222 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . These amounts are distinct from the cash deposited by the parent company. The increase in liquidity available to our bank subsidiaries was primarily due to an increase in deposits, partially offset by capital returns to the parent company and reductions in debt. In addition to their Global Excess Liquidity Sources, our bank subsidiaries hold other unencumbered investment-grade securities that we believe could also be used to generate liquidity. Our bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of other unencumbered loans and securities to certain Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified Bank of America 2012 75 eligible assets was approximately $194 billion and $189 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined by guidelines outlined by the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can only be used to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries and can only be transferred to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries with prior regulatory approval. Global Excess Liquidity Sources available to our broker/dealer subsidiaries totaled $22 billion and $31 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Our broker/dealers also held other unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could also be used to generate additional liquidity. Liquidity held in a broker/dealer subsidiary is available to meet the obligations of that entity and can only be transferred to the parent company or to any other subsidiary with prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Table 18 presents the composition of Global Excess Liquidity Sources at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Table 18 Global Excess Liquidity Sources Composition December 31 (Dollars in billions) 2012 2011 Cash on deposit $ 65 $ 79 U.S. treasuries 21 48 U.S. agency securities and mortgage-backed securities 271 228 Non-U.S. government and supranational securities 15 23 Total global excess liquidity sources $ 372 $ 378 Time to Required Funding and Stress Modeling We use a variety of metrics to determine the appropriate amounts of excess liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries. One metric we use to evaluate the appropriate level of excess liquidity at the parent company is Time to Required Funding. This debt coverage measure indicates the number of months that the parent company can continue to meet its unsecured contractual obligations as they come due using only its Global Excess Liquidity Sources without issuing any new debt or accessing any additional liquidity sources. We define unsecured contractual obligations for purposes of this metric as maturities of senior or subordinated debt issued or guaranteed by Bank of America Corporation or Merrill Lynch. These include certain unsecured debt instruments, primarily structured liabilities, which we may be required to settle for cash prior to maturity. The Corporation has established a target for Time to Required Funding of 21 months. Our Time to Required Funding was 33 months at December 31, 2012 . For purposes of calculating Time to Required Funding at December 31, 2012 , we have also included in the amount of unsecured contractual obligations the $8.6 billion liability related to the BNY Mellon Settlement. The BNY Mellon Settlement is subject to final court approval and certain other conditions, and the timing of payment is not certain. We utilize liquidity stress models to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of excess liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries. These models are risk sensitive and have become increasingly important in analyzing our potential contractual and contingent cash outflows beyond those outflows considered in the Time to Required Funding analysis. We evaluate the liquidity requirements under a range of scenarios with varying levels of severity and time horizons. The scenarios we consider and utilize incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific events, including potential credit rating downgrades for the parent company and our subsidiaries, and are based on historical experience, regulatory guidance, and both expected and unexpected future events. The types of potential contractual and contingent cash outflows we consider in our scenarios may include, but are not limited to, upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt and reductions in new debt issuance; diminished access to secured financing markets; potential deposit withdrawals and reduced rollover of maturing term deposits by customers; increased draws on loan commitments, liquidity facilities and letters of credit, including Variable Rate Demand Notes; additional collateral that counterparties could call if our credit ratings were downgraded further; collateral, margin and subsidiary capital requirements arising from losses; and potential liquidity required to maintain businesses and finance customer activities. Changes in certain market factors, including, but not limited to, credit rating downgrades, could negatively impact potential contractual and contingent outflows and the related financial instruments, and in some cases these impacts could be material to our financial results. We consider all sources of funds that we could access during each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by legal entity. We also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset-liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses. Basel 3 Liquidity Standards In December 2010, the Basel Committee proposed two measures of liquidity risk which are considered part of Basel 3. The first proposed liquidity measure is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), which is calculated as the amount of a financial institution unencumbered, high-quality, liquid assets relative to the net cash outflows the institution could encounter under a significant 30-day stress scenario. The Basel Committee announced in January 2013 that an initial minimum LCR requirement of 60 percent will be implemented in January 2015, and will thereafter increase in 10 percent annual increments through January 2019. The second proposed liquidity measure is the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), which measures the amount of longer-term, stable sources of funding employed by a financial institution relative to the liquidity profiles of the assets funded and the potential for contingent calls on funding liquidity arising from off-balance sheet commitments and obligations over a one-year period. The Basel Committee is currently reviewing the NSFR requirement and intends for the requirement to be implemented by January 2018, following an observation period that is currently underway. We continue to monitor the development and the potential impact of these proposals and assuming adoption by U.S. banking regulators, we expect to meet the final standards within the regulatory timelines. 76 Bank of America 2012 Diversified Funding Sources We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits and secured and unsecured liabilities through a globally coordinated funding strategy. We diversify our funding globally across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.11 trillion and $1.03 trillion at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Deposits are primarily generated by our CBB , GWIM and Global Banking segments. These deposits are diversified by clients, product type and geography, and the majority of our U.S. deposits are insured by the FDIC. We consider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of funding. We believe this deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources. Our lending activities may also be financed through secured borrowings, including securitizations with GSEs, the FHA and private-label investors, as well as FHLB loans. Our trading activities in broker/dealer subsidiaries are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. We believe funding these activities in the secured financing markets is more cost-efficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing. Repurchase agreements are generally short-term and often overnight. Disruptions in secured financing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in the availability of such financing. We manage the liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding globally from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when appropriate. We issue the majority of our long-term unsecured debt at the parent company. During 2012 , the parent company issued $17.6 billion of long-term unsecured debt, including structured liabilities of $9.2 billion. We may also issue long-term unsecured debt through BANA in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile, although there were no new issuances through BANA during 2012 . While the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or the Corporation, we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month or quarter. The primary benefits expected from our centralized funding strategy include greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time zone differences or other business considerations make parent company funding impractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt. Table 19 presents our long-term debt by major currency at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Table 19 Long-term Debt by Major Currency December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 U.S. Dollar $ 180,329 $ 255,262 Euro 58,985 68,799 Japanese Yen 12,749 19,568 British Pound 11,126 12,554 Canadian Dollar 3,560 4,621 Australian Dollar 2,760 4,900 Swiss Franc 1,917 2,268 Other 4,159 4,293 Total long-term debt $ 275,585 $ 372,265 Total long-term debt decreased $96.7 billion , or 26 percent , in 2012 , primarily driven by maturities and liability management actions. This reflects our ongoing initiative to reduce our debt balances over time and we anticipate that debt levels will continue to decline from maturities through 2013. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt securities in various transactions, depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity and other factors. In addition, our broker/dealer subsidiaries may make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. For additional information on long-term debt funding, see Note 12 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For further details on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for Nontrading Activities on page 117 . We also diversify our unsecured funding sources by issuing various types of debt instruments including structured liabilities, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivative positions and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured liability obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. We had outstanding structured liabilities with a carrying value of $51.7 billion and $50.9 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. Bank of America 2012 77 Prior to 2010, we participated in the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP), which allowed us to issue senior unsecured debt guaranteed by the FDIC in return for a fee based on the amount and maturity of the debt. At December 31, 2012 , there were no outstanding borrowings under the TLGP and we no longer issue debt under this program. At December 31, 2011 , we had $23.9 billion outstanding and all of the debt issued under the TLGP matured by June 30, 2012. Contingency Planning We maintain contingency funding plans that outline our potential responses to liquidity stress events at various levels of severity. These policies and plans are based on stress scenarios and include potential funding strategies and communication and notification procedures that we would implement in the event we experienced stressed liquidity conditions. We periodically review and test the contingency funding plans to validate efficacy and assess readiness. Our U.S. bank subsidiaries can access contingency funding through the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries have access to central bank facilities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. While we do not rely on these sources in our liquidity modeling, we maintain the policies, procedures and governance processes that would enable us to access these sources if necessary. Credit Ratings Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are impacted by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including OTC derivatives. Thus, it is our objective to maintain high-quality credit ratings. Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies which consider a number of factors, including our own financial strength, performance, prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control. The rating agencies could make adjustments to our ratings at any time and they provide no assurances that they will maintain our ratings at current levels. Other factors that influence our credit ratings include changes to the rating agencies methodologies for our industry or certain security types, the rating agencies assessment of the general operating environment for financial services companies, our mortgage exposures, our relative positions in the markets in which we compete, reputation, liquidity position, diversity of funding sources, funding costs, the level and volatility of earnings, corporate governance and risk management policies, capital position, capital management practices, and current or future regulatory and legislative initiatives. On December 20, 2012, Standard & Poor Ratings Services (S&P) published a full credit analysis report on the Corporation, leaving the credit ratings for the company and its subsidiaries unchanged as of that date. On October 10, 2012, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) announced the results of its periodic review of its ratings for 12 large, complex securities trading and universal banks, including the Corporation. As part of this action, Fitch affirmed the Corporation credit ratings. On June 21, 2012, Moody Investors Service Inc. (Moody s) completed its previously-announced review for possible downgrade of financial institutions with global capital markets operations, downgrading the ratings of 15 banks and securities firms, including our ratings. The Corporation long-term debt rating and BANA long-term and short-term debt ratings were downgraded one notch as part of this action. The Moody downgrade has not had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Each of the three major rating agencies, Moody s, S&P and Fitch, downgraded the ratings for the Corporation and its rated subsidiaries in late 2011. Currently, the Corporation long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies are as follows: Baa2/P-2 (negative) by Moody s, A-/A-2 (negative) by S&P, and A/F1 (stable) by Fitch. BANA long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks are as follows: A3/P-2 (stable) by Moody s, A/A-1 (negative) by S&P, and A/F1 (stable) by Fitch. The credit ratings of Merrill Lynch from the three major credit rating agencies are the same as those of the Corporation. The major credit rating agencies have indicated that the primary drivers of Merrill Lynch credit ratings are the Corporation credit ratings. MLPF&S long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks are A/A-1 (negative) by S&P and A/F1 (stable) by Fitch. Merrill Lynch International long-term/short-term senior debt rating is A/A-1 (negative) by S&P. The major rating agencies have each indicated that, as a systemically important financial institution, our credit ratings currently reflect their expectation that, if necessary, we would receive significant support from the U.S. government, and that they will continue to assess such support in the context of sovereign financial strength and regulatory and legislative developments. A further reduction in certain of our credit ratings or the ratings of certain asset-backed securitizations may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, potential loss of access to credit markets, the related cost of funds, our businesses and on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where counterparty creditworthiness is critical. In addition, under the terms of certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, in the event of further downgrades of our or our rated subsidiaries credit ratings, the counterparties to those agreements may require us to provide additional collateral, or to terminate these contracts or agreements, which could cause us to sustain losses and/or adversely impact our liquidity. If the short-term credit ratings of our parent company, bank or broker/dealer subsidiaries were downgraded by one or more levels, the potential loss of access to short-term funding sources such as repo financing and the effect on our incremental cost of funds could be material. At December 31, 2012 , if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch, the amount of additional collateral contractually required by derivative contracts and other trading agreements would have been approximately $3.3 billion comprised of $2.9 billion for BANA and $418 million for Merrill Lynch and certain of its subsidiaries. If the agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for these entities by a second incremental notch, approximately $4.4 billion in additional incremental collateral comprised of $455 million for BANA and $4.0 billion for Merrill Lynch and certain of its subsidiaries would have been required. 78 Bank of America 2012 Also, if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch, the derivative liability that would be subject to unilateral termination by counterparties as of December 31, 2012 was $3.8 billion , against which $3.0 billion of collateral has been posted. If the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation and certain subsidiaries by a second incremental notch, the derivative liability that would be subject to unilateral termination by counterparties as of December 31, 2012 was an incremental $1.7 billion , against which $1.1 billion of collateral has been posted. While certain potential impacts are contractual and quantifiable, the full scope of consequences of a credit ratings downgrade to a financial institution is inherently uncertain, as it depends upon numerous dynamic, complex and inter-related factors and assumptions, including whether any downgrade of a firm long-term credit ratings precipitates downgrades to its short-term credit ratings, and assumptions about the potential behaviors of various customers, investors and counterparties. For additional information on potential impacts of credit rating downgrades, see Time to Required Funding and Stress Modeling on page 76 . For information regarding the additional collateral and termination payments that could be required in connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements as a result of such a credit rating downgrade, see Item 1A. Risk Factors . On June 8, 2012, S&P affirmed its AA+ long-term and A-1+ short-term sovereign credit rating on the U.S. government. The outlook remains negative. On July 10, 2012, Fitch affirmed its AAA long-term and F1+ short-term sovereign credit rating on the U.S. government. The outlook remains negative. Moody also rates the U.S. government AAA with a negative outlook. All three rating agencies have indicated that they will continue to assess fiscal projections and consolidation measures, as well as the medium-term economic outlook for the U.S. Credit Risk Management Credit quality improved during 2012 due in part to improving economic conditions. Our proactive credit risk management initiatives positively impacted the credit portfolio as charge-offs and delinquencies continued to improve across most portfolios and risk ratings improved in the commercial portfolios. For more information, see Executive Summary 2012 Economic and Business Environment on page 26 . Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations. Credit risk can also arise from operational failures that result in an erroneous advance, commitment or investment of funds. We define the credit exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the loss potential arising from all product classifications including loans and leases, deposit overdrafts, derivatives, assets held-for-sale and unfunded lending commitments which include loan commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees. Derivative positions are recorded at fair value and assets held-for-sale are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. Certain loans and unfunded commitments are accounted for under the fair value option. Credit risk for these categories of assets is not accounted for as part of the allowance for credit losses but as part of the fair value adjustments recorded in earnings. For derivative positions, our credit risk is measured as the net cost in the event the counterparties with contracts in which we are in a gain position fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. We use the current mark-to-market value to represent credit exposure without giving consideration to future mark-to-market changes. The credit risk amounts take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. Our consumer and commercial credit extension and review procedures take into account funded and unfunded credit exposures. For additional information on derivative and credit extension commitments, see Note 3 Derivatives and Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower or counterparty, repayment sources, the nature of underlying collateral, and other support given current events, conditions and expectations. We classify our portfolios as either consumer or commercial and monitor credit risk in each as discussed below. We proactively refine our underwriting and credit management practices as well as credit standards to meet the changing economic environment. To actively mitigate losses and enhance customer support in our consumer businesses, we have in place collection programs and loan modification and customer assistance infrastructures. We utilize a number of actions to mitigate losses in the commercial businesses including increasing the frequency and intensity of portfolio monitoring, hedging activity and our practice of transferring management of deteriorating commercial exposures to independent special asset officers as credits enter criticized categories. In January 2013, in connection with the FNMA Settlement, we repurchased for $6.6 billion certain residential mortgage loans that had previously been sold to FNMA, which we have valued at less than the purchase price. The majority of these repurchased loans will be included in our PCI portfolio. For additional information on the FNMA Settlement, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Representations and Warranties on page 54 and Note 8 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements . During 2012 , new regulatory guidance issued regarding the treatment of loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and regulatory interagency guidance issued on junior-lien consumer real estate loans adversely impacted the consumer portfolio nonperforming loan and net charge-off statistics. In addition, the National Mortgage Settlement adversely impacted net charge-offs but resulted in a corresponding reduction in nonperforming loans. For more information, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 80 and Table 21 . Certain European countries, including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, have experienced varying degrees of financial stress in recent years. For additional information on our exposures and related risks in non-U.S. countries, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 105 and Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Bank of America 2012 79 Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience. These models are a component of our consumer credit risk management process and are used in part to help make both new and existing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses, and economic capital allocations for credit risk. Since January 2008, and through 2012 , Bank of America and Countrywide have completed approximately 1.2 million loan modifications with customers. During 2012 , we completed more than 156,000 customer loan modifications with a total unpaid principal balance of approximately $34 billion, including approximately 41,400 permanent modifications under the government Making Home Affordable Program. Of the loan modifications completed in 2012 , in terms of both the volume of modifications and the unpaid principal balance associated with the underlying loans, most were in the portfolio serviced for investors and were not on our balance sheet. The most common types of modifications include a combination of rate reduction and/or capitalization of past due amounts which represented 54 percent of the volume of modifications completed in 2012 , while principal forbearance represented 18 percent, principal reductions and forgiveness represented 17 percent and capitalization of past due amounts represented seven percent. For modified loans on our balance sheet, these modification types are generally considered TDRs. For more information on TDRs and portfolio impacts, see Nonperforming Consumer Loans and Foreclosed Properties Activity on page 93 and Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Consumer Credit Portfolio Improvement in the U.S. economy, labor markets and home prices during 2012 resulted in lower credit losses across all major consumer portfolios. Although home prices have shown signs of improvement, the declines over the past several years continued to adversely impact the home loans portfolio. Improved credit quality across the consumer portfolio and the impact of the National Mortgage Settlement, as discussed in the following section, drove an $8.6 billion decrease in the consumer allowance for loan and lease losses to $21.1 billion at December 31, 2012 . For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 109 . As a result of the National Mortgage Settlement in 2012, which among other things provided for borrower assistance, we recorded charge-offs of $435 million related to fully forgiven non-PCI loans in the home equity portfolio, which resulted in reductions of the same amount in nonperforming loans. Associated with the National Mortgage Settlement in 2012, we also fully forgave home equity loans in the Countrywide PCI portfolio with a carrying value before reserves of $2.5 billion and an unpaid principal balance of $2.9 billion which resulted in a decrease in the corresponding allowance for loan and lease losses. These items had no impact on the provision for credit losses as these loans were fully reserved. For more information on the National Mortgage Settlement, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Other Mortgage-related Matters on page 61 . In 2012, new regulatory guidance was issued addressing consumer real estate loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In accordance with this new guidance, we now classify consumer real estate and other secured consumer loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower, as TDRs, irrespective of payment history or delinquency status, even if the repayment terms for the loan have not been otherwise modified. We continue to have a lien on the underlying collateral. Previously, such loans were classified as TDRs only if there had been a change in contractual payment terms that represented a concession to the borrower. The net impact upon implementation to the consumer real estate and other secured consumer portfolios of adopting this new regulatory guidance was a $551 million increase in net charge-offs as these loans were written-down to collateral value, and the full-year impact was a $596 million increase in net charge-offs in 2012 . This also resulted in an increase of $3.6 billion in TDRs and $1.2 billion in net new nonperforming loans upon implementation, of which $1.1 billion of such loans were included in nonperforming loans at December 31, 2012 . Of the $1.1 billion , $1.0 billion , or 92 percent , were current on their contractual payments. Of these contractually current nonperforming loans, more than 70 percent were discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy more than 12 months ago, and more than 40 percent were discharged 24 months or more ago. As subsequent cash payments are received, the interest component of the payments is generally recorded as interest income on a cash basis and the principal component is generally recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the loan. For more information on the impacts to consumer loans as a result of this new regulatory guidance, see Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . In 2012, the bank regulatory agencies jointly issued interagency supervisory guidance on nonaccrual status for junior-lien consumer real estate loans. In accordance with this regulatory interagency guidance, we now classify junior-lien home equity loans as nonperforming when the first-lien loan becomes 90 days past due even if the junior-lien loan is performing, and as a result, we reclassified $1.9 billion of performing home equity loans to nonperforming upon implementation, and $1.5 billion of such loans were included in nonperforming loans at December 31, 2012 . The regulatory interagency guidance had no impact on our allowance for loan and lease losses or provision for credit losses as the delinquency status of the underlying first-lien was already considered in our reserving process. For more information, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Home Equity on page 87 and Table 21 . For further information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, charge-offs and TDRs for the consumer portfolio, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 80 Bank of America 2012 Table 20 presents our outstanding consumer loans and the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio. Loans that were acquired from Countrywide and considered credit-impaired were recorded at fair value upon acquisition. In addition to being included in the Outstandings columns in Table 20 , these loans are also shown separately, net of purchase accounting adjustments, in the Countrywide Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio column. For additional information, see Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The impact of the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio on certain credit statistics is reported where appropriate. See Countrywide Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 90 for more information. Under certain circumstances, loans that were originally classified as discontinued real estate loans upon acquisition have been subsequently modified from pay option or subprime loans into loans with more conventional terms and are now included in the residential mortgage portfolio, but continue to be classified as PCI loans as shown in Table 20 .

(3) Net charge-offs include $551 million of current or less than 60 days past due loans charged off as a result of the completion of implementation of new regulatory guidance on loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and $45 million of loans charged off subsequent to the implementation. n/a = not applicable 82 Bank of America 2012 Table 22 presents accruing consumer loans past due 90 days or more and consumer nonperforming loans. Nonperforming loans do not include past due consumer credit card loans, other unsecured loans and in general, consumer non-real estate-secured loans (excluding those loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy) as these loans are typically charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. Real estate-secured past due consumer loans that are insured by the FHA or individually insured under long-term stand-by agreements with FNMA and FHLMC (collectively, the fully-insured loan portfolio) are reported as accruing as opposed to nonperforming since the principal repayment is insured. Fully-insured loans included in accruing past due 90 days or more are primarily related to our purchases of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements. Additionally, nonperforming loans and accruing balances past due 90 days or more do not include the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio or loans accounted for under the fair value option even though the customer may be contractually past due. For additional information on FHA loans, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Other Mortgage-related Matters on page 61 .

These write-offs decreased the PCI valuation allowance included as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. For information on PCI write-offs, see Countrywide Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 90 . (3) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option. Net charge-off ratios, excluding the Countrywide PCI and fully-insured loan portfolios, were 2.02 percent and 2.27 percent for residential mortgage, 3.98 percent and 3.77 percent for home equity, 6.10 percent and 7.14 percent for discontinued real estate and 2.99 percent and 3.62 percent for the total consumer portfolio for 2012 and 2011 . These are the only product classifications impacted by the Countrywide PCI and fully-insured loan portfolios for 2012 and 2011 . Net charge-offs exclude $2.8 billion of write-offs in the Countrywide home equity PCI loan portfolio for 2012 . These write-offs decreased the PCI valuation allowance included as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. The net charge-off ratio including the PCI write-offs for home equity was 6.02 percent in 2012.

(2) Nonperforming loans and net charge-offs include the impacts of the National Mortgage Settlement and guidance issued by regulatory agencies. For more information, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 80 and Table 21 . (3) Balances exclude consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option of $147 million and $906 million of residential mortgage loans and $858 million and $1.3 billion of discontinued real estate loans at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . See Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option on page 93 and Note 22 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the fair value option. (4) The $2.8 billion of write-offs in the Countrywide home equity PCI loan portfolio for 2012 decreased the PCI valuation allowance included as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. For information on PCI write-offs, see Countrywide Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 90 . We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following discussions of the residential mortgage, home equity and discontinued real estate portfolios, we provide information that excludes the impact of the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option in certain credit quality statistics. We separately disclose information on the Countrywide PCI loan portfolios on page 90 . Residential Mortgage The residential mortgage portfolio, which for purposes of the consumer credit portfolio discussion and related tables excludes the discontinued real estate portfolio acquired from Countrywide, makes up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 44 percent of consumer loans at December 31, 2012 . Approximately 17 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio is in GWIM and represents residential mortgages that are originated for the home purchase and refinancing needs of our wealth management clients. The remaining portion of the portfolio is primarily in All Other and is comprised of originated loans, purchased loans used in our overall ALM activities, delinquent FHA loans repurchased pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA as well as loans repurchased related to our representations and warranties. Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio, excluding $147 million of loans accounted for under the fair value option, decreased $19.1 billion in 2012 as paydowns, charge-offs 84 Bank of America 2012 and transfers to foreclosed properties more than offset new origination volume retained on our balance sheet. At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the residential mortgage portfolio included $90.9 billion and $93.9 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans. On this portion of the residential mortgage portfolio, we are protected against principal loss as a result of either FHA insurance or long-term stand-by agreements with FNMA and FHLMC. At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , $66.6 billion and $69.5 billion had FHA insurance and $24.3 billion and $24.4 billion were protected by long-term stand-by agreements. All of these loans are individually insured and therefore the Corporation does not record an allowance for credit losses with respect to these loans. At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , $25.5 billion and $24.0 billion of the FHA-insured loan population were delinquent FHA loans repurchased pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA. In addition to the long-term stand-by agreements with FNMA and FHLMC, we have mitigated a portion of our credit risk on the residential mortgage portfolio through the use of synthetic securitization vehicles as described in Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the synthetic securitization vehicles referenced principal balances of $17.6 billion and $23.9 billion of residential mortgage loans and provided loss protection up to $500 million and $783 million . At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the Corporation had a receivable of $305 million and $359 million from these vehicles for reimbursement of losses. The Corporation records an allowance for credit losses on loans referenced by the synthetic securitization vehicles. The reported net charge-offs for the residential mortgage portfolio do not include the benefit of amounts reimbursable from these vehicles. Adjusting for the benefit of the credit protection from the synthetic securitizations, the residential mortgage net charge-off ratio, excluding the Countrywide PCI and fully-insured loan portfolios, for 2012 would have been reduced by nine bps, and 13 bps for 2011 . Synthetic securitizations and the long-term stand-by agreements with FNMA and FHLMC together reduce our regulatory risk-weighted assets due to the transfer of a portion of our credit risk to unaffiliated parties. At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , these programs had the cumulative effect of reducing our risk-weighted assets by $7.2 billion and $7.9 billion, increasing our Tier 1 capital ratio by eight bps for both periods, and our Tier 1 common capital ratio by seven bps and six bps. Table 25 presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, and excluding the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio, fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. We believe the presentation of information adjusted to exclude these loan portfolios is more representative of the credit risk in the residential mortgage loan portfolio. As such, the following discussion presents the residential mortgage portfolio excluding the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. For more information on the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio, see page 90 .

There were $147 million and $906 million of residential mortgage loans accounted for under the fair value option at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . See Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option on page 93 and Note 22 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the fair value option. (2) Nonperforming loans at December 31, 2012 and net charge-off ratios for 2012 include the impact of new regulatory guidance on loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy. For more information, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 80 and Table 21 . (3) These vintages of loans account for 60 percent and 63 percent of nonperforming residential mortgage loans at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , and 72 percent and 73 percent of residential mortgage net charge-offs in 2012 and 2011 . (4) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option. n/a = not applicable Nonperforming residential mortgage loans decreased $1.2 billion in 2012 as paydowns, charge-offs and returns to performing status, outpaced new inflows. In addition, nonperforming residential mortgage loan balances at December 31, 2012 included $572 million due to new regulatory guidance related to loans less than 60 days past due that were discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy. At December 31, 2012 , borrowers were current on contractual payments with respect to $3.5 billion, or 24 percent of nonperforming residential mortgage loans, and $8.7 billion, or 59 percent of nonperforming residential mortgage loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell. Accruing loans past due 30 days or more decreased $868 million in 2012 . Net charge-offs decreased $779 million to $3.1 billion in 2012 , or 2.02 percent of total average residential mortgage loans, compared to $3.8 billion , or 2.27 percent , for 2011 . This decrease in net charge-offs for 2012 was primarily driven by decreased write- Bank of America 2012 85 downs on loans greater than 180 days past due which were written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell, and favorable delinquency trends. In addition, 2012 included $75 million in net charge-offs related to loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy that were written down to the underlying collateral value as a result of new regulatory guidance. For more information on the new regulatory guidance on loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 80 and Table 21 . Net charge-off ratios were further impacted by lower loan balances primarily due to paydowns and charge-offs outpacing new originations. Loans in the residential mortgage portfolio with certain characteristics have greater risk of loss than others. These characteristics include loans with a high refreshed LTV, loans originated at the peak of home prices in 2006 and 2007, interest-only loans and loans to borrowers located in California and Florida where we have concentrations and where significant declines in home prices have been experienced. Although the disclosures in this section address each of these risk characteristics separately, there is significant overlap in loans with these characteristics, which contributed to a disproportionate share of the losses in the portfolio. The residential mortgage loans with all of these higher risk characteristics comprised four percent and six percent of the residential mortgage portfolio at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , and accounted for 20 percent of the residential mortgage net charge-offs in 2012 , and 23 percent in 2011 . Residential mortgage loans with a greater than 90 percent but less than 100 percent refreshed LTV represented 10 percent and 11 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent represented 20 percent and 26 percent of the residential mortgage loan portfolio at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Of the loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent, 92 percent were performing at both December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where the outstanding carrying value of the loan is greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. The majority of these loans have a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent primarily due to home price deterioration over the past several years. Loans to borrowers with refreshed FICO scores below 620 represented 14 percent and 15 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Of the $143.6 billion and $158.5 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , as shown in Table 26 , 41 percent and 40 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $13.7 billion, or 23 percent, at December 31, 2012 . Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. As of December 31, 2012 , $368 million, or three percent of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $3.1 billion , or two percent of accruing past due 30 days or more for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at December 31, 2012 , $2.1 billion, or 16 percent of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming compared to $14.8 billion , or 10 percent of nonperforming loans for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. Loans in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio have an interest-only period of three to 10 years and more than 85 percent of these loans will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2015 or later. Table 26 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 12 percent of outstandings at both December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Loans within this MSA comprised only eight percent and seven percent of net charge-offs for 2012 and 2011 .

For more information, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 80 and Table 21 . (3) In these states, foreclosure requires a court order following a legal proceeding (judicial states). (4) Amount excludes the Countrywide PCI residential mortgage and fully-insured loan portfolios. The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) encourages banks to meet the credit needs of their communities for housing and other purposes, particularly in neighborhoods with low or moderate incomes. At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , our CRA portfolio was $11.3 billion and $12.5 billion, or eight percent of the residential mortgage loan balances for both periods. The CRA portfolio included $2.5 billion of nonperforming loans at both December 31, 2012 and 2011 representing 17 percent and 15 percent of 86 Bank of America 2012 total nonperforming residential mortgage loans. Net charge-offs related to the CRA portfolio were $643 million and $732 million for 2012 and 2011 , or 21 percent and 19 percent of total net charge-offs for the residential mortgage portfolio. For information on representations and warranties related to our residential mortgage portfolio, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Representations and Warranties on page 54 and Note 8 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Home Equity The home equity portfolio makes up 20 percent of the consumer portfolio and is comprised of HELOCs, home equity loans and reverse mortgages. As of December 31, 2012 , our HELOC portfolio had an outstanding balance of $91.3 billion , or 85 percent of the total home equity portfolio. HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years with approximately nine percent of the portfolio having a draw period of five years with a five-year renewal option. During the initial draw period, the borrowers are only required to pay the interest due on the loans on a monthly basis. After the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15-year amortizing loans. As of December 31, 2012 , our home equity loan portfolio had an outstanding balance of $15.3 billion , or 14 percent of the total home equity portfolio. Home equity loans are almost all fixed-rate loans with amortizing payment terms of 10 to 30 years and 51 percent of these loans have 25 to 30-year terms. As of December 31, 2012 , our reverse mortgage portfolio had an outstanding balance of $1.4 billion , or one percent of the total home equity portfolio. In 2011, we exited the reverse mortgage origination business. At December 31, 2012 , 88 percent of the home equity portfolio was included in CRES while the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $16.7 billion in 2012 primarily due to paydowns and charge-offs outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. In addition, in 2012 , $2.9 billion of loans, including $2.5 billion of Countrywide PCI loans in the home equity portfolio, were forgiven in connection with the National Mortgage Settlement. Of the total home equity portfolio at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , $21.1 billion , or 20 percent , and $24.5 billion, or 20 percent, were in first-lien positions ( 21 percent and 22 percent excluding the Countrywide PCI home equity portfolio at December 31, 2012 and 2011 ). As of December 31, 2012 , outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $29.8 billion, or 30 percent of our total home equity portfolio excluding the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio. Unused HELOCs totaled $60.9 billion at December 31, 2012 compared to $67.5 billion at December 31, 2011 . This decrease was primarily due to customers choosing to close accounts as well as line management initiatives on deteriorating accounts, which more than offset new production. The HELOC utilization rate was 60 percent at December 31, 2012 compared to 61 percent at December 31, 2011 . Table 27 presents certain home equity portfolio key credit statistics on both a reported basis as well as excluding the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio. We believe the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio is more representative of the credit risk in this portfolio. Table 27 Home Equity Key Credit Statistics December 31 Reported Basis Excluding Countrywide Purchased Credit-impaired Loans (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 2012 2011 Outstandings $ 107,996 $ 124,699 $ 99,449 $ 112,721 Accruing past due 30 days or more (1) 1,098 1,658 1,098 1,658 Nonperforming loans (1, 2) 4,281 2,453 4,281 2,453 Percent of portfolio Refreshed combined LTV greater than 90 but less than 100 10 % 10 % 10 % 11 % Refreshed combined LTV greater than 100 31 36 29 32 Refreshed FICO below 620 (3) 9 11 8 9 2006 and 2007 vintages (4) 48 50 46 46 Net charge-off ratio (2, 5) 3.62 3.42 3.98 3.77 (1) Accruing past due 30 days or more includes $321 million and $609 million and nonperforming loans includes $824 million and $703 million of loans where we serviced the underlying first-lien at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . (2) Nonperforming loans at December 31, 2012 and net charge-off ratios for 2012 include the impacts of the National Mortgage Settlement and guidance issued by regulatory agencies. For more information, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 80 and Table 21 . (3) Beginning in 2012, home equity FICO metrics reflected an updated scoring model that is more representative of the credit risk of our borrowers. Prior period amounts were adjusted to reflect these updates. (4) These vintages of loans have higher refreshed combined LTV ratios and accounted for 51 percent and 54 percent of nonperforming home equity loans at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , and accounted for 60 percent and 65 percent of net charge-offs in 2012 and 2011 . (5) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans. The following discussion presents the home equity portfolio excluding the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio. Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio increased $1.8 billion in 2012 due to the reclassification to nonperforming of junior-lien loans less than 90 days past due that have a senior-lien loan that is 90 days or more past due which resulted in a $1.5 billion increase as of December 31, 2012 , and the reclassification to nonperforming of loans less than 60 days past due that were discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy which resulted in an increase of $478 million at December 31, 2012 , in both cases pursuant to new regulatory guidance. Bank of America 2012 87 These additions to nonperforming loans were partially offset by the $435 million of loans forgiven related to the National Mortgage Settlement. Excluding the impact of these items, nonperforming loans increased compared to December 31, 2011 as inflows outpaced outflows in 2012 . At December 31, 2012 , on $2.0 billion, or 46 percent of nonperforming home equity loans, the borrowers were current on contractual payments and $1.2 billion, or 28 percent of nonperforming home equity loans, were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell. Outstanding balances accruing past due 30 days or more decreased $560 million during 2012 driven in part by the reclassification of junior-lien home equity loans to nonperforming in accordance with regulatory interagency guidance. For more information on the changes as a result of regulatory guidance and the National Mortgage Settlement, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 80 . In some cases, the junior-lien home equity outstanding balance that we hold is performing, but the underlying first-lien is not. For outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio in which we service the first-lien loan, we are able to track whether the first-lien loan is in default. For loans where the first-lien is serviced by a third party, we utilize credit bureau data to estimate the delinquency status of the first-lien. Given that the credit bureau database we use does not include a property address for the mortgages, we are unable to identify with certainty whether a reported delinquent first-lien mortgage pertains to the same property for which we hold a junior-lien loan. At December 31, 2012 , we estimate that $2.6 billion of current and $559 million of 30 to 89 days past due junior-lien loans were behind a delinquent first-lien loan. We service the first-lien loans on $958 million of these combined amounts, with the remaining $2.2 billion serviced by third parties. Of the $3.2 billion current to 89 days past due junior-lien loans, based on available credit bureau data and our own internal servicing data, we estimate that approximately $1.5 billion had first-lien loans that were 90 days or more past due. Net charge-offs decreased $236 million to $4.2 billion , or 3.98 percent of the total average home equity portfolio, for 2012 compared to $4.5 billion , or 3.77 percent , for 2011 primarily driven by favorable portfolio trends due in part to improvement in the U.S. economy partially offset by $435 million in net charge-offs associated with the National Mortgage Settlement and $474 million in net charge-offs related to loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy that were written down to the underlying collateral value due to new regulatory guidance. Net charge-off ratios were further impacted by lower outstanding balances primarily as a result of paydowns and charge-offs outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. There are certain characteristics of the home equity portfolio that have contributed to higher losses including those loans with a high refreshed combined loan-to-value (CLTV), loans that were originated at the peak of home prices in 2006 and 2007, and loans in geographic areas that have experienced the most significant declines in home prices. Home price declines coupled with the fact that most home equity outstandings are secured by second-lien positions have significantly reduced and, in some cases, eliminated all collateral value after consideration of the first-lien position. Although the disclosures in this section address each of these risk characteristics separately, there is significant overlap in outstanding balances with these characteristics, which has contributed to a disproportionate share of losses in the portfolio. Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio with all of these higher risk characteristics comprised eight percent and 10 percent of the total home equity portfolio at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , and accounted for 24 percent of the home equity net charge-offs in 2012 compared to 28 percent in 2011 . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio with greater than 90 percent but less than 100 percent refreshed CLTVs comprised 10 percent and 11 percent of the home equity portfolio at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Outstanding balances with refreshed CLTVs greater than 100 percent comprised 29 percent and 32 percent of the home equity portfolio at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where the carrying value and available line of credit of the combined loans are equal to or greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. Depending on the value of the property, there may be collateral in excess of the first-lien that is available to reduce the severity of loss on the second-lien. Home price deterioration over the past several years has contributed to an increase in CLTV ratios. Of those outstanding balances with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent, 95 percent of the customers were current at December 31, 2012 and 92 percent of second-lien loans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent were current on both their second-lien and underlying first-lien loans at December 31, 2012 . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio to borrowers with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented eight percent and nine percent of the home equity portfolio at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Of the $99.4 billion and $112.7 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , 79 percent and 78 percent were interest-only loans, almost all of which were HELOCs. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have entered the amortization period was $2.1 billion, or two percent of total HELOCs, at December 31, 2012 . The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. As of December 31, 2012 , $72 million, or three percent of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $972 million, or one percent of outstanding accruing past due 30 days or more for the entire HELOC portfolio. In addition, at December 31, 2012 , $131 million, or six percent of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming compared to $3.7 billion, or four percent of outstandings that were nonperforming for the entire HELOC portfolio. Loans in our HELOC portfolio generally have an initial draw period of 10 years and more than 85 percent of these loans will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2015 or later. Although we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and that is still in its revolving period (i.e., customers may draw on and repay their line of credit, but are generally only required to pay interest on a monthly basis). During 2012 , approximately 50 percent of these customers did not pay any principal on their HELOCs. Table 28 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 11 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both December 31, 2012 and 2011 . This MSA comprised eight percent and seven percent of net charge-offs in 88 Bank of America 2012 2012 and 2011 . The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 12 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both December 31, 2012 and 2011 . This MSA comprised 11 percent and 12 percent of net charge-offs in 2012 and 2011 . For information on representations and warranties related to our home equity portfolio, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Representations and Warranties on page 54 and Note 8 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

For more information, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 80 and Table 21 . (2) Net charge-offs exclude $2.8 billion of write-offs in the Countrywide home equity PCI loan portfolio for 2012 . These write-offs decreased the PCI valuation allowance included as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. For information on PCI write-offs, see Countrywide Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 90 . (3) In these states, foreclosure requires a court order following a legal proceeding (judicial states). (4) Amount excludes the Countrywide PCI home equity loan portfolio. Discontinued Real Estate The discontinued real estate portfolio, excluding $858 million of loans accounted for under the fair value option, totaled $9.9 billion at December 31, 2012 and consists of pay option and subprime loans acquired in the Countrywide acquisition. Upon acquisition, the majority of the discontinued real estate portfolio was considered credit-impaired and written down to fair value. At December 31, 2012 , the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio was $8.8 billion , or 89 percent of the total discontinued real estate portfolio. This portfolio is included in All Other and is managed as part of our overall ALM activities. See Countrywide Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 90 for more information on the discontinued real estate portfolio. At December 31, 2012 , the purchased discontinued real estate portfolio that was not credit-impaired was $1.1 billion . Loans with greater than 90 percent refreshed LTVs and CLTVs comprised 32 percent of the portfolio and those with refreshed FICO scores below 620 represented 41 percent of the portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 16 percent of outstanding discontinued real estate loans at December 31, 2012 . Pay option adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which are included in the discontinued real estate portfolio, have interest rates that adjust monthly and minimum required payments that adjust annually, subject to resetting if minimum payments are made and deferred interest limits are reached. Annual payment adjustments are subject to a 7.5 percent maximum change. To ensure that contractual loan payments are adequate to repay a loan, the fully-amortizing loan payment amount is re-established after the initial five- or 10-year period and again every five years thereafter. These payment adjustments are not subject to the 7.5 percent limit and may be substantial due to changes in interest rates and the addition of unpaid interest to the loan balance. Payment advantage ARMs have interest rates that are fixed for an initial period of five years. Payments are subject to reset if the minimum payments are made and deferred interest limits are reached. If interest deferrals cause a loan principal balance to reach a certain level within the first 10 years of the life of the loan, the payment is reset to the interest-only payment; then at the 10-year point, the fully-amortizing payment is required. The difference between the frequency of changes in a loan interest rates and payments along with a limitation on changes in the minimum monthly payments of 7.5 percent per year can result in payments that are not sufficient to pay all of the monthly interest charges (i.e., negative amortization). Unpaid interest is added to the loan balance until the loan balance increases to a specified limit, which can be no more than 115 percent of the original loan amount, at which time a new monthly payment amount adequate to repay the loan over its remaining contractual life is established. At December 31, 2012 , the unpaid principal balance of pay option loans was $9.4 billion, with a carrying amount of $8.8 billion, including $8.1 billion of loans that were credit-impaired upon acquisition, and accordingly, the reserve is based on a life-of-loan loss estimate. The total unpaid principal balance of pay option loans with accumulated negative amortization was $6.4 billion including $464 million of negative amortization. For those borrowers who are making payments in accordance with their contractual terms, 17 percent and 22 percent at December 31, 2012 and 2011 elected to make only the minimum payment on option ARMs. We believe the majority of borrowers are now making scheduled payments primarily because the low rate environment has caused the fully indexed rates to be affordable to more borrowers. We continue to evaluate our exposure to payment resets on the acquired negative-amortizing loans including the Countrywide PCI pay option loan portfolio and have taken into consideration several assumptions regarding this evaluation including prepayment and default rates. Of the loans in the pay option portfolio at December 31, 2012 that have not already experienced a payment reset, one percent are expected to reset in 2013 and approximately 23 percent thereafter. In addition, seven percent are expected to prepay and 69 percent are expected to default prior to being reset, most of which were severely delinquent as of December 31, 2012 . Bank of America 2012 89 Countrywide Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio Loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination and for which it is probable at purchase that we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments are accounted for under the accounting guidance for PCI loans, which addresses accounting for differences between contractual and expected cash flows to be collected from the purchaser initial investment in loans if those differences are attributable, at least in part, to credit quality. Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the acquisition date may include statistics such as past due status, refreshed FICO scores and refreshed LTVs. PCI loans are recorded at fair value upon acquisition and the applicable accounting guidance prohibits carrying over or recording a valuation allowance in the initial accounting. PCI loans that have similar risk characteristics, primarily credit risk, collateral type and interest rate risk, are pooled and accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. Once a pool is assembled, it is considered as if it were one loan for purposes of applying the accounting guidance for PCI loans. An individual loan is removed from a PCI loan pool if it is sold, foreclosed, forgiven or the expectation of any future proceeds is remote. When a loan is removed from a PCI loan pool and the foreclosure or recovery value of the loan is less than the loan carrying value, the difference is first applied against the PCI pool nonaccretable difference. If the nonaccretable difference has been fully utilized, only then is the PCI pool basis applicable to that loan written-off against its valuation reserve; however, the integrity of the pool is maintained and it continues to be accounted for as if it were one loan. Table 29 presents the unpaid principal balance, carrying value, related valuation allowance and the net carrying value as a percentage of the unpaid principal balance for the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio. Table 29 Countrywide Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio December 31, 2012 (Dollars in millions) Unpaid Principal Balance Carrying Value Related Valuation Allowance Carrying Value Net of Valuation Allowance Percent of Unpaid Principal Balance Residential mortgage $ 8,898 $ 8,737 $ 1,061 $ 7,676 86.27 % Home equity 8,324 8,547 2,428 6,119 73.51 Discontinued real estate 9,281 8,834 2,047 6,787 73.13 Total Countrywide purchased credit-impaired loan portfolio $ 26,503 $ 26,118 $ 5,536 $ 20,582 77.66 December 31, 2011 Residential mortgage $ 10,426 $ 9,966 $ 1,111 $ 8,855 84.93 % Home equity 12,516 11,978 5,129 6,849 54.72 Discontinued real estate 11,891 9,857 2,219 7,638 64.23 Total Countrywide purchased credit-impaired loan portfolio $ 34,833 $ 31,801 $ 8,459 $ 23,342 67.01 The total Countrywide PCI unpaid principal balance decreased $8.3 billion , or 24 percent , in 2012 to $26.5 billion at December 31, 2012 primarily driven by liquidations, paydowns and payoffs. In addition, the decline includes loans with an unpaid principal balance of $2.9 billion within the home equity portfolio that were forgiven in connection with the National Mortgage Settlement of which 92 percent were 180 days or more past due. For more information on the National Mortgage Settlement, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 80 . Of the unpaid principal balance of $26.5 billion at December 31, 2012 , $7.3 billion was 180 days or more past due, including $6.5 billion of first-lien and $795 million of home equity loans. Of the $19.2 billion that was less than 180 days past due, $17.1 billion, or 89 percent of the total unpaid principal balance, was current based on the contractual terms while $1.3 billion, or seven percent, was in early stage delinquency. The home equity 180 days or more past due balances declined $2.9 billion, or 79 percent, during 2012 , due primarily to the loans forgiven as discussed above. During 2012 , we recorded a provision benefit of $103 million for the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio including a benefit of $88 million for discontinued real estate, a benefit of $27 million for residential mortgage loans and a provision expense of $12 million for home equity. This compared to a total provision of $2.1 billion in 2011 . The decline in provision in 2012 was primarily driven by an improvement in our home price outlook. The Countrywide PCI allowance declined $2.9 billion during 2012 driven by a $2.7 billion reduction in the Countrywide PCI home equity allowance primarily as a result of liquidations including the forgiveness of $2.5 billion of fully reserved home equity loans in connection with the National Mortgage Settlement. For further information on the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio, see Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . In January 2013, in connection with the FNMA Settlement, we repurchased for $6.6 billion certain residential mortgage loans that had previously been sold to FNMA, which we have valued at less than the purchase price. The majority of these loans were classified as PCI loans when they were recorded in January 2013. For additional information, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Representations and Warranties on page 54 . Additional information on the Countrywide PCI residential mortgage, home equity and discontinued real estate loan portfolios is provided in the following sections. Purchased Credit-impaired Residential Mortgage Loan Portfolio The Countrywide PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio comprised 33 percent of the total Countrywide PCI loan portfolio at December 31, 2012 . Those loans to borrowers with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 37 percent of the Countrywide 90 Bank of America 2012 PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio at December 31, 2012 . Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 90 percent, after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and the related valuation allowance, represented 60 percent of the Countrywide PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio and 80 percent based on the unpaid principal balance at December 31, 2012 . Those loans that were originally classified as Countrywide PCI discontinued real estate loans upon acquisition and have been subsequently modified are now included in the Countrywide PCI residential mortgage outstandings. Table 30 presents outstandings net of purchase accounting adjustments and before the related valuation allowance, by certain state concentrations.

Those loans with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 23 percent of the Countrywide PCI home equity portfolio at December 31, 2012 . Loans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 90 percent, after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and the related valuation allowance, represented 76 percent of the Countrywide PCI home equity portfolio and 77 percent based on the unpaid principal balance at December 31, 2012 .

Purchased Credit-impaired Discontinued Real Estate Loan Portfolio The Countrywide PCI discontinued real estate loan portfolio comprised 34 percent of the total Countrywide PCI loan portfolio at December 31, 2012 . Those loans to borrowers with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 62 percent of the Countrywide PCI discontinued real estate loan portfolio at December 31, 2012 . Loans with a refreshed LTV, or CLTV in the case of second-liens, greater than 90 percent, after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and the related valuation allowance, represented 42 percent of the Countrywide PCI discontinued real estate loan portfolio and 81 percent based on the unpaid principal balance at December 31, 2012 . Those loans that were originally classified as discontinued real estate loans upon acquisition and have been subsequently modified are now excluded from this portfolio and included in the Countrywide PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio, but remain in the PCI loan pool.

U.S. Credit Card The U.S. credit card portfolio is managed in CBB . Outstandings in the U.S. credit card portfolio decreased $7.5 billion in 2012 due to higher payments, charge-offs and portfolio sales. Net charge-offs decreased $2.6 billion to $4.6 billion in 2012 due to improvements in delinquencies and bankruptcies as a result of an improved economic environment, account management on higher risk accounts and the impact of higher credit quality originations. U.S. credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $1.1 billion while loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $633 million in 2012 due to improvement in the U.S. economy. Table 33 presents certain key credit statistics for the consumer U.S. credit card portfolio. Table 33 U.S. Credit Card Key Credit Statistics December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 Outstandings $ 94,835 $ 102,291 Accruing past due 30 days or more 2,748 3,823 Accruing past due 90 days or more 1,437 2,070 2012 2011 Net charge-offs $ 4,632 $ 7,276 Net charge-off ratios (1) 4.88 % 6.90 % (1) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans. Unused lines of credit for U.S. credit card totaled $335.5 billion and $368.1 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . The $32.6 billion decrease was driven by closure of inactive accounts and account management initiatives on higher risk accounts. Bank of America 2012 91 Table 34 presents certain state concentrations for the U.S. credit card portfolio.

Net charge-offs decreased $588 million to $581 million in 2012 due to the sale of the Canadian consumer credit card portfolio in 2011 and improvement in delinquencies. Unused lines of credit for non-U.S. credit card decreased $1.1 billion to $35.7 billion in 2012 driven by a decline in the number of outstanding accounts primarily offset by strengthening of the British Pound against the U.S. Dollar. Table 35 presents certain key credit statistics for the non-U.S. credit card portfolio. Table 35 Non-U.S. Credit Card Key Credit Statistics December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 Outstandings $ 11,697 $ 14,418 Accruing past due 30 days or more 403 610 Accruing past due 90 days or more 212 342 2012 2011 Net charge-offs $ 581 $ 1,169 Net charge-off ratios (1) 4.29 % 4.86 % (1) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans and leases. Direct/Indirect Consumer At December 31, 2012 , approximately 43 percent of the direct/indirect portfolio was included in Global Banking (dealer financial services - automotive, marine, aircraft and recreational vehicle loans), 39 percent was included in GWIM (principally securities-based lending margin loans and unsecured personal loans), 12 percent was included in All Other (the IWM business based outside of the U.S. that was moved from GWIM and student loans) and the remaining portion was in CBB (consumer personal loans). Outstanding loans and leases decreased $6.5 billion in 2012 due to run-off of an auto loan portfolio, an auto loan sale and securitization within the dealer financial services portfolio and lower outstandings in the unsecured consumer lending portfolio partially offset by growth in securities-based lending. For 2012 , net charge-offs decreased $713 million to $763 million , or 0.90 percent of total average direct/indirect loans compared to 1.64 percent for 2011 . This decrease was primarily driven by improvements in delinquencies, collections and bankruptcies in the unsecured consumer lending portfolio as a result of an improved economic environment as well as reduced outstandings. Partially offsetting this decline was $47 million of net charge-offs related to other secured consumer loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy as a result of new regulatory guidance. For more information, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 80 and Table 21 . Net charge-offs in the unsecured consumer lending portfolio decreased $610 million to $485 million in 2012 , or 7.68 percent of total average unsecured consumer lending loans compared to 10.93 percent for 2011 . Direct/indirect loans that were past due 30 days or more and still accruing interest declined $537 million to $1.4 billion in 2012 due to improvements in both the unsecured consumer lending and dealer financial services portfolios. Table 36 presents certain state concentrations for the direct/indirect consumer loan portfolio. Table 36 Direct/Indirect State Concentrations December 31 Outstandings Accruing Past Due 90 Days or More Net Charge-offs (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 California $ 10,793 $ 11,152 $ 53 $ 81 $ 102 $ 222 Florida 7,363 7,456 37 55 88 148 Texas 7,239 7,882 41 54 64 117 New York 4,794 5,160 28 40 43 79 Georgia 2,491 2,828 31 38 30 61 Other U.S./Non-U.S. 50,525 55,235 355 478 436 849 Total direct/indirect loan portfolio $ 83,205 $ 89,713 $ 545 $ 746 $ 763 $ 1,476 92 Bank of America 2012 Other Consumer At December 31, 2012 , approximately 87 percent of the $1.6 billion other consumer portfolio was associated with certain consumer finance businesses that we previously exited and non-U.S. consumer loan portfolios that are included in All Other . The remainder is primarily deposit overdrafts included in CBB . Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option Outstanding consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option were $1.0 billion at December 31, 2012 and included $858 million of discontinued real estate loans and $147 million of residential mortgage loans in consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs). During 2012 , we recorded gains of $57 million resulting from changes in the fair value of the loan portfolio. These were offset by losses recorded on the related long-term debt. Nonperforming Consumer Loans and Foreclosed Properties Activity Table 37 presents nonperforming consumer loans and foreclosed properties activity during 2012 and 2011 . Nonperforming LHFS are excluded from nonperforming loans as they are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. Nonperforming loans do not include past due consumer credit card loans, other unsecured loans and in general, consumer non-real estate-secured loans (excluding those loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy), as these loans are typically charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. The fully-insured loan portfolio is not reported as nonperforming as principal repayment is insured. Additionally, nonperforming loans do not include the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio or loans accounted for under the fair value option. For further information on nonperforming loans, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Nonperforming loans increased $663 million in 2012 to $19.4 billion . During 2012, we reclassified to nonperforming $1.9 billion of junior-lien loans less than 90 days past due that have a senior-lien loan that is 90 days or more past due and $1.2 billion of loans less than 60 days past due that were discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy upon implementation of new regulatory guidance. These additions to nonperforming loans were partially offset by $435 million of nonperforming loans forgiven in connection with the National Mortgage Settlement. Excluding the impact of these items, nonperforming loans declined in 2012 as outflows outpaced new inflows which continued to improve due to favorable delinquency trends. For more information on the impacts related to the National Mortgage Settlement and guidance issued by regulatory agencies, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 80 and Table 21 . The outstanding balance of a real estate-secured loan that is in excess of the estimated property value, after reducing the estimated property value for estimated costs to sell, is charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due unless repayment of the loan is fully insured. At December 31, 2012 , $10.7 billion, or 54 percent, of nonperforming consumer real estate loans and foreclosed properties had been written down to their estimated property value less estimated costs to sell, including $10.1 billion of nonperforming loans 180 days or more past due and $650 million of foreclosed properties. Foreclosed properties decreased $1.3 billion in 2012 as liquidations outpaced additions. PCI loans are excluded from nonperforming loans as these loans were written down to fair value at the acquisition date; however, once the underlying real estate is acquired by the Corporation upon foreclosure of the delinquent PCI loan, it is included in foreclosed properties. Countrywide PCI related foreclosed properties decreased $322 million in 2012 . Not included in foreclosed properties at December 31, 2012 was $2.5 billion of real estate that was acquired upon foreclosure of delinquent FHA-insured loans. We hold this real estate on our balance sheet until we convey these properties to the FHA. We exclude these amounts from our nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties activity as we will be reimbursed once the property is conveyed to the FHA for principal and, up to certain limits, costs incurred during the foreclosure process and interest incurred during the holding period. For additional information on the review of our foreclosure processes, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Other Mortgage-related Matters on page 61 . Bank of America 2012 93 Restructured Loans Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. These concessions typically result from the Corporation loss mitigation activities and could include reductions in the interest rate, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions. Certain TDRs are classified as nonperforming at the time of restructuring and may only be returned to performing status after considering the borrower sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period, generally six months. Nonperforming TDRs, excluding those modified loans in the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio, are included in Table 37 . Table 37 Nonperforming Consumer Loans and Foreclosed Properties Activity (1) (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 Nonperforming loans, January 1 $ 18,768 $ 20,854 Additions to nonperforming loans: New nonperforming loans 13,084 15,723 Implementation of change in treatment of loans discharged in bankruptcies (2) 1,162 n/a Implementation of regulatory interagency guidance (3) 1,853 n/a Reductions to nonperforming loans: Paydowns and payoffs (3,801 ) (3,318 ) Sales (47 ) Returns to performing status (4) (4,203 ) (4,741 ) Charge-offs (5) (6,544 ) (8,095 ) Transfers to foreclosed properties (6) (841 ) (1,655 ) Total net additions (reductions) to nonperforming loans 663 (2,086 ) Total nonperforming loans, December 31 (7) 19,431 18,768 Foreclosed properties, January 1 (8) 1,991 1,249 Additions to foreclosed properties: New foreclosed properties (6) 1,129 2,996 Reductions to foreclosed properties: Sales (2,283 ) (1,993 ) Write-downs (187 ) (261 ) Total net additions (reductions) to foreclosed properties (1,341 ) 742 Total foreclosed properties, December 31 650 1,991 Nonperforming consumer loans and foreclosed properties, December 31 $ 20,081 $ 20,759 Nonperforming consumer loans as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans (9) 3.52 % 3.09 % Nonperforming consumer loans and foreclosed properties as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans and foreclosed properties (9) 3.63 3.41 (1) Balances do not include nonperforming LHFS of $676 million and $659 million and nonaccruing TDRs removed from the Countrywide PCI portfolio prior to January 1, 2010 of $521 million and $477 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011 as well as loans accruing past due 90 days or more as presented in Table 22 and Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) In 2012, we added $1.2 billion to nonperforming loans as a result of new regulatory guidance on loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy. For more information, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 80 and Table 21 . (3) As a result of the regulatory interagency guidance, we reclassified $1.9 billion of performing home equity loans to nonperforming during 2012. For more information, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 80 . (4) Consumer loans may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. (5) Our policy is to not classify consumer credit card and non-bankruptcy related consumer loans not secured by real estate as nonperforming; therefore, the charge-offs on these loans have no impact on nonperforming activity and accordingly are excluded from this table. (6) New foreclosed properties represents transfers of nonperforming loans to foreclosed properties net of charge-offs taken during the first 90 days after transfer of a loan to foreclosed properties. New foreclosed properties also includes properties obtained upon foreclosure of delinquent PCI loans, properties repurchased due to representations and warranties exposure and properties acquired with newly consolidated subsidiaries. (7) At December 31, 2012 , 52 percent of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due and were written down through charge-offs to 62 percent of the unpaid principal balance. (8) Foreclosed property balances do not include loans that are insured by the FHA and have entered foreclosure of $2.5 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . (9) Outstanding consumer loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. n/a = not applicable Our policy is to record any losses in the value of foreclosed properties as a reduction in the allowance for loan and lease losses during the first 90 days after transfer of a loan to foreclosed properties. Thereafter, further losses in value are recorded in noninterest expense. New foreclosed properties included in Table 37 are net of $261 million and $352 million of charge-offs for 2012 and 2011 , recorded during the first 90 days after transfer. In 2012, new regulatory guidance was issued addressing secured consumer loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and as a result, $3.6 billion of loans were included in TDRs at December 31, 2012 , of which $1.2 billion were current or less than 60 days past due upon implementation. Of the $3.6 billion of TDRs, approximately 27 percent, 41 percent and 32 percent had been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2012 , 2011 and prior years, respectively. For more information, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 80 and Table 21 . 94 Bank of America 2012 Table 38 presents TDRs for the home loans portfolio. Performing TDR balances are excluded from nonperforming loans in Table 37 .

(2) Residential mortgage performing TDRs included $11.9 billion and $7.0 billion of loans that were fully-insured at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . (3) Home equity TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $1.4 billion and $824 million , and included $1.0 billion and $282 million of loans classified as nonperforming and $348 million and $542 million of loans classified as performing at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . (4) Discontinued real estate TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $253 million and $230 million , and included $170 million and $118 million of loans classified as nonperforming and $83 million and $112 million as performing at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . We work with customers that are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying credit card and other consumer loans, while complying with Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) guidelines. Substantially all of our credit card and other consumer loan modifications involve a reduction in the customer interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months, both of which are considered to be TDRs (the renegotiated TDR portfolio). We make modifications primarily through internal renegotiation programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external renegotiation programs. The renegotiated TDR portfolio is generally excluded from Table 37 as substantially all of the loans remain on accrual status until either charged off or paid in full. The renegotiated TDR portfolio included $58 million of non-real estate-secured loans at December 31, 2012 that were discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy as a result of new regulatory guidance and classified as nonperforming loans. At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , our renegotiated TDR portfolio was $3.9 billion and $7.1 billion , of which $3.1 billion and $5.5 billion were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. The decline in the renegotiated TDR portfolio was primarily driven by paydowns and charge-offs as well as lower new program enrollments. For more information on the renegotiated TDR portfolio, see Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Credit risk management for the commercial portfolio begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of the borrower or counterparty based on an analysis of its financial position. As part of the overall credit risk assessment, our commercial credit exposures are assigned a risk rating and are subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards. Subsequent to loan origination, risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis, and if necessary, adjusted to reflect changes in the financial condition, cash flow, risk profile or outlook of a borrower or counterparty. In making credit decisions, we consider risk rating, collateral, country, industry and single name concentration limits while also balancing the total borrower or counterparty relationship. Our business and risk management personnel use a variety of tools to continuously monitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty to perform under its obligations. We use risk rating aggregations to measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios. In addition, risk ratings are a factor in determining the level of assigned economic capital and the allowance for credit losses. For information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Management of Commercial Credit Risk Concentrations Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure do not result in undesirable levels of risk. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our international portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 43 , 48 , 56 and 57 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. As part of our ongoing risk mitigation initiatives, we attempt to work with clients experiencing financial difficulty to modify their loans to terms that better align with their current ability to pay. In situations where an economic concession has been granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, we identify these loans as TDRs. Bank of America 2012 95 We account for certain large corporate loans and loan commitments, including issued but unfunded letters of credit which are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes, that exceed our single name credit risk concentration guidelines under the fair value option. Lending commitments, both funded and unfunded, are actively managed and monitored, and as appropriate, credit risk for these lending relationships may be mitigated through the use of credit derivatives, with the Corporation credit view and market perspectives determining the size and timing of the hedging activity. In addition, we purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain other credit exposures. To lessen the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, credit exposure may be added within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. These credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for treatment as accounting hedges. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income (loss). Commercial Credit Portfolio Table 39 presents our commercial loans and leases, and related credit quality information at December 31, 2012 and 2011 .

(2) Includes card-related products. (3) Commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option include U.S. commercial loans of $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion , and non-U.S. commercial loans of $5.7 billion and $4.4 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . See Note 22 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the fair value option. Outstanding commercial loans and leases increased $37.6 billion in 2012 , primarily in non-U.S. commercial and U.S. commercial. During 2012 , credit quality in the commercial loan portfolio continued to show improvement relative to the prior year. Reservable criticized balances and nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed property balances in the commercial credit portfolio declined during 2012 and the declines were primarily in the commercial real estate and U.S. commercial portfolios. Commercial real estate continued to show improvement in both the residential and non-residential portfolios. The reduction in reservable criticized U.S. commercial loans was driven by broad-based improvements in terms of clients, industries and businesses. Most other credit indicators across the remaining commercial portfolios also improved in 2012 . The allowance for loan and lease losses declined $1.0 billion from December 31, 2011 to $3.1 billion at December 31, 2012 due to improvements in the core commercial portfolio (total commercial products excluding U.S. small business) . For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 109 . Nonperforming commercial loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans and leases was 0.91 percent and 2.02 percent ( 0.93 percent and 2.04 percent excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option) at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Accruing commercial loans and leases past due 90 days or more as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans and leases was 0.06 percent and 0.10 percent at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Table 40 presents net charge-offs and related ratios for our commercial loans and leases for 2012 and 2011 . Improving portfolio trends drove lower charge-offs across most of the portfolio.

Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs and financial guarantees, bankers acceptances and commercial letters of credit for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions, during a specified period. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes. Total commercial committed credit exposure increased $16.5 billion in 2012 primarily driven by increases in loans and LHFS, partially offset by decreases in derivative assets, and SBLCs and financial guarantees. Total commercial utilized credit exposure increased $5.2 billion in 2012 primarily driven by the same factors as total commercial committed exposure as described in the previous paragraph. The decrease in derivatives relates primarily to a lower valuation of existing trades due to interest rate decreases along with reduced trading volume. The utilization rate for loans and leases, SBLCs and financial guarantees, commercial letters of credit and bankers acceptances was 58 percent and 57 percent at December 31, 2012 and 2011 .

(4) Derivative assets are carried at fair value, reflect the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and have been reduced by cash collateral of $58.1 billion and $58.9 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Not reflected in utilized and committed exposure is additional derivative collateral held of $18.7 billion and $16.1 billion which consists primarily of other marketable securities. (5) Includes $1.3 billion of monoline exposure at both December 31, 2012 and 2011 , as discussed in Monoline Exposure on page 103 . Table 42 presents commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure by product type. Criticized exposure corresponds to the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful asset categories as defined by regulatory authorities. Total commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased $11.3 billion , or 42 percent , in 2012 primarily in commercial real estate and U.S. commercial property types driven largely by continued paydowns, rating upgrades, charge-offs and sales outpacing downgrades. At December 31, 2012 , approximately 82 percent of commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure was secured compared to 85 percent at December 31, 2011 .

(2) Percentages are calculated as commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure divided by total commercial utilized reservable exposure for each exposure category. Bank of America 2012 97 U.S. Commercial At December 31, 2012 , 68 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in Global Banking, 10 percent in Global Markets , 10 percent in CBB and the remainder primarily in GWIM (business-purpose loans for wealthy clients). U.S. commercial loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, increased $17.2 billion , or 10 percent , in 2012 primarily due to greater client demand in middle-market segments, dealer financing and specialized industries, and growth in certain asset-backed lending products. Reservable criticized balances and nonperforming loans and leases declined $3.1 billion and $690 million in 2012 . The declines were broad-based in terms of clients and industries and were driven by improved client credit profiles and liquidity. Net charge-offs increased $47 million in 2012 due primarily to lower recoveries compared to 2011 . Commercial Real Estate The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms. Outstanding loans decreased $959 million , or two percent , in 2012 due to paydowns outpacing new originations and renewals. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 23 percent and 20 percent of commercial real estate loans and leases at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Commercial real estate credit quality improved significantly during 2012. Nonperforming commercial real estate loans and foreclosed properties decreased $2.7 billion , or 61 percent , in 2012 primarily in the non-residential portfolio. Reservable criticized balances decreased $7.7 billion , or 67 percent , primarily due to declines in the non-residential portfolio. Net charge-offs declined $563 million in 2012 compared to 2011 due to improvement in both the residential and non-residential portfolios. Table 43 presents outstanding commercial real estate loans by geographic region, based on the geographic location of the collateral, and by property type. Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans and leases secured by non-owner-occupied real estate which is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment.

During 2012 , we continued to see improvements in both the residential and non-residential portfolios; however, portions of the non-residential portfolio in certain markets may be subject to additional risk. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce utilized and potential exposure in the commercial real estate portfolios including ongoing refinement of our credit standards, additional transfers of deteriorating exposures to management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation. 98 Bank of America 2012 Tables 44 and 45 present commercial real estate credit quality data by non-residential and residential property types. The residential portfolio presented in Tables 43 , 44 and 45 includes condominiums and other residential real estate. Other property types in Tables 43 , 44 and 45 primarily include special purpose, nursing/retirement homes, medical facilities and restaurants, as well as unsecured loans to borrowers whose primary business is commercial real estate.

At December 31, 2012 , total committed non-residential exposure was $54.5 billion compared to $53.1 billion at December 31, 2011 , of which $37.0 billion and $37.2 billion were funded secured loans. Non-residential nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties were $1.4 billion and $3.5 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , which represented 3.68 percent and 9.29 percent of total non-residential loans and foreclosed properties. The decline in nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties in the non-residential portfolio was driven by decreases in the office, industrial/warehouse, shopping centers/retail and multi-family rental property types. Non-residential utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased to $3.2 billion , or 8.27 percent of non-residential utilized reservable exposure, at December 31, 2012 compared to $10.1 billion , or 25.34 percent, at December 31, 2011 primarily driven by repayments and an overall improvement in credit quality. The decrease in reservable criticized exposure was primarily driven by office, multi-family rental, industrial/warehouse and shopping centers/retail property types in the non-residential portfolio. For the non-residential portfolio, net charge-offs decreased $379 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to improving appraisal values, improved borrower credit profiles and higher recoveries. At December 31, 2012 , total committed residential exposure was $3.2 billion compared to $3.9 billion at December 31, 2011 , of which $1.6 billion and $2.4 billion were funded secured loans. The decline in residential committed exposure was due to repayments, net charge-offs, and continued risk reduction and mitigation initiatives in line with our portfolio strategy. Residential nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties decreased $600 million in 2012 due to repayments, a decline in the volume of loans being downgraded to nonaccrual status and net charge-offs. Residential utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased $884 million to $534 million due to repayments and net charge-offs. The nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties and the utilized reservable criticized ratios for the residential portfolio were 23.33 percent and 31.56 percent at December 31, 2012 compared to 38.89 percent and 54.65 percent at December 31, 2011 . Net charge-offs for the residential portfolio decreased $184 million in 2012 compared to 2011. Bank of America 2012 99 At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the commercial real estate loan portfolio included $6.7 billion and $10.9 billion of funded construction and land development loans that were originated to fund the construction and/or rehabilitation of commercial properties. The decline in construction and land development loans was driven by repayments, net charge-offs, continued risk mitigation initiatives and a reduced emphasis on new originations. This portfolio is mostly secured and diversified across property types and geographic regions but faces continuing challenges in the housing markets. Reservable criticized construction and land development loans totaled $1.5 billion and $4.9 billion, and nonperforming construction and land development loans and foreclosed properties totaled $730 million and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . During a property construction phase, interest income is typically paid from interest reserves that are established at the inception of the loan. As construction is completed and the property is put into service, these interest reserves are depleted and interest payments from operating cash flows begin. Loans generally continue to be classified as construction loans until operating cash flows reach appropriate levels or the loans are refinanced. We do not recognize interest income on nonperforming loans regardless of the existence of an interest reserve. Non-U.S. Commercial At December 31, 2012 , 72 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking and 28 percent in Global Markets . Outstanding loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, increased $18.8 billion in 2012 primarily due to increased client financing activity, structured lending and trade finance exposures. Net charge-offs decreased $124 million in 2012 compared to 2011. For additional information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 105 . U.S. Small Business Commercial The U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card and small business loans managed in CBB . Card-related products were 45 percent and 46 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs decreased $296 million in 2012 compared to 2011 driven by improvements in delinquencies, collections and bankruptcies resulting from an improved economic environment as well as the reduction of higher risk vintages and the impact of higher credit quality originations. Of the U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs, 58 percent were credit card-related products in 2012 compared to 74 percent in 2011 . Commercial Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option The portfolio of commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option is managed primarily in Global Banking . Outstanding commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option increased $1.4 billion to an aggregate fair value of $8.0 billion at December 31, 2012 primarily due to increased corporate borrowings under bank credit facilities. We recorded net gains of $213 million in 2012 compared to net losses of $174 million in 2011 resulting from changes in the fair value of the loan portfolio. These amounts were primarily attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were recorded in other income (loss) and do not reflect the results of hedging activities. In addition, unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit accounted for under the fair value option had an aggregate fair value of $528 million and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011 which was recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The associated aggregate notional amount of unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit accounted for under the fair value option was $18.3 billion and $25.7 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . We recorded net gains of $704 million from changes in the fair value of commitments and letters of credit during 2012 compared to net losses of $429 million in 2011 resulting from maturities and terminations at par value and changes in the fair value of the loan portfolio. These amounts were primarily attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were recorded in other income (loss) and do not reflect the results of hedging activities. 100 Bank of America 2012 Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity Table 46 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during 2012 and 2011 . Nonperforming commercial loans and leases decreased $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion at December 31, 2012 driven by paydowns, charge-offs and sales outpacing new nonperforming loans. Approximately 94 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties are secured and approximately 45 percent are contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans are carried at approximately 76 percent of their unpaid principal balance before consideration of the allowance for loan and lease losses as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated property value less estimated costs to sell.

(2) Includes U.S. small business commercial activity. (3) Commercial loans and leases may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. TDRs are generally classified as performing after a sustained period of demonstrated payment performance. (4) Small business card loans are not classified as nonperforming; therefore, the charge-offs on these loans have no impact on nonperforming activity and accordingly are excluded from this table. (5) New foreclosed properties represents transfers of nonperforming loans to foreclosed properties net of charge-offs recorded during the first 90 days after transfer of a loan to foreclosed properties. (6) Excludes loans accounted for under the fair value option. Table 47 presents our commercial TDRs by product type and performing status. U.S. small business commercial TDRs are comprised of renegotiated small business card loans and are not classified as nonperforming as they are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. For additional information on TDRs, see Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total committed commercial credit exposure increased $16.5 billion , or two percent , to $767.0 billion at December 31, 2012 . The increase in commercial committed exposure was concentrated in food, beverage and tobacco, banking, energy, diversified financials, and real estate, partially offset by lower exposure to government and public education. Industry limits are used internally to manage industry concentrations and are based on committed exposures and capital usage that are allocated on an industry-by-industry basis. A risk management framework is in place to set and approve industry limits as well as to provide ongoing monitoring. Management Credit Risk Committee (CRC) oversees industry limit governance. Diversified financials, our largest industry concentration, experienced an increase in committed exposure of $4.7 billion , or five percent , in 2012 primarily driven by increases in margin loans and certain asset-backed lending products, partially offset by a decrease in derivative exposure. Real estate, our second largest industry concentration, experienced an increase in committed exposure of $3.1 billion , or five percent , in 2012 primarily due to new originations and renewals outpacing paydowns and sales. Real estate construction and land development exposure represented 14 percent of the total real estate industry committed exposure at December 31, 2012 , down from 20 percent at December 31, 2011 . For more information on commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Real Estate on page 98 . Committed exposure in the food, beverage and tobacco industry increased $6.8 billion , or 22 percent , in 2012 primarily related to short-term acquisition financing. Government and public education committed exposure decreased $6.7 billion , or 12 percent , in 2012 primarily driven by decreases in loans and SBLCs. Banking committed exposure increased $6.5 billion , or 17 percent , in 2012 primarily driven by loans to mortgage finance companies and trade finance activity with non-U.S. banks. Energy committed exposure increased $6.4 billion , or 20 percent , in 2012 reflecting loan growth in the exploration and production, and integrated oil sectors. Our committed state and municipal exposure of $38.0 billion at December 31, 2012 consisted of $30.9 billion of commercial utilized exposure (including $17.6 billion of funded loans, $8.9 billion of SBLCs and $3.6 billion of derivative assets) and unfunded commercial exposure of $7.2 billion (primarily unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit) and is reported in the government and public education industry in Table 48 . While the slow economic recovery continues to pressure budgets, most U.S. state and local governments have implemented offsetting fiscal adjustments and continue to honor debt obligations as agreed. While historical default rates have been low, as part of our overall and ongoing risk management processes, we continually monitor these exposures through a rigorous review process. Additionally, internal communications are regularly circulated to maintain exposure levels and are in compliance with established concentration guidelines. 102 Bank of America 2012 Table 48 Commercial Credit Exposure by Industry (1) December 31 Commercial Utilized Total Commercial Committed (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 2012 2011 Diversified financials $ 66,201 $ 64,957 $ 99,673 $ 94,969 Real estate (2) 47,479 48,138 65,639 62,566 Government and public education 41,449 43,090 50,285 57,021 Capital goods 25,071 24,025 49,196 48,013 Retailing 28,065 25,478 47,719 46,290 Healthcare equipment and services 29,396 31,298 45,488 48,141 Banking 40,245 35,231 45,238 38,735 Materials 21,809 19,384 40,493 38,070 Energy 17,684 15,151 38,464 32,074 Food, beverage and tobacco 14,738 15,904 37,344 30,501 Consumer services 23,093 24,445 36,367 38,498 Commercial services and supplies 19,020 20,089 30,257 30,831 Utilities 8,410 8,102 23,432 24,552 Media 13,091 11,447 21,705 21,158 Transportation 13,791 12,683 20,255 19,036 Individuals and trusts 13,916 14,993 17,801 19,001 Insurance, including monolines 8,519 10,090 14,145 16,157 Software and services 5,549 4,304 12,125 9,579 Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology 3,854 4,141 11,409 11,328 Technology hardware and equipment 5,118 5,247 11,108 12,173 Telecommunication services 4,029 4,297 10,297 10,424 Religious and social organizations 6,850 8,536 9,107 11,160 Consumer durables and apparel 4,246 4,505 8,438 8,965 Automobiles and components 3,312 2,813 7,675 7,178 Food and staples retailing 3,528 3,273 6,838 6,476 Other 3,264 4,888 6,507 7,636 Total commercial credit exposure by industry $ 471,727 $ 466,509 $ 767,005 $ 750,532 Net credit default protection purchased on total commitments (3) $ (14,657 ) $ (19,356 ) (1) Includes U.S. small business commercial exposure.

For purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined based on the borrowers or counterparties primary business activity using operating cash flows and primary source of repayment as key factors. (3) Represents net notional credit protection purchased. See Risk Mitigation on page 104 for additional information. Monoline Exposure Monoline exposure is reported in the insurance industry and managed under insurance portfolio industry limits. We have indirect exposure to monolines primarily in the form of guarantees supporting our loans, investment portfolios, securitizations and credit-enhanced securities as part of our public finance business and other selected products. Such indirect exposure exists when we purchase credit protection from monolines to hedge all or a portion of the credit risk on certain credit exposures including loans and CDOs. We underwrite our public finance exposure by evaluating the underlying securities. We also have indirect exposure to monolines in the form of guarantees supporting our mortgage and other loan sales. Indirect exposure may exist when credit protection was purchased from monolines to hedge all or a portion of the credit risk on certain mortgage and other loan exposures. A loss may occur when we are required to repurchase a loan and the market value of the loan has declined, or we are required to indemnify or provide recourse for a guarantor loss. For additional information regarding our exposure to representations and warranties, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Representations and Warranties on page 54 and Note 8 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Table 49 presents the notional amount of our monoline derivative credit exposure, mark-to-market adjustment and the counterparty credit valuation adjustment. Table 49 Derivative Credit Exposures December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 Notional amount of monoline exposure $ 13,547 $ 21,070 Mark-to-market $ 898 $ 1,766 Counterparty credit valuation adjustment (118 ) (417 ) Net mark-to-market $ 780 $ 1,349 2012 2011 Gains (losses) from credit valuation changes $ 213 $ (1,000 ) The notional amount of monoline exposure at December 31, 2012 decreased $7.5 billion from December 31, 2011 due to terminations, paydowns and maturities of monoline contracts. In addition, $1.3 billion of monoline exposure with a single counterparty ($4.9 billion gross receivable less impairment) was included in other assets at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . The contracts are no longer considered to be derivative trading instruments because of the inherent default risk and they no longer Bank of America 2012 103 provide a hedge benefit. We also have potential representations and warranties exposure with the same counterparty. Risk Mitigation We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, credit exposure may be added within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $14.7 billion and $19.4 billion . The mark-to-market effects resulted in net losses of $1.0 billion in 2012 compared to net gains of $121 million in 2011 . The gains and losses related to these instruments are offset by gains and losses on the exposures. Table 50 presents the average VaR for these derivatives. See Trading Risk Management on page 114 for a description of our VaR calculation for the market-based trading portfolio.

(2) Ratings are refreshed on a quarterly basis. (3) Ratings of BBB- or higher are considered to meet the definition of investment grade. (4) NR is comprised of names that have not been rated. In addition to our net notional credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain credit exposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making activities for clients and establishing positions intended to profit from directional or relative value changes. We execute the majority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC market with large, multinational financial institutions, including broker/dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of other investors. Because these transactions are executed in the OTC market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also subject to credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to perform under the terms of these contracts. In most cases, credit derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate rating level, or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required of the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades. 104 Bank of America 2012 Table 53 presents the total contract/notional amount of credit derivatives outstanding and includes both purchased and written credit derivatives. The credit risk amounts are measured as net asset exposure by counterparty, taking into consideration all contracts and collateral with that counterparty. The contract/notional amounts of credit derivatives decreased primarily due to portfolio optimization and increased utilization of clearinghouses in relation to certain regulatory initiatives and refinement of risk mitigation activities. For information on written credit derivatives, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The credit risk amounts discussed above and presented in Table 53 take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements, while amounts disclosed in Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements are shown on a gross basis. Credit risk reflects the potential benefit from offsetting exposure to non-credit derivative products with the same counterparties that may be netted upon the occurrence of certain events, thereby reducing our overall exposure. Table 53 Credit Derivatives December 31 2012 2011 (Dollars in millions) Contract/ Notional Credit Risk Contract/ Notional Credit Risk Purchased credit derivatives: Credit default swaps $ 1,559,472 $ 8,987 $ 1,944,764 $ 14,163 Total return swaps/other 43,489 402 17,519 776 Total purchased credit derivatives $ 1,602,961 $ 9,389 $ 1,962,283 $ 14,939 Written credit derivatives: Credit default swaps $ 1,531,504 n/a $ 1,885,944 n/a Total return swaps/other 68,811 n/a 17,838 n/a Total written credit derivatives $ 1,600,315 n/a $ 1,903,782 n/a n/a = not applicable Counterparty Credit Risk Valuation Adjustments We record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments (CVA) on certain derivative assets, including our credit default protection purchased, in order to properly reflect the credit risk of the counterparty. We calculate CVA based on a modeled expected exposure that incorporates current market risk factors including changes in market spreads and non-credit related market factors that affect the value of a derivative. The exposure also takes into consideration credit mitigants such as legally enforceable master netting agreements and collateral. Table 54 presents credit valuation gains (losses), net of hedges, for 2012 and 2011 . In 2012 , we refined our methodology for CVA on derivatives on a prospective basis. We no longer consider the probability of default for both the counterparty and the Corporation when calculating the counterparty CVA and now only consider the probability of the counterparty defaulting for CVA. For more information, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The effect of this change in estimate on CVA is reflected in the table below. Credit valuation gains for 2012 were due to improved counterparty creditworthiness, partially offset by hedge results. For information on our monoline counterparty credit risk, see Monoline Exposure on page 103 .

We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. Management oversight of country risk, including cross-border risk, is provided by the Country Credit Risk Committee, a subcommittee of the CRC. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (for example, related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance, rather than through the country risk governance. Table 55 presents our total non-U.S. exposure broken out by region at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Non-U.S. exposure is presented on an internal risk management basis and includes sovereign and non-sovereign credit exposure, securities and other investments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the U.S. Risk assignments by country can be adjusted for externally guaranteed loans outstanding and certain collateral types. Exposures which are subject to external guarantees are reported under the country of the guarantor. Exposures with tangible collateral are reflected in the country where the collateral is held. For securities received, other than cross-border resale agreements, outstandings are assigned to the domicile of the issuer of the securities.

Bank of America 2012 105 Our total non-U.S. exposure was $281.7 billion at December 31, 2012 , an increase of $44.6 billion from December 31, 2011 . The increase in non-U.S. exposure was driven by our strategy to grow non-U.S. business in select countries and diversify risk globally. Our non-U.S. exposure remained concentrated in Europe which accounted for $137.8 billion , or 49 percent of total non-U.S. exposure. The European exposure was mostly in Western Europe and was distributed across a variety of industries. Select European countries are further detailed in Table 57 . Asia Pacific was our second largest non-U.S. exposure at $92.4 billion , or 33 percent of total non-U.S. exposure. Latin America accounted for $21.2 billion , or eight percent of total non-U.S. exposure. Middle East and Africa accounted for $8.2 billion , or three percent of total non-U.S. exposure. Other non-U.S. exposure accounted for $22.0 billion or approximately seven percent of total non-U.S. exposure. For information on country specific exposures, see Tables 56 and 57 . Funded loans and loan equivalents include loans, leases and other extensions of credit or funds including letters of credit and due from placements, which have not been reduced by collateral or credit default protection. Funded loans are reported net of charge-offs but prior to any allowance for loan and lease losses. Unfunded commitments are the undrawn portion of legally binding commitments related to loans and loan equivalents. Net counterparty exposure includes the fair value of derivatives, including the counterparty risk associated with credit default swaps (CDS) and secured financing transactions. Derivative exposures are reported net of collateral, which is predominantly cash, pledged under legally enforceable netting agreements. Secured financing transaction exposures have been reduced by eligible cash or securities pledged as collateral. Counterparty exposure has not been reduced by hedges or credit default protection. Securities and other investments are marked-to-market and long positions are netted against short positions with the same underlying issuer to, but not below, zero (i.e., negative issuer exposures are reported as zero ). Other investments includes our GPI portfolio and strategic investments. Net country exposure represents country exposure less hedges and credit default protection purchased, net of credit default protection sold. We hedge certain of our country exposures with credit default protection primarily in the form of single-name, as well as index and tranche CDS. The exposures associated with these hedges represent the amount that would be realized upon the isolated default of an individual issuer in the relevant country assuming a zero recovery rate for that individual issuer, and are calculated based on the CDS notional amount less any fair value receivable or payable. Changes in the assumption of an isolated default can produce different results in a particular tranche. Table 56 presents our 20 largest, non-U.S. country exposures. These exposures accounted for 89 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at December 31, 2012 compared to 88 percent at December 31, 2011 .

Risks from the ongoing debt crisis in these countries could continue to disrupt the financial markets which could have a detrimental impact on global economic conditions and sovereign and non-sovereign debt in these countries. In the fourth quarter of 2012 , European policymakers continued to make incremental progress toward greater fiscal and monetary unity; however, fundamental issues of competitiveness, growth and fiscal solvency remain as challenges. As a result, volatility is expected to continue. We expect to continue to support client activities in the region and our exposures may vary over time as we monitor the situation and manage our risk profile. Table 57 presents our direct sovereign and non-sovereign exposures in these countries at December 31, 2012 . Our total sovereign and non-sovereign exposure to these countries was $14.5 billion at December 31, 2012 compared to $15.2 billion at December 31, 2011 . The total exposure to these countries, net of all hedges, was $9.5 billion at December 31, 2012 compared to $10.3 billion at December 31, 2011 , of which $280 million and $362 million was sovereign exposure. At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the value of hedges and credit default protection purchased, net of credit default protection sold, was $5.1 billion and $4.9 billion .

Counterparty exposure is not presented net of hedges or credit default protection. (2) Long securities exposures have been netted on a single-name basis to, but not below, zero by short positions of $6.5 billion and net CDS purchased of $1.8 billion , consisting of $2.0 billion of net single-name CDS purchased and $207 million of net index and tranched CDS sold. (3) Represents credit default protection purchased, net of credit default protection sold, which is used to mitigate the Corporation risk to country exposures as listed, including $2.7 billion , consisting of $3.0 billion in net single-name CDS purchased and $346 million in net index and tranched CDS sold, to hedge loans and securities, $2.3 billion in additional credit default protection purchased to hedge derivative assets and $60 million in other short positions. The majority of our CDS contracts on reference assets in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain are with highly-rated financial institutions primarily outside of the Eurozone and we work to limit or eliminate correlated CDS. Due to our engagement in market-making activities, our CDS portfolio contains contracts with various maturities to a diverse set of counterparties. We work to limit mismatches in maturities between our exposures and the CDS we use to hedge them. However, there may be instances where the protection purchased has a different maturity from the exposure for which the protection was purchased, in which case, those exposures and hedges are subject to more active monitoring and management. Bank of America 2012 107 Table 58 presents the notional and fair value amounts of single-name CDS purchased and sold on reference assets in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Table 58 includes only single-name CDS netted at the counterparty level, whereas, Table 57 includes single-name, indexed and tranched CDS positions netted by the reference asset that they are intended to hedge; therefore, CDS purchased and sold information is not comparable between tables. Table 58 Single-Name CDS with Reference Assets in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain (1) December 31, 2012 Notional Fair Value (Dollars in billions) Purchased Sold Purchased Sold Greece Aggregate $ 1.8 $ 1.7 $ 0.2 $ 0.2 After legally netting (2) 0.4 0.4 0.1 0.1 Ireland Aggregate 3.0 2.8 0.2 0.2 After legally netting (2) 1.4 1.2 0.1 0.1 Italy Aggregate 47.4 42.1 3.5 2.8 After legally netting (2) 11.0 5.7 1.3 0.5 Portugal Aggregate 8.1 8.0 0.5 0.5 After legally netting (2) 1.3 1.2 0.1 0.1 Spain Aggregate 22.7 22.3 1.0 1.0 After legally netting (2) 4.0 3.7 0.2 0.2 (1) The majority of our CDS contracts on reference assets in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain are primarily with non-Eurozone counterparties. (2) Amounts listed are after consideration of legally enforceable counterparty master netting agreements. Losses could result even if there is credit default protection purchased because the purchased credit protection contracts only pay out under certain scenarios and thus not all losses may be covered by the credit protection contracts. The effectiveness of our CDS protection as a hedge of these risks is influenced by a number of factors, including the contractual terms of the CDS. Generally, only the occurrence of a credit event as defined by the CDS terms (which may include, among other events, the failure to pay by, or restructuring of, the reference entity) results in a payment under the purchased credit protection contracts. The determination as to whether a credit event has occurred is made by the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) Determination Committee (comprised of various ISDA member firms) based on the terms of the CDS and facts and circumstances for the event. Accordingly, uncertainties exist as to whether any particular strategy or policy action for addressing the European debt crisis would constitute a credit event under the CDS. A voluntary restructuring may not trigger a credit event under CDS terms and consequently may not trigger a payment under the CDS contract. In addition to our direct sovereign and non-sovereign exposures, a significant deterioration of the European debt crisis could result in material reductions in the value of sovereign debt and other asset classes, disruptions in capital markets, widening of credit spreads of U.S. and other financial institutions, loss of investor confidence in the financial services industry, a slowdown in global economic activity and other adverse developments. For additional information on the debt crisis in Europe, see Item 1A. Risk Factors . Table 59 presents countries where total cross-border exposure exceeded one percent of our total assets. Cross-border exposures are calculated using FFIEC guidelines and not our internal risk management view; therefore, exposures are not comparable between tables. Exposure includes cross-border claims by our non-U.S. offices including loans, acceptances, time deposits placed, trading account assets, securities, derivative assets, other interest-earning investments and other monetary assets. Amounts also include unfunded commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees, and the notional value of cash lent under secured financing transactions. Sector definitions are consistent with FFIEC reporting requirements for preparing the Country Exposure Report. At December 31, 2012 , the United Kingdom, France and Canada were the only countries where total cross-border exposure exceeded one percent of our total assets. No other countries had exposure exceeding 0.75 percent of our total assets. Table 59 Total Cross-border Exposure Exceeding One Percent of Total Assets (Dollars in millions) December 31 Public Sector Banks Private Sector Cross-border Exposure Exposure as a Percentage of Total Assets United Kingdom 2012 $ 95 $ 5,656 $ 31,595 $ 37,346 1.69 % 2011 6,401 4,424 18,056 28,881 1.36 France (1) 2012 2,556 3,215 17,639 23,410 1.06 Canada (2) 2012 1,325 3,314 18,427 23,066 1.04 (1) At December 31, 2011 , total cross-border exposure for France was $16.1 billion, representing 0.75 percent of total assets. (2) At December 31, 2011 , total cross-border exposure for Canada was $16.9 billion, representing 0.79 percent of total assets. 108 Bank of America 2012 Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses decreased $5.2 billion to $8.2 billion for 2012 compared to 2011 . The provision for credit losses was $6.7 billion lower than net charge-offs for 2012 , resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses due to improved portfolio trends and increasing home prices in the consumer real estate portfolios, lower bankruptcy filings and delinquencies affecting the Card Services portfolio, and improvement in overall credit quality within the core commercial portfolio (total commercial products excluding U.S. small business) . Absent unexpected deterioration in the economy, we expect reductions in the allowance for credit losses, excluding the valuation allowance for PCI loans, to continue in the near term, though at a slower pace than in 2012. The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio decreased $6.4 billion to $8.0 billion for 2012 compared to 2011 . The improvement was primarily in the consumer real estate loan portfolios due to improved portfolio trends and an improved home price outlook in our PCI portfolios. The provision for credit losses related to the PCI loan portfolios was a provision benefit of $103 million in 2012 as the home price outlook improved, compared to a provision expense of $2.2 billion in 2011 . The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including the unfunded lending commitments, increased $1.1 billion to $197 million in 2012 compared to 2011 due to stabilization of credit quality, loan growth and a higher volume of loan resolutions in the prior year, all within the core commercial portfolio. Allowance for Credit Losses Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses The allowance for loan and lease losses is comprised of two components. The first component covers nonperforming commercial loans and TDRs. The second component covers loans and leases on which there are incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable, as well as incurred losses that may not be represented in the loss forecast models. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the total of these two components, each of which is described in more detail below. The allowance for loan and lease losses excludes LHFS and loans accounted for under the fair value option as the fair value reflects a credit risk component. The first component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers both the nonperforming commercial loans and all TDRs within the consumer and commercial portfolios. These loans are subject to impairment measurement based on the present value of projected future cash flows discounted at the loan original effective interest rate, or in certain circumstances, impairment may also be based upon the collateral value or the loan observable market price if available. Impairment measurement for the renegotiated credit card, unsecured consumer and small business TDR portfolios is based on the present value of projected cash flows discounted using the average portfolio contractual interest rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring. For purposes of computing this specific loss component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool using historical loss experience for the respective product types and risk ratings of the loans. The second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers the remaining consumer and commercial loans and leases that have incurred losses which are not yet individually identifiable. The allowance for consumer and certain homogeneous commercial loan and lease products is based on aggregated portfolio evaluations, generally by product type. Loss forecast models are utilized that consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, estimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends, delinquencies, economic trends and credit scores. Our consumer real estate loss forecast model estimates the portion of loans that will default based on individual loan attributes, the most significant of which are refreshed LTV or CLTV, and borrower credit score as well as vintage and geography, all of which are further broken down into current delinquency status. Additionally, we incorporate the delinquency status of underlying first-lien loans on our junior-lien home equity portfolio in our allowance process. Incorporating refreshed LTV and CLTV into our probability of default allows us to factor the impact of changes in home prices into our allowance for loan and lease losses. These loss forecast models are updated on a quarterly basis to incorporate information reflecting the current economic environment. As of December 31, 2012 , the loss forecast process resulted in reductions in the allowance for all major consumer portfolios. The allowance for commercial loan and lease losses is established by product type after analyzing historical loss experience by internal risk rating, current economic conditions, industry performance trends, geographic and obligor concentrations within each portfolio and any other pertinent information. The statistical models for commercial loans are generally updated annually and utilize our historical database of actual defaults and other data. The loan risk ratings and composition of the commercial portfolios used to calculate the allowance are updated at least quarterly to incorporate the most recent data reflecting the current economic environment. For risk-rated commercial loans, we estimate the probability of default and the LGD based on our historical experience of defaults and credit losses. Factors considered when assessing the internal risk rating include the value of the underlying collateral, if applicable, the industry in which the obligor operates, the obligor liquidity and other financial indicators, and other quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the obligor credit risk. As of December 31, 2012 , updates to the loan risk ratings and portfolio composition resulted in reductions in the allowance for the commercial real estate, U.S. commercial and commercial lease financing portfolios. Also included within the second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses are reserves to cover losses that are incurred but, in our assessment, may not be adequately represented in the historical loss data used in the loss forecast models. For example, factors that we consider include, among others, changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in economic and business conditions, changes in the nature and size of the portfolio, changes in the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans and the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements. We also consider factors that are applicable to unique portfolio segments. For example, we consider the risk of uncertainty in our loss forecasting models related to junior-lien home equity loans that are current, but have first-lien loans that we do not service that are 30 days or more past due. In addition, we consider the inherent uncertainty in mathematical models that are built upon historical data. Bank of America 2012 109 During 2012 , the factors that impacted the allowance for loan and lease losses included significant overall improvements in the credit quality of the portfolios driven by improvements in the U.S. economy and labor markets, proactive credit risk management initiatives and the impact of recent higher credit quality originations. Additionally, the resolution of uncertainties through current recognition of net charge-offs, specifically in the home loans portfolios, has impacted the amount of reserve needed in that portfolio. Evidencing the improvements in the U.S. economy and labor markets are modest growth in consumer spending, improvements in unemployment levels, a decrease in the absolute level and our share of national consumer bankruptcy filings, a rise in both residential building activity and overall home prices. In addition to these improvements, paydowns, charge-offs and returns to performing status and upgrades out of criticized continued to outpace new nonaccrual consumer loans and reservable criticized commercial loans, but such loans remained elevated relative to levels experienced prior to the financial crisis. We monitor differences between estimated and actual incurred loan and lease losses. This monitoring process includes periodic assessments by senior management of loan and lease portfolios and the models used to estimate incurred losses in those portfolios. Additions to, or reductions of, the allowance for loan and lease losses generally are recorded through charges or credits to the provision for credit losses. Credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses. Recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer portfolio, as presented in Table 61 , was $21.1 billion at December 31, 2012 , a decrease of $8.6 billion from December 31, 2011 . The decrease in the home equity and residential mortgage allowance was primarily driven by improved delinquencies and home prices as evidenced by improving LTV statistics as presented in Tables 25 and 27 . In addition, the home equity allowance declined due to reduced exposures to current junior-lien loans that we estimate had a first-lien loan that was 90 days or more past due. Also, the home equity allowance related to the PCI portfolio declined $2.7 billion primarily due to the forgiveness of fully reserved home equity loans in connection with the National Mortgage Settlement. The decrease in the allowance related to the U.S. credit card and unsecured consumer lending portfolios in CBB was primarily due to improvement in delinquencies and bankruptcies. For example, in the U.S. credit card portfolio, accruing loans 30 days or more past due decreased to $2.7 billion at December 31, 2012 from $3.8 billion (to 2.90 percent from 3.74 percent of outstanding U.S. credit card loans) at December 31, 2011 , and accruing loans 90 days or more past due decreased to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2012 from $2.1 billion (to 1.52 percent from 2.02 percent of outstanding U.S. credit card loans) over the same period. See Tables 22 , 23 , 25 , 27 , 33 and 35 for additional details on key consumer credit statistics. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio as presented in Table 61 was $3.1 billion at December 31, 2012 , a decrease of $1.0 billion from December 31, 2011 . The decrease was driven by continued improvement in the credit quality of the core commercial portfolio. For example, the commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased to $15.9 billion at December 31, 2012 from $27.2 billion (to 4.10 percent from 7.41 percent of total commercial utilized reservable exposure) at December 31, 2011 . Similarly, nonperforming commercial loans declined to $3.2 billion at December 31, 2012 from $6.3 billion (to 0.93 percent from 2.04 percent of outstanding commercial loans) at December 31, 2011 . See Tables 39 , 40 and 42 for additional details on key commercial credit statistics. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 2.69 percent at December 31, 2012 compared to 3.68 percent at December 31, 2011 . The decrease in the ratio was largely due to improved credit quality driven by improved economic conditions and the home equity PCI loans that were forgiven which led to the reduction in the allowance for credit losses discussed above. The December 31, 2012 and 2011 ratios above include the PCI loan portfolio. Excluding the PCI loan portfolio, the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 2.14 percent at December 31, 2012 compared to 2.86 percent at December 31, 2011 . 110 Bank of America 2012 Table 60 presents a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses for 2012 and 2011 .

(12) For more information on the PCI loan portfolio and the valuation allowance for PCI loans, see Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases and Note 6 Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements . For reporting purposes, we allocate the allowance for credit losses across products. However, the allowance is generally available to absorb any credit losses without restriction.

Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option included residential mortgage loans of $147 million and $906 million and discontinued real estate of $858 million and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . Commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option included U.S. commercial loans of $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion and non-U.S. commercial loans of $5.7 billion and $4.4 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . (2) Includes allowance for loan and lease losses for U.S. small business commercial loans of $642 million and $893 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . (3) Includes allowance for loan and lease losses for impaired commercial loans of $330 million and $545 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . (4) Includes $5.5 billion and $8.5 billion of valuation allowance presented with the allowance for credit losses related to PCI loans at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . 112 Bank of America 2012 Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option. Unfunded lending commitments are subject to the same assessment as funded loans, including estimates of probability of default and LGD. Due to the nature of unfunded commitments, the estimate of probable losses must also consider utilization. To estimate the portion of these undrawn commitments that is likely to be drawn by a borrower at the time of estimated default, analyses of the Corporation historical experience are applied to the unfunded commitments to estimate the funded EAD. The expected loss for unfunded lending commitments is the product of the probability of default, the LGD and the EAD, adjusted for any qualitative factors including economic uncertainty and inherent imprecision in models. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments at December 31, 2012 was $513 million , $201 million lower than December 31, 2011 driven by improved credit quality in the unfunded portfolio and accretion of purchase accounting adjustments on acquired Merrill Lynch unfunded positions. Market Risk Management Market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and/or activities including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt, trading account assets and liabilities, and derivatives. Market-sensitive assets and liabilities are generated through loans and deposits associated with our traditional banking business, customer and other trading operations, the ALM process, credit risk mitigation activities and mortgage banking activities. In the event of market volatility, factors such as underlying market movements and liquidity have an impact on the results of the Corporation. Our traditional banking loan and deposit products are nontrading positions and are generally reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities (historical cost). However, these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions, primarily changes in the levels of interest rates. The risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our nontrading positions is managed through our ALM activities. We have elected to account for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value option. For further information on the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, see Note 21 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Our trading positions are reported at fair value with changes currently reflected in income. Trading positions are subject to various risk factors, which include exposures to interest rates and foreign exchange rates, as well as mortgage, equity, commodity, issuer, credit and market liquidity risk factors. We seek to mitigate these risk exposures by using techniques that encompass a variety of financial instruments in both the cash and derivatives markets. The following discusses the key risk components along with respective risk mitigation techniques. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk represents exposures to instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates. These instruments include, but are not limited to, loans, debt securities, certain trading-related assets and liabilities, deposits, borrowings and derivatives. Hedging instruments used to mitigate these risks include derivatives such as options, futures, forwards and swaps. Foreign Exchange Risk Foreign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, foreign currency-denominated loans and securities, future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions, foreign currency-denominated debt and various foreign exchange derivatives whose values fluctuate with changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or non-U.S. interest rates. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include foreign exchange options, currency swaps, futures, forwards, foreign currency-denominated debt and deposits. Mortgage Risk Mortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the value of mortgage-related instruments. The values of these instruments are sensitive to prepayment rates, mortgage rates, agency debt ratings, default, market liquidity, government participation and interest rate volatility. Our exposure to these instruments takes several forms. First, we trade and engage in market-making activities in a variety of mortgage securities including whole loans, pass-through certificates, commercial mortgages and collateralized mortgage obligations including CDOs using mortgages as underlying collateral. Second, we originate a variety of MBS which involves the accumulation of mortgage-related loans in anticipation of eventual securitization. Third, we may hold positions in mortgage securities and residential mortgage loans as part of the ALM portfolio. Fourth, we create MSRs as part of our mortgage origination activities. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 24 Mortgage Servicing Rights to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on MSRs. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include contracts and derivatives such as options, swaps, futures and forwards. Equity Market Risk Equity market risk represents exposures to securities that represent an ownership interest in a corporation in the form of domestic and foreign common stock or other equity-linked instruments. Instruments that would lead to this exposure include, but are not limited to, the following: common stock, exchange-traded funds, American Depositary Receipts, convertible bonds, listed equity options (puts and calls), OTC equity options, equity total return swaps, equity index futures and other equity derivative products. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures, swaps, convertible bonds and cash positions. Bank of America 2012 113 Commodity Risk Commodity risk represents exposures to instruments traded in the petroleum, natural gas, power and metals markets. These instruments consist primarily of futures, forwards, swaps and options. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures and swaps in the same or similar commodity product, as well as cash positions. Issuer Credit Risk Issuer credit risk represents exposures to changes in the creditworthiness of individual issuers or groups of issuers. Our portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an asset may be adversely impacted by changes in the levels of credit spreads, by credit migration or by defaults. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include bonds, CDS and other credit fixed-income instruments. Market Liquidity Risk Market liquidity risk represents the risk that the level of expected market activity changes dramatically and, in certain cases, may even cease. This exposes us to the risk that we will not be able to transact business and execute trades in an orderly manner which may impact our results. This impact could be further exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing correlations are compromised by disproportionate demand or lack of demand for certain instruments. We utilize various risk mitigating techniques as discussed in more detail in Trading Risk Management. Trading Risk Management Trading-related revenues represent the amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. Trading account assets and liabilities and derivative positions are reported at fair value. For more information on fair value, see Note 21 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Trading-related revenues can be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Also, trading-related revenues are dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. The Global Markets Risk Committee (GMRC), chaired by the Global Markets Risk Executive, has been designated by ALMRC as the primary governance authority for global markets risk management including trading risk management. The GMRC focus is to take a forward-looking view of the primary credit and market risks impacting Global Markets and prioritize those that need a proactive risk mitigation strategy. Market risks that impact businesses outside of Global Markets are monitored and governed by their respective governance authorities. The GMRC monitors significant daily revenues and losses by business and the primary drivers of the revenues or losses. Thresholds are in place for each of our businesses in order to determine if the revenue or loss is considered to be significant for that business. If any of the thresholds are exceeded, an explanation of the variance is provided to the GMRC. The thresholds are developed in coordination with the respective risk managers to highlight those revenues or losses that exceed what is considered to be normal daily income statement volatility. 114 Bank of America 2012 The histogram below is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for 2012 and 2011 . During 2012 , positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 98 percent, or 243 of the 249 trading days of which 80 percent (199 days) were daily trading gains of over $25 million, less than one percent (1 day) of the trading days had losses greater than $25 million and the largest loss was $50 million. This is compared to 2011 , where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 86 percent, or 214 of the 250 trading days of which 66 percent (165 days) were daily trading gains of over $25 million, five percent (12 days) of the trading days had losses greater than $25 million and the largest loss was $119 million. To evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of individual positions as well as portfolios. VaR is a key statistic used to measure market risk. In order to manage day-to-day risks, VaR is subject to trading limits both for our overall trading portfolio and within individual businesses. All trading limit excesses are communicated to management for review. A VaR model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss the portfolio is expected to experience within a given confidence level based on historical data. With any VaR model, there are significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company. In addition, the accuracy of a VaR model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the positions in the portfolio. A VaR model may require additional modeling assumptions for new products that do not have extensive historical price data or for illiquid positions for which accurate daily prices are not consistently available. A VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios. There are, however, many limitations inherent in a VaR model as it utilizes historical results over a defined time period to estimate future performance. Historical results may not always be indicative of future results and changes in market conditions or in the composition of the underlying portfolio could have a material impact on the accuracy of the VaR model. In order for the VaR model to reflect current market conditions, we update the historical data underlying our VaR model on a bi-weekly basis and regularly review the assumptions underlying the model. Our VaR model utilizes three years of historical data. This time period was chosen to ensure that VaR reflects both a broad range of market movements as well as being sensitive to recent changes in market volatility. In addition, certain types of risks associated with positions that are illiquid and/or unobservable are not included in VaR. If these risks are determined to be material, the VaR model results will be supplemented. Bank of America 2012 115 We continually review, evaluate and enhance our VaR model so that it reflects the material risks in our trading portfolio. Changes to the VaR model are reviewed and approved prior to implementation and any material changes are reported to management through the appropriate governance committees. Nevertheless, due to the limitations previously discussed, we have historically used the VaR model as only one of the components in managing our trading risk and also use other techniques such as stress testing and desk level limits. Periods of extreme market stress influence the reliability of these techniques to varying degrees. The accuracy of the VaR methodology is reviewed by backtesting which compares the VaR results from historical data against the actual daily profit and loss. Graphic representation of the backtesting results with additional explanation of backtesting excesses are reported to the GMRC. Backtesting excesses occur when trading losses exceed VaR. Senior management reviews and evaluates the results of these tests. In periods of market stress, the GMRC members communicate daily to discuss losses and VaR limit excesses. As a result of this process, the businesses may selectively reduce risk. Where economically feasible, positions are sold or macroeconomic hedges are executed to reduce the exposure. We use one VaR model that uses a historical simulation approach based on three years of historical data and an expected shortfall methodology equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level. Statistically, this means that losses will exceed VaR, on average, one out of 100 trading days, or two to three times each year. The number of actual backtesting excesses observed is dependent on current market performance relative to historic market volatility. Actual losses did not exceed daily trading VaR in 2012 or 2011 . The graph below shows daily trading-related revenue and VaR for 2012 . The large gains in daily trading-related revenue reflected near the end of the year, are due in part to above average activity in the markets leading up to news about the fiscal cliff. Table 62 presents average, high and low daily trading VaR for 2012 and 2011 . Table 62 Market Risk VaR for Trading Activities 2012 2011 (Dollars in millions) Average High (1) Low (1) Average High (1) Low (1) Foreign exchange $ 21.4 $ 34.3 $ 11.5 $ 20.0 $ 48.6 $ 5.6 Interest rate 46.3 75.3 29.8 50.6 82.7 29.2 Credit 49.5 80.7 31.1 109.9 155.3 54.8 Real estate/mortgage 34.1 45.0 27.6 80.0 139.5 31.5 Equities 27.8 54.8 14.6 50.5 88.9 25.1 Commodities 13.0 17.7 7.2 18.9 33.8 8.4 Portfolio diversification (117.1 ) (163.1 ) Total market-based trading portfolio $ 75.0 $ 128.1 $ 41.9 $ 166.8 $ 318.6 $ 75.0 (1) The high and low for the total portfolio may not equal the sum of the individual components as the highs or lows of the individual portfolios may have occurred on different trading days. 116 Bank of America 2012 The $92 million decrease in average VaR during 2012 was driven by reduced risk across most asset classes, with the largest reductions coming from the credit, real estate/mortgage and equities asset classes. In addition, volatile market data from 2008, which was a material contribution to the 2011 average, was no longer included in the three-year historical dataset for the 2012 average. Counterparty credit risk is an adjustment to the mark-to-market value of our derivative exposures to reflect the impact of the credit quality of counterparties on our derivative assets. Since counterparty credit exposure is not included in the VaR component of the regulatory capital allocation, we do not include it in our trading VaR, and it is therefore not included in the daily trading-related revenue illustrated in our histogram or used for backtesting. Trading Portfolio Stress Testing Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited lookback window, we also stress test our portfolio. Stress testing estimates the value change in our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. Various scenarios, categorized as either historical or hypothetical, are regularly run and reported for the overall trading portfolio and individual businesses. Historical scenarios simulate the impact of price changes that occurred during a set of extended historical market events. Generally, a 10-business-day window or longer, representing the most severe point during a crisis, is selected for each historical scenario. Hypothetical scenarios provide simulations of anticipated shocks from pre-defined market stress events. These stress events include shocks to underlying market risk variables which may be well beyond the shocks found in the historical data used to calculate VaR. As with the historical scenarios, the hypothetical scenarios are designed to represent a short-term market disruption. Scenarios are reviewed and updated as necessary in light of changing positions and new economic or political information. For example, we currently include stress tests that contemplate a full or partial break-up of the Eurozone. In addition to the value afforded by the results themselves, this information provides senior management with a clear picture of the trend of risk being taken given the relatively static nature of the shocks applied. Stress testing for the trading portfolio is also integrated with enterprise-wide stress testing and incorporated into the limits framework. A process is in place to promote consistency between the scenarios used for the trading portfolio and those used for enterprise-wide stress testing. The scenarios used for enterprise-wide stress testing purposes differ from the typical trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the results are forecasted over multiple periods for use in consolidated capital and liquidity planning. For additional information on enterprise-wide stress testing, see page 68 . Interest Rate Risk Management for Nontrading Activities The following discussion presents net interest income excluding the impact of trading-related activities. Interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our nontrading balance sheet. Interest rate risk is measured as the potential volatility in net interest income caused by changes in market interest rates. Client-facing activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet. We prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income. The baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business growth, ALM positioning and the direction of interest rate movements as implied by the market-based forward curve. We then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The net interest income forecast is frequently updated for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends, market conditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually monitor our balance sheet position in an effort to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes. The interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate balance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing and maturity characteristics, but do not include the impact of hedge ineffectiveness. Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect core net interest income and capital. The spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecast at December 31, 2012 and 2011 are presented in Table 63 . Table 63 Forward Rates December 31, 2012 Federal Funds Three-Month LIBOR 10-Year Swap Spot rates 0.25 % 0.31 % 1.84 % 12-month forward rates 0.25 0.37 2.10 December 31, 2011 Spot rates 0.25 % 0.58 % 2.03 % 12-month forward rates 0.25 0.75 2.29 Bank of America 2012 117 Table 64 shows the pre-tax dollar impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from December 31, 2012 and 2011 , resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented to ensure that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. For more information, see Net Interest Income Excluding Trading-related Net Interest Income on page 36 . Table 64 Estimated Net Interest Income Excluding Trading-related Net Interest Income (Dollars in millions) Short Rate (bps) Long Rate (bps) December 31 Curve Change 2012 2011 Parallel Shifts +100 bps instantaneous shift +100 +100 $ 4,232 $ 2,883 -50 bps instantaneous shift --50 --50 (2,250 ) (1,795 ) Flatteners Short end instantaneous change +100 2,159 979 Long end instantaneous change --50 (1,597 ) (1,319 ) Steepeners Short end instantaneous change --50 (655 ) (464 ) Long end instantaneous change +100 2,091 1,935 The sensitivity analysis in Table 64 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks. Our net interest income was asset sensitive to a parallel move in interest rates at both December 31, 2012 and 2011 . As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. Securities The securities portfolio is an integral part of our ALM positioning and is primarily comprised of debt securities including MBS and to a lesser extent U.S. Treasury, corporate, municipal and other debt securities. At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , we held AFS debt securities with a fair value of $286.9 billion and $276.2 billion . During 2012 and 2011 , we purchased AFS debt and other securities of $164.5 billion and $99.5 billion , sold $72.4 billion and $116.8 billion , and had maturities and received paydowns of $71.5 billion and $56.7 billion . We realized $1.7 billion and $3.4 billion in net gains on sales of debt securities during 2012 and 2011 . At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , we held $49.5 billion and $35.3 billion of held-to-maturity securities and $14.5 billion of other securities classified as other assets. There were no securities classified as other assets during 2011. Accumulated OCI included after-tax net unrealized gains of $4.4 billion and $3.1 billion on AFS debt securities and $462 million and $3 million on AFS marketable equity securities at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . For additional information on accumulated OCI, see Note 15 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The amount of pre-tax net unrealized gains on AFS debt securities increased $2.1 billion during 2012 to $7.0 billion , primarily due to the impact of lower rates. For additional information on our securities portfolio, see Note 4 Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We recognized $53 million of other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) losses in earnings on AFS debt securities in 2012 compared to $299 million in 2011 . The recognition of OTTI is based on a variety of factors, including the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than amortized cost, the financial condition of the issuer of the security including credit ratings and any specific events affecting the operations of the issuer, underlying assets that collateralize the debt security, other industry and macroeconomic conditions, and our intent and ability to hold the security to recovery. Residential Mortgage Portfolio At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , our residential mortgage portfolio was $243.2 billion and $262.3 billion which excluded $9.9 billion and $11.1 billion of discontinued real estate loans and $1.0 billion and $2.2 billion of consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option. For more information on consumer fair value option loans, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option on page 93 . The $19.1 billion decrease in 2012 was due to paydowns, charge-offs and transfers to foreclosed properties which more than offset new origination volume and repurchases of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA. During 2012 , CRES and GWIM originated $35.4 billion in first-lien mortgages that we retained compared to $45.5 billion in 2011 . Additionally, we repurchased $8.2 billion of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA compared to repurchases of $7.8 billion in 2011. We received paydowns of $53.0 billion in 2012 compared to paydowns of $42.3 billion in 2011 . There were no purchases of residential mortgages related to ALM activities in 2012 compared to $72 million in 2011 . We sold $305 million of residential mortgages in 2012 compared to $109 million in 2011 , all of which were originated residential mortgages. Gains recognized on the sales of residential mortgages in both periods were minimal. Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts Interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components. For additional information on our hedging activities, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Our interest rate contracts are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards. In addition, we use foreign exchange contracts, including cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward contracts and options to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Changes to the composition of our derivatives portfolio during 2012 reflect actions taken for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk management. The decisions to reposition our derivatives portfolio are based on the current assessment of economic and financial conditions including the interest rate and foreign currency environments, balance sheet composition and trends, the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet and the relative mix of our cash and derivative positions. 118 Bank of America 2012 Table 65 presents derivatives utilized in our ALM activities including those designated as accounting and market risk hedging instruments and shows the notional amount, fair value, weighted-average receive-fixed and pay-fixed rates, expected maturity and average estimated durations of our open ALM derivatives at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . These amounts do not include derivative hedges on our MSRs.

The forward starting pay-fixed swap positions at December 31, 2012 and 2011 were $520 million and $8.8 billion. (2) Does not include basis adjustments on either fixed-rate debt issued by the Corporation or AFS debt securities which are hedged using derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments that substantially offset the fair values of these derivatives. (3) At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the notional amount of same-currency basis swaps consisted of $213.5 billion and $222.6 billion in both foreign currency and U.S. dollar-denominated basis swaps in which both sides of the swap are in the same currency. (4) Foreign exchange basis swaps consisted of cross-currency variable interest rate swaps used separately or in conjunction with receive-fixed interest rate swaps. (5) Does not include foreign currency translation adjustments on certain non-U.S. debt issued by the Corporation that substantially offset the fair values of these derivatives. (6) The notional amount of option products of $4.2 billion at December 31, 2012 were comprised of $18 million in purchased caps/floors and $4.2 billion in swaptions. Option products of $10.4 billion at December 31, 2011 were comprised of $30 million in purchased caps/floors and $10.4 billion in swaptions. (7) Reflects the net of long and short positions. (8) The notional amount of foreign exchange contracts of $(1.2) billion at December 31, 2012 was comprised of $41.9 billion in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed swaps, $10.5 billion in foreign currency-denominated pay-fixed swaps, and $(32.6) billion in net foreign currency forward rate contracts. Foreign exchange contracts of $52.3 billion at December 31, 2011 were comprised of $40.6 billion in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed swaps, $647 million in foreign currency-denominated pay-fixed swaps and $12.4 billion in net foreign currency forward rate contracts. Bank of America 2012 119 We use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities and other forecasted transactions (collectively referred to as cash flow hedges). The net losses on both open and terminated cash flow hedge derivative instruments recorded in accumulated OCI, net-of-tax, were $2.9 billion and $3.8 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . These net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes in prices or interest rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at December 31, 2012 , the pre-tax net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings as follows: $1.0 billion, or 22 percent within the next year, 58 percent in years two through five, and 13 percent in years six through ten, with the remaining seven percent thereafter. For more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We hedge our net investment in non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward foreign exchange contracts that typically settle in less than 180 days, cross-currency basis swaps, foreign exchange options and foreign currency-denominated debt. We recorded after-tax gains on derivatives and foreign currency-denominated debt in accumulated OCI associated with net investment hedges which were offset by losses on our net investments in consolidated non-U.S. entities at December 31, 2012 . Mortgage Banking Risk Management We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be HFI or held-for-sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate. Interest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Fluctuations in interest rates drive consumer demand for new mortgages and the level of refinancing activity, which in turn, affects total origination and service fee income. Typically, a decline in mortgage interest rates will lead to an increase in mortgage originations and fees and a decrease in the value of the MSRs driven by higher prepayment expectations. Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage banking is a complex process that requires complex modeling and ongoing monitoring. IRLCs and the related residential first mortgage LHFS are subject to interest rate risk between the date of the IRLC and the date the loans are sold to the secondary market. To hedge interest rate risk, we utilize forward loan sale commitments and other derivative instruments including purchased options. These instruments are used to hedge certain market risks of IRLCs and residential first mortgage LHFS. At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the notional amount of derivatives economically hedging the IRLCs and residential first mortgage LHFS was $31.1 billion and $14.7 billion. MSRs are nonfinancial assets created when the underlying mortgage loan is sold to investors and we retain the right to service the loan. We use certain derivatives such as interest rate options, interest rate swaps, forward settlement contracts and Eurodollar futures, as well as MBS and U.S. Treasuries to hedge certain market risks of MSRs. The notional amounts of the derivative contracts and principal value of other securities hedging the MSRs were $2.5 trillion and $31.3 billion at December 31, 2012 compared to $2.6 trillion and $46.3 billion at December 31, 2011 . In 2012 , we recorded gains in mortgage banking income of $2.3 billion related to the change in fair value of the derivative contracts and other securities used to hedge the market risks of the MSRs compared to $6.3 billion for 2011 . For additional information on MSRs, see Note 24 Mortgage Servicing Rights to the Consolidated Financial Statements and for more information on mortgage banking income, see CRES on page 41 . Compliance Risk Management Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to the reputation of the Corporation arising from the failure to comply with requirements applicable to banking and financial services laws, rules and regulations. Compliance is at the core of the Corporation culture and is a key component of risk management discipline. The Global Compliance organization is responsible for driving a culture of compliance; establishing compliance program requirements and related policies; executing the monitoring and testing of business controls; performing risk assessments on the businesses adherence to laws, rules and regulations as well as the effectiveness of business controls; overseeing remediation of compliance risks and issues executed by the businesses and supporting the identification, escalation and reporting of current, emerging and reputational compliance risk matters to senior management and the Board (or appropriate committee). Global Compliance is also responsible for facilitating processes to effectively manage regulatory changes and maintain constructive relationships with regulators. The Board provides oversight of compliance risks through its Audit Committee. Operational Risk Management The Corporation defines operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Operational risk may occur anywhere in the Corporation, not solely in operations functions, and its effects may extend beyond financial losses. Operational risk includes legal risk. Successful operational risk management is particularly important to diversified financial services companies because of the nature, volume and complexity of the financial services business. Global banking guidelines and country-specific requirements for managing operational risk were established in Basel 2 which requires that the Corporation has internal operational risk management processes to assess and measure operational risk exposure and to set aside appropriate capital to address those exposures. Under the advanced measurement rules of the Basel 2 Framework, an operational loss event is an event that results in a loss and is associated with any of the following seven operational loss event categories: internal fraud; external fraud; employment practices and workplace safety; clients, products and business practices; damage to physical assets; business disruption and system failures; and execution, delivery and process management. Specific examples of loss events include robberies, credit card fraud, processing errors and physical losses from natural disasters. 120 Bank of America 2012 We approach operational risk management from two perspectives to manage operational risk within the structure of the Corporation: (1) at the enterprise level to provide independent, integrated management of operational risk across the organization, and (2) at the business and enterprise control function levels to address operational risk in revenue producing and non-revenue producing units. The Operational Risk Management Program incorporates the overarching processes for identifying, measuring, mitigating, controlling, monitoring, testing, reviewing operational risk, and reporting operational risk information to management and the Board. A sound internal governance structure enhances the effectiveness of the Corporation Operational Risk Management Program and is accomplished at the enterprise level through formal oversight by the Board, the CRO and a variety of management committees and risk oversight groups aligned to the Corporation overall risk governance framework and practices. Of these, the Compliance and Operational Risk Committee (CORC) oversees the Corporation policies and processes for sound operational risk management. The CORC also serves as an escalation point for critical operational risk matters within the Corporation. The CORC reports operational risk activities to the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Board. Within the Global Risk Management organization, the Corporate Operational Risk team develops and guides the strategies, policies, practices, controls and monitoring tools for assessing and managing operational risks across the organization and reports results to businesses, enterprise control functions, senior management, governance committees and the Board. Corporate Audit provides independent assessment and validation through testing of key processes and controls across the Corporation. An annual Audit Plan ensures that coverage activities address the significant aspects of the Corporation risk profile. Risk assessments incorporating operational risk are completed within the audit planning process. The business and enterprise control functions are responsible for managing all the risks within their units, including operational risks. In addition to enterprise risk management tools such as loss reporting, scenario analysis and RCSAs, operational risk executives, working in conjunction with senior business executives, have developed key tools to help identify, measure, mitigate and monitor risk in each business and enterprise control function. Examples of these include personnel management practices; data reconciliation processes; fraud management units; transaction processing, monitoring and analysis; business recovery planning; and new product introduction processes. The business and enterprise control functions are also responsible for consistently implementing, and monitoring adherence to, corporate practices. Business and enterprise control function management uses the enterprise RCSA process to identify and evaluate the status of risk and control issues, including mitigation plans, as appropriate. The goals of this process are to assess changing market and business conditions, evaluate key risks impacting each business and enterprise control function and assess the controls in place to mitigate the risks. The RCSA process is documented at periodic intervals. Key operational risk indicators for these risks have been developed and are used to help identify trends and issues on an enterprise, business and enterprise control function level. Independent review and challenge to the Corporation overall operational risk management framework is performed by the Corporate Operational Risk Validation Team. Enterprise control functions have risk governance and control responsibilities for their enterprise programs (e.g., Global Technology and Operations Group, Chief Financial Officer Group, Global Marketing and Corporate Affairs, Global Human Resources). They provide insights on day-to-day risk activities throughout the Company by overseeing and managing the performance of their functions against Company-wide expectations. The enterprise control functions participate in the operational risk management process in two ways. First, these organizations manage risk in their functional department. Second, they provide specialized risk management services (e.g., information management, vendor management) within their area of expertise to the enterprise, businesses and other enterprise control functions they support. These groups also work with business and risk executives to develop and guide appropriate strategies, policies, practices, controls and monitoring tools for each business and enterprise control function relative to these programs. Additionally, where appropriate, insurance policies are purchased to mitigate the impact of operational losses. These insurance policies are explicitly incorporated in the structural features of operational risk evaluation. As insurance recoveries, especially given recent market events, are subject to legal and financial uncertainty, the inclusion of these insurance policies is subject to reductions in their expected mitigating benefits. Complex Accounting Estimates Our significant accounting principles, as described in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements are essential in understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. The more judgmental estimates are summarized in the following discussion. We have identified and described the development of the variables most important in the estimation processes that involve mathematical models to derive the estimates. In many cases, there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the models. Where alternatives exist, we have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs. Actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could impact our results of operations. Separate from the possible future impact to our results of operations from input and model variables, the value of our lending portfolio and market-sensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date, often significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant, negative effect on future operating results. These fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs. Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, represents management estimate of probable losses inherent in the Corporation loan portfolio excluding those loans accounted for under the fair value option. Changes to the allowance for credit losses are reported in the Corporation Consolidated Statement of Income in the provision for credit Bank of America 2012 121 losses. Our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is discussed in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We evaluate our allowance at the portfolio segment level and our portfolio segments are Home Loans, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial. Due to the variability in the drivers of the assumptions used in this process, estimates of the portfolio inherent risks and overall collectability change with changes in the economy, individual industries, countries, and borrowers ability and willingness to repay their obligations. The degree to which any particular assumption affects the allowance for credit losses depends on the severity of the change and its relationship to the other assumptions. Key judgments used in determining the allowance for credit losses include risk ratings for pools of commercial loans and leases, market and collateral values and discount rates for individually evaluated loans, product type classifications for consumer and commercial loans and leases, loss rates used for consumer and commercial loans and leases, adjustments made to address current events and conditions, considerations regarding domestic and global economic uncertainty, and overall credit conditions. Our estimate for the allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the loss rates and expected cash flows from our Home Loans and Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segments, as well as our U.S. small business commercial portfolio within the Commercial portfolio segment. For each one percent increase in the loss rates on loans collectively evaluated for impairment in our Home Loans portfolio segment, excluding PCI loans, coupled with a one percent decrease in the discounted cash flows on those loans individually evaluated for impairment within this portfolio segment, the allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2012 would have increased by $147 million. PCI loans within our Home Loans portfolio segment are initially recorded at fair value. Applicable accounting guidance prohibits carry-over or creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting. However, subsequent decreases in the expected cash flows from the date of acquisition result in a charge to the provision for credit losses and a corresponding increase to the allowance for loan and lease losses. We subject our PCI portfolio to stress scenarios to evaluate the potential impact given certain events. A one percent decrease in the expected cash flows could result in a $208 million impairment of the portfolio, of which $99 million would be related to our discontinued real estate portfolio. For each one percent increase in the loss rates on loans collectively evaluated for impairment within our Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment and U.S. small business commercial portfolio coupled with a one percent decrease in the expected cash flows on those loans individually evaluated for impairment within the portfolio segment and the U.S. small business commercial portfolio, the allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2012 would have increased by $60 million. Our allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the risk ratings assigned to loans and leases within the Commercial portfolio segment (excluding the U.S. small business commercial portfolio). Assuming a downgrade of one level in the internal risk ratings for commercial loans and leases, except loans and leases already risk-rated Doubtful as defined by regulatory authorities, the allowance for loan and lease losses would have increased by $2.2 billion at December 31, 2012 . The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases at December 31, 2012 was 2.69 percent and these hypothetical increases in the allowance would raise the ratio to 2.98 percent. These sensitivity analyses do not represent management expectations of the deterioration in risk ratings or the increases in loss rates but are provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for loan and lease losses to changes in key inputs. We believe the risk ratings and loss severities currently in use are appropriate and that the probability of the alternative scenarios outlined above occurring within a short period of time is remote. The process of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses requires a high degree of judgment. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions. Mortgage Servicing Rights MSRs are nonfinancial assets that are created when a mortgage loan is sold and we retain the right to service the loan. We account for consumer MSRs at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the Corporation Consolidated Statement of Income in mortgage banking income (loss). Commercial and residential reverse mortgage MSRs are accounted for using the amortization method, lower of cost or market value, with impairment recognized as a reduction of mortgage banking income (loss). At December 31, 2012 , our total MSR balance was $5.9 billion . We determine the fair value of our consumer MSRs using a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The model incorporates key economic assumptions including estimates of prepayment rates and resultant weighted-average lives of the MSRs, and the option-adjusted spread levels. These variables can, and generally do, change from quarter to quarter as market conditions and projected interest rates change. These assumptions are subjective in nature and changes in these assumptions could materially affect our operating results. For example, decreasing the prepayment rate assumption used in the valuation of our consumer MSRs by 10 percent while keeping all other assumptions unchanged could have resulted in an estimated increase of $510 million in MSRs and mortgage banking income (loss) at December 31, 2012 . This impact does not reflect any hedge strategies that may be undertaken to mitigate such risk. We manage potential changes in the fair value of MSRs through a comprehensive risk management program. The intent is to mitigate the effects of changes in the fair value of MSRs through the use of risk management instruments. To reduce the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate and market value fluctuations, securities including MBS and U.S. Treasuries, as well as certain derivatives such as options and interest rate swaps may be used to hedge certain market risks of the MSRs, but are not designated as accounting hedges. These instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in mortgage banking income (loss). For more information, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management on page 120 . For additional information on MSRs, including the sensitivity of weighted-average lives and the fair value of MSRs to changes in modeled assumptions, see Note 24 Mortgage Servicing Rights to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 122 Bank of America 2012 Fair Value of Financial Instruments We classify the fair values of financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy under applicable accounting guidance which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Applicable accounting guidance establishes three levels of inputs used to measure fair value. We carry trading account assets and liabilities, derivative assets and liabilities, AFS debt and equity securities, certain MSRs and certain other assets at fair value. Also, we account for certain loans and loan commitments, LHFS, other short-term borrowings, securities financing agreements, asset-backed secured financings, long-term deposits and long-term debt under the fair value option. For more information, see Note 21 Fair Value Measurements and Note 22 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The fair values of assets and liabilities may include adjustments, such as market liquidity and credit quality, where appropriate. Valuations of products using models or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs. Where market data is available, the inputs used for valuation reflect that information as of our valuation date. Inputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if they are supported by little or no market activity. In periods of extreme volatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may be more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process. In keeping with the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities, we have in place various processes and controls that include: a model validation policy that requires review and approval of quantitative models used for deal pricing, financial statement fair value determination and risk quantification; a trading product valuation policy that requires verification of all traded product valuations; and a periodic review and substantiation of daily profit and loss reporting for all traded products. Primarily through validation controls, we utilize both broker and pricing service inputs which can and do include both market-observable and internally-modeled values and/or valuation inputs. Our reliance on this information is tempered by the knowledge of how the broker and/or pricing service develops its data with a higher degree of reliance applied to those that are more directly observable and lesser reliance applied to those developed through their own internal modeling. Similarly, broker quotes that are executable are given a higher level of reliance than indicative broker quotes, which are not executable. These processes and controls are performed independently of the business. Trading account assets and liabilities are carried at fair value based primarily on actively traded markets where prices are from either direct market quotes or observed transactions. Liquidity is a significant factor in the determination of the fair value of trading account assets and liabilities. Market price quotes may not be readily available for some positions, or positions within a market sector where trading activity has slowed significantly or ceased. Situations of illiquidity generally are triggered by market perception of credit uncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market sector. In these instances, fair value is determined based on limited available market information and other factors, principally from reviewing the issuer financial statements and changes in credit ratings made by one or more of the rating agencies. Trading account profits, which represent the net amount earned from our trading positions, can be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Trading account profits are dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. To evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of individual positions as well as portfolios. At a portfolio and corporate level, we use trading limits, stress testing and tools such as VaR modeling, which estimates a potential daily loss that we do not expect to exceed with a specified confidence level, to measure and manage market risk. For more information on VaR, see Trading Risk Management on page 114 . The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the OTC market are determined using quantitative models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors, which are used to value the positions. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. Estimation risk is greater for derivative asset and liability positions that are either option-based or have longer maturity dates where observable market inputs are less readily available or are unobservable, in which case quantitative-based extrapolations of rate, price or index scenarios are used in determining fair values. The Corporation incorporates within its fair value measurements of OTC derivatives a valuation adjustment to reflect the credit risk associated with the net position. Positions are netted by counterparty and fair value for net long exposures is adjusted for counterparty credit risk while the fair value for net short exposures is adjusted for our own credit risk. The credit adjustments are determined by reference to existing direct market reference costs of credit, or where direct references are not available, a proxy is applied consistent with direct references for other counterparties that are similar in credit risk. An estimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination of fair value, primarily based on market implied experience adjusted for any more recent name specific expectations. Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy established in applicable accounting guidance. The Level 3 financial assets and liabilities include certain loans, MBS, ABS, CDOs and structured liabilities, as well as highly structured, complex or long-dated derivative contracts, private equity investments and consumer MSRs. The fair value of these Level 3 financial assets and liabilities is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. Bank of America 2012 123 Table 66 Level 3 Asset and Liability Summary December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 (Dollars in millions) Level 3 Fair Value As a % of Total Level 3 Assets As a % of Total Assets Level 3 Fair Value As a % of Total Level 3 Assets As a % of Total Assets Trading account assets $ 9,559 26.13 % 0.43 % $ 11,455 22.21 % 0.54 % Derivative assets 8,073 22.06 0.37 14,366 27.85 0.67 AFS debt securities 5,091 13.91 0.23 8,012 15.53 0.38 All other Level 3 assets at fair value 13,865 37.90 0.63 17,744 34.41 0.83 Total Level 3 assets at fair value (1) $ 36,588 100.00 % 1.66 % $ 51,577 100.00 % 2.42 % Level 3 Fair Value As a % of Total Level 3 Liabilities As a % of Total Liabilities Level 3 Fair Value As a % of Total Level 3 Liabilities As a % of Total Liabilities Derivative liabilities $ 6,605 73.51 % 0.33 % $ 8,500 73.46 % 0.45 % Long-term debt 2,301 25.61 0.12 2,943 25.43 0.15 All other Level 3 liabilities at fair value 79 0.88 0.01 128 1.11 0.01 Total Level 3 liabilities at fair value (1) $ 8,985 100.00 % 0.46 % $ 11,571 100.00 % 0.61 % (1) Level 3 total assets and liabilities are shown before the impact of counterparty netting related to our derivative positions. During 2012 , we recognized net gains of $136 million on Level 3 assets and liabilities. The net gains were primarily gains on trading account assets, LHFS, and loans and leases, offset by losses on MSRs, long-term debt and net derivative assets. Unrealized gains on trading account assets were primarily due to mark-to-market gains on collateralized loan obligation positions due to strong market conditions, as well as mark-to-market gains on secondary loan positions held in inventory. Unrealized gains on LHFS were due to improved market conditions for mortgage whole loans in EMEA. Unrealized gains on loans and leases were due to an overall improvement in housing prices and lower loss severity. Unrealized losses on MSRs were primarily due to the impact of the decline in interest rates on forecasted prepayments. Unrealized losses on long-term debt were the result of improved credit spreads throughout the year. Losses on net derivative assets were primarily due to tightening spreads on credit derivatives and in the RMBS indices, as well as mark-to-market movement in various equity instruments, offset by mortgage production gains. There were net unrealized gains of $65 million in accumulated OCI on Level 3 assets and liabilities at December 31, 2012 . For additional information on the components of net realized and unrealized gains and losses during 2012 , see Note 21 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Level 3 financial instruments, such as our consumer MSRs, may be hedged with derivatives classified as Level 1 or 2; therefore, gains or losses associated with Level 3 financial instruments may be offset by gains or losses associated with financial instruments classified in other levels of the fair value hierarchy. The Level 3 gains and losses recorded in earnings did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital resources. We conduct a review of our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of Level 3 are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable, respectively, in the current marketplace. These transfers are considered to be effective as of the beginning of the quarter in which they occur. For additional information on the significant transfers into and out of Level 3 during 2012 , see Note 21 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Global Principal Investments GPI is included within Equity Investments in All Other on page 52 . GPI is comprised of a diversified portfolio of private equity, real estate and other alternative investments in both privately-held and publicly-traded companies. These investments are made either directly in a company or held through a fund. At December 31, 2012 , this portfolio totaled $3.5 billion including $2.2 billion of non-public investments. Certain equity investments in the portfolio are subject to investment company accounting under applicable accounting guidance, and accordingly, are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in equity investment income. Initially the transaction price of the investment is generally considered to be the best indicator of fair value. Thereafter, valuation of direct investments is based on an assessment of each individual investment using methodologies that include publicly-traded comparables derived by multiplying a key performance metric (e.g., earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of the portfolio company by the relevant valuation multiple observed for comparable companies, acquisition comparables, entry-level multiples and discounted cash flows, and are subject to appropriate discounts for lack of liquidity or marketability. Certain factors that may influence changes in fair value include but are not limited to, recapitalizations, subsequent rounds of financing and offerings in the equity or debt capital markets. For fund investments, we generally record the fair value of our proportionate interest in the fund capital as reported by the fund respective managers. Accrued Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets Accrued income taxes, reported as a component of accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Corporation Consolidated Balance Sheet, represent the net amount of current income taxes we expect to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions attributable to our operations to date. We currently file income tax returns in more than 100 jurisdictions and consider many factors, including statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance , in estimating the appropriate accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction. 124 Bank of America 2012 In applying the applicable accounting guidance, we monitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimate of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities. These revisions of our estimate of accrued income taxes, which also may result from our income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax controversies, may be material to our operating results for any given period. Net deferred tax assets, reported as a component of other assets on the Corporation Consolidated Balance Sheet, represent the net decrease in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of net operating loss (NOL) and tax credit carryforwards and because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements. NOL and tax credit carryforwards result in reductions to future tax liabilities, and many of these attributes can expire if not utilized within certain periods. We consider the need for valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amounts we estimate are more-likely-than-not to be realized. While we have established some valuation allowances for certain state and non-U.S. deferred tax assets, we have concluded that our various estimates of future t axable income will be sufficient to realize all U.S. federal and U.K. deferred tax assets, including NOL and tax credit carryforwards, that are not subject to any special limitations (such as change-in-control limitations) prior to any expiration. The majority of our U.K. net deferred tax assets, which consist primarily of NOLs, are realizable by subsidiaries that have a recent history of cumulative losses. These deferred tax assets related to NOLs will be realized over an extended number of years. Significant decreases to our estimates of future taxable income could materially change our conclusions about how much of our tax attributes and other deferred tax assets are more-likely-than-not to be realized prior to their expiration. See Note 20 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a table of significant tax attributes and additional information. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Background The nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets are discussed in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 9 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, which for the Corporation is performed as of June 30, and in interim periods if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below. As reporting units are determined after an acquisition or evolve with changes in business strategy, goodwill is assigned to reporting units and it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition. All of the revenue streams and related activities of a reporting unit, whether acquired or organic, are available to support the value of the goodwill. We use the reporting units allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying amount of equity for each reporting unit in our goodwill impairment tests as we do not maintain a record of equity as defined under GAAP at the reporting unit level. Allocated equity includes economic capital, goodwill and a percentage of intangible assets allocated to the reporting units. The allocation of economic capital to the reporting units utilized for goodwill impairment testing has the same basis as the allocation of economic capital to our operating segments. Economic capital allocation plans are incorporated into the Corporation financial plan which is approved by the Board on an annual basis. Allocated equity is updated on a quarterly basis. The Corporation common stock price remained low during 2012 and 2011. During these periods, our market capitalization remained below our recorded book value. We estimate that the fair value of all reporting units with assigned goodwill in aggregate as of the June 30, 2012 annual goodwill impairment test was $219.5 billion and the aggregate carrying value of all reporting units with assigned goodwill, as measured by allocated equity was $138.4 billion. The common stock market capitalization of the Corporation at June 30, 2012 was $88.2 billion ( $125.1 billion at December 31, 2012 ). As none of our reporting units are publicly-traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations do not directly correlate to the Corporation stock price. Although we believe it is reasonable to conclude that market capitalization could be an indicator of fair value over time, we do not believe that our current market capitalization reflects the aggregate fair value of our individual reporting units. Estimating the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to cash flows, the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium. We determined the fair values of the reporting units using a combination of valuation techniques consistent with the market approach and the income approach and also utilized independent valuation specialists. The market approach we used estimates the fair value of the individual reporting units by incorporating any combination of the tangible capital, book capital and earnings multiples from comparable publicly-traded companies in industries similar to that of the reporting unit. The relative weight assigned to these multiples varies among the reporting units based on qualitative and quantitative characteristics, primarily the size and relative profitability of the reporting unit as compared to the comparable publicly-traded companies. Since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of a noncontrolling interest, we added a control premium to arrive at the reporting units estimated fair values on a controlling basis. For purposes of the income approach, we calculated discounted cash flows by taking the net present value of estimated future cash flows and an appropriate terminal value. Our discounted cash flow analysis employs a capital asset pricing model in estimating the discount rate (i.e., cost of equity financing) for each reporting unit. The inputs to this model include the risk-free rate of return, beta, which is a measure of the level of non-diversifiable risk associated with comparable companies for each specific reporting unit, market equity risk premium and in certain cases an unsystematic (company-specific) risk factor. The unsystematic risk factor is the input that specifically addresses uncertainty related to our projections of earnings and growth, including the uncertainty related to loss expectations. We utilized discount rates that we believe adequately reflect the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets generally and specifically in our internally developed forecasts. We estimated expected rates of equity returns based on historical market returns and risk/return rates for similar industries of each reporting unit. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and actual results may differ from forecasted results. Bank of America 2012 125 In 2012 , the IWM businesses within GWIM , including $230 million of goodwill, were moved to All Other in connection with the agreement we entered into during 2012 to sell these businesses. Prior periods have been reclassified. 2012 Annual Impairment Test During the three months ended September 30, 2012 , we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2012 for all of our reporting units which had goodwill. Additionally, we also evaluated the U.K. Card business within All Other as the U.K. Card business comprises the majority of the goodwill included in All Other . In performing the first step of the annual goodwill impairment test, we compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its estimated carrying value as measured by allocated equity, including goodwill. To determine fair value, we utilized a combination of the market approach and income approach. Under the market approach, we compared earnings and equity multiples of the individual reporting units to multiples of public companies comparable to the individual reporting units. The control premium used in the June 30, 2012 annual goodwill impairment test was 35 percent for all reporting units. Under the income approach, we updated our assumptions to reflect the current market environment. The discount rates used in the June 30, 2012 annual goodwill impairment test ranged from 11 percent to 14 percent depending on the relative risk of a reporting unit. Growth rates developed by management for individual revenue and expense items in each reporting unit ranged from (0.2) percent to 7.2 percent. For certain revenue and expense items that have been significantly affected by the current economic environment, management developed separate long-term forecasts. Based on the results of step one of the annual goodwill impairment test, we determined that step two was not required for any of the reporting units as their respective fair values exceeded their carrying values indicating there was no impairment. 2011 Impairment Tests During the three months ended December 31, 2011 , a goodwill impairment test was performed for the European consumer card businesses reporting unit within All Other as it was likely that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded the fair value due to a decrease in estimated future growth projections. We concluded that goodwill was impaired, and accordingly, recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $581 million . During the three months ended June 30, 2011 , as a consequence of the BNY Mellon Settlement entered into by the Corporation on June 28, 2011 , the adverse impact of the incremental mortgage-related charges and the continued economic slowdown in the mortgage business, we performed a goodwill impairment test for the CRES reporting unit. We concluded that the remaining balance of goodwill of $2.6 billion was impaired, and accordingly, recorded a goodwill impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill in CRES to zero . Representations and Warranties The methodology used to estimate the liability for obligations under representations and warranties related to transfers of residential mortgage loans is a function of the representations and warranties given and considers a variety of factors. Depending upon the counterparty, these factors include actual defaults, estimated future defaults, historical loss experience, estimated home prices, other economic conditions, estimated probability that we will receive a repurchase request, including consideration of whether presentation thresholds will be met, number of payments made by the borrower prior to default and estimated probability that we will be required to repurchase a loan. It also considers other relevant facts and circumstances, such as bulk settlements and identity of the counterparty or type of counterparty, as appropriate. The estimate of the liability for obligations under representations and warranties is based upon currently available information, significant judgment, and a number of factors, including those set forth above, that are subject to change. Changes to any one of these factors could significantly impact the estimate of our liability. The representations and warranties provision may vary significantly each period as the methodology used to estimate the expense continues to be refined based on the level and type of repurchase requests presented, defects identified, the latest experience gained on repurchase requests, and other relevant facts and circumstances. The estimate of the liability for representations and warranties is sensitive to future defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate. An assumed simultaneous increase or decrease of 10 percent in estimated future defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate would result in an increase of approximately $850 million or decrease of approximately $750 million in the representations and warranties liability as of December 31, 2012 , excluding amounts related to the FNMA Settlement. These sensitivities are hypothetical and are intended to provide an indication of the impact of a significant change in these key assumptions on the representations and warranties liability. In reality, changes in one assumption may result in changes in other assumptions, which may or may not counteract the sensitivity. For additional information on representations and warranties exposure and the corresponding range of possible loss, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Representations and Warranties on page 54 , as well as Note 8 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees and Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 126 Bank of America 2012 Litigation Reserve In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Corporation establishes an accrued liability for litigation and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. When a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, the Corporation does not establish an accrued liability. As a litigation or regulatory matter develops, the Corporation, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates on an ongoing basis whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is both probable and estimable. If, at the time of evaluation, the loss contingency related to a litigation or regulatory matter is not both probable and estimable, the matter will continue to be monitored for further developments that would make such loss contingency both probable and estimable. Once the loss contingency related to a litigation or regulatory matter is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Corporation will establish an accrued liability with respect to such loss contingency and record a corresponding amount of litigation-related expense. The Corporation will continue to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established. For a limited number of the matters disclosed in Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, we are able to estimate a range of possible loss. In determining whether it is possible to provide an estimate of loss or range of possible loss, the Corporation reviews and evaluates its material litigation and regulatory matters on an ongoing basis, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. These may include information learned through the discovery process, rulings on dispositive motions, settlement discussions, and other rulings by courts, arbitrators or others. In cases in which the Corporation possesses sufficient information to develop an estimate of loss or range of possible loss, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed in Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements . For other disclosed matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, such an estimate is not possible. Those matters for which an estimate is not possible are not included within this estimated range. Therefore, the estimated range of possible loss represents what we believe to be an estimate of possible loss only for certain matters meeting these criteria. It does not represent the Corporation maximum loss exposure. Information is provided in Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the nature of all of these contingencies and, where specified, the amount of the claim associated with these loss contingencies. Consolidation and Accounting for Variable Interest Entities In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, an entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE. The Corporation is deemed to have a controlling financial interest and is the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE economic performance and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Determining whether an entity has a controlling financial interest in a VIE requires significant judgment. An entity must assess the purpose and design of the VIE, including explicit and implicit contractual arrangements, and the entity involvement in both the design of the VIE and its ongoing activities. The entity must then determine which activities have the most significant impact on the economic performance of the VIE and whether the entity has the power to direct such activities. For VIEs that hold financial assets, the party that services the assets or makes investment management decisions may have the power to direct the most significant activities of a VIE. Alternatively, a third party that has the unilateral right to replace the servicer or investment manager or to liquidate the VIE may be deemed to be the party with power. If there are no significant ongoing activities, the party that was responsible for the design of the VIE may be deemed to have power. If the entity determines that it has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE, then the entity must determine if it has either an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Such economic interests may include investments in debt or equity instruments issued by the VIE, liquidity commitments, and explicit and implicit guarantees. On a quarterly basis, we reassess whether we have a controlling financial interest and are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The quarterly reassessment process considers whether we have acquired or divested the power to direct the activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. The reassessment also considers whether we have acquired or disposed of a financial interest that could be significant to the VIE, or whether an interest in the VIE has become significant or is no longer significant. The consolidation status of the VIEs with which we are involved may change as a result of such reassessments. Changes in consolidation status are applied prospectively, with assets and liabilities of a newly consolidated VIE initially recorded at fair value. A gain or loss may be recognized upon deconsolidation of a VIE depending on the carrying amounts of deconsolidated assets and liabilities compared to the fair value of retained interests and ongoing contractual arrangements. Bank of America 2012 127 2011 Compared to 2010 The following discussion and analysis provides a comparison of our results of operations for 2011 and 2010 . This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes. Tables 7 and 8 contain financial data to supplement this discussion. Overview Net Income (Loss) Net income was $1.4 billion in 2011 compared to a net loss of $2.2 billion in 2010 . Including preferred stock dividends, the net income applicable to common shareholders was $85 million , or $0.01 per diluted share. Those results compared to a net loss applicable to common shareholders of $3.6 billion , or $0.37 per diluted share for 2010 . Net Interest Income Net interest income on a FTE basis was $45.6 billion for 2011 , a decrease of $7.1 billion compared to 2010 . The decline was primarily due to lower consumer loan balances and yields and decreased investment security yields, including the acceleration of purchase premium amortization from an increase in modeled prepayment expectations, and increased hedge ineffectiveness. Lower trading-related net interest income also negatively impacted 2011 results. These decreases were partially offset by ongoing reductions in our debt footprint and lower interest rates paid on deposits. The net interest yield on a FTE basis was 2.48 percent for 2011 , a decrease of 30 bps compared to 2010 as the yield continued to be under pressure due to the aforementioned items and the low rate environment. Noninterest Income Noninterest income was $48.8 billion in 2011 , a decrease of $9.9 billion compared to 2010 . Card income decreased $924 million primarily due to the implementation of new interchange fee rules under the Durbin Amendment, which became effective on October 1, 2011 and the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (CARD Act) provisions that were implemented during 2010. Service charges decreased $1.3 billion largely due to the impact of overdraft policy changes in conjunction with Regulation E, which became effective in the third quarter of 2010. Equity investment income increased $2.1 billion. The results for 2011 included $6.5 billion of gains on the sale of CCB shares, partially offset by $1.1 billion of impairment charges on our merchant services joint venture. The prior year included $2.5 billion of net gains which included the sales of certain strategic investments, $2.3 billion of gains in our GPI portfolio and $535 million of CCB dividends. Trading account profits decreased $3.4 billion primarily due to adverse market conditions and extreme volatility in the credit markets compared to the prior year. Net DVA gains on derivatives were $1.0 billion in 2011 compared to $262 million in 2010 as a result of a widening of our credit spreads. Proprietary trading revenue was $434 million for the six months ended June 30, 2011 compared to $1.4 billion for 2010 due to Global Markets exiting its stand-alone proprietary trading business as of June 30, 2011. Mortgage banking income decreased $11.6 billion primarily due to an $8.8 billion increase in the representations and warranties provision which was largely related to the BNY Mellon Settlement. Also contributing to the decline was lower production income due to a reduction in new loan origination volumes partially offset by an increase in servicing income. Other income increased $4.5 billion primarily due to positive fair value adjustments of $3.3 billion related to widening of our own credit spreads on structured liabilities compared to $18 million in 2010. In addition, 2011 included a $771 million gain on the sale of Balboa as well as $1.2 billion of gains on the exchange of certain trust preferred securities for common stock and debt. Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses was $13.4 billion for 2011 , a decrease of $15.0 billion compared to 2010 . The provision for credit losses was $7.4 billion lower than net charge-offs for 2011, resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses primarily driven by lower delinquencies, improved collection rates and fewer bankruptcy filings across the U.S. credit card and unsecured consumer lending portfolios, and improvement in overall credit quality in the commercial real estate portfolio partially offset by additions to consumer PCI loan portfolio reserves. This compared to a $5.9 billion reduction in the allowance for credit losses in 2010. Net charge-offs totaled $20.8 billion, or 2.24 percent of average loans and leases for 2011 compared to $34.3 billion, or 3.60 percent for 2010 . The decrease in net charge-offs was primarily driven by improvements in general economic conditions that resulted in lower delinquencies, improved collection rates and fewer bankruptcy filings across the U.S. credit card and unsecured consumer lending portfolios, as well as lower losses in the home equity portfolio primarily driven by fewer delinquent loans. Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense was $80.3 billion for 2011 , a decrease of $2.8 billion compared to 2010 . Goodwill impairment charges were $3.2 billion for 2011 compared to $12.4 billion in the prior year. Personnel expense increased $1.8 billion for 2011 attributable to personnel costs related to the continued build-out of certain businesses, technology costs as well as increases in default-related servicing. Additionally, professional fees increased $686 million related to consulting fees for regulatory initiatives as well as higher legal expenses. Other general operating expenses increased $4.9 billion largely as a result of a $3.0 billion increase in litigation expense, primarily mortgage-related, and an increase of $1.6 billion in mortgage-related assessments and waivers costs. Merger and restructuring expenses decreased $1.2 billion in 2011. Income Tax Expense The income tax benefit was $1.7 billion on the pre-tax loss of $230 million for 2011 compared to income tax expense of $915 million on the pre-tax loss of $1.3 billion for 2010 . These amounts are before FTE adjustments. The income tax benefit for 2011 was driven by recurring tax preference items, a $1.0 billion benefit from the release of the remaining valuation allowance applicable to the Merrill Lynch capital loss carryover deferred tax asset, and a benefit of $823 million for planned realization of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets related to the tax basis in certain 128 Bank of America 2012 subsidiaries. These benefits were partially offset by the $782 million tax charge related to the enactment of a two percent reduction in the U.K. corporate income tax rate. The effective tax rate for 2010 excluding goodwill impairment charges was 8.3 percent. In addition to our recurring tax preference items, this rate was driven by a $1.7 billion benefit from the release of a portion of the valuation allowance applicable to the Merrill Lynch capital loss carryover deferred tax asset, partially offset by the $392 million charge from a one percent reduction to the U.K. corporate income tax rate enacted during 2010 . Business Segment Operations Consumer & Business Banking CBB recorded net income of $7.4 billion in 2011 compared to a net loss of $5.1 billion in 2010 primarily due to a $10.4 billion goodwill impairment charge in 2010 and a decrease in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a decline in revenue. The decline in revenue was primarily driven by lower average loan balances and yields, lower service charges reflecting the impact of overdraft policy changes in conjunction with Regulation E that were fully implemented during the third quarter of 2010, the implementation of the Durbin Amendment in the fourth quarter of 2011, the gain on the sale of our MasterCard position in 2010 and the implementation of the CARD Act. The provision for credit losses decreased $8.2 billion to $3.5 billion reflecting improving economic conditions and lower loan balances. Noninterest expense decreased $10.9 billion to $17.7 billion primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge in 2010 and lower litigation and operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in FDIC expense. Consumer Real Estate Services CRES recorded a net loss of $19.5 billion in 2011 compared to $8.9 billion in 2010 primarily due to an increase in representations and warranties provision, lower core production income, a decrease in insurance income due to the sale of Balboa in 2011 , and an increase in noninterest expense. Mortgage banking income declined driven by the increased representations and warranties provision and lower core production income due to a drop in market share combined with the decline in the overall market demand for mortgages in 2011. The provision for credit losses decreased $4.0 billion to $4.5 billion primarily driven by improving portfolio trends, including lower reserve additions in the Countrywide PCI home equity portfolio. Noninterest expense increased $7.0 billion to $21.8 billion due to higher litigation expense, increased mortgage-related assessments and waivers costs, higher default-related and other loss mitigation expenses and a higher goodwill impairment charge, partially offset by lower insurance and production expenses. Global Banking Global Banking recorded net income of $6.0 billion in 2011 compared to $4.9 billion in 2010 primarily driven by lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower revenue. Revenue decreased $432 million to $17.3 billion primarily driven by lower net interest income related to ALM activities and lower accretion on acquired portfolios, partially offset by the impact of higher average loan and deposit balances. The provision for credit losses improved $2.4 billion to a benefit of $1.1 billion driven by the positive impact of the economic environment on the credit portfolio and an accelerated rate of loan resolutions in the commercial real estate portfolio. Noninterest expense increased $215 million to $8.9 billion as higher FDIC expense was partially offset by lower personnel and occupancy expenses. Global Markets Global Markets recorded net income of $1.0 billion in 2011 compared to $4.3 billion in 2010 driven by a decline in sales and trading revenue due to a challenging market environment, partially offset by net DVA gains. Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, was $11.8 billion in 2011 compared to $16.4 billion in 2010 . Noninterest expense increased $470 million to $12.2 billion primarily driven by increased costs related to investments in infrastructure. Income tax expense included a $774 million charge to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax assets as a result of a reduction in the U.K. corporate income tax rate enacted during 2011 compared to a charge of $388 million for a rate reduction enacted in 2010. Global Wealth & Investment Management GWIM recorded net income of $1.7 billion in 2011 compared to $1.3 billion in 2010 driven by higher asset management fees, higher net interest income and lower credit costs, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $338 million to $5.9 billion as the impact of higher average deposit balances more than offset the impact of a lower rate environment. Noninterest income increased $774 million to $10.6 billion primarily due to higher asset management fees driven by higher average markets levels in 2011 compared to 2010 and continued long-term AUM flows. The provision for credit losses decreased $248 million to $398 million driven by improving portfolio trends. Noninterest expense increased $1.1 billion to $13.4 billion due primarily to higher volume-driven expenses and personnel costs associated with the continued investment in the business. All Other All Other recorded net income of $4.7 billion in 2011 compared to $1.3 billion in 2010 primarily due to higher noninterest income and lower merger and restructuring charges. Noninterest income increased $7.3 billion to $14.1 billion due to positive fair value adjustments related to our own credit spreads on structured liabilities of $3.3 billion in 2011 compared to $18 million in 2010. Equity investment income increased $2.5 billion as a result of a $6.5 billion gain from the sale of CCB shares partially offset by $1.1 billion of impairment charges on our merchant services joint venture and a decrease of $1.9 billion in GPI income. A goodwill impairment charge of $581 million was recorded during 2011 as a result of a change in the estimated value of the European consumer card business. The prior year included $1.2 billion of gains on the sales of certain strategic investments. The provision for credit losses decreased $152 million to $6.2 billion primarily due to divestitures, improvements in the non-U.S. credit card portfolio and run-off, partially offset by the impact of a continuing decline in home prices.

In addition, for 2012 , fees earned on deposits, primarily overnight, placed with certain non-U.S. central banks, which are included in the time deposits placed and other short-term investments line in prior periods, have been included in the cash and cash equivalents line. Net interest income and net interest yield are calculated excluding these fees. (2) Yields on AFS debt securities are calculated based on fair value rather than the cost basis. The use of fair value does not have a material impact on net interest yield. (3) Nonperforming loans are included in the respective average loan balances. Income on these nonperforming loans is recognized on a cost recovery basis. PCI loans were recorded at fair value upon acquisition and accrete interest income over the remaining life of the loan. (4) Includes non-U.S. residential mortgage loans of $90 million , $91 million and $410 million in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. (5) Includes non-U.S. consumer loans of $7.8 billion , $8.5 billion and $7.9 billion in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. (6) Includes consumer finance loans of $1.5 billion , $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion ; other non-U.S. consumer loans of $699 million , $878 million and $731 million ; and consumer overdrafts of $128 million , $93 million and $111 million in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. (7) Includes U.S. commercial real estate loans of $36.4 billion , $42.1 billion and $57.3 billion ; and non-U.S. commercial real estate loans of $1.6 billion , $2.3 billion and $2.7 billion in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. (8) Interest income includes the impact of interest rate risk management contracts, which decreased interest income on the underlying assets by $754 million , $2.6 billion and $1.4 billion in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Interest expense includes the impact of interest rate risk management contracts, which decreased interest expense on the underlying liabilities by $2.3 billion , $2.6 billion and $3.5 billion in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.

Bank of America 2012 149 Glossary Alt-A Mortgage A type of U.S. mortgage that, for various reasons, is considered riskier than A-paper, or prime, and less risky than subprime, the riskiest category. Alt-A interest rates, which are determined by credit risk, therefore tend to be between those of prime and subprime home loans. Typically, Alt-A mortgages are characterized by borrowers with less than full documentation, lower credit scores and higher LTVs. Assets in Custody Consist largely of custodial and non-discretionary trust assets excluding brokerage assets administered for clients. Trust assets encompass a broad range of asset types including real estate, private company ownership interest, personal property and investments. Assets Under Management (AUM) The total market value of assets under the investment advisory and discretion of GWIM which generate asset management fees based on a percentage of the assets market values. AUM reflects assets that are generally managed for institutional, high net-worth and retail clients, and are distributed through various investment products including mutual funds, other commingled vehicles and separate accounts. Carrying Value (with respect to loans) The amount at which a loan is recorded on the balance sheet. For loans recorded at amortized cost, carrying value is the unpaid principal balance net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and costs, and unamortized purchase premium or discount. For loans that are or have been on nonaccrual status, the carrying value is also reduced by any net charge-offs that have been recorded and the amount of interest payments applied as a reduction of principal under the cost recovery method. For PCI loans, the carrying value equals fair value upon acquisition adjusted for subsequent cash collections and yield accreted to date. For credit card loans, the carrying value also includes interest that has been billed to the customer. For loans classified as held-for-sale, carrying value is the lower of carrying value as described in the sentences above, or fair value. For loans for which we have elected the fair value option, the carrying value is fair value. Client Brokerage Assets Include client assets which are held in brokerage accounts. This includes non-discretionary brokerage and fee-based assets which generate brokerage income and asset management fee revenue. Committed Credit Exposure Includes any funded portion of a facility plus the unfunded portion of a facility on which the lender is legally bound to advance funds during a specified period under prescribed conditions. Credit Derivatives Contractual agreements that provide protection against a credit event on one or more referenced obligations. The nature of a credit event is established by the protection purchaser and protection seller at the inception of the transaction, and such events generally include bankruptcy or insolvency of the referenced credit entity, failure to meet payment obligations when due, as well as acceleration of indebtedness and payment repudiation or moratorium. The purchaser of the credit derivative pays a periodic fee in return for a payment by the protection seller upon the occurrence, if any, of such a credit event. A credit default swap is a type of a credit derivative. Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the counterparty credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments. Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the Corporation own credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments. Interest Rate Lock Commitment (IRLC) Commitment with a loan applicant in which the loan terms, including interest rate and price, are guaranteed for a designated period of time subject to credit approval. Letter of Credit A document issued on behalf of a customer to a third party promising to pay the third party upon presentation of specified documents. A letter of credit effectively substitutes the issuer credit for that of the customer. Loan-to-value (LTV) A commonly used credit quality metric that is reported in terms of ending and average LTV. Ending LTV is calculated as the outstanding carrying value of the loan at the end of the period divided by the estimated value of the property securing the loan. Estimated property values are primarily determined by utilizing the Case-Schiller Home Index, a widely used index based on data from repeat sales of single family homes. Case-Schiller indices are updated quarterly and are reported on a three-month or one-quarter lag. An additional metric related to LTV is combined loan-to-value (CLTV) which is similar to the LTV metric, yet combines the outstanding balance on the residential mortgage loan and the outstanding carrying value on the home equity loan or available line of credit, both of which are secured by the same property, divided by the estimated value of the property. A LTV of 100 percent reflects a loan that is currently secured by a property valued at an amount exactly equal to the carrying value or available line of the loan. Under certain circumstances, estimated values can also be determined by utilizing an automated valuation method (AVM) or Mortgage Risk Assessment Corporation (MRAC) index. An AVM is a tool that estimates the value of a property by reference to large volumes of market data including sales of comparable properties and price trends specific to the MSA in which the property being valued is located. The MRAC index is similar to the Case-Schiller Home Index in that it is an index that is based on data from repeat sales of single family homes and is reported on a lag. Margin Receivables An extension of credit secured by eligible securities in certain brokerage accounts. Mortgage Servicing Right (MSR) The right to service a mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or securitized. Servicing includes collections for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors. 150 Bank of America 2012 Net Interest Yield Net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets. Nonperforming Loans and Leases Includes loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status, including nonaccruing loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties (TDRs). Loans accounted for under the fair value option, PCI loans and LHFS are not reported as nonperforming loans and leases. Consumer credit card loans, business card loans, consumer loans secured by personal property (except for certain secured consumer loans, including those that have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring), and consumer loans secured by real estate that are insured by the FHA or through long-term credit protection agreements with FNMA and FHLMC (fully-insured loan portfolio), are not placed on nonaccrual status and are, therefore, not reported as nonperforming loans and leases. Purchased Credit-impaired (PCI) Loan A loan purchased as an individual loan, in a portfolio of loans or in a business combination with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination for which it is probable, upon acquisition, that the investor will be unable to collect all contractually required payments. These loans are recorded at fair value upon acquisition. Subprime Loans Although a standard industry definition for subprime loans (including subprime mortgage loans) does not exist, the Corporation defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers, including individuals with one or a combination of high credit risk factors, such as low FICO scores, high debt to income ratios and inferior payment history. Tier 1 Common Capital Tier 1 capital less preferred stock, qualifying trust preferred securities, hybrid securities and qualifying noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries. Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) Loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Certain consumer loans for which a binding offer to restructure has been extended are also classified as TDRs. Concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate to a rate that is below market on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance, loans discharged in bankruptcy or other actions intended to maximize collection. Secured consumer loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not been reaffirmed by the borrower are classified as TDRs at the time of discharge from bankruptcy. TDRs are generally reported as nonperforming loans and leases while on nonaccrual status. Nonperforming TDRs may be returned to accrual status when, among other criteria, payment in full of all amounts due under the restructured terms is expected and the borrower has demonstrated a sustained period of repayment performance, typically six months. TDRs that are on accrual status are reported as performing TDRs through the end of the calendar year in which the restructuring occurred or the year in which they are returned to accrual status. In addition, if accruing TDRs bear less than a market rate of interest at the time of modification, they are reported as performing TDRs throughout their remaining lives unless and until they cease to perform in accordance with their modified contractual terms, at which time they would be placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming TDRs. Value-at-Risk (VaR) VaR is a model that simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss the portfolio is expected to experience with a given confidence level based on historical data. A VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios.
