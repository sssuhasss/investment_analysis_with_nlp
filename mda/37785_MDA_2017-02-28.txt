ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We are a diversified chemical company serving agricultural, consumer and industrial markets globally with innovative solutions, applications and market-leading products. We operate in three distinct business segments: FMC Agricultural Solutions, FMC Health and Nutrition and FMC Lithium. Our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment develops, markets and sells all three major classes of crop protection chemicals: insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. These products are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of insects, weeds and disease, as well as in non-agricultural markets for pest control. The FMC Health and Nutrition segment focuses on nutritional ingredients, health excipients, and functional health ingredients. Nutritional ingredients are used to enhance texture, color, structure and physical stability. Health excipients are used for binding, encapsulation and disintegrant applications. Functional health ingredients are used as active ingredients in nutraceutical and pharmaceutical markets. Our FMC Lithium segment manufactures lithium for use in a wide range of lithium products, which are used primarily in energy storage, specialty polymers and chemical synthesis application. 2016 Highlights The following are the more significant developments in our businesses during the year ended December 31, 2016 : Revenue of $3,282.4 million in 2016 increased $5.9 million or approximately one percent versus last year. A more detailed review of revenues by segment is included under the section entitled Results of Operations . On a regional basis, sales in Latin America decreas ed by 18 percent , sales in North America decreased two percent, sales in Asia increased five percent and sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) increased by 26 percent . Our gross margin, excluding acquisition-related charges, of $1,199.8 million increased approximately $66.6 million or approximately six percent versus last year. Gross margin as a percent of revenue is approximately 37 percent versus 35 percent in 2015 . The increase in gross margin was driven by improved pricing and mix in both Brazil and North America in our FMC Agricultural Solutions business. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 28 percent from $737.9 million to $529.5 million . In 2015, we incurred significant acquisition related charges that occurred to a much lesser extent in 2016 accounting for the majority of the decrease. Selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding non-operating pension and postretirement charges and acquisition-related charges, of $481.0 million increased $10.9 million or approximately two percent . Non-operating pension and postretirement charges and acquisition-related charges are presented in our Adjusted Earnings Non-GAAP financial measurement below under the section titled Results of Operations . Research and development expenses of $141.5 million decreased $2.2 million or two percent . The decrease was due to registration and regulatory timing within FMC Agricultural Solutions. Net income attributable to FMC stockholders of $209.1 million decreased approximately $ 279.9 million from $489.0 million in the prior year period. Adjusted after-tax earnings from continuing operations attributable to FMC stockholders of $379.8 million increased approximately $47.2 million or 14 percent due to higher results in FMC Agricultural Solutions and FMC Lithium. See the disclosure of our Adjusted Earnings Non-GAAP financial measurement below under the section titled Results of Operations . Other 2016 Highlights In our FMC Agricultural Solutions business, we continue to see the benefits of the Cheminova acquisition, which brought greater scale and regional balance to our business, improved our market access and expanded our product portfolio and technology pipeline. Challenging market conditions specifically in the global crop protection market persisted throughout the year. During the quarter, as discussed above, our FMC Agricultural Solutions business had significantly improved operating results primarily due to improved performance in Brazil which last year was significantly impacted by unfavorable foreign currency. In FMC Health and Nutrition, global demand for our naturally-derived ingredient product lines continues to be strong and we remain focused on protecting the business high margins through the implementation of Manufacturing Excellence programs, process technology improvements and product differentiation. However, the Omega-3 business is having challenges due to the overcapacity in the industry. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we commissioned our new MCC production facility in Rayong, Thailand, which will facilitate our ability to serve a growing nutrition market in Asia. 21 Table of Contents In FMC Lithium, we are seeing the benefits of our strategy to grow our business in the technology-driven specialty end markets, where demand continues to accelerate and pricing trends across our portfolio remain favorable. In May, we announced plans to triple our production capacity of lithium hydroxide to 30,000 metric tons by 2019 in order to meet growing demand from our key customers. In late October, we announced a supply agreement that will source 8,000 metric tons per year of lithium carbonate, beginning in mid-2018. This agreement will help to support our hydroxide expansion. 2017 Outlook Despite continued challenging Agricultural market conditions, we believe that our 2017 plan is very achievable. It relies on things we control rather than on expectations of positive external events. We expect to deliver segment earnings growth in each business and a reduction in income tax expense in 2017 as a result of the integration of Cheminova. The strategy of each business is aligned with its respective market conditions. Therefore, we expect revenue and earnings growth in our Lithium and Health and Nutrition businesses, and we will continue a very disciplined approach in Ag Solutions to ensure earnings growth while positioning the business strongly for the eventual upturn in that market. On a long term basis, we continue to remain a technology-driven company with low-cost, asset light operations, a unique business research and development model that balances short-and mid-term developments with long-term innovations, and global scale with strong regional expertise to support local customers. Please see segment discussions under the section entitled Results of Operations for 2017 outlook for each segment. 22 Table of Contents Results of Operations 2016 , 2015 and 2014 Overview The following presents a reconciliation of our segment operating profit to the net income attributable to FMC stockholders as seen through the eyes of our management. For management purposes, we report the operating performance of each of our business segments based on earnings before interest and income taxes excluding corporate expenses, other income (expense), net and corporate special income (charges). SEGMENT RESULTS RECONCILIATION (in Millions) Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Revenue FMC Agricultural Solutions $ 2,274.8 $ 2,252.9 $ 2,173.8 FMC Health and Nutrition 743.5 785.5 828.2 FMC Lithium 264.1 238.1 256.7 Total $ 3,282.4 $ 3,276.5 $ 3,258.7 Income from continuing operations before income taxes FMC Agricultural Solutions $ 399.9 $ 363.9 $ 497.8 FMC Health and Nutrition 191.3 194.7 187.9 FMC Lithium 70.2 23.0 27.2 Segment operating profit $ 661.4 $ 581.6 $ 712.9 Corporate and other (83.6 ) (62.4 ) (71.4 ) Operating profit before the items listed below 577.8 519.2 641.5 Interest expense, net (82.7 ) (80.1 ) (51.2 ) Corporate special (charges) income: Restructuring and other (charges) income (1) (107.3 ) (244.0 ) (56.4 ) Non-operating pension and postretirement charges (2) (25.1 ) (35.3 ) (10.5 ) Business separation costs (3) (23.6 ) Acquisition-related charges (4) (23.4 ) (290.3 ) (136.0 ) Provision for income taxes (93.9 ) (47.4 ) (56.2 ) Discontinued operations, net of income taxes (33.7 ) 676.4 14.5 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (2.6 ) (9.5 ) (14.6 ) Net income attributable to FMC stockholders $ 209.1 $ 489.0 $ 307.5 ____________________ (1) See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included within this Form 10-K for details of restructuring and other (charges) income by segment: Year Ended December 31, (in Millions) 2016 2015 2014 FMC Agricultural Solutions $ (62.0 ) $ (123.7 ) $ 4.5 FMC Health and Nutrition (10.0 ) (93.8 ) (14.1 ) FMC Lithium (0.6 ) (2.7 ) Corporate (34.7 ) (23.8 ) (46.8 ) Restructuring and other (charges) income $ (107.3 ) $ (244.0 ) $ (56.4 ) (2) Our non-operating pension and postretirement costs are defined as those costs related to interest, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains and losses and the impacts of any plan curtailments or settlements. These costs are primarily related to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance and we consider these costs to be outside our operational performance. We exclude these non-operating pension and postretirement costs from our segments as we believe that removing them provides a better understanding of the underlying profitability of our businesses, provides increased transparency and clarity in the performance of our retirement plans and enhances period-over-period comparability. We continue to include the service cost and amortization of prior service cost in our operating segments noted above. We believe these elements reflect the current year operating costs to our businesses for the employment benefits provided to active employees. These expenses are included as a component of the line item "Selling, general and administrative expenses" on the consolidated statements of income (loss). 23 Table of Contents (3) Charges are associated with the previously planned separation of our FMC Corporation into two independent public companies. On September 8, 2014, we announced that we would no longer proceed with the planned separation. At that time we announced the acquisition of Cheminova. See Note 3 within these consolidated financial statements included within this Form 10-K for more information. These charges are included within "Business separation costs" on our consolidated income statement. These costs were primarily related to professional fees associated with separation activities within the finance and legal functions through September 8, 2014. (4) Charges related to the expensing of the inventory fair value step-up resulting from the application of acquisition purchase accounting, legal and professional fees and gains or losses on hedging purchase price associated with the planned or completed acquisitions. See Note 3 for details. Amounts represent the following: Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in Millions) 2016 2015 2014 Acquisition-related charges - Cheminova (c) Legal and professional fees (a) $ 23.4 $ 60.4 $ 32.2 Inventory fair value step-up amortization (b) 57.8 Unrealized loss/(gain) on hedging purchase price (a) 172.1 99.6 Acquisition-related charges - Epax Inventory fair value step-up amortization (b) 4.2 Total Acquisition-related charges $ 23.4 $ 290.3 $ 136.0 (a) On the consolidated statements of income, these charges are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses. (b) On the consolidated statements of income, these charges are included in Costs of sales and services. (c) Acquisition-related charges associated with the integration of Cheminova with Agricultural Solutions were completed at the end of 2016. ADJUSTED EARNINGS RECONCILIATION The following chart, which is provided to assist the readers of our financial statements, depicts certain after-tax charges (gains). These items are excluded from the measures we use to evaluate business performance and determine certain performance-based compensation. These after-tax items are discussed in detail within the Other results of operations section that follows. Additionally, the chart below discloses our Non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted after-tax earnings from continuing operations attributable to FMC stockholders reconciled from the GAAP financial measure Net income (loss) attributable to FMC stockholders. We believe that this measure provides useful information about our operating results to investors. We also believe that excluding the effect of restructuring and other income and charges, non-operating pension and postretirement charges, certain Non-GAAP tax adjustments from operating results and discontinued operations allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of our underlying businesses from period to period. This measure should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP. (in Millions) Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Net income attributable to FMC stockholders (GAAP) $ 209.1 $ 489.0 $ 307.5 Corporate special charges (income), pre-tax 155.8 569.6 226.5 Income tax expense (benefit) on Corporate special charges (income) (1) (48.5 ) (144.9 ) (84.1 ) Corporate special charges (income), net of income taxes 107.3 424.7 142.4 Discontinued operations attributable to FMC Stockholders, net of income taxes 33.7 (676.4 ) (9.3 ) Non-GAAP tax adjustments (2) 29.7 95.3 (13.8 ) Adjusted after-tax earnings from continuing operations attributable to FMC stockholders (Non-GAAP) $ 379.8 $ 332.6 $ 426.8 ____________________ (1) The income tax expense (benefit) on Corporate special charges (income) is determined using the applicable rates in the taxing jurisdictions in which the Corporate special charge or income occurred and includes both current and deferred income tax expense (benefit) based on the nature of the non-GAAP performance measure. (2) We exclude the GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, from the Non-GAAP measure of income, and instead include a Non-GAAP tax provision based upon the annual Non-GAAP effective tax rate. The GAAP tax provision includes certain discrete tax items including, but not limited to: income tax expenses or benefits that are not related to current year ongoing business operations; tax 24 Table of Contents adjustments associated with fluctuations in foreign currency remeasurement of certain foreign operations; certain changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years; certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets; and changes in tax law. Management believes excluding these discrete tax items assists investors and securities analysts in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations thereby providing investors with useful supplemental information about FMC's operational performance. In the discussion below, please refer to our chart titled "Segment Results Reconciliation" within the Results of Operations section. All comparisons are between the periods unless otherwise noted. Segment Results For management purposes, segment operating profit is defined as segment revenue less segment operating expenses (segment operating expenses consist of costs of sales and services, selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") and research and development expenses ("R&D"). We have excluded the following items from segment operating profit: corporate staff expense, interest income and expense associated with corporate debt facilities and investments, income taxes, gains (or losses) on divestitures of businesses, restructuring and other charges (income), non-operating pension and postretirement charges, investment gains and losses, loss on extinguishment of debt, asset impairments, Last-in, First-out ( LIFO ) inventory adjustments, acquisition/divestiture related charges, business separation costs and other income and expense items. Information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. FMC Agricultural Solutions (in Millions) Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Revenue $ 2,274.8 $ 2,252.9 $ 2,173.8 Operating Profit 399.9 363.9 497.8 2016 vs. 2015 Revenue of $2,274.8 million increased approximately one percent versus the prior year period. Operating profit of $ 399.9 million increased approximately 10 percent compared to the year-ago period. Refer to the FMC Agricultural Solutions Pro Forma Financial Results with Cheminova section below for further discussion. For 2017 , full-year segment revenue is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion and full-year segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $410 million to $450 million . In Europe, we expect our key markets to have increased demand compared to last year which could be somewhat unfavorably impacted by foreign currency. In North America, we expect challenging market conditions will continue in 2017 given elevated channel inventory levels, lower commodity prices, and cautious purchasing decisions by the growers. As a result, we expect the market in North America to be down in 2017. Across Asia, we expect market demand to increase slightly in 2017 assuming more normal weather conditions. In Latin America, market conditions across the region are expected to be favorable, resulting in somewhat higher demand than 2016. However, foreign exchange headwinds could impact the region negatively. 2015 vs. 2014 Revenue of $2,252.9 million increased approximately four percent versus the prior year period due to revenue from the Cheminova acquisition on April 20, 2015. Operating profit of $363.9 million decreased approximately 27 percent compared to the year-ago period. This decline was primarily driven by market conditions and currency movements in Brazil. FMC Agricultural Solutions Pro Forma Financial Results with Cheminova In the second quarter of 2015, we began to present pro forma combined results for the FMC Agricultural Solutions segment. We believe that reviewing our operating results by combining actual and pro forma results for the FMC 25 Table of Contents Agricultural Solutions segment for 2015 is more useful in identifying trends in, or reaching conclusions regarding, the overall operating performance of this segment. Our pro forma segment information includes adjustments as if the Cheminova transaction had occurred on January 1, 2014. Our pro forma data have also been adjusted for the effects of acquisition accounting but do not include adjustments for costs related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that might have been achieved by the combined businesses. Pro forma amounts presented are not necessarily indicative of what our results would have been had we operated Cheminova since January 1, 2014, nor our future results. We believe that reviewing our operating results by combining actual and pro forma results for the FMC Agricultural Solutions segment for the periods set forth below is more useful in identifying trends in, or reaching conclusions regarding, the overall operating performance of the segment. FMC Agricultural Solutions Pro Forma Financial Results Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in Millions) 2016 2015 2014 Revenue Revenue, FMC Agricultural Solutions, as reported (1) $ 2,274.8 $ 2,252.9 $ 2,173.8 Revenue, Cheminova, pro forma (2) 362.0 1,225.7 Pro Forma Combined, Revenue (3) $ 2,274.8 $ 2,614.9 $ 3,399.5 Operating Profit Operating Profit, FMC Agricultural Solutions, as reported (1) $ 399.9 $ 363.9 $ 497.8 Operating Profit, Cheminova, pro forma (2) 19.9 38.2 Pro Forma Combined, Operating Profit (3) $ 399.9 $ 383.8 $ 536.0 ___________________ (1) As reported amounts are the results of operations of FMC Agricultural Solutions, including the results of the Cheminova acquisition from April 21, 2015 onward. (2) Cheminova pro forma amounts include the historical results of Cheminova, prior to April 21, 2015. These amounts also include adjustments as if the Cheminova transaction had occurred on January 1, 2014, including the effects of acquisition accounting. The pro forma amounts do not include adjustments for expenses related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that may have been or may be achieved by the combined segment. (3) The pro forma combined amounts are not necessarily indicative of what the results would have been had we acquired Cheminova on January 1, 2014 or indicative of future results. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, pro forma results and actual results are the same. FMC Agricultural Solutions Pro Forma Combined Revenue by Region (1) Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in Millions) 2016 2015 2014 Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) (2) $ 516.3 $ 585.7 $ 639.6 North America (3) 557.8 595.2 658.3 Latin America (4) 758.8 965.3 1,488.3 Asia (5) 441.9 468.7 613.3 Total $ 2,274.8 $ 2,614.9 $ 3,399.5 26 Table of Contents ___________________ (1) The pro forma combined revenue by region amounts are not necessarily indicative of what the results would have been had we acquired Cheminova on January 1, 2014 or indicative of future results. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, pro forma revenues and actual revenues are the same. (2) Decrease in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was driven by unfavorable weather in both Central and Western Europe. Additionally, the shift in the timing of sales as a result of our change to a direct market access model across Europe and product rationalization each contributed to the decline in revenue. (3) Decrease in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was driven by elevated channel inventory levels and lower demand due to the deterioration in farm incomes which resulted in more cautious purchasing decisions. (4) Lower sales volumes in Brazil contributed to the reduction in revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 . Continued product rationalization resulted in lower revenues as well as the decision to allow the existing channel inventory to reduce. The volumes were also impacted by our disciplined approach to reduce our credit exposure in Brazil. Additionally, foreign exchange headwinds from the Mexican Peso contributed to the revenue decrease. Decrease in the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was due lower volumes in Brazil including the deliberate action to reduce third party resales in Brazil, in part as the result of the sale of our Consagro business in 2015. (5) Decline in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was driven by softer demand in China as well as our actions to reduce channel inventories in India, following two years of drought. Actual Results for 2016 vs. Pro Forma Combined Results for 2015 Revenue of $2,274.8 million decreased approximately 13 percent versus pro forma combined revenue the prior year period. Volumes contributed to 14 percent of the decline and unfavorable foreign currency contributed another one percent to the decline . These declines were partially offset by favorable pricing which contributed a two percent increase. The lower volumes were partially due to actions we took to eliminate certain product sales as previously described. These actions reduced revenue by approximately $175 million compared to the pro forma revenue for 2015. See chart above for discussion on revenue by region. Operating profit of $399.9 million increased approximately four percent compared to the pro forma combined operating profit for the prior period. Improved pricing and mix impacted pro forma operating profit by ten percent which was predominantly experienced in both Brazil and North America and favorable foreign currency impacted pro forma results by four percent. Lower costs, primarily selling, general and administrative in nature also favorably impacted results by 10 percent . The lower volumes noted above had a negative impact on pro forma operating profit of 20 percent . Pro Forma Combined Results - 2015 vs. 2014 Pro forma combined revenue of $2,614.9 million decreased approximately 23 percent versus the prior year period. Favorable pricing impacted revenue by five percent in 2015 compared to the same period in 2014; however, the price increases only partially offset the unfavorable impact of foreign currency movements and lower volumes. Unfavorable currency negatively impacted revenue by 11 percent while volumes impacted revenue by 16 percent. Most of this decline was experienced in Latin America, primarily Brazil. Lower volume was also a result of the deliberate action to reduce third party resales also in Brazil. These reduced third party sales were partially the result of the sale of our Consagro business. Pro forma combined operating profit of $383.8 million decreased approximately 28 percent compared to the year-ago period. The significant movement in foreign currency rates compared to the prior year, particularly the real, was the main driver of the decline in operating profit as price increases in local currencies were not enough to offset the impact of foreign currency. During 2015, the Brazilian real depreciated significantly versus the U.S. dollar. As a result, foreign currency contributed 55 percent to the decline in year over year pro forma combined operating profit while to a lesser extent lower volumes contributed to a 16 percent impact. Higher pricing and mix partially offset these declines by 23 percent while lower costs primarily selling, general and administrative combined with lower research and development costs improved profits year over year by 19 percent. These lower costs were driven by cost savings driven by synergies associated with the Cheminova acquisition as well as reduced spending primarily in Brazil to address with near-term market conditions. In 2015, we announced several targeted measures to reduce operating costs and reorganize our operations in Brazil to align the business with near-term market conditions. These measures included: Enhancing our focus on proprietary technology platforms and differentiated products, and rationalizing our product offerings to eliminate low-margin sales. This portfolio rationalization program, including the sale of our generic subsidiary, Consagro, reduced 2015 pro forma combined operating profit by $48 million compared to 2014. This will enable us to further reduce the region's operating costs and enhance our potential to deliver higher future earnings and return on capital. At the completion of this reorganization, FMC's workforce in Brazil will be approximately half its size compared to 2014. Aside from the product rationalization, all of these actions were substantially completed by December 31, 2015. 27 Table of Contents FMC Health and Nutrition (in Millions) Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Revenue $ 743.5 $ 785.5 $ 828.2 Operating Profit 191.3 194.7 187.9 2016 vs. 2015 Revenue was $743.5 million , a decrease of approximately five percent versus the prior-year period. Lower volume was the main driver of the decrease , contributing four percent, primarily due to Omega-3. Unfavorable foreign currency impacts and unfavorable price and mix decreased revenue by approximately one percent total. Segment operating profit of $191.3 million decreased approximately two percent versus the year ago period driven by lower revenue partially offset by lower manufacturing costs. The lower volumes discussed in the preceding paragraph drove the lower earnings. Segment revenue for the full year of 2017 is anticipated to be approximately $ 750 million to $ 790 million , while full-year segment earnings are expected to be between $ 190 million and $ 200 million . The anticipated revenue increase is driven by increased volumes of MCC-based products associated with our new MCC plant in Thailand. The relatively flat earnings will be impacted by costs of bringing the new plant on-line which are expected to offset by the benefits of other operational improvements across the business. 2015 vs. 2014 Revenue was $785.5 million, a decrease of approximately five percent versus the prior-year period. Unfavorable foreign currency impacts, primarily a weaker euro, decreased revenue by approximately five percent with volume, price and mix flat in the aggregate compared to prior year. Volume was slightly positive as lower volume in carrageenan and alginates were offset by growth in the MCC family of products in both pharmaceuticals and food end markets. Pricing for 2015 as compared to 2014 was slightly positive and mix was slightly negative. Segment operating profit of $194.7 million increased approximately four percent versus the year ago period driven by the higher volumes discussed in the preceding paragraph, the operating profit impact of improved price and mix and lower manufacturing costs as well as lower selling, general and administrative costs, partially offset by unfavorable currency. Volumes and price mix improved operating profit by three percent and two percent, respectively while lower manufacturing costs and lower selling, general and administrative costs improved profits by two percent and three percent, respectively. The reduction in these costs was driven by various manufacturing initiatives to improve profitability as well as the benefits of restructuring activities and cost control initiatives. Finally, unfavorable currency negatively impacted results by six percent year over year. FMC Lithium (in Millions) Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Revenue $ 264.1 $ 238.1 $ 256.7 Operating Profit 70.2 23.0 27.2 2016 vs. 2015 Revenue of $264.1 million increased by approximately 11 percent versus the prior-year period driven by favorable pricing of Carbonate, Chloride, and Hydroxide, which accounted for 14 percent of the change. This was offset by lower volumes due to increased demand from downstream products, which impacted revenues by three percent. Segment operating profit of $70.2 million increased approximately $47 million versus the year ago period. The favorable pricing noted above impacted operating profit by approximately $33 million while volume had a negative impact on operating profit of $3 million . Favorable foreign currency impacts increased operating profit by approximately $3 million . Additionally, lower raw material prices, lower energy prices and increased manufacturing efficiencies improved operating profit by approximately $14 million . 28 Table of Contents Demand for lithium remains strong and pricing trends continue to be favorable. In 2016, we announced plans to triple our production capacity of lithium hydroxide to 30,000 metric tons by 2019 in order to meet growing demand from our key customers. This hydroxide expansion will result in increased volumes in the second half of 2017. Full year segment revenue is expected to be approximately $ 315 million to $ 355 million while segment operating profit is expected to be between $ 90 million and $ 110 million for the full year of 2017 , an increase of approximately 42 percent over 2016 at the mid-point of the range. 2015 vs. 2014 Revenue of $238.1 million decreased by approximately seven percent versus the prior-year period driven by lower volumes of upstream products and weaker foreign currencies. These impacted revenues by seven percent and three percent, respectively. This was partially offset by favorable pricing which impacted revenue by three percent. Segment operating profit of $23.0 million decreased approximately 15 percent versus the year ago period. Pricing impacted operating profit favorably by approximately $7 million while volume had about an equal negative impact on operating profit. Foreign currency, primarily the Argentine peso and the euro, impacted operating profit by approximately $9 million. This was partially offset by manufacturing cost savings and other miscellaneous items. Corporate and other Corporate expenses are included as a component of the line item Selling, general and administrative expenses except for last in, first-out (LIFO) related charges that are included as a component of "Cost of sales and other services" on our consolidated statements of income. 2016 vs. 2015 Corporate and other expenses of $83.6 million increased by $21.2 million from $62.4 million in 2015 . Approximately $10 million of the increase is driven by the higher incentive compensation due to improved business performance as well as costs associated with the relocation of our Corporate headquarters which totaled approximately $2.2 million. The remaining $9 million increase was primarily the result of other project initiatives. 2015 vs. 2014 Corporate and other expenses of $62.4 million decreased by $9.0 million from $71.4 million in the same period in 2014. The decrease was driven primarily by reduced LIFO inventory expense of approximately $7.0 million. The reduced LIFO expense was driven by lower inflation rates applied to the inventory subject to LIFO calculations. Excluding the LIFO reductions, corporate staff expenses and incentive payments were flat year over year. Interest expense, net 2016 vs. 2015 Interest expense, net of $82.7 million increased by approximately three percent compared to $80.1 million in 2015 . The slight increase was primarily due to higher foreign debt balances, partially offset by lower term balance and other minor factors. 2015 vs. 2014 Interest expense, net of $80.1 million increased approximately 56 percent as compared to $51.2 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to our borrowings under our senior unsecured Term Loan facility. The proceeds of these borrowings were used to finance the acquisition of Cheminova as well as to pay costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition and the term loan facility. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information. Corporate special charges (income) 29 Table of Contents Restructuring and other charges (income) Our restructuring and other charges (income) are comprised of restructuring, assets disposals and other charges (income) as described below: Year Ended December 31, (in Millions) 2016 2015 2014 Restructuring Charges and Asset Disposals $ 53.4 $ 217.7 $ 17.2 Other Charges (Income), Net 53.9 26.3 39.2 Total Restructuring and Other Charges (1) $ 107.3 $ 244.0 $ 56.4 _______________ (1) See Note 7 within the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information. 2016 Restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2016 totaled $53.4 million . Included in this were final charges totaling $42.3 million associated with the integration of Cheminova into our existing FMC Agricultural Solutions segment. The amount includes final adjustments to severances, long lived asset write offs, contract termination costs and other miscellaneous items. Additionally, other charges (income), net in 2016 consisted of $36.8 million for continuing environmental sites treated as Corporate charges, $13.2 million associated with a license agreement to obtain certain technology and intellectual property rights for new compounds still under development and $4.2 million as a result of the Argentina government's action to devalue its currency. These charges were offset by other miscellaneous income of $0.3 million . 2015 Restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2015 totaled $244.0 million. Included in this were significant charges totaling $118.3 million associated with charges as part of the integration of Cheminova into our existing FMC Agricultural Solutions segment. The Cheminova charges included those associated with the sale of Consagro, which amounted to $64.5 million. Restructuring and asset disposal charges also include charges associated with various activities in Health and Nutrition of $93.6 million. The majority of these charges are from the loss on sale of our Pectin business of $12 million as well as asset write downs associated with the mothballing of our Seal Sands plant equaling $70.5 million. The Seal Sands plant, in the UK, was mothballed in 2015 due to a lack of demand for the Omega-3 pharmaceuticals products that were manufactured at that facility. Other charges (income), net in 2015 consisted of environmental charges of $21.7 million, the impacts of the Argentina currency devaluation in December of 2015 of $10.7 million, and $20.5 million of expenses associated with acquired in-process research and development activity. Partially offsetting these amounts was a gain of $26.6 million related to the sale of our remaining ownership interest in a Belgian-based pesticide distribution company, Belchim Crop Protection N.V. ("Belchim"). 2014 Restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2014 of $17.2 million were primarily associated with our Health and Nutrition restructuring as well as other miscellaneous exit costs. Other charges (income), net in 2014 of $39.2 million were primarily related to corporate environmental charges of $43.7 million and charges of $22.1 million associated with our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment which entered into collaboration and license agreements with various third-party companies for the purpose of obtaining certain technology and intellectual property rights relating to new compounds still under development. Offsetting these charges is income from the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in a pesticide distribution company which resulted in a gain on the sale of approximately $26.6 million. Non-operating pension and postretirement (charges) income Non-operating pension and postretirement (charges) income are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income (loss). 2016 vs. 2015 The charge for 2016 was $25.1 million compared to $35.3 million in 2015 . The decrease in charges was in part due to the estimation method used in 2016 to calculate the interest cost components of our net periodic benefit cost as described in the Critical Accounting Policies section of Item 7 within this Form 10-K. The decrease was also the result of $13.3 million of 30 Table of Contents lower amortization of net actuarial losses. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $12.1 million for recognized losses due to plan settlements. See Note 13 for more information. 2015 vs. 2014 The charge for 2015 was $35.3 million compared to $10.5 million for 2014. The increase in charges was primarily the result of $24.1 million of higher amortization of net actuarial losses. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information. Business Separation costs On September 8, 2014, we announced that we would no longer proceed with the planned separation as a result of the planned acquisition of Cheminova and divestiture of FMC Alkali Chemicals division. As a result there were no business separation charges in 2015 or 2016. Business separation cost for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 represent charges associated with the planned separation activities through December 31, 2015. Acquisition-related charges A detailed description of the acquisition related charges is included in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included within this Form 10-K and in the Segment Results Reconciliation above within the " Results of Operations " section of the Management's Discussion and Analysis. Provision for income taxes A significant amount of our earnings is generated by our foreign subsidiaries (e.g. Denmark, Ireland and Hong Kong), which tax earnings at lower rates than the United States federal statutory rate. Our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by numerous items including: a future change in the composition of earnings from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions, as earnings in foreign jurisdictions are typically taxed at more favorable rates than the United States federal statutory rate; accounting for uncertain tax positions; business combinations; expiration of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits; changes in valuation allowance; changes in tax law; and the potential decision to repatriate certain future foreign earnings on which United States taxes have not been previously accrued. Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in Millions) 2016 2015 2014 Income (Expense) Tax Provision (Benefit) Effective Tax Rate Income (Expense) Tax Provision (Benefit) Effective Tax Rate Income (Expense) Tax Provision (Benefit) Effective Tax Rate GAAP - Continuing operations $ 339.3 $ 93.9 27.7 % $ (130.5 ) $ 47.4 (36.3 )% $ 363.8 $ 56.2 15.4 % Corporate special charges 155.8 48.5 569.6 144.9 226.5 84.1 Tax adjustments (1) (29.7 ) (95.3 ) 13.8 $ 495.1 $ 112.7 22.8 % $ 439.1 $ 97.0 22.1 % $ 590.3 $ 154.1 26.1 % _______________ (1) Tax adjustments in 2016 were primarily associated with valuation allowance adjustments to U.S. state deferred tax balances. Tax adjustments in 2015 were primarily associated with valuation allowance adjustments taken in our Brazil subsidiaries. Tax adjustments in 2014 were primarily associated with revisions to our tax liabilities associated with prior year tax matters. The primary drivers for the fluctuations in the effective tax rate from 2016 to 2015 and 2015 to 2014 are provided in the table above. Excluding the items in the table above, the changes in the effective tax rate were primarily due to shifts in earnings mix as it relates to domestic versus foreign income. Foreign profits are generally taxed at lower rates compared to domestic income. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the provisions for income taxes on continuing operations, as well as items that significantly impact our effective tax rate. Discontinued operations, net of income taxes Our discontinued operations, in periods up to its sale, represent our discontinued FMC Alkali Chemicals and Peroxygens business results as well as adjustments to retained liabilities from other previously discontinued operations. The primary liabilities retained include environmental liabilities, other postretirement benefit liabilities, self-insurance, long-term obligations related to legal proceedings and historical restructuring activities. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on our discontinued operations. 31 Table of Contents 2016 vs. 2015 Discontinued operations, net of income taxes represented a loss of $33.7 million in 2016 compared to a gain of $676.4 million in 2015 . The change was driven by the divestiture of our discontinued FMC Alkali Chemicals division which resulted in an after tax gain of $ 702.1 million in 2015 . 2015 vs. 2014 Discontinued operations, net of income taxes represented a gain of $676.4 in 2015 compared to a gain of $14.5 million in 2014. The change was driven by the divestiture of our discontinued FMC Alkali Chemicals division which resulted in an after tax gain of $702.1 million in 2015. Net income attributable to FMC stockholders 2016 vs. 2015 Net income attributable to FMC stockholders decreased to $209.1 million from $489.0 million . The decrease was primarily due to the gain from the sale of our discontinued FMC Alkali Chemicals division in 2015 which was partially offset by lower acquisition-related costs in 2016. 2015 vs. 2014 Net income attributable to FMC stockholders increased to $489.0 million from $307.5 million. The increase was primarily due to the gain from the sale of our discontinued FMC Alkali Chemicals division offset by reduced Agricultural Solutions results as well as higher interest expense from higher debt levels needed to fund the Cheminova acquisition. Also significantly impacting results was a higher tax rate in 2015 primarily due to the increases in certain foreign valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. 32 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , were $64.2 million and $78.6 million , respectively. Of the cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2016 , $64.1 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our intent is to reinvest indefinitely the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and therefore we have not recorded taxes that would be payable if we repatriated these earnings. At December 31, 2016 , we had total debt of $1,893.0 million as compared to $2,148.9 million at December 31, 2015 . Total debt included $1,798.8 million and $2,036.3 million of long-term debt (excluding current portions of $2.4 million and $1.5 million ) at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. As of December 31, 2016 , we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants. During 2016, the maximum leverage ratio stepped down in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility. By the end of 2017 , the maximum leverage ratio will step down to 3.5 in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility. We will take a variety of steps, if necessary, to ensure compliance with the maximum leverage ratio at the applicable measurement dates. The decrease in long-term debt was due to the repayments of borrowing under our term loan and redemption of certain outstanding industrial revenue bonds. At December 31, 2016 , $750.0 million remained outstanding under the Term Loan Facility. The scheduled maturity of the Term Loan Facility is on April 21, 2020. The borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement will bear interest at a floating rate, which will be a base rate or a Eurocurrency rate equal to the London interbank offered rate for the relevant interest period, plus in each case an applicable margin, as determined in accordance with the provisions of the Term Loan Agreement. Our short-term debt, consists of foreign borrowings and our commercial paper program. Foreign borrowings decreased from $87.2 million at December 31, 2015 to $85.5 million at December 31, 2016 while outstanding commercial paper also decreased from $23.9 million to $6.3 million at December 31, 2015 and 2016 , respectively. Our commercial paper program allows us to borrow at rates generally more favorable than those available under our credit facility. At December 31, 2016 , the average effective interest rate on these borrowings was 0.95 percent . See Note 12 in the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for further details. 33 Table of Contents Statement of Cash Flows Cash provided (required) by operating activities was $537.3 million , $(277.1) million and $284.9 million for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The table below presents the components of net cash provided by operating activities. (in Millions) Twelve months ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Income (loss) from continuing operations before equity in (earnings) loss of affiliates, interest income and expense and income taxes $ 421.5 $ (50.2 ) $ 414.8 Corporate special charges and depreciation and amortization (1) 293.4 685.1 320.2 Operating income before depreciation and amortization (Non-GAAP) $ 714.9 $ 634.9 $ 735.0 Change in trade receivables, net (2) (6.1 ) 140.9 (274.7 ) Change in inventories (3) 72.5 78.3 36.2 Change in accounts payable (4) (24.1 ) (292.5 ) (16.2 ) Change in accrued customer rebates (5) (5.3 ) 11.0 34.3 Change in advance payments from customers (6) (10.0 ) 60.6 11.3 Change in all other operating assets and liabilities (7) 86.4 (22.9 ) 61.2 Cash basis operating income (Non-GAAP) 828.3 610.3 587.1 Restructuring and other spending (8) (26.0 ) (34.9 ) (9.5 ) Environmental spending, continuing, net of recoveries (9) (28.1 ) (32.2 ) (17.5 ) Pension and other postretirement benefit contributions (10) (68.7 ) (78.7 ) (68.3 ) Net interest payments (11) (81.6 ) (74.7 ) (61.0 ) Tax payments, net of refunds (12) (62.8 ) (340.3 ) (109.0 ) Excess tax benefits from share-based compensation (13) (0.4 ) (1.4 ) (4.7 ) Payments associated with the Cheminova purchase price hedges (14) (264.8 ) Acquisition legal and professional fees (15) (23.4 ) (60.4 ) (32.2 ) Cash provided (required) by operating activities of continuing operations $ 537.3 $ (277.1 ) $ 284.9 ____________________ (1) Represents the sum of corporate special charges and depreciation and amortization. (2) The changes in cash flows related to trade receivables in 2016 and 2015 were primarily driven by timing of collections. Collection timing is more pronounced in our FMC Agricultural Solutions business where sales, particularly in Brazil, have terms significantly longer than the rest of our businesses. Additionally, timing of collection is impacted as amounts for both periods include carry-over balances remaining to be collected in Latin America, where collection periods are measured in months rather than weeks. During 2016, we collected approximately $650 million of receivables in Brazil. A significant proportion of the collections in Brazil are coming from those accounts that were past due at the start of the year, improving the quality of the remaining receivable balance. (3) The changes in inventory are a result of inventory levels being adjusted to take into consideration the change in market conditions mostly in FMC Agricultural Solutions. (4) The change in accounts payable in 2015 was due to timing of payments including inventory reductions activities across the company, particularly as we integrated Cheminova, as well as adjusting inventory levels in light of current market conditions. These events did not repeat in 2016. (5) These rebates are associated with our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment in North America and Brazil and generally settle in the fourth quarter of each year. The changes year over year are primarily associated with the mix in sales eligible for rebates and incentives in 2016 compared to 2015 and timing of rebate payments. (6) The advance payments from customers represent advances from our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment customers. Customers did not participate in as many pre-payment programs in 2016 as they did in 2015 due to market dynamics in North America. (7) Changes in all periods presented primarily represent timing of payments associated with all other operating assets and liabilities, including guarantees issued to vendors under our vendor finance program. (8) See Note 7 in our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for further details. (9) Included in our results for each of the years presented are environmental charges for environmental remediation at our operating sites of $ 36.8 million , $ 21.7 million and $ 43.7 million , respectively. The amounts in 2016 will be spent in future years. The amounts represent environmental remediation spending at our operating sites which were recorded against pre-existing reserves, net of recoveries. 34 Table of Contents Environmental obligations for continuing operations primarily represent obligations at shut down or abandoned facilities within businesses that do not meet the criteria for presentation as discontinued operations. (10) Amounts include voluntary contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plan of $ 35.0 million , $ 65.0 million and $ 50.0 million , respectively. (11) Interest payments in all periods remained fairly constant. (12) The significant increase in tax payments in 2015 is due the tax paid on the gain associated with the sale of the discontinued FMC Alkali Chemicals division. (13) Amounts are presented as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows, from share-based compensation. (14) Represents payments for the Cheminova purchase price hedges. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more information. (15) Represents payments for legal and professional fees associated with the Cheminova acquisition. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more information. Cash provided (required) by operating activities of discontinued operations was $(39.5) million , $(80.6) million and $88.8 million for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Cash required by operating activities of discontinued operation is directly related to environmental, other postretirement benefit liabilities, self-insurance, long-term obligations related to legal proceedings and historical restructuring activities. Amounts in 2015 included divestiture costs associated with the sale of our FMC Alkali Chemicals business as well as related operating activities. The increase of cash required by operating activities of discontinued operations in 2015 is due primarily to divestiture costs associated with the sale of our discontinued FMC Alkali Chemicals business on April 1, 2015. Additionally, 2014 includes a full year of positive cash flows associated with FMC Alkali while 2015 only includes one quarter worth due to sale date timing. Cash required by investing activities of continuing operations was $(139.2) million , $(1,285.5) million and $(190.2) million for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The decrease of cash required by investing activities in 2016 is due primarily due to the Cheminova acquisition on April 21, 2015 for an aggregate purchase price of $1.2 billion, excluding assumed net debt and hedged-related costs totaling $0.6 billion. Cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations was $4.0 million , $1,634.3 million and $154.9 million for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations in 2016 decreased as a result of the sale of our FMC Alkali Chemicals business which was completed on April 1, 2015 resulting in $1.64 billion in proceeds in 2015 that did not recur in 2016. Cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations in 2015 is directly associated with the sale of our discontinued FMC Alkali Chemicals business. Cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations in 2014 is directly associated with the sale of our discontinued FMC Peroxygens business which was completed on February 28, 2014. The proceeds from this sale were approximately $200 million. Also included in these investing activities was capital expenditures of these same discontinued operations for historical periods up to the point of sale. The decrease in these capital expenditures in 2015 was due to only one quarter worth of Alkali capital expenditures in 2015 compared to a full year in 2014. Cash required by financing activities was $(377.0) million , $(16.7) million and $(349.9) million in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. 2016 vs. 2015 The change period over period in financing activities is primarily due to the repayments of borrowings under our term loan and redemption of certain outstanding industrial revenue bonds. 2015 vs. 2014 The change period over period in financing activities is primarily due to the $1.65 billion we borrowed under our previously announced senior unsecured Term Loan facility. The proceeds of the borrowing were used to finance the acquisition of Cheminova as well as to pay costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition and the term loan facility. Offsetting this borrowing in 2015 was repayments of long-term debt totaling $1.1 billion primarily due to repayments associated with acquired Cheminova long term debt. Additionally short term debt decreased $547 million in 2015 as compared to $140 million in 2014. Additionally in 2014 we paid $98.7 million to noncontrolling interests (primarily to acquire the remaining ownership of our discontinued FMC Alkali Chemicals division) as compared to zero such payments in 2015. 2017 Outlook 35 Table of Contents In 2017 , we expect a continued improvement in cash generation. In aggregate, we expect cash basis operating income to increase driven by higher earnings within each segment partially offset by higher working capital requirements in 2017. We also expect lower restructuring spending and a reduction in spending from completing substantially all acquisition-related integration activities in 2016. We anticipate lower cash taxes in 2017 as compared to 2016. Other potential liquidity needs Our cash needs for 2017 include operating cash requirements, capital expenditures, scheduled mandatory payments of long-term debt, dividend payments, share repurchases, contributions to our pension plans, environmental and asset retirement obligation spending and restructuring. We plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash, cash generated from operations, commercial paper issuances and borrowings under our committed revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2016 our remaining borrowing capacity under our credit facility was $1,376.1 million . Projected 2017 capital expenditures and expenditures related to contract manufacturers are expected to approximate 2016 levels. Projected 2017 spending includes approximately $50 to $55 million of net environmental remediation spending. This spending does not include expected spending on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities or expected spending for environmental compliance costs, which we will include as a component of costs of sales and services in our consolidated statements of income since these amounts are not covered by established reserves. Capital spending to expand, maintain or replace equipment at our production facilities may trigger requirements for upgrading our environmental controls, which may increase our spending for environmental controls over the foregoing projections. Our U.S. Pension Plan assets decreased slightly from $ 1,204.6 million at December 31, 2015 to $ 1,203.3 million at December 31, 2016 . Our U.S. Pension Plan assets comprise approximately 95 percent of our total plan assets with the difference representing plan assets related to foreign pension plans. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included within this Form 10-K for details on how we develop our long-term rate of return assumptions. We made contributions of $ 35.0 million and $ 65.0 million in 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and intend to contribute $40 million in 2017 . Our contributions in 2015 , 2016 and our intended contribution in 2017 are all in excess of the minimum requirements. Our contributions in excess of minimums are done with the objective of avoiding variable rate Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") premiums as well as potentially reducing future funding volatility. We do not believe that the additional contribution in 2017 will have a material impact on our current and future liquidity needs. However, volatility of interest rates and equity returns may require greater contributions in the future. During the year ended December 31, 2016 , 210,000 shares were repurchased under the publicly announced repurchase program. At December 31, 2016 , $238.8 million remained unused under our Board-authorized repurchase program. This repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price targets and may be suspended or terminated at any time. Shares may be purchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. We also reacquire shares from time to time from employees in connections with vesting, exercise and forfeiture of awards under our equity compensation plans. Dividends On January 19, 2017 , we paid dividends aggregating $22.1 million to our shareholders of record as of December 31, 2016 . This amount is included in Accrued and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 . For the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , we paid $88.6 million , $86.4 million and $78.1 million in dividends, respectively. Commitments We provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain FMC Agricultural Solutions customers, principally Brazilian customers, for their seasonal borrowing. The total of these guarantees was $108.7 million at December 31, 2016 . These guarantees arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers and nonconsolidated affiliates. Non-performance by the guaranteed party triggers the obligation requiring us to make payments to the beneficiary of the guarantee. Based on our experience these types of guarantees have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial position or on our liquidity. Our expectation is that future payment or performance related to the non-performance of others is considered unlikely. Short-term debt consisted of foreign credit lines and commercial paper at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . We provide parent-company guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries. We continually evaluate our options for divesting real estate holdings and property, plant and equipment that are no longer integral to our operating businesses. In connection with our property and asset sales and divestitures, we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain liabilities, including environmental contamination and taxes that occurred prior to the date of sale. Our indemnification obligations with respect to these liabilities may be indefinite as to duration and may or may not be subject to a deductible, minimum claim amount or cap. As such, it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made or 36 Table of Contents to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss. If triggered, we may be able to recover certain of the indemnity payments from third parties. We have not recorded any specific liabilities for these guarantees. Our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows: Contractual Commitments Expected Cash Payments by Year (in Millions) 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 & beyond Total Debt maturities (1) $ 94.2 $ 2.3 $ 557.3 $ 496.9 $ 753.6 $ 1,904.3 Contractual interest (2) 62.6 62.5 56.6 31.5 100.8 314.0 Lease obligations (3) 19.5 22.5 22.9 21.4 146.6 232.9 Certain long-term liabilities (4) 4.4 4.4 4.6 4.6 35.1 53.1 Derivative contracts 2.5 2.5 Purchase obligations (5) 9.4 3.8 13.2 Total (6) $ 192.6 $ 95.5 $ 641.4 $ 554.4 $ 1,036.1 $ 2,520.0 ____________________ (1) Excluding discounts. (2) Contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on our long-term debt obligations. We had $ 1.7 million of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at December 31, 2016 . The rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at December 31, 2016 . Variable rates are determined by the market and will fluctuate over time. (3) Before sub-lease rental income. (4) Obligations associated with our Ewing, NJ and Shanghai, China research and technology centers. (5) Purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, price provisions and timing of the transaction. We have entered into a number of purchase obligations for the sourcing of materials and energy where take-or-pay arrangements apply. Since the majority of the minimum obligations under these contracts are take-or-pay commitments over the life of the contract and not a year by year take-or-pay, the obligations in the table related to these types of contacts are presented in the earliest period in which the minimum obligation could be payable under these types of contracts. (6) As of December 31, 2016 , the liability for uncertain tax positions was $121.1 million . This liability is excluded from the table above. Additionally, accrued pension and other postretirement benefits and our environmental liabilities as recorded on our consolidated balance sheets are excluded from the table above. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and periods in which these liabilities might be paid. Contingencies See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Climate Change As a global corporate citizen, we are concerned about the consequences of climate change and will take prudent and cost effective actions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. FMC is committed to doing its part to address climate change and its impacts. We have set 2025 goals that we will reduce both energy intensity and Green House Gas (GHG) intensity for our operations by 15% from our 2013 baseline year. In 2016, FMC's actions to implement best practices in environmental stewardship and climate change action were recognized by CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project). CDP is widely recognized as one of the top environmental data reporting organizations in the world, and over 8,500 companies responded to CDP in 2016. FMC submitted its first-ever response to CDP's climate change program and received an "A-" score, which places FMC in CDP's Leadership scoring category. FMC detailed the business risks and opportunities we have due to climate change and its impacts in our 2016 CDP climate change report. Even as we take action to control the release of GHGs, additional warming is anticipated. Long-term, higher average global temperatures could result in induced charges in natural resources, growing seasons, precipitation patterns, weather patterns, species distributions, water availability, sea levels, and biodiversity. These impacts could cause changes in supplies of raw materials used to maintain FMC production capacity and could lead to possible increased sourcing costs. Depending on how pervasive the climate impacts are in the different geographic locations experiencing changes in natural resources, FMC customers could be impacted. Demand for FMC products could increase if our products meet our customers needs to adapt to climate change impacts or decrease if our products do not meet their needs. Within our own operations, we continually assess our manufacturing sites worldwide for risks and opportunities to increase our preparedness for climate change. We are evaluating sea level rise and storm surge at three of our plants located within 4 meters of sea level to understand timing of potential impacts and response actions that 37 Table of Contents may need to be taken. To lessen FMC overall environmental footprint, we have taken actions to increase the energy efficiency in our manufacturing sites. We have also committed to 2025 goals to reduce our water use in high-risk areas by 20% and our waste intensities by 15%. In our product portfolio, we see market opportunities for our products to address climate change and its impacts. For example, FMC Agricultural Solutions products can help customers increase yield, energy and water efficiency, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions. Our products can also help growers adapt to more unpredictable growing conditions and the effects these types of threats have on crops. FMC Health and Nutrition addresses consumers changing preferences and increased environmental concerns with natural products and differentiated food and health ingredients for healthier lifestyles. FMC Lithium products can be used in energy storage applications, fuel-efficient and electric vehicles, lighter-weight aluminum in the aircraft and aerospace industries. We are improving existing products and developing new platforms and technologies that help mitigate impacts of climate change. Agricultural Solutions is developing products with a lighter environmental footprint in its biologicals products. FMC Lithium is researching new applications of our lithium products in a range of industries. These business opportunities could lead to new products and services for our existing and potential customers. Beyond our products and operations, FMC recognizes that energy consumption throughout our supply chain can impact climate change and product costs. Therefore, we will actively work with our entire value chain - suppliers, contractors, and customers - to improve their energy efficiencies and to reduce their GHG emissions. We continue to follow legislative and regulatory developments regarding climate change because the regulation of greenhouse gases, depending on their nature and scope, could subject some of our manufacturing operations to additional costs or limits on operations. In December 2015, 195 countries at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris reached an agreement to reduce GHGs. It remains to be seen how and when each of these countries will implement this agreement. The United States Environmental Protection Agency Clean Power Plan (Plan) is the U.S. centerpiece for meeting its Paris commitment. Implementation of the Plan has been stayed by the U.S. Supreme Court pending appeals and the legal challenges to the Plan have yet to be resolved in the U.S. federal court of appeals. The Plan gives states flexibility to craft their own programs, so the impact to FMC of the Plan, if implemented, is not estimable at this time. At this point, our U.S. facilities are not subject to any state or regional greenhouse gas regulation that limits GHG emissions. Some of our foreign operations are subject to national or local energy management or climate change regulation, such as our plant in Denmark that is subject to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. At present, that plant emissions are below its designated cap. Future GHG regulatory requirements may result in increased costs of energy, additional capital costs for emissions control or new equipment, and/or costs associated with cap and trade or carbon taxes. We are currently monitoring regulatory developments. The costs of complying with possible future climate change requirements are difficult to estimate at this time.

Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) . The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have described our accounting policies in Note 1 "Principal Accounting Policies and related Financial Information" to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. We have reviewed these accounting policies, identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements. We have reviewed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Critical accounting policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition in accordance with U.S. GAAP and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current conditions and other reasonable factors. 38 Table of Contents Revenue recognition and trade receivables We recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete, which is generally upon transfer of title. This transfer typically occurs either upon shipment to the customer or upon receipt by the customer. In all cases, we apply the following criteria in recognizing revenue: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Rebates due to customers are accrued as a reduction of revenue in the same period that the related sales are recorded based on the contract terms. We periodically enter into prepayment arrangements with customers, primarily in our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment, and receive advance payments for product to be delivered in future periods. These advance payments are recorded as deferred revenue and classified as Advance payments from customers on the consolidated balance sheet. Revenue associated with advance payments is recognized as shipments are made and title, ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer. We record amounts billed for shipping and handling fees as revenue. Costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded as costs of sales and services. Amounts billed for sales and use taxes, value-added taxes, and certain excise and other specific transactional taxes imposed on revenue-producing transactions are presented on a net basis and excluded from sales in the consolidated income statements. We record a liability until remitted to the respective taxing authority. Trade receivables consist of amounts owed from customer sales and are recorded when revenue is recognized. The allowance for trade receivables represents our best estimate of the probable losses associated with potential customer defaults. In developing our allowance for trade receivables, we use a two stage process which includes calculating a general formula to develop an allowance to appropriately address the uncertainty surrounding collection risk of our entire portfolio and specific allowances for customers where the risk of collection has been reasonably identified either due to liquidity constraints or disputes over contractual terms and conditions. Our method of calculating the general formula consists of estimating the recoverability of trade receivables based on historical experience, current collection trends, and external business factors such as economic factors, including regional bankruptcy rates, and political factors. Our analysis of trade receivable collection risk is performed quarterly, and the allowance is adjusted accordingly. We also hold long-term receivables that represent long-term customer receivable balances related to past-due accounts which are not expected to be collected within the current year. Our policy for the review of the allowance for these receivables is consistent with the discussion in the preceding paragraph above on trade receivables. Therefore on an ongoing basis, we continue to evaluate the credit quality of our long-term receivables utilizing aging of receivables, collection experience and write-offs, as well as existing economic conditions, to determine if an additional allowance is necessary Environmental obligations and related recoveries We provide for environmental-related obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability, that estimate has been used. Where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used. Estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ), or similar government agencies, are generally accrued no later than when a Record of Decision ( ROD ), or equivalent, is issued, or upon completion of a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study ( RI/FS ), or equivalent, that is submitted by us to the appropriate government agency or agencies. Estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management, as well as by financial and legal management and, if necessary, adjusted as additional information becomes available. The estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination, required remediation methods, and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties. Our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation and/or study of sites at which we are alleged to have released hazardous substances into the environment. Such costs principally include, among other items, RI/FS, site remediation, costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan, management costs, fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort, and future monitoring costs. Estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies, specific site consultants engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites. Included in our environmental liabilities are costs for the operation, maintenance and monitoring of site remediation plans (OM&M). Such reserves are based on our best estimates for these OM&M plans. Over time we may incur OM&M costs in excess of these reserves. However, we are unable to reasonably estimate an amount in excess of our recorded reserves because we cannot reasonably 39 Table of Contents estimate the period for which such OM&M plans will need to be in place or the future annual cost of such remediation, as conditions at these environmental sites change over time. Such additional OM&M costs could be significant in total but would be incurred over an extended period of years. Included in the environmental reserve balance, other assets balance and disclosure of reasonably possible loss contingencies are amounts from third party insurance policies, which we believe are probable of recovery. Provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income, net of probable and estimable recoveries from named Potentially Responsible Parties ( PRPs ) or other third parties. Such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values. In calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves, we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ( CERCLA ) and the analogous state laws on all PRPs and have considered the identity and financial condition of the other PRPs at each site to the extent possible. We have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated, as well as the status of our claims against such parties. Although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of PRPs and other third parties with absolute certainty, the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a site-by-site basis. Our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties. We believe that any recorded recoveries related to PRPs are realizable in all material respects. Recoveries are recorded as either an offset in Environmental liabilities, continuing and discontinued or as Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with U.S. accounting literature. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for changes in estimates associated with our environmental obligations. Impairments and valuation of long-lived and indefinite-lived assets Our long-lived assets primarily include property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. The determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment, including estimates based on historical information, current market data and future expectations. The principal assumptions utilized in our valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates, operating margin estimates and discount rates. Although the estimates were deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition, those estimates are inherently uncertain. We test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of our property, plant and equipment may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition. In cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets, which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable. The estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices, volumes, costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time. We perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter of each year, or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would require reassessment of the recoverability of those assets. In performing our evaluation we assess qualitative factors such as overall financial performance of our reporting units, anticipated changes in industry and market structure, competitive environments, planned capacity and cost factors such as raw material prices. Based on our assessment for 2016 , we determined that no goodwill impairment charge to our continuing operations was required. The majority of the Brands intangible asset relates to our proprietary brand portfolio for which the fair value was substantially in excess of the carrying value. During the 3rd quarter of 2016, we recorded a $1 million impairment charge in our generic brand portfolio which is part of the FMC Agricultural Solutions segment. The carrying value of the generic portfolio subsequent to the charge is approximately $6 million . See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for charges associated with long-lived asset disposal costs and the activity associated with the restructuring reserves. 40 Table of Contents Pension and other postretirement benefits We provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees and retirees. The costs (benefits) and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions, including interest (discount) rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increase for employees. The costs (benefits) and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions, such as average retirement age, mortality, employee turnover, and plan participation. To the extent our plans actual experience, as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans demographics, differs from these assumptions, the costs and obligations for providing these benefits, as well as the plans funding requirements, could increase or decrease. When actual results differ from our assumptions, the difference is typically recognized over future periods. In addition, the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs (benefits) in future periods. Historically, we have amortized unrecognized gains and losses using the corridor method over the average remaining service period of active participants of approximately eight years. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 95% of the participants in our U.S. qualified plan and approximately 93% of the participants in our U.S. postretirement life plan were inactive. Therefore, for fiscal 2017, we will amortize gains and losses over the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive population for these two plans. The gain/loss amortization period for the U.S. qualified pension plan will increase from about eight years to about nineteen years as a result of this change. We consider this a change in estimate and, accordingly, will account for it prospectively in 2017. For fiscal 2017, the change in estimate from amortizing gains and losses over the expected lifetime of the inactive population rather than the average remaining service period of active participants is expected to reduce US pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost by approximately $18 to $22 million when compared to the prior estimate. In 2016, the Society of Actuaries released an updated mortality table projection scale for measurement of retirement program obligations. We adopted this update in measuring the December 31, 2016 U.S. defined benefit and post retirement obligations. Adoption of this new projection scale has decreased the benefit obligations at December 31, 2016 by approximately $17.7 million . The effect of this adoption will be amortized into net periodic benefit cost beginning in 2017. We use several assumptions and statistical methods to determine the asset values used to calculate both the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans funding requirements. The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a market-related value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a five-year period. We use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans funding requirements. The actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range, high or low, of the actual market value of assets, and is adjusted accordingly. We select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on high-quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date. In selecting a discount rate as of December 31, 2016 , we placed particular emphasis on a discount rate yield-curve provided by our actuary. This yield-curve, when populated with projected cash flows that represent the expected timing and amount of our plans' benefit payments, produced an effective discount rate of 4.22 percent for our U.S. qualified plan, 3.55 percent for our U.S. nonqualified, and 3.77 percent for our U.S. other postretirement benefit plans. The discount rates used at our December 31, 2016 and 2015 measurement dates for the U.S. qualified plan were 4.22 percent and 4.50 percent , respectively. The effect of the change in the discount rate from 4.50 percent to 4.22 percent at December 31, 2016 resulted in a $39.1 million increase to our U.S. qualified pension benefit obligations. The effect of the change in the discount rate from 4.15 percent at December 31, 2014 to 4.50 percent at December 31, 2015 resulted in a $5.4 million decrease to the 2016 U.S. qualified pension expense. The change in discount rate from 4.50 percent at December 31, 2015 to 4.22 percent at December 31, 2016 was attributable to a decrease in yields on high quality corporate bonds with cash flows matching the timing and amount of our expected future benefit payments between the 2015 and 2016 measurement dates. Using the December 31, 2016 and 2015 yield curves, our U.S. qualified plan cash flows produced a single weighted-average discount rate of approximately 4.22 percent and 4.50 percent , respectively. On December 31, 2015, we changed the method we used to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of our net periodic benefit cost for our US defined benefit pension plans. We use a full yield curve approach in the estimate of these components of benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows as we believe this provides a better estimate of service and interest costs. For fiscal 2016, the change in estimate from a single weighted average discount rate to a spot rate approach reduced US pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost by $12 million. In developing the assumption for the long-term rate of return on assets for our U.S. Plan, we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries, including historical market returns, information on the assumption for 41 Table of Contents long-term real returns by asset class, inflation assumptions, and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates. We also consider the historical performance of our own plan trust, which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 8.4 percent over the last 20 years (which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period) as well as other factors which are discussed in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. Our long-term rate of return for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was 7.00 percent , 7.25 percent and 7.75 percent , respectively. For the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in assumptions see our discussion below. Sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions. A one-half percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $ 70.3 million and $ 76.8 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by $ 5.2 million , $ 6.4 million and $ 6.9 million for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. A one-half percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $ 78.5 million and, $ 85.3 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and increased pension and other postretirement benefit cost by $ 5.7 million , $ 6.5 million and $ 7.5 million for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. A one-half percent increase in the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by $ 6.0 million , $ 5.8 million and $ 5.2 million for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. A one-half percent decrease in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by $ 6.0 million , $ 5.8 million and $ 5.2 million for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs (benefits) are found in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. Income taxes We have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the need for this allowance, we have considered a number of factors including future taxable income, the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Similarly, should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made. Additionally, we file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. Certain income tax returns for FMC entities taxable in the U.S. and significant foreign jurisdictions are open for examination and adjustment. We assess our income tax positions and record a liability for all years open to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. We adjust these liabilities, if necessary, upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for additional discussion surrounding income taxes. 42 Table of Contents
