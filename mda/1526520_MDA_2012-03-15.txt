Item 7 Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We are the world largest online travel company, empowering users to plan and have the perfect trip. Our travel research platform aggregates reviews and opinions from our community about destinations, accommodations (including hotels, resorts, motels, B&Bs, specialty lodging and vacation rentals), restaurants and activities throughout the world through our flagship TripAdvisor brand. Our branded websites include tripadvisor.com in the United States and localized versions of the website in 29 other countries, including in China under the brand daodao.com. Our-branded websites globally received more than 50 million unique visitors in January 2012, according to comScore, and we have built a marketable base of more than 20 million members and over 60 million reviews and opinions. Beyond travel-related content, our websites also include links to the websites of our advertisers, including travel advertisers, allowing travelers to directly book their travel arrangements. In addition to the flagship TripAdvisor brand, we manage and operate websites under 18 other travel media brands, connected by the common goal of providing comprehensive travel planning resources across the travel sector. Executive Summary Our financial results are dependent on our ability to drive our click-based advertising revenue and continue to invest in areas of potential growth, including our social, mobile and global initiatives as well as our subscription-based businesses, which include vacation rentals and business listings. We have leveraged our position as the largest online travel company to become a critical partner for online advertisers including hotels, online travel agencies and other travel-related service providers by providing our customers with access to our large audience of highly-qualified, highly-engaged users. The key drivers of our click-based advertising revenue are described below, as well as a summary of our key growth areas and the current trends impacting our business. In December 2011, Expedia, Inc., or Expedia, spun out the TripAdvisor business into a stand-alone public company. This transaction is described in more detail in the section entitled Spin-Off below. Key Drivers of Click-Based Advertising Revenue In the year ended December 31, 2011, 79% of our total revenue came from our core cost-per-click, or CPC, based lead generation product. The key drivers of our click-based advertising revenue include the growth in hotel shoppers, user conversion and lead pricing. Total traffic growth, or growth in monthly visits from unique IP addresses (as defined below), is reflective of our overall brand growth. We continue to refine our ability to track and analyze sub-segments of traffic and its correlation to revenue generation and we believe that hotel shoppers is a more useful indicator of revenue growth. We use the term hotel shoppers to refer to users who view a listing of hotels in a city or visitors who view a specific hotel page. After hotel shoppers, the second driver of our business is user conversion, which is a measure of how many hotel shoppers ultimately click on a CPC link that generates revenue for us. User conversion on our site is primarily driven by three factors: merchandising, commerce coverage and choice. We think of merchandising as the number and location of ads that are available on a page; commerce coverage is whether we have a client who can take an online booking for a particular property; and choice is the number of clients available for any given property, allowing the user to shop for the best price. In summary, our CPC revenue depends on the number of hotel shoppers that we can get interested in a property, whether there is a commerce link available for that hotel shopper to click on for that property and whether there are several commerce choices available for that property, so the hotel shopper can shop around. The other key driver that we look at is the CPC price that online travel agencies and hoteliers are willing to pay us for our leads. Key Growth Areas We do not intend to alter our growth strategy now that we are a stand-alone public company. We continue to invest in areas of potential growth, including our social, mobile and global initiatives as well as our subscription-based businesses, which include vacation rentals and business listings. 35 Table of Contents Social . Our Wisdom of Friends initiative is a core component of our strategic growth plan; 76% of respondents to a recent Nielsen study cited recommendations from people I know as the information source that they trust most. We believe that having a strong social presence drives traffic to and engagement on our sites and improves the sites stickiness amongst the users. As a result, we continue to deepen our integration with Facebook Friend Graph. As of February, 2012, TripAdvisor has offered more than 100 million users (according to Facebook Insights) a personalized and social travel planning experience that enables travelers to engage first with their own Facebook friends reviews and opinions when planning their perfect trip on TripAdvisor. Mobile . Mobile is an investment area that is geared towards creating a more complete user experience by reinforcing the TripAdvisor brand when users are in-market. In the year ended December 31, 2011, we saw strong user uptake, reaching an aggregate of 13 million mobile downloads and approximately 16 million monthly unique users, as measured by our own log files, up from 2 million downloads and 4 million monthly unique users at the end of 2010. During that period, we launched 20 free Mobile City Guides for Android and iOS, offering access to TripAdvisor traveler reviews, as well as suggested itineraries and offline-accessible interactive walking tours. We believe mobile devices, including smartphones and tablet devices, are increasingly used when travelers begin to plan trips. In order to capture an increasing percentage of these users, we have designed our mobile product to be user-friendly and have chosen not to monetize that platform to its full potential at this time. We expect the long-term benefits of a more engaged mobile audience to outweigh the short-term revenue that we could generate from, for example, an increased number of advertisements. Vacation Rentals . This product addresses a highly-fragmented $85 billion dollar per-year industry, according to a 2010 Radius Global Market study. Historically, we have built our supply content through acquisitions, namely our U.S.-based FlipKey and U.K.-based HolidayLettings businesses, but during the fourth quarter we announced partnerships aimed at increasing our supply content. We believe that our nearly 200,000 properties, and our highly-engaged and motivated community, position us extremely well for success. Business Listings . This product was created in early 2010 to allow hotel and accommodation owners to list pertinent information on TripAdvisor, bringing them closer to the traveler and thereby increasing direct bookings. In the year ended December 31, 2011, we saw nearly 80% subscriber growth, reaching our approximately 35,000 Business Listing customers by the end of the year, which is still only around 6% of our current hotel listings on our TripAdvisor branded sites. We intend to expand our sales force and improve features to attract additional customers from our installed base. Current Trends Affecting Our Business Increasing Competition. The travel review industry and, more generally, the business of collecting and aggregating travel-related resources and information, have become increasingly competitive. In recent years, an increasing number of companies, such as search companies Google Inc. and Baidu.com, Inc. and several large online travel agencies, have begun to collect and aggregate travel information and resources. We plan to continue to invest in order to remain the leading source of travel reviews as well as continuing to enhance our content and user experience. Increasing Use of Internet and Social Media to Access Travel Information. Commerce, information and advertising continue to migrate to the Internet and away from traditional media outlets. We believe that this trend will create strategic growth opportunities, allowing us to attract new consumers and develop unique and effective advertising solutions. Consumers are increasingly using online social media, such as Facebook, as a means to communicate and exchange information, including travel information and opinions. Consumers are also increasingly using mobile and tablet computing devices to access the Internet. To address these demands, we have developed and plan to continue to extend the platform to develop mobile and tablet applications to allow greater access to our travel information and resources. In addition, we have made significant efforts related to social networking in order to leverage the expanding use of this channel. 36 Table of Contents Click-Based Advertising Revenue. In recent years, the majority of our revenue growth resulted from higher click-based advertising revenue due to increased traffic on our websites, an increase in the volume of clicks on advertisers placements, and, in 2011, an increase in the average CPC price. Although click-based advertising revenue growth has generally been driven by traffic volume, we remain focused on the various factors that could impact revenue growth, including, but not limited to, the growth in hotel shoppers, CPC pricing fluctuations, the overall economy, the ability of advertisers to monetize our traffic, the quality and mix of traffic to our websites, and the quality and mix of traffic from our advertising placements to advertisers, as well as advertisers evolving approach to transaction attribution models and return on investment targets. Global Economic Conditions. In late 2008 and throughout 2009, weak global economic conditions created uncertainty for travelers and suppliers, and put pressure on discretionary spending on travel and advertising. As a result, our revenue growth slowed in 2009, with a corresponding pull back in sales and marketing and a reduction in general and administrative expenses. Throughout 2010 and into 2011, the travel industry has been gradually improving. With the improved economic conditions, we reaccelerated sales and marketing spending and increased other operating costs to support expansion and have experienced increased click volumes and revenue growth during these periods. Global economic conditions remain uncertain and, as such, our near-term visibility remains limited. Spin-Off On April 7, 2011, Expedia announced its plan to separate into two independent public companies in order to better achieve certain strategic objectives of its various businesses. We refer to this transaction as the Spin-Off in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Non-recurring expenses incurred to affect the Spin-Off during the year ended December 31, 2011 has been included within Spin-Off costs in the accompanying consolidated and combined statements of operations. In connection with the Spin-Off, we were incorporated as a Delaware corporation in July 2011. On November 1, 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, declared effective the Form S-4 with information pertaining to the Spin-Off, which included a preliminary proxy statement for Expedia and prospectus for us and Expedia. On December 6, 2011, at Expedia annual meeting of stockholders, Expedia stockholders approved the Spin-Off, and the related proposals. The Spin-Off was also approved by Expedia Board of Directors on December 6, 2011 and, also in December 2011, Expedia received a favorable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, on the tax-free nature of the Spin-Off. On December 20, 2011, following the close of trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the Spin-Off was completed, and we began trading as an independent public company on December 21, 2011. Expedia effected the Spin-Off by means of a reclassification of its capital stock that resulted in the holders of Expedia capital stock immediately prior to the time of effectiveness of the reclassification having the right to receive a proportionate amount of our capital stock. A one-for-two reverse stock split of outstanding Expedia capital stock occurred immediately prior to the Spin-Off, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. Upon completion of the Spin-Off, Expedia ceased to have any ownership interest in us, and all of our shares of Common Stock were held by the stockholders of Expedia immediately prior to Spin-Off. In connection with the Spin-Off, Expedia contributed or transferred all of the subsidiaries and assets it held relating to the TripAdvisor Media Group, which are comprised of the TripAdvisor Holdings, LLC combined financial statements, to us and we or one of our subsidiaries assumed of all of the liabilities relating to Expedia TripAdvisor Media Group. We now trade on NASDAQ, under the symbol TRIP. In connection with the Spin-Off, and as provided for in the separation agreement between us and Expedia, or the Separation Agreement, we secured financing under a $400 million term loan at the time of our separation from Expedia. Immediately prior to the completion of the Spin-Off, we distributed approximately $406 million in cash to Expedia in the form of a dividend, which was funded from the net proceeds of the financing and any cash on hand in excess of $165 million as of the Spin-Off. The Separation Agreement also provided for a subsequent 37 Table of Contents reconciliation process to ensure the appropriate amount was retained. The completion of this reconciliation resulted in us recording an additional receivable from Expedia of $7 million at December 31, 2011. In addition, as provided for in the Separation Agreement, we extinguished all domestic receivables due from Expedia. Refer to Note 1 Organization and Basis of Presentation and Note 11 Debt in the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements and our debt discussion in the section entitled Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources below for further information on the divestiture accounting and secured financing. Commercial Arrangements with Expedia Businesses Following the Spin-Off, new commercial arrangements with Expedia businesses, including Expedia.com and Hotels.com, were implemented and are described in Note 9 Related Party Transactions in the notes to our consolidated and combined financial statements. The new arrangements have terms of up to one year. In connection with the Spin-Off, Expedia expects to lower its CPC pricing by 10-15%. This change was rolled out throughout the fourth quarter of 2011, and trended towards the upper end of the expected discount range. We expect the decrease in CPC pricing paid by Expedia to continue to negatively impact total revenue for the year ending December 31, 2012 by approximately 5%. Some of this lost revenue may be replaced by advertising revenue from other customers; however, we have not included this in our forward looking revenue assumptions. Segment We have one reportable segment. The segment is determined based on how our chief operating decision maker manages our business, makes operating decisions and evaluates operating performance. 38 Table of Contents Results of Operations Selected Financial Data (in thousands, except per share data) Year ended December 31, % Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Revenue $ 426,045 $ 313,525 $ 212,375 36 % 48 % Related-party revenue from Expedia 211,018 171,110 139,714 23 % 22 % Total revenue 637,063 484,635 352,089 31 % 38 % Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue (exclusive of amortization) (1) 10,873 7,345 4,569 48 % 61 % Selling and marketing(2) 209,176 140,470 105,679 49 % 33 % Technology and content(2) 57,448 43,321 29,331 33 % 48 % General and administrative(2) 44,770 31,819 14,286 41 % 123 % Related-party shared services fee 9,222 7,900 6,910 17 % 14 % Depreciation 18,362 12,871 9,330 43 % 38 % Amortization of intangible assets 7,523 14,609 13,806 (49 %) 6 % Spin-Off costs 6,932 100 % Total costs and expenses 364,306 258,335 183,911 41 % 40 % Operating income 272,757 226,300 168,178 21 % 35 % Other income (expense): Related-party interest income (expense), net 544 (241 ) (978 ) 326 % 75 % Other interest expense, net (153 ) 100 % Other, net (1,254 ) (1,644 ) (660 ) 24 % (149 %) Total other expense, net (863 ) (1,885 ) (1,638 ) 54 % (15 %) Income before income taxes 271,894 224,415 166,540 21 % 35 % Provision for income taxes (94,103 ) (85,461 ) (64,325 ) 10 % 33 % Net income 177,791 138,954 102,215 28 % 36 % Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (114 ) (178 ) 212 (36 %) 184 % Net income attributable to TripAdvisor, Inc. $ 177,677 $ 138,776 $ 102,427 28 % 35 % Earnings Per Share attributable to TripAdvisor, Inc : Basic $ 1.33 $ 1.04 $ 0.77 28 % 35 % Diluted $ 1.32 $ 1.04 $ 0.77 27 % 35 % Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding: Basic 133,461 133,461 133,461 Diluted 134,865 133,461 133,461 1 % Other Financial Data: Adjusted EBITDA (3) $ 322,918 $ 260,963 $ 197,219 24 % 32 % (1) Excludes amortization as follows: Amortization of acquired technology included in amortization of intangibles $ 578 $ 1,080 $ 4,356 Amortization of website development costs included in depreciation 12,438 8,104 5,992 $ 13,016 $ 9,184 $ 10,348 (2) Includes stock-based compensation as follows: Selling and marketing $ 3,216 $ 2,101 $ 1,885 Technology and content 3,931 2,661 2,276 General and administrative 10,197 2,421 1,744 (3) See Adjusted EBITDA below for more information and for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. 39 Table of Contents Adjusted EBITDA To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have provided reconciliations below of Adjusted EBITDA to operating income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. A non-GAAP financial measure refers to a numerical measure of a company historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in such company financial statements. We define Adjusted EBITDA as operating income (loss), excluding depreciation of property and equipment, which includes internal use software and website development, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and non-recurring expenses incurred to effect the Spin-Off from Expedia during the year ended December 31, 2011. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary metric by which management evaluates the performance of its business and on which internal budgets are based. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items that are either not part of our core operations such as the costs incurred in connection with the Spin-Off or those costs that do not require a cash outlay, such as stock-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization expense, which are based on our estimates of the useful life of tangible and intangible assets. These estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on historical costs and other factors and may not be indicative of current or future capital expenditures. We believe that by excluding certain items, such as stock-based compensation and non-recurring expenses, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business and allows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results reported in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation; Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; and Other companies, including companies in our own industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income and our other GAAP results. 40 Table of Contents The following table is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating income for the periods presented: Year ended December 31, (in thousands) 2011 2010 2009 Adjusted EBITDA $ 322,918 $ 260,963 $ 197,219 Depreciation (1) (18,362 ) (12,871 ) (9,330 ) OIBA (2) 304,556 248,092 187,889 Amortization of intangible assets (7,523 ) (14,609 ) (13,806 ) Stock-based compensation (17,344 ) (7,183 ) (5,905 ) Spin-Off costs (6,932 ) Operating income 272,757 226,300 168,178 (1) Includes internal use software and website development costs. (2) Our primary operating metric prior to the Spin-Off for evaluating operating performance was Operating Income Before Amortization, or OIBA, as reported on our Form S-4, filed with the SEC on November 1, 2011. OIBA is defined as operating income plus: (1) amortization of intangible assets and any related impairment; (2) stock-based compensation expense; and (3) non-recurring expenses incurred to effect the Spin-Off during the year ended December 31, 2011. This operating metric is no longer being used by our management to measure operating performance and is only being shown above to illustrate the financial impact as we convert to a new operating metric post Spin-Off. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period data to the current format. Our management has changed the non-GAAP financial measure that we use to measure our operating performance from OIBA to Adjusted EBITDA. Consequently we have reclassified depreciation expense, which previously had resided in technology and content expense and general and administrative expense, and have presented it as a separate line item on the consolidated and combined statement of operations. This reclassification had no net effect on either total operating expenses or total operating income for any period. The table below provides a reconciliation of that reclassification for the periods presented. Year ended December 31, (in thousands) 2010 2009 Depreciation (1) $ 12,871 $ 9,330 Technology and content (10,351 ) (7,743 ) General and administrative (2,520 ) (1,587 ) $ $ (1) Reflects total depreciation expense as reported on our Form S-4, filed with the SEC on November 1, 2011 in our consolidated and combined statement of cash flows. Revenue We derive substantially all of our revenue through the sale of advertising, primarily through click-based advertising and, to a lesser extent, display-based advertising. In addition, we earn revenue through a combination of subscription-based offerings, transaction revenue from our flash sale website, SniqueAway, and other revenue including content licensing. 41 Table of Contents The following discussion of revenue includes references to the number of unique Internet protocol, or IP, addresses that visit TripAdvisor-branded sites each month. This metric is one of the metrics used by us to analyze revenue and is measured using internally developed analytical tools. Each unique IP address is only counted the first time it visits a TripAdvisor site during each calendar month. Our measurement of unique visitors does not include any visitors to our subsidiary sites that are not TripAdvisor-branded, nor does it include any individuals who view TripAdvisor content on other sites. While directionally indicative, unique IP address tracking has recently become less valuable as a revenue growth metric because of the continually increasing diversification of our site traffic and usage, particularly in light of our users engagement with non-hotel based site content, such as restaurants and attractions. As such, we believe that using hotel shoppers as a metric will be a more useful indicator of future revenue growth and we intend to track this metric on an ongoing basis.

A key driver of the increase in click-based advertising revenue was an increase of 29% in monthly visits from unique IP addresses to the TripAdvisor branded sites during the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the same period for 2010 and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the average cost per click rates in 2011. Subscription, transaction and other revenue increased by $22 million or 76% in 2011, primarily due to growth in Business Listings and having a full year of revenue from the 2010 acquisition of Holiday Lettings. 2010 vs. 2009 Monthly visits from unique IP addresses to the TripAdvisor-branded sites increased 47% during 2010, which was the primary contributing factor to the increase in click-based advertising and display-based advertising revenue. Subscription, transaction and other revenue grew in 2010 due to the launch of Business Listings in January 2010, the acquisition of Holiday Lettings in June 2010 and the launch of SniqueAway in September 2010. In addition to the above product revenue discussion, related-party revenue from Expedia, which consists primarily of click-based advertising, is as follows: Year ended December 31, % Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 ($ in millions) Related party revenue from Expedia $ 211 $ 171 $ 140 23 % 22 % % of revenue 33.1 % 35.3 % 39.7 % TripAdvisor and Expedia have entered into new commercial arrangements in connection with the Spin-Off, as discussed in Note 9 Related Party Transactions in the notes to our consolidated and combined financial statements. The new arrangements have terms of up to one year. In connection with the Spin-Off, Expedia expects to lower its CPC pricing by 10-15%. This change was rolled out throughout the fourth quarter of 2011, and trended towards the upper end of the expected discount range. We expect the decrease in CPC pricing paid 42 Table of Contents by Expedia to continue to negatively impact total revenue for the year ending December 31, 2012 by approximately 5%. Some of this lost revenue may be replaced by advertising revenue from other customers; however, we have not included this in our forward looking revenue assumptions. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue consists of expenses that are closely correlated or directly related to revenue generation, including advertisement fees, flight search fees, credit card fees and data center costs. Year ended December 31, % Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 ($ in millions) Cost of revenue $ 11 $ 7 $ 5 48 % 61 % % of revenue 1.7 % 1.5 % 1.3 % 2011 vs. 2010 Cost of revenue increased $4 million or 48% during the year ended December 31, 2011 when compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased data center costs in support of higher site traffic and increased credit card merchant fees. 2010 vs. 2009 In 2010, the primary drivers of the increase in cost of revenue expense were higher costs related to an increase in flight search volume and data center costs in support of higher site traffic. Selling and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of direct costs, including search engine marketing, or SEM, other traffic acquisition costs, syndication costs and affiliate program commissions, brand advertising and public relations. In addition, our indirect sales and marketing expense consists of personnel and overhead expenses, including salaries, commissions, benefits, stock-based compensation expense and bonuses for sales, sales support, customer support and marketing employees. Year ended December 31, % Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 ($ in millions) Direct costs $ 137 $ 88 $ 70 57 % 26 % Personnel and overhead 72 52 $ 36 36 % 47 % Total selling and marketing $ 209 $ 140 $ 106 49 % 33 % % of revenue 32.8 % 29.0 % 30.0 % 2011 vs. 2010 Direct selling and marketing costs increased $49 million or 57% during the year ended December 31, 2011when compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased SEM costs and other traffic acquisition costs. Personnel and overhead costs increased $20 million or 36% during the year ended December 31, 2011 when compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to an increase in headcount to support business growth, including international expansion. 2010 vs. 2009 The increase in total selling and marketing expense in 2010 was due to an increase in online and offline marketing expenses, including SEM, other traffic acquisition costs, affiliate marketing expenses, and higher personnel costs primarily due to an increase in headcount, including personnel added through acquisitions. 43 Table of Contents Technology and Content Technology and content expenses consist of personnel and overhead expenses, including salaries and benefits, stock-based compensation expense and bonuses for salaried employees and contractors engaged in the design, development, testing and maintenance of our website. Other costs include licensing and maintenance expense.

Technology and content costs as a percent of revenue were 9% for 2011, consistent with 2010. As discussed above, all depreciation costs of technology assets, including web servers and purchased and capitalized website and development activities for all prior periods have been reclassified on this Annual Report on Form 10-K to depreciation expense on our consolidated and combined statement of operations as of December 31, 2011. 2010 vs. 2009 The year-over-year increase of $14 million in technology and content expense in 2010 was primarily due to increased personnel costs from increased headcount to support business expansion, including site launches in ten countries, enhanced site features and mobile initiatives, as well as personnel added through acquisitions. General and Administrative General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel and related overhead costs, including executive leadership, finance, legal and human resource functions and stock-based compensation as well as professional service fees and other fees including audit, legal, tax and accounting, and other costs including bad debt expense.

Refer to Note 7 Stock Based Awards and Other Equity Instruments in the notes to our consolidated and combined financial statements for information related to the stock-based award modification charges. As discussed above, all depreciation costs of capitalized assets, primarily consisting of furniture and office equipment for prior periods have been reclassified on this Annual Report on Form 10-K to depreciation expense on our consolidated and combined statement of operations. 2010 vs. 2009 In 2010, the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs, including incentive compensation, as well as an increase in bad debt expense, agency recruiting fees and excise tax. Related-Party Shared Services Fee Related-party shared services fee is comprised of allocations from Expedia for accounting, legal, tax, corporate development, treasury and real estate functions and includes an allocation of employee compensation within these functions. These allocations were determined based on what we and Expedia considered being reasonable reflections of the utilization of services provided or the benefit received by us. Year ended December 31, % Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 ($ in millions) Related-party shared services fee $ 9 $ 8 $ 7 17 % 14 % % of revenue 1.4 % 1.6 % 2.0 % In 2011 and 2010, the increase in related-party shared services fee was primarily due to an increase in accounting, legal, tax and treasury costs in support of international expansion. Depreciation Year ended December 31, % Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 ($ in millions) Depreciation $ 18 $ 13 $ 9 43 % 38 % % of revenue 2.9 % 2.7 % 2.6 % 2011 vs. 2010 Depreciation expense increased $5 million or 43% during the year ended December 31, 2011 when compared to the same period in 2010 primarily due to increased amortization of $4 million related to capitalized software and website development costs. 2010 vs. 2009 In 2010, our depreciation increased primarily due to increased amortization of capitalized software and website development costs of $2 million with the remainder being related to increase depreciation related to servers and leasehold improvements. 45 Table of Contents Amortization of Intangible Assets Year ended December 31, % Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 ($ in millions) Amortization of intangible assets $ 8 $ 15 $ 14 (49 %) 6 % % of revenue 1.2 % 3.0 % 3.9 % 2011 vs. 2010 Amortization of intangible assets decreased $7 million or 49% during the year ended December 31, 2011 when compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to the completion of amortization of $3 million related to certain technology intangible assets and a decrease in amortization of $4 million related to the contingent purchase consideration for the acquisition of Holiday Lettings in June 2010. 2010 vs. 2009 In 2010, the increase in amortization of intangible assets expense was primarily due to a charge of approximately $4 million related to changes in the estimated amount of contingent purchase consideration for the acquisition of Holiday Lettings in June 2010, partially offset by the completion of amortization related to certain technology intangibles. Operating Income Year ended December 31, % Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 ($ in millions) Operating income $ 273 $ 226 $ 168 21 % 35 % % of revenue 42.8 % 46.7 % 47.8 % 2011 vs. 2010 Operating income increased $47 million or 21% for the year ended December 31, 2011 when compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to an increase in revenue of $152 million or 31%, which was partially offset by a corresponding increase to operating expenses of $106 million or 41%, particularly in personnel costs to support business growth and traffic acquisition costs to drive higher revenue. Also included in total operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2011 is $7 million of costs incurred as part of the Spin-Off from Expedia, which will be non-recurring for 2012. 2010 vs. 2009 In 2010, operating income increased primarily due to an increase in revenue, which was partially offset by a corresponding increase to operating expenses, particularly in personnel costs to support business growth and traffic acquisition costs to drive higher revenue. Related-Party Interest Income (Expense), Net Related-party interest income (expense), net is immaterial for all periods presented and is primarily intercompany in nature, arising from the transfer of liquid funds between Expedia and us that occurred as part of Expedia treasury operations prior to the Spin-Off. This income (expense) will be non-recurring for 2012. 46 Table of Contents Other Interest Expense, Net Other interest income (expense), net is immaterial for all periods presented and is primarily interest expense on our term loan and revolving credit facility from the period of December 21, 2011 through December 31, 2011. Refer to the section entitled Commitments and Contingencies below for a current estimate of our expected future interest payments regarding our long term debt. Other, Net Other, net is primarily comprised of net foreign exchange losses for the periods presented. Provision for Income Taxes Year ended December 31, % Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 ($ in millions) Provision for income taxes $ 94 $ 85 $ 64 10 % 33 % Effective tax rate 34.6 % 38.1 % 38.6 % 2011 vs. 2010 Our effective tax rate was lower than the 35% federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings in jurisdictions outside the United States, where our effective tax rate is lower, which was partially offset by state income taxes, accruals on uncertain tax positions, increases in valuation allowances, and non-deductible transaction costs associated with the Spin-Off. The change in the effective rate for 2011 compared to the 2010 rate was primarily due to an increase in earnings in jurisdictions outside the United States and a decrease in state income taxes partially offset by non-deductible transaction costs. 2010 vs. 2009 The 2010 effective tax rate was higher than the 35% federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and accruals related to uncertain tax positions, partially offset by earnings in jurisdictions outside the United States, where the effective rate is lower. Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2011 we had $184 million cash and cash equivalents, and at December 31, 2010 we had $93 million of cash and cash equivalents and $20 million short-term investments. Prior to the Spin-Off, Expedia provided cash management and other treasury services to us. As part of these services we regularly transferred the majority of our domestic cash balances to Expedia and received funding from Expedia for any domestic cash needs. Accordingly, the cash and short-term investment balances presented above consisted primarily of cash and short term investments held in the United Kingdom ($165 million and $106 million as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively) related to earnings we intend to reinvest permanently outside the United States. Cumulative earnings related to undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to indefinitely reinvest outside of the United States totaled $258 million as of December 31, 2011. Should we distribute or be treated under certain U.S. tax rules as having distributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to U.S. income taxes. Cash held is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and British pound sterling. In connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into a new revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of $200 million and have also entered into a five-year, $400 million term loan facility, as discussed below. Immediately prior to the Spin-Off, we transferred approximately $406 million in the form of a dividend to Expedia, which included an estimate of our cash in excess of $165 million. This distribution included the proceeds from our $400 million term loan facility. 47 Table of Contents Historically, the cash we generate has been sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements. Subsequent to the Spin-Off, management believes that our cash and cash equivalents, combined with expected cash flows generated by operating activities and the new revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to fund our ongoing working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements and business growth initiatives, meet our long term debt obligations and commitments, and fund acquisitions for at least the next 12 months. Our cash flows are as follows (in millions): Year ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 218 $ 197 $ 126 Investing activities $ (539 ) $ (140 ) $ (149 ) Financing activities $ 412 $ 4 $ 46 2011 vs. 2010 Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2011, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $21 million or 11% when compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher operating income after adjusting for the impacts of depreciation and amortization, and cash inflows from the Business Listing product, partially offset by an increase in income tax payments and the payment of a contingent purchase consideration of which $3 million affected operating cash and working capital adjustments related to the Spin-Off. Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2011, net cash used in investing activities increased by $399 million or 286% when compared to the same period in 2010 primarily due to a distribution of approximately $406 million paid to Expedia immediately prior to the Spin-Off, higher net cash transfers to Expedia related to business operations between us and Expedia prior to Spin-Off of $30 million and, in October 2011, an acquisition of a common control subsidiary in China from Expedia for $28 million, net of cash acquired, partially offset by a decrease of $27 million in cash paid for business acquisitions and a maturity of a short term investment of $20 million. Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2011, net cash provided by financing activities increased $408 million when compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to our term loan facility borrowing in conjunction with the Spin-Off of $400 million and additional short-term borrowings of $16 million, consisting of $10 million from our new revolving credit facility related to the Spin-Off and an additional $6 million related to our existing revolving credit facility in China. This was partially offset by a payment of a contingent purchase consideration of which $10 million affected cash used in financing activities. 2010 vs. 2009 Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2010, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $71 million, primarily due to higher operating income after adjusting for the impacts of depreciation and amortization, and cash inflows from the Business Listing product, partially offset by an increase in income tax payments. 48 Table of Contents Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2010, net cash used in investing activities decreased slightly due to lower net payments to Expedia and lower cash paid for acquisitions, partially offset by the purchase of short-term investments and higher capital expenditures. Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2010, net cash provided by financing activities was primarily comprised of short-term borrowings of $2 million and excess tax benefits of $2 million. Term Loan Facility Due 2016 and Revolving Credit Facility Related to the Spin-Off Overview On December 20, 2011, in connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into a credit agreement with certain lenders, or the Credit Agreement that provides $600 million of borrowing facilities, including: a term loan facility, or the Term Loan, in an aggregate principal amount of $400 million with a term of five years due December 2016; and a revolving credit facility, or the Revolving Credit Facility, in an aggregate principal amount of $200 million available in U.S. dollars, Euros and British pound sterling with a term of five years expiring December 2016. The proceeds of the Term Loan were used to fund the distribution to Expedia described above and in Note 1 Organization and Basis of Presentation in the notes to our consolidated and combined financial statements. Any loans under our Revolving Credit Facility have been used for general corporate purposes. The Term Loan and any loans under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest by reference to a base rate or a eurocurrency rate, in either case plus an applicable margin based on our leverage ratio. We are also required to pay a quarterly commitment fee, on the average daily unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility for each fiscal quarter and fees in connection with the issuance of letters of credit. The Term Loan and loans under the Revolving Credit Facility currently bear interest at LIBOR plus 175 basis points, or the Eurocurrency Spread, or the alternate base rate, or ABR, plus 75 basis points, and undrawn amounts are currently subject to a commitment fee of 30 basis points. As of December 31, 2011 we are using a one-month interest period Eurocurrency Spread which is approximately 2.06% per annum. Interest is payable on a monthly basis while we are borrowing under the one-month interest rate period. The current interest rates are based on current assumptions, leverage and LIBOR rates and do not take into account that rates will reset periodically. A 25 basis point change in the interest rate on the current Term Loan balance would result in an increase or decrease to interest expense of approximately $1 million per annum. The Term Loan principal will be repayable in quarterly installments equal to 1.25% of the original principal amount in the calendar year 2012, due on the last day of each calendar with the first installment due on March 31, 2012, and 2.5% of the original principal amount in each year thereafter with the balance due on the final maturity date. The future minimum principal payment obligations due under the Term Loan are as follows (in thousands): Year Ending December 31, Principal Payments 2012 $ 20,000 2013 40,000 2014 40,000 2015 40,000 2016 260,000 Total $ 400,000 49 Table of Contents In connection with the Credit Agreement, we incurred debt financing costs totaling $3.5 million, which were capitalized as deferred financing costs. Of the $3.5 million costs, approximately $1 million was recorded in other current assets and approximately $ 2.5 million was reported in other long term assets on the consolidated and combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2011, net of amortization, for the period from December 21, 2011 through December 31, 2011. These costs will be amortized from the Spin-Off date over the remaining term using the effective interest rate method and will be included in interest expense. The Revolving Credit Facility includes $40 million of borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and $40 million for borrowings on same-day notice, referred to as the Swingline Loan. Immediately following the Spin-Off, $10 million was drawn down under the Revolving Credit Facility and is expected to be repaid in full during the year ended December 31, 2012. Prepayments We may voluntarily repay any outstanding borrowing under the Credit Agreement at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs with respect to eurocurrency loans. Guarantees All obligations under the Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by us and each of our existing and subsequently acquired or organized direct or indirect wholly-owned domestic and foreign restricted subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions for controlled foreign corporations, foreign subsidiaries where applicable law would otherwise be violated or non-material subsidiaries. Covenants The Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to: incur additional indebtedness, create liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, engage in mergers or consolidations, sell or transfer assets, pay dividends and distributions or repurchase our capital stock, make investments, loans or advances, prepay certain subordinated indebtedness, make certain acquisitions, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, amend material agreements governing certain subordinated indebtedness, and change our fiscal year. The Credit Agreement also requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum cash interest coverage ratio, and contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default, including a change of control. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Credit Agreement will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of all amounts due under Credit Agreement and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. As of December 31, 2011 we have concluded we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants. The full text of the Credit Agreement, by and among TripAdvisor, TripAdvisor Holdings, LLC, and TripAdvisor LLC, the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and J.P. Morgan Europe Limited, as London agent, dated as of December 20, 2011, is incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as Exhibit 4.2. Chinese Credit Facility In August 2010, certain of our Chinese subsidiaries entered into a RMB 67,000,000 (approximately $10 million), one-year revolving credit facility, or the Chinese Credit Facility, with Bank of America. In June 2011, the Chinese Credit Facility was amended to extend the facility to March 2012 and increase the borrowing capacity to RMB 130,000,000 (approximately $20 million). In December 2011 the Chinese Credit Facility was amended to extend the facility to September 2012. The Chinese Credit Facility was unconditionally guaranteed by Expedia prior to the Spin-Off. This guarantee was subsequently released in connection with the Spin-Off. As of December 31, 2011, there was $17 million of borrowings outstanding under this facility. The facility bears interest based on the People Bank of China base rate, which was 6.56% and 5.81% as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. 50 Table of Contents Commitments, Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table summarizes our material contractual obligations, commercial commitments and outstanding debt as of December 31, 2011: By Period Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years More than 5 years (In thousands) Operating leases $ 14,887 $ 5,616 $ 7,851 $ 1,420 $ Purchase obligations 2,761 1,320 1,096 345 Term Loan (1) 400,000 20,000 80,000 300,000 Expected interest payments on Term Loan (1) 33,115 8,086 14,214 10,815 Revolving credit facility (1) 10,000 10,000 Chinese credit facility 16,734 16,734 Total(2)(3) $ 477,497 $ 61,756 $ 103,161 $ 312,580 $ (1) For a discussion of debt that we entered into in connection with the Spin-Off, see Note 11 Debt in the notes to our consolidated and combined financial statements and the section entitled Term Loan Facility Due 2016 and Revolving Credit Facility related to the Spin-Off above. Interest is currently due and payable monthly under the Term Loan, as we are currently using a one-month interest period Eurocurrency Spread and principal is paid on a quarterly basis. The amounts included as expected interest payments on the Term Loan in this table are based on the effective interest rate as of December 31, 2011 related to the Term Loan, but, could change significantly in the future. (2) Excluded from the table was $13 million of unrecognized tax benefits for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment. We estimate that none of this amount will be paid within the next year. (3) In addition, in connection with the Spin-Off, we assumed Expedia obligation to fund a charitable foundation. The Board of Directors of the charitable foundation is currently comprised of Stephen Kaufer, Julie M.B. Bradley and Seth J. Kalvert. The obligation was calculated at 1.7% of OIBA in 2011 and was fully paid through Spin-Off and will be calculated at 2.0% of OIBA for subsequent years. For a discussion regarding OIBA, see Note 12 Segment Information in the notes to our consolidated and combined financial statements. This future commitment has been excluded from the table above. Certain of our entities were guarantors of Expedia credit facility and outstanding senior notes prior to the Spin-Off. These guarantees were full, unconditional, joint and several, and were released upon the completion of the Spin-Off. Other than the items described above, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2011. Income Taxes We record income taxes under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes. We determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting. Accordingly, we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, as well as other relevant factors. We may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe 51 Table of Contents is more likely than not to be realized. Due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses, future changes in income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results, we make certain judgments and estimates. Therefore, actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates. We record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in a future tax return. The determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position, taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that our tax position, based on technical merits, will be sustained upon examination. For those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. The difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability. The ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. We have not provided for deferred U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to reinvest permanently outside the United States. Should we distribute earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to U.S. income taxes. Due to complexities in tax laws and various assumptions that would have to be made, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. taxes on these earnings. Related Party Transactions Relationship between Expedia and us After the Spin-Off For purposes of governing certain of the ongoing relationships between us and Expedia at and after the Spin-Off, and to provide for an orderly transition, we and Expedia have entered into various agreements, including, among others, the Separation Agreement; a tax sharing agreement, or the Tax Sharing Agreement; an employee matters agreement, or the Employee Matters Agreement; a transition services agreement, or the Transition Services Agreement; and various commercial agreements, which are discussed below. The full text of the Separation Agreement, the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Employee Matters Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement and the Master Advertising Agreement (CPC) are incorporated by reference on this Annual Report on Form 10-K as Exhibits 2.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4 and 10.6 (10.6 filed in redacted form pursuant to confidential treatment request), respectively. Separation Agreement Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, immediately prior to the Spin-Off, Expedia contributed or otherwise transferred to us all of the subsidiaries and assets primarily related to Expedia TripAdvisor Media Group-related businesses. In general, Expedia effected the transfer of TripAdvisor Media Group assets through a series of contributions of relevant Expedia subsidiaries. Similarly, we or one of our subsidiaries have assumed all of the liabilities primarily relating to Expedia TripAdvisor Media Group-related businesses, immediately prior to the Spin-Off. We have agreed to take each TripAdvisor asset and to assume and perform each TripAdvisor liability on an as is, where is basis, and Expedia has made no representations or warranties with respect to any aspect of the TripAdvisor assets or the TripAdvisor liabilities. Other matters governed by the Separation Agreement include provision and retention of records, access to information and confidentiality, cooperation with respect to governmental filings and third party consents, access to property, control of ongoing litigation and indemnification arrangements relating to liabilities of each party. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, we and our subsidiaries have agreed to indemnify Expedia, its affiliates and their respective current and former directors, officers and employees for any losses arising out of any breach of the Separation Agreement, the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Employee Matters Agreement, the Transition Services agreement and any failure by us to assume and perform any of the TripAdvisor liabilities. 52 Table of Contents Expedia and its subsidiaries have agreed to indemnify us and our affiliates and their respective current and former directors, officers and employees for any losses arising out of any breach of the Separation Agreement, the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement, the Employee Matters Agreement and any failure by Expedia to assume and perform any of the Expedia liabilities. We have also agreed to indemnify Expedia against any liabilities relating to our financial and business information included in the proxy statement/prospectus on Form S-4 filed with the SEC on November 1, 2011. In addition, we and Expedia each have generally agreed to bear 50% of the costs and liabilities associated with any securities law litigation relating to public disclosures prior to the Spin-Off with respect to the businesses or entities that comprise TripAdvisor following the Spin-Off, regardless of whether the litigation arose prior to or after the Spin-Off. Following the Spin-Off, we now bear 100% of the costs and liabilities associated with any other litigation relating to the conduct, prior to or after the Spin-Off, of the businesses or entities that comprise TripAdvisor following the Spin-Off, regardless of whether the litigation arose before or after the Spin-Off. Tax Sharing Agreement The Tax Sharing Agreement governs Expedia and our respective rights, responsibilities and obligations after the Spin-Off with respect to various tax matters. Generally, the Tax Sharing Agreement provides that although Expedia will remit taxes payable with respect to our income included on its consolidated income tax returns, pre-distribution taxes that are attributable to the business of one party, including audit adjustments with respect to consolidated periods, will be borne solely by that party. Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, Expedia will prepare and file the federal consolidated return, and any other income tax returns that include Expedia and us with the appropriate tax authorities and will remit any taxes relating thereto to the relevant tax authority. We will prepare and file all separate company tax returns for TripAdvisor and our consolidated subsidiaries, and pay all taxes due with respect to such tax returns for all taxable periods. In general, Expedia controls all audits and administrative matters relating to the consolidated return of the Expedia group and any other income tax return that include Expedia and us. Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we generally (i) may not take (or fail to take) any action that would cause any representations, information or covenants in the separation documents or documents relating to the tax opinion concerning the Spin-Off to be untrue, (ii) may not take (or fail to take) any action that would cause the Spin-Off to lose its tax free status, (iii) may not sell, issue, redeem or otherwise acquire any equity securities or equity securities of the members of our group, except in specified transactions until January 21, 2014 and (iv) during that same period, may not, other than in the ordinary course of business, sell or otherwise dispose of a substantial portion of our assets, liquidate, merge or consolidate with any other person. During this period, we may take certain actions prohibited by these covenants if we provide Expedia with an IRS ruling or an unqualified opinion of counsel to the effect that these actions will not affect the tax free nature of the Spin-Off, in each case satisfactory to Expedia in its sole and absolute discretion exercised in good faith. Notwithstanding the receipt of any such IRS ruling or opinion, we must indemnify Expedia for any taxes and related losses resulting from (i) any act or failure to act described in the covenants above, (ii) any acquisition of our equity securities or assets or those of any member of our group, and (iii) any breach by us or any member of our group of representations in the separation documents between us and Expedia or the documents relating to the tax opinion concerning the Spin-Off. Under U.S. federal income tax laws, we and Expedia are severally liable for all of Expedia federal income taxes attributable to the periods prior to and including the taxable year of Expedia, ended on December 31, 2011. Thus, if Expedia fails to pay the taxes attributable to it under the Tax Sharing Agreement for periods prior to and including the taxable year ended December 31, 2011, we may be responsible for these tax liabilities. Employee Matters Agreement The Employee Matters Agreement covers a wide range of compensation and benefit issues related to the Spin-Off. In general, under the Employee Matters Agreement, Expedia will assume or retain (i) all liabilities with respect to Expedia employees, former Expedia employees and their dependents and beneficiaries under all 53 Table of Contents Expedia employee benefit plans and (ii) all liabilities with respect to the employment or termination of employment of all Expedia employees, former Expedia employees and other service providers. We will assume or retain (i) all liabilities under our employee benefit plans and (ii) all liabilities with respect to the employment or termination of employment of all of our employees, former employees and other service providers. Subject to the transition period through the end of 2011 with respect to benefits under the U.S. Expedia health and welfare plans and flexible benefits plan, after the Spin-Off, we no longer participate in such Expedia employee benefit plans, but have established our own employee benefit plans that are substantially similar to the plans sponsored by Expedia prior to the Spin-Off. Through the end of 2011, Expedia continued to provide benefits under the U.S. Expedia health and welfare plans and flexible benefits plan to our employees located in the United States and we bore the cost of this coverage with respect to our employees. Assets and liabilities from the Expedia Retirement Savings Plan relating to the accounts of our employees were transferred to the comparable TripAdvisor plan as soon as practicable following the Spin-Off. Transition Services Agreement Under the Transition Services Agreement, Expedia provides us, on an interim, transitional basis, various services, including governmental affairs, finance and accounting services, corporate development, legal affairs, systems support and assistance with certain human resources functions, and such other services as to which Expedia and we mutually agree. The charges for these services will be on an hourly rate basis agreed upon prior to the completion of the Spin-Off. In general, the services began on the date of the completion of the Spin-Off and will continue for a period generally not expected to exceed 12 months following the Spin-Off. We may terminate the agreement with respect to one or more services upon 90 days prior written notice. Commercial Agreements Following the Spin-Off, we and Expedia continue to work together pursuant to various commercial agreements between subsidiaries of Expedia, on the one hand, and our subsidiaries, on the other hand. The various commercial agreements have terms of up to one year. Click-Based Advertising Agreements. Certain subsidiaries of Expedia have agreed to continue to purchase click-based advertising, primarily in connection with the check rates feature on our websites, but also including textlink advertising on our websites. The pricing for such advertising will be on a cost-per-click or revenue-share basis. Content Sharing Arrangement. We and Expedia entered into a content license sharing arrangement whereby we and Expedia have agreed to continue providing each other, with certain proprietary and/or user-generated content without charge. We will continue to provide certain subsidiaries of Expedia with proprietary content, including user-generated content, primarily hotel reviews, as well as proprietary ratings and summary statistics. Expedia will continue to provide us with proprietary content, including hotel star ratings, thumbnail images, hotel and flight pricing and availability data.

Relationship Between Liberty and us After the Spin-Off Governance Agreement On December 20, 2011, in connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into a governance agreement, or the Governance Agreement, with Liberty Interactive Corporation, or Liberty, and Barry Diller, the Chairman of our Board of Directors and our Senior Executive. The summary of the material terms of the Governance Agreement set forth below is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Governance Agreement, which is incorporated by reference on this Annual Report on Form 10-K as Exhibit 10.1. On December 20, 2011, in connection with the Spin-Off, Liberty and Mr. Diller also entered into a Stockholders Agreement, or the Stockholders Agreement. Representation of Liberty on our Board of Directors Under the terms of the Governance Agreement: Liberty has the right to nominate up to such number of our directors as is equal to 20% of the total number of TripAdvisor directors (rounded up to the next whole number if the total number of directors is not an even multiple of 5) so long as Liberty beneficially owns at least 16,825,982 of our equity securities (or long as Liberty ownership percentage is at least equal to 15% of our total equity securities); Liberty has the right to nominate one our directors so long as Liberty beneficially owns at least 11,217,321 of our equity securities (or so long as Liberty owns at least 5% of the total of our equity securities); and We will use our reasonable best efforts to cause one of Liberty designees to be a member of a committee of our Board of Directors and, to the extent the person designated by Liberty would qualify as a member of the compensation committee of our Board of Directors under applicable tax and securities laws and regulations, we will seek to have that person appointed to the compensation committee of our Board of Directors. Pursuant to the terms of the Governance Agreement, we will cause each director that Liberty nominates to be included in the slate of nominees recommended by our Board of Directors to our stockholders for election as directors at each annual meeting of our stockholders and will use all reasonable efforts to cause the election of each such director including soliciting proxies in favor of the election of such persons. Liberty has the right to designate a replacement director to our Board of Directors in order to fill any vacancy of a director previously designated by Liberty. Liberty would have the right to transfer this ability to nominate candidates to our Board of Directors subject to the same ownership requirements as Liberty current nomination rights, to its transferee in a Block Sale (as discussed below), provided that the transferee nominees are independent directors and are approved by our Nominating Committee (or equivalent committee of our Board of Directors). In addition, the spun-off or split-off company in a Distribution Transaction (as discussed below) will succeed to Liberty rights under the Governance Agreement, including Liberty right to nominate directors. Contingent Matters The Governance Agreement lists certain actions that require the prior consent of Liberty and Mr. Diller before TripAdvisor can take any such action, which are referred to herein as Contingent Matters. For so long as: In the case of Liberty, Liberty owns at least 14,956,428 of our equity securities and at least 5% of our total equity securities, or the Liberty Condition; and 55 Table of Contents In the case of Mr. Diller, he owns at least 2,500,000 of our Common Shares (including options to purchase Common Shares, whether or not then exercisable), continues to serve as the Chairman of our Board of Directors and has not become disabled, or the Diller Condition (the Diller Condition together with the Liberty Condition are referred to herein as the Consent Conditions); We have agreed that, without the prior approval of Liberty and/or Mr. Diller, as applicable, we will not engage in any transaction that would result in Liberty or Mr. Diller having to divest any part of their interests in TripAdvisor or any other material assets, or that would render any such ownership illegal or would subject Mr. Diller or Liberty to any fines, penalties or material additional restrictions or limitations. In addition, for so long as the Consent Conditions apply, if we (or any of our subsidiaries) incur any indebtedness (other than a customary refinancing not to exceed the principal amount of the existing obligation being refinanced), after which our total debt ratio (as defined in the Governance Agreement) equals or exceeds 8:1, then for so long as the total debt ratio continues to equal or exceed 8:1, we may not take any of the following actions without the prior approval of Liberty and/or Mr. Diller: Acquire or dispose of any assets, issue any debt or equity securities, repurchase any debt or equity securities, or incur indebtedness, if the aggregate value of such transaction or transactions (alone or in combination) during any six month period equals 10% or more of our market capitalization; Voluntarily commence any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of TripAdvisor or any of our material subsidies; Make any material amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws; Engage in any line of business other than online and offline media and related businesses, or other businesses engaged in by us as of the date of determination of the total debt ratio; Adopt any stockholder rights plan that would adversely affect Liberty or Mr. Diller, as applicable; or Grant additional consent rights to any of our stockholders. Preemptive Rights In the event that we issue or propose to issue any shares of Common Stock or Class B Common Stock (with certain limited exceptions), including shares issued upon exercise, conversion or exchange of options, warrants and convertible securities, Liberty will have preemptive rights that entitle it to purchase a number of shares of our Common Stock so that Liberty will maintain the identical ownership interest in us (subject to certain adjustments) that Liberty had immediately prior to such issuance or proposed issuance (but not in excess of 20.01%). Any purchase by Liberty will be allocated between Common Stock and Class B Common Stock in the same proportion as the issuance or issuances giving rise to the preemptive right, except to the extent that Liberty opts to acquire shares of Common Stock in lieu of shares of Class B Common Stock. Registration Rights Liberty and Mr. Diller are entitled to customary, transferable registration rights with respect to shares of our Common Stock owned by them. Liberty is entitled to four demand registration rights and Mr. Diller is entitled to three demand registration rights. We will pay the costs associated with such registrations (other than underwriting discounts, fees and commissions). We will not be required to register shares of our Common Stock if a stockholder could sell the shares in the quantities proposed to be sold at such time in one transaction under Rule 144 of the Securities Act or under another comparable exemption from registration. In connection with a transfer of our securities to an unaffiliated third party, Liberty or Mr. Diller may assign any of its or his then-remaining demand registration rights to the third party transferee, if upon the transfer the transferee acquires beneficial ownership of more than 5% of our outstanding equity securities. If upon the 56 Table of Contents transfer the transferee acquires beneficial ownership of our equity securities representing less than 5% of our outstanding equity securities, but having at least $250 million in then-current market value, Liberty or Mr. Diller may assign one of its or his remaining demand registration rights, which the transferee may exercise only in connection with an offering of our shares of Common Stock having $100 million or more in market value. Inapplicability of Anti-Takeover Provisions to Distribution Transaction or Block Sale Pursuant to the Governance Agreement, we will not, in the case of a Distribution Transaction (as discussed below), implement any anti-takeover provision (including any shareholder rights plan) or, in the case of a Block Sale (as discussed below), will render inapplicable any such anti-takeover provision: The purpose or reasonably evident effect of which is to restrict or limit Liberty ability to engage in a Distribution Transaction or a Block Sale; or The purpose or reasonably evident effect of which is to impose a material economic detriment on us to which our equity securities are transferred in connection with a qualifying Distribution Transaction (and whose shares are distributed to the public stockholders of Liberty) or that would impose a material economic detriment on the transferee in a Block Sale. In addition, our Board of Directors will approve the transfer of Class B Common Stock and Common Stock in a Distribution Transaction or Block Sale (up to a 30% ownership level in the case of a Block Sale) for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, which is the prohibition on transactions with interested stockholders under Delaware state law. In the case of a Block Sale, however, such approval for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL will be subject to the imposition of contractual restrictions on the Block Sale transferee analogous to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL (as further described below). Restrictions on Block Sale Transferee For three years following a Block Sale by Liberty, the transferee will be subject to the following restrictions with regard to us, unless the restrictions terminate early in the circumstances discussed below: An ownership cap set at 30% of our total equity securities of (which would apply to any group of which the transferee or its affiliates is a member), subject to adjustment under certain circumstances; Specified standstill restrictions limiting the transferee ability, at such time as any directors nominated by the transferee are serving on our Board of Directors, to, among other things, engage in proxy contests, propose transactions involving us, form a group (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) or influence our management. These restrictions, other than the prohibition on proxy contests, would terminate if the transferee relinquishes all rights to nominate directors under the Governance Agreement; and Contractual provisions analogous to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL that would prohibit the transferee from engaging in specified business combination transactions with us without our prior approval, acting through a committee of independent directors. The contractual provisions mirroring Section 203 of the DGCL would not apply to the transferee if upon the Block Sale it would not be an interested stockholder (as determined pursuant to Section 203 of the DGCL) of TripAdvisor. However, if these contractual provisions become applicable at the time of the Block Sale, they will continue in effect for the term of the standstill restrictions even if the transferee would subsequently cease to qualify as an interested stockholder (as determined pursuant to Section 203 of the DGCL). The standstill restrictions and 30% ownership cap, as well as the termination provisions, would apply to subsequent transferees of all or substantially all of the shares transferred in a prior Block Sale, but in any event would not extend past the third anniversary of the original Block Sale. With respect to such unaffiliated subsequent transferees of the shares transferred in a prior Block Sale, the statutory (rather than contractual) anti-takeover restrictions of Section 203 of the DGCL would apply subject to the waiver, at the time of a transfer, by us. 57 Table of Contents Prior to the expiration of the three-year term, the standstill restrictions, including the cap on ownership described above, would terminate at the earlier of (i) Mr. Diller and his affiliates actually owning securities representing more than 50% of the total voting power of TripAdvisor or (ii) the Block Sale transferee and its affiliates beneficially owning (as defined in the Governance Agreement) securities representing less than 12% of the total voting power of TripAdvisor and Mr. Diller beneficially owning (as defined in the Governance Agreement) securities representing more than 40% of the total voting power of TripAdvisor. For this purpose, securities actually owned by Mr. Diller and his affiliates will include all of our securities held by Mr. Diller and his affiliates , plus those shares of Class B Common Stock for which Mr. Diller and his affiliates have a right to swap shares of Common Stock (as discussed below) but for which the swap right has not been exercised, minus the securities Mr. Diller and his affiliates currently hold but would need to exchange for the Class B Common Stock in such swap right. The above restrictions may be waived at any time by TripAdvisor, acting through a committee of independent directors. Other Block Sale Provisions Any Block Sale by Liberty within the two years immediately following the completion of the Spin-Off will require our consent and the consent of Expedia. We and Expedia will not withhold our or their consent to such Block Sale if we and Expedia determine in good faith (a) that a safe harbor exists for the Block Sale under Section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, or (b) that during the two years immediately prior to the Spin-Off there were no substantial negotiations with the transferee in such Block Sale regarding the Block Sale. If Mr. Diller does not acquire from Liberty all shares of Class B Common Stock proposed to be transferred in a Block Sale or in a transfer of all of the Class B Common Stock and Common Stock beneficially owned by Liberty through the exercise of his swap rights or right of first refusal under the Stockholders Agreement (resulting in such Class B Common Stock of Liberty being converted into, or exchanged for, shares of our Common Stock before the Block Sale), for a period of two years after the Block Sale, Mr. Diller will have the right from time to time to acquire from us an equal number of shares of Class B Common Stock held in treasury, either by purchase at fair market value, through an exchange of an equivalent number of shares of Common Stock, or a combination thereof. Mr. Diller may exercise this right either alone or in conjunction with one or more third-parties so long as Mr. Diller retains voting control over the Class B Common Stock acquired. Prior to the two year period following a Block Sale, Mr. Diller right to acquire Class B Common Stock from us will be suspended immediately upon the entry by us into a merger agreement providing for a merger that constitutes a change of control of TripAdvisor, and will terminate irrevocably upon the consummation of a tender or exchange offer for securities representing a majority of our total voting power or a merger that constitutes a change of control of TripAdvisor. Certain Waivers During the term of the Stockholders Agreement, without our consent (to be exercised by a committee of independent directors), Mr. Diller will not waive Liberty obligation under the Stockholders Agreement to convert or exchange its shares of Class B Common Stock to shares of Common Stock in specified circumstances. This consent right is not applicable if Mr. Diller no longer has any rights under the Stockholders Agreement. In certain circumstances this consent right will survive a mutual termination of the Stockholders Agreement for a period of up to one year. Termination Generally, the Governance Agreement will terminate: With respect to Liberty, at such time that Liberty beneficially owns equity securities representing less than 5% of our total equity securities; and With respect to Mr. Diller, at such time as Mr. Diller ceases to be our Chairman or becomes disabled. 58 Table of Contents With respect to the provisions governing Contingent Matters, such provisions will terminate as to Mr. Diller and Liberty as set forth under the section entitled Contingent Matters above. Distribution Transactions Liberty will be permitted to spin-off or split-off to its public stockholders all (but not less than all) of its equity ownership in TripAdvisor in a transaction meeting specified requirements without first complying with the transfer restrictions under the Stockholders Agreement, including Mr. Diller tag-along right, right of first refusal, swap right and conversion requirement, and without being subject to the application of certain anti-takeover provisions, as described above under The Governance Agreement Inapplicability of Anti-Takeover Provisions to Distribution Transaction or Block Sale . Such transaction is referred to herein as a Distribution Transaction. The spun-off or split-off company will be required to assume all of Liberty obligations (including the proxy given to Mr. Diller under the Stockholders Agreement) and will succeed to Liberty rights under the Governance Agreement and Stockholders Agreement (including Liberty right to nominate directors). Block Sales So long as Liberty equity ownership in us does not exceed 30% of our total equity securities and Mr. Diller continues to hold a proxy over Liberty shares in TripAdvisor under the Stockholders Agreement, Liberty will be permitted to sell all (but not less than all) of such equity interest in us to an unaffiliated third party, without being subject to the application of certain anti-takeover provisions, as described above under The Governance Agreement Inapplicability of Anti-Takeover Provisions to Distribution Transaction or Block Sale , subject to prior compliance with Mr. Diller tag-along right, right of first refusal and swap right under the Stockholders Agreement, as well as the requirement that Liberty convert shares of Class B Common Stock to shares of Common Stock or exchange them for Common Stock with us before the Block Sale. Such sale of equity interest is referred to herein as a Block Sale. Prior to any Block Sale, Liberty will be required to exchange and/or convert any shares of Class B Common Stock proposed to be transferred in such Block Sale, to the extent Mr. Diller does not acquire such shares pursuant to exercise of his right of first refusal or swap rights, for newly-issued Common Stock (subject to application of relevant securities laws). Relationship Between us, Mr. Diller and Liberty Mr. Diller is our Senior Executive and Chairman of the Board of Directors. Mr. Diller and Liberty are parties to the Stockholders Agreement. Among other arrangements, under the terms of the Stockholders Agreement, Liberty grants to Mr. Diller an irrevocable proxy with respect to all of our securities beneficially owned by Liberty on all matters submitted to a stockholder vote or by which the stockholders may act by written consent (other than with respect to Contingent Matters with respect to which Liberty has not consented), until such proxy terminates in accordance with the terms of the Stockholders Agreement. As a result of the arrangements contemplated by the Stockholders Agreement, as of December 31, 2011, Mr. Diller controlled approximately 62.4% of the combined voting power of our capital stock and can effectively control the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote or for the consent of our stockholders (other than with respect to the election by the holders of our Common Stock of 25% of the members of our Board of Directors and matters to which Delaware law requires a separate class vote). Upon Mr. Diller ceasing to serve in his capacity as our Chairman, or his becoming disabled, Liberty may effectively control the voting power of our capital stock through its ownership of our Common Shares. We are subject to the Marketplace Rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, or the Marketplace Rules. The Marketplace Rules exempt controlled companies, or companies of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company, from certain requirements. Based on the arrangements described above, we are relying on the exemptions for controlled companies from applicable Marketplace Rules. 59 Table of Contents For more information on our relationship with Mr. Diller and Liberty, see Note 9 Related Party Transactions in the notes to our consolidated and combined financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements because they require that management use judgment and estimates in applying those policies. We prepare our consolidated and combined financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with GAAP. Preparation of the consolidated and combined financial statements and accompanying notes requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated and combined financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of the consolidated and combined financial statements. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: It requires us to make an assumption because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time management was making the estimate; and/or Changes in the estimate or different estimates that management could have selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. For more information on each of these policies, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to our consolidated and combined financial statements. A discussion of information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates is below. Recoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill . We assess goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1, or more frequently, if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we will record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise. We have one reportable segment. The segment is determined based on how our chief operating decision maker manages our business, makes operating decisions and evaluates operating performance. We generally base our measurement of fair value of our reporting units on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of our business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach estimates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of us to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. Our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units. 60 Table of Contents We believe the use of discounted cash flows and market approach on a weighted basis is the best method for determining the fair value of its reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and Internet industries; and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis. In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued updated guidance, Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment, or ASU 2011-08, on the periodic testing of goodwill for impairment. This guidance allows companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards. This guidance is applicable for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 with early adoption permitted. On October 1, 2011, we early adopted this guidance and our adoption did not materially impact our consolidated and combined financial statements. Based on our assessment of goodwill as of October 1, 2011 and December 31, 2011 (after Spin-Off), using qualitative factors we have concluded there was no indication of a goodwill impairment and did not find it necessary to perform a two-step goodwill impairment test. Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets . In the evaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset over its fair value. We base our measurement of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of trade name and trademarks, using the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. Based on our assessment of indefinite-lived intangibles October 1, 2011 and as of December 31, 2011(after Spin-Off), we have not identified any circumstances that would warrant an impairment assessment. Definite-Lived Intangible Assets . Intangible assets with definite lives and other long-lived assets are carried at cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of two to ten years. We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group carrying amount and its estimated fair value. We have not identified any circumstances that would warrant an impairment assessment as of December 31, 2011. The use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill, indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets, which could result in impairment or, in the period in which an impairment is recognized, could result in a materially different impairment charge. Income Taxes We compute and account for our income taxes on a separate tax return basis. We record income taxes under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes. We 61 Table of Contents determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting. Accordingly, we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income and the carryforward periods available for tax reporting purposes, as well as other relevant factors. We may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. Due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses, future changes in income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results, we make certain judgments and estimates. Therefore, actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates. We record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in a future tax return. The determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position, taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that the tax position, based on technical merits, will be sustained upon examination. For those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. The difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability. The ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. We have not provided for deferred U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to reinvest permanently outside the United States. Should we distribute earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to U.S. income taxes. Due to complexities in tax laws and various assumptions that would have to be made, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. taxes on these earnings. Stock-Based Compensation TripAdvisor Equity Grants Assumed at Spin-Off All stock-based compensation included in our consolidated and combined financial statements prior to Spin-Off relates to Expedia common stock options and restricted stock units, or RSUs, held by TripAdvisor employees prior to the Spin-Off. The following methods were used to measure the fair value of these awards and we will continue to amortize the fair value thereof as follows for all pre-Spin-Off equity grants: Stock Options . The value of stock options issued or modified, including unvested options assumed in acquisitions, on the grant date (or modification or acquisition dates, if applicable) were measured at fair value, using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Black-Scholes model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, expected term, dividend yield and risk-free interest rates. The expected volatility was based on historical volatility of Expedia common stock and other relevant factors. The expected term assumptions were based on our historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards granted to employees. We will continue to amortize the fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, over the remaining vesting term on a straight-line basis. The majority of these stock options vest over four years. Restricted Stock Units . RSUs are stock awards that are granted to employees entitling the holder to shares of Common Stock as the award vests. RSUs were measured at fair value based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of Expedia common stock at the date of grant. We will continue to amortize the fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term, generally a five-year period, on a straight-line basis. Performance-based RSUs that were granted by Expedia vest upon achievement of certain company-based performance conditions and a requisite service period. On the date of grant, the fair value of the performance-based award was determined based on the fair value of Expedia common stock at that time and it was assessed 62 Table of Contents whether it was probable that the performance targets would be achieved. If assessed as probable, compensation expense was recorded for these awards over the estimated performance period using the accelerated method. At each reporting period, we will reassess the probability of achieving the performance targets and the performance period required to meet those targets. The estimation of whether the performance targets will be achieved and of the performance period required to achieve the targets requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of those changes will be recorded in the period estimates are revised, or the change in estimate will be applied prospectively depending on whether the change affects the estimate of total compensation cost to be recognized or merely affects the period over which compensation cost is to be recognized. The ultimate number of shares issued and the related compensation expense recognized will be based on a comparison of the final performance metrics to the specified targets. TripAdvisor Equity Grants Awards Issued Subsequent to Spin-Off Prior to the completion of the Spin-Off, we adopted the TripAdvisor, Inc. 2011 Stock and Annual Incentive Plan, or the 2011 Incentive Plan. We now participate in the 2011 Incentive Plan as of December 21, 2011, under which we may grant restricted stock, restricted stock awards, RSUs, stock options and other stock-based awards to our directors, officers, employees and consultants. Refer to Note 7 Stock Based Awards and Other Equity Instruments below for further information on the 2011 Incentive Plan. We have issued 32,526 RSUs from the 2011 Incentive Plan, to our non-employee members of the Board of Directors the fair value of which we measured based on the quoted price of our Common Stock at the date of grant (which was December 21, 2011). We will amortize the fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term of three years on a straight-line basis. Restricted Stock Units . RSUs are stock awards that are granted to employees entitling the holder to shares of Common Stock as the award vests. RSUs are measured at fair value based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our Common Stock at the date of grant. We amortize the fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term on a straight-line basis. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive these awards, and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of our original estimates of fair value. In determining the estimated forfeiture rates for stock-based awards, we have periodically conducted an assessment of the actual number of equity awards that have been forfeited to date as well as those expected to be forfeited in the future. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including our attrition rates, the employee class and historical experience. The estimate of stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited requires significant judgment and, to the extent that actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period such estimates are revised. Refer to Note 7 Stock Based Awards and Other Equity Instruments in the notes to our consolidated and combined financial statements for further discussion of stock based compensation and material modification charges related to the Spin-Off. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment, or ASU 2011-08. ASU 2011-08 was issued to amend FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, (Topic 350) Intangibles Goodwill and Other. The guidance in ASU 2011-08 is intended to reduce complexity and costs by allowing an entity the option to first make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of a reporting unit. If entities determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, the two-step impairment test would be required. Otherwise, further testing would not be needed. The 63 Table of Contents amendments in this update are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted, and we adopted ASU 2011-08 on October 1, 2011 for the fiscal year 2011 goodwill impairment test. The adoption of ASU 2011-08 did not have a material impact our consolidated and combined financial statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation on Comprehensive Income , or ASU 2011-05. Under ASU 2011-05, there will no longer be the option to present items of other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders equity. ASU 2011-05 requires entities to present net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements of net income and other comprehensive income. ASU 2011-05 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011 on a retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, we have adopted the presentation requirements of ASU 2011-05. The adoption of ASU 2011-05 did not have a material impact on our consolidated and combined financial statements.
