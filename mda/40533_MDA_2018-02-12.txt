ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in millions, except per-share amounts or unless otherwise noted) For an overview of our business groups, including a discussion of our major products and services, see the Business discussion contained in Item 1. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. On February 12, 2018, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of CSRA for $40.75 per share in cash. The transaction is valued at $9.6 billion, including the assumption of $2.8 billion in CSRA debt. We anticipate financing the transaction through a combination of available cash and new debt financing. We will commence a cash tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of CSRA common stock. The tender offer is subject to customary conditions, including antitrust clearance and the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of CSRA common stock. We expect to complete the acquisition in the first half of 2018. The forward-looking statements contained in Item 7 do not include any estimated amounts for the CSRA acquisition and any associated impacts. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT With approximately 60% of our revenue from the U.S. government, our financial performance is impacted by U.S. government spending levels, particularly defense spending. Over the past several years, U.S. defense spending has been mandated by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA). The BCA establishes spending caps over a 10-year period through 2021. On February 9, 2018, the Congress approved increases to the BCA spending caps and a budget for fiscal years (FY) 2018 and 2019. The FY 2018 defense budget totals $700 billion, which includes $629 billion in the base budget in compliance with the modified BCA spending caps and $71 billion for overseas contingency operations, representing an increase of more than 10% over FY 2017 spending levels. The FY 2019 defense budget totals $716 billion. However, federal agencies and programs do not receive funding at the new levels until the corresponding appropriations bills are approved. The Congress has not yet passed the FY 2018 defense appropriation bill. As a result, we have been operating under a series of continuing resolutions (CRs), which have funded government agencies at FY 2017 spending levels, since the beginning of the government fiscal year. As of the filing of this Form 10-K on February 12, 2018, the current CR, signed into law on February 9, 2018, funds the government through March 23, 2018. We do not anticipate that these CRs will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. The long-term outlook for our U.S. defense business is influenced by the relevance of our programs to the U.S. military funding priorities, the diversity of our programs and customers, our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs, our ability to evolve our products to address a fast-changing threat environment and our proven track record of successful contract execution. International demand for military equipment and information technologies presents opportunities for our non-U.S. operations and exports from our North American businesses. While the revenue potential can be significant, there are risks to doing business in foreign countries, including changing budget priorities and overall spending pressures unique to each country. In our Aerospace group, we continue to experience strong demand across our product portfolio. We expect our continued investment in the development of new aircraft products and technologies to support 26 the Aerospace group long-term growth. Similarly, we believe the aircraft services business will be a strong source of revenue as the global business-jet fleet grows. Across our portfolio, we focus on expanding operating earnings and the efficient conversion of earnings into cash. We emphasize effective program execution and the flexibility and agility to respond to changing circumstances in our business environment, and look for opportunities to drive cost reduction across our business. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION An understanding of our accounting practices is necessary in the evaluation of our financial statements and operating results. The following paragraphs explain how we recognize revenue and operating costs in our business groups. We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which we adopted on January 1, 2017. Prior-period information has been restated for the adoption as further discussed in Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. In the Aerospace group, we record revenue on contracts for new aircraft when the customer obtains control of the asset, which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft . Revenue associated with the group completions of other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) aircraft and the group services businesses is recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of services. Fluctuations in revenue from period to period result from the number and mix of new aircraft deliveries, progress on aircraft completions and the level of aircraft service activity during the period. The majority of the Aerospace group operating costs relate to new aircraft production on firm orders and consist of labor, material, subcontractor and overhead costs. The costs are accumulated in production lots, recorded in inventory and recognized as operating costs at aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot. While changes in the estimated average unit cost for a production lot impact the level of operating costs, the amount of operating costs reported in a given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered. Operating costs in the Aerospace group completions and services businesses are recognized generally as incurred. For new aircraft, operating earnings and margin are a function of the prices of our aircraft, our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft, and the mix of large-cabin and mid-cabin aircraft deliveries. Additional factors affecting the group earnings and margin include the volume, mix and profitability of completions and services work performed, the volume of and market for pre-owned aircraft, and the level of general and administrative (G&A) and net research and development (R&D) costs incurred by the group. In the three defense groups, revenue on long-term government contracts is recognized generally over time as the work progresses, either as the products are produced or as services are rendered. Typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include labor, material, overhead and, when appropriate, G&A expenses. Variances in costs recognized from period to period reflect primarily increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual 27 contracts. Because costs are used as a measure of progress, year-over-year variances in cost result in corresponding variances in revenue, which we generally refer to as volume. Operating earnings and margin in the defense groups are driven by changes in volume, performance or contract mix. Performance refers to changes in profitability based on adjustments to estimates at completion on individual contracts. These adjustments result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract, the estimated costs to complete the contract or both. Therefore, changes in costs incurred in the period compared with prior periods do not necessarily impact profitability. It is only when total estimated costs at completion on a given contract change without a corresponding change in the contract value that the profitability of that contract may be impacted. Contract mix refers to changes in the volume of higher- versus lower-margin work. Additionally, higher or lower margins can be inherent in the contract type (e.g., fixed-price/cost-reimbursable) or type of work (e.g., development/production). CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW 2017 IN REVIEW Outstanding operating performance: Revenue increased to $31 billion with growth in our Aerospace and Combat Systems groups. Operating earnings of $4.2 billion and operating margin of 13.5% increased 11.9% and 130 basis points, respectively, from 2016 . Return on sales increased 60 basis points from 2016 to 9.4% . Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share of $9.56 increased 10.6% from 2016 . Free cash flow from operations was 119% of earnings from continuing operations. $2.9 billion of cash deployed for share repurchases, dividends and business acquisitions, consistent with 2016 . Return on invested capital (ROIC) of 16.8% , 50 basis points higher than 2016 . Robust backlog of $63.2 billion increased nearly $1 billion from 2016 , supporting our long-term growth expectations. Net orders for Gulfstream aircraft increased over 20% from 2016. Several significant contract awards received in 2017 in our defense groups. REVIEW OF 2017 VS. 2016 Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 Variance Revenue $ 30,973 $ 30,561 $ 412 1.3 % Operating costs and expenses 26,796 26,827 (31 ) (0.1 )% Operating earnings 4,177 3,734 443 11.9 % Operating margin 13.5 % 12.2 % Our consolidated revenue increased in 2017 driven by higher volume across our Combat Systems group and increased revenue from aircraft deliveries and aircraft services in our Aerospace group. These increases 28 were offset partially by lower C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) solutions revenue in our Information Systems and Technology group. While revenue increased, operating costs and expenses decreased, resulting in an 11.9% increase in operating earnings and margin growth of 130 basis points. Operating earnings and margin expanded at each of our business groups in 2017 . REVIEW OF 2016 VS. 2015 Year Ended December 31 2016 2015 Variance Revenue $ 30,561 $ 31,781 $ (1,220 ) (3.8 )% Operating costs and expenses 26,827 27,486 (659 ) (2.4 )% Operating earnings 3,734 4,295 (561 ) (13.1 )% Operating margin 12.2 % 13.5 % Revenue was down in 2016 due to fewer G550 and G450 large-cabin and G280 mid-cabin aircraft deliveries in our Aerospace group. This decrease was offset partially by higher C4ISR solutions volume in our Information Systems and Technology group. Operating costs and expenses decreased at a lower rate than revenue declined in 2016 , resulting in a 130 basis-point decrease in consolidated operating margin compared with 2015. Operating margin decreased in the Aerospace, Combat Systems and Marine Systems groups. REVIEW OF BUSINESS GROUPS Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 2015 Revenue Operating Earnings Revenue Operating Earnings Revenue Operating Earnings Aerospace $ 8,129 $ 1,593 $ 7,815 $ 1,407 $ 9,177 $ 1,807 Combat Systems 5,949 937 5,530 831 5,643 886 Information Systems and Technology 8,891 1,011 9,144 941 8,929 895 Marine Systems 8,004 685 8,072 595 8,032 748 Corporate* (49 ) (40 ) (41 ) Total $ 30,973 $ 4,177 $ 30,561 $ 3,734 $ 31,781 $ 4,295 * Corporate operating results consist primarily of stock option expense. Following is a discussion of operating results and outlook for each of our business groups. For the Aerospace group, results are analyzed by specific types of products and services, consistent with how the group is managed. For the defense groups, the discussion is based on the lines of products and services each group offers with a supplemental discussion of specific contracts and programs when significant to the group results. Additional information regarding our business groups can be found in Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 29 AEROSPACE Review of 2017 vs. 2016 Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 Variance Revenue $ 8,129 $ 7,815 $ 314 4.0 % Operating earnings 1,593 1,407 186 13.2 % Operating margin 19.6 % 18.0 % Gulfstream aircraft deliveries (in units) 120 121 (1) (0.8 )% The increase in the Aerospace group revenue in 2017 consisted of the following: Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions $ 246 Aircraft services 118 Pre-owned aircraft (50 ) Total increase $ 314 Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions revenue increased due to additional deliveries of the ultra-large-cabin G650 and mid-cabin G280 aircraft. This growth was offset in part by a decrease in the number of G450 and G550 large-cabin aircraft deliveries as we transition from the production of these models to the new G500 and G600, which are scheduled to enter into service in 2018. We also had three fewer pre-owned aircraft sales in 2017 compared with 2016 (five versus eight). Aircraft services revenue increased, driven by higher demand for maintenance work and the small acquisition of a fixed-base operation (FBO) in 2017. The increase in the group operating earnings in 2017 consisted of the following: Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions $ 238 Aircraft services 8 Pre-owned aircraft 11 G&A/other expenses (71 ) Total increase $ 186 Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions earnings were up due to favorable cost performance and mix of ultra-large- and large-cabin aircraft deliveries. G&A/other expenses were higher in 2017 due primarily to increased R&D expenses associated with ongoing product-development efforts as the group progresses with the certification of the G500 and G600. Overall, the Aerospace group operating margin increased 160 basis points to 19.6%. Review of 2016 vs. 2015 Year Ended December 31 2016 2015 Variance Revenue $ 7,815 $ 9,177 $ (1,362 ) (14.8 )% Operating earnings 1,407 1,807 (400 ) (22.1 )% Operating margin 18.0 % 19.7 % Gulfstream aircraft deliveries (in units) 121 152 (31) (20.4 )% 30 The Aerospace group revenue and operating earnings decreased in 2016 due primarily to fewer G550 and G450 large-cabin and G280 mid-cabin aircraft deliveries. Operating earnings also decreased in 2016 due to a supplier settlement received in 2015 associated with aircraft component design and delivery delays. Partially offsetting these decreases, the group aircraft services revenue and operating earnings increased driven by higher demand for maintenance work and the acquisition of an aircraft management and charter services provider in 2016. Aircraft services operating earnings were particularly strong in 2016 due to a favorable mix of work and labor efficiencies. Additionally, the group 2016 operating earnings were impacted favorably by lower G&A/other expenses as a result of cost savings initiatives. Overall, the Aerospace group operating margin decreased 170 basis points to 18%. 2018 Outlook We expect the Aerospace group 2018 revenue to increase between 2 and 3% from 2017 . Operating margin is expected to be 18%, down slightly from 2017 as a result of mix shift as the group transitions to the new G500 and G600 aircraft as well as higher pre-owned aircraft sales. COMBAT SYSTEMS Review of 2017 vs. 2016 Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 Variance Revenue $ 5,949 $ 5,530 $ 419 7.6 % Operating earnings 937 831 106 12.8 % Operating margin 15.8 % 15.0 % The increase in the Combat Systems group revenue in 2017 consisted of the following: U.S. military vehicles $ 250 Weapons systems and munitions 144 International military vehicles 25 Total increase $ 419 Revenue was up across the Combat Systems group in 2017 . Revenue from U.S. military vehicles increased due to higher volume on the Army Abrams and Stryker programs, including work to produce Abrams M1A2 System Enhancement Package Version 3 (SEPv3) tanks and upgrade Stryker vehicles with an integrated 30-millimeter cannon and additional upgrades. Weapons systems and munitions revenue was up due primarily to increased production of several products, including bombs and Hydra-70 rockets for the U.S. government. Revenue from international military vehicles increased due to the ramp up in production on the British AJAX armoured fighting vehicle program and several international light armored vehicle (LAV) programs, offset largely by lower revenue on a large combat-vehicle contract in the Middle East as the group transitions from engineering to production. The Combat Systems group operating margin increased 80 basis points driven by improved operating performance across the group portfolio. Operating earnings in 2016 included the impact of a loss on the design and development phase of the AJAX program. 31 Review of 2016 vs. 2015 Year Ended December 31 2016 2015 Variance Revenue $ 5,530 $ 5,643 $ (113 ) (2.0 )% Operating earnings 831 886 (55 ) (6.2 )% Operating margin 15.0 % 15.7 % The Combat Systems group revenue decreased in 2016 due primarily to lower international military vehicles revenue driven by decreased volume on the large combat-vehicle contract in the Middle East and the timing of work on the group contract to upgrade and modernize LAV III combat vehicles for the Canadian Army. These decreases were offset partially by higher volume on the group contract to deliver Piranha vehicles to the Danish Ministry of Defense. The Combat Systems group operating margin decreased 70 basis points in 2016 due primarily to the loss on the design and development phase of the AJAX program. The impact of this loss was offset partially by favorable contract mix and improved operating performance. 2018 Outlook We expect the Combat Systems group 2018 revenue to increase between 3 and 4% from 2017. Operating margin is expected to be in the mid- to high-15% range. INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY Review of 2017 vs. 2016 Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 Variance Revenue $ 8,891 $ 9,144 $ (253 ) (2.8 )% Operating earnings 1,011 941 70 7.4 % Operating margin 11.4 % 10.3 % The change in the Information Systems and Technology group revenue in 2017 consisted of the following: C4ISR solutions $ (235 ) Information technology (IT) services (18 ) Total decrease $ (253 ) C4ISR solutions revenue decreased as a result of funding delays across a number of programs, including the Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T) mobile communications network and Common Hardware Systems-4 (CHS-4) computing and communications equipment programs, caused by the seven-month FY 2017 CR. Revenue decreased slightly in our IT services business due to delays in procurement activities across a number of programs, particularly in our federal civilian business, offset largely by the acquisition in late 2017 of a provider of mission-critical support services. Despite the lower revenue, operating earnings increased, and operating margin expanded 110 basis points. The margin growth was driven primarily by strong program performance and favorable contract mix across the portfolio. 32 Review of 2016 vs. 2015 Year Ended December 31 2016 2015 Variance Revenue $ 9,144 $ 8,929 $ 215 2.4 % Operating earnings 941 895 46 5.1 % Operating margin 10.3 % 10.0 % Revenue in the Information Systems and Technology group was up in 2016 driven by higher volume across the C4ISR solutions business, including the WIN-T program and several programs in Canada and the United Kingdom. Revenue decreased in our IT services business driven by lower volume on our health solutions programs, including less contact-center services work for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The group operating margin increased 30 basis points in 2016 driven primarily by improved operating performance. Operating earnings in 2015 included a gain of $23 on the sale of a commercial cyber security product business. Excluding the impact of this gain on the prior-year period, the group operating margin increased 50 basis points in 2016 . 2018 Outlook We expect the Information Systems and Technology group 2018 revenue to increase between 5 and 6% from 2017 , with operating margin around 11%. MARINE SYSTEMS Review of 2017 vs. 2016 Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 Variance Revenue $ 8,004 $ 8,072 $ (68 ) (0.8 )% Operating earnings 685 595 90 15.1 % Operating margin 8.6 % 7.4 % The change in the Marine Systems group revenue in 2017 consisted of the following: Commercial ship construction $ (253 ) U.S. Navy ship construction (66 ) U.S. Navy ship engineering, repair and other services 251 Total decrease $ (68 ) Revenue was down from Jones Act commercial ship construction following the delivery of six ships in 2016 and two ships in 2017. Revenue from U.S. Navy ship construction decreased due to timing on the Virginia-class submarine program offset partially by higher volume on the Navy Expeditionary Sea Base (ESB) program. Revenue from U.S. Navy ship engineering, repair and other services increased in 2017 due primarily to additional work related to the Columbia-class submarine development program and Virginia-class submarine design enhancements, and a higher volume of submarine repair work. The Marine Systems group operating margin increased 120 basis points due primarily to the 2016 impact of cost growth associated with the restart of the Navy DDG-51 program. The group operating margin was also affected favorably in 2017 by a decrease in lower-margin commercial ship work. 33 Review of 2016 vs. 2015 Year Ended December 31 2016 2015 Variance Revenue $ 8,072 $ 8,032 $ 40 0.5 % Operating earnings 595 748 (153 ) (20.5 )% Operating margin 7.4 % 9.3 % Revenue increased in the Marine Systems group in 2016 due primarily to additional development work on the Columbia-class submarine program, offset partially by lower Jones Act commercial ship construction volume. Operating margin decreased 190 basis points in 2016 due to the DDG-51 program cost growth discussed above. Additionally, operating earnings in 2015 benefited from favorable cost performance on Block III of the Virginia-class submarine program. 2018 Outlook We expect the Marine Systems group 2018 revenue to increase between 5 and 6% from 2017. Operating margin is expected to be in the mid- to high-8% range. CORPORATE Corporate costs totaled $49 in 2017 , $40 in 2016 and $41 in 2015 and consisted primarily of stock option expense. Corporate operating costs in 2018 will be impacted by the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2017-07 on January 1, 2018. ASU 2017-07 requires the non-service cost components of pension and other post-retirement benefit cost (e.g., interest cost) to be reported in other income (expense) in the income statement. In our three defense groups, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs are allocable contract costs. For these groups, we will report the adjustment for the non-service cost components in Corporate operating results. This amount will offset our stock option expense, resulting in expected Corporate operating costs in 2018 of essentially zero. For further discussion of the adoption of ASU 2017-07, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. OTHER INFORMATION PRODUCT AND SERVICE REVENUE AND OPERATING COSTS Review of 2017 vs. 2016 Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 Variance Revenue: Products $ 19,016 $ 19,010 $ 6 % Services 11,957 11,551 406 3.5 % Operating Costs: Products $ 14,799 $ 15,159 $ (360 ) (2.4 )% Services 9,987 9,746 241 2.5 % 34 The increase in product revenue in 2017 consisted of the following: Military vehicle production $ 261 Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions 246 Ship construction (310 ) C4ISR products (173 ) Other, net (18 ) Total increase $ 6 Military vehicle production revenue increased due to higher volume on the U.S. Army Abrams and Stryker programs and the ramp up in production on the AJAX and several international LAV programs. Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions revenue increased due to additional deliveries of the ultra-large-cabin G650 and mid-cabin G280 aircraft. These increases were offset largely by decreased ship construction revenue driven by timing on the Virginia-class submarine program and reduced Jones Act commercial ship construction volume, and decreased revenue from C4ISR products driven by funding delays caused by the extended FY 2017 CR. While product revenue was steady in 2017, product operating costs decreased due to strong operating performance in our Aerospace and Information Systems and Technology groups and the impact of DDG-51 program cost growth in 2016 in our Marine Systems group. The increase in service revenue in 2017 consisted of the following: Ship engineering, repair and other services $ 243 Aircraft services 118 Other, net 45 Total increase $ 406 Revenue from ship engineering, repair and other services increased due primarily to additional work related to the Columbia-class submarine development program and Virginia-class submarine design enhancements, and a higher volume of submarine repair work. Aircraft services revenue increased driven by higher demand for maintenance work and the acquisition of an FBO in 2017. Service operating costs increased in 2017 at a lower rate than revenue due primarily to strong operating performance in our Information Systems and Technology group. Review of 2016 vs. 2015 Year Ended December 31 2016 2015 Variance Revenue: Products $ 19,010 $ 20,477 $ (1,467 ) (7.2 )% Services 11,551 11,304 247 2.2 % Operating Costs: Products $ 15,159 $ 15,986 $ (827 ) (5.2 )% Services 9,746 9,563 183 1.9 % 35 The change in product revenue in 2016 consisted of the following: Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions $ (1,423 ) Ship construction (225 ) C4ISR products 206 Other, net (25 ) Total decrease $ (1,467 ) Product revenue decreased due primarily to fewer G550 and G450 large-cabin and G280 mid-cabin aircraft deliveries, and decreased Jones Act commercial ship construction volume. Revenue from C4ISR products increased due primarily to higher volume on the WIN-T program. Product operating costs decreased at a lower rate than revenue declined in 2016 due to DDG-51 program cost growth in our Marine Systems group. Additionally, 2015 benefited from favorable cost performance on Block III of the Virginia-class submarine program in our Marine Systems group and a supplier settlement received in our Aerospace group. The increase in service revenue in 2016 consisted of the following: Ship engineering, repair and other services $ 264 Other, net (17 ) Total increase $ 247 Service revenue increased due primarily to additional development work on the Columbia-class submarine program. Service operating costs increased in 2016 consistent with the higher volume described above. G&A EXPENSES As a percentage of revenue, G&A expenses were 6.5% in 2017 , 6.3% in 2016 and 6.1% in 2015 . We expect G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2018 to be generally consistent with 2017 . INTEREST, NET Net interest expense was $103 in 2017 , $91 in 2016 and $83 in 2015 . The increase in 2017 was due primarily to a $500 net increase in long-term debt beginning in the third quarter of 2016. We expect 2018 net interest expense to be approximately $115. The increase from 2017 is due primarily to slightly higher interest rates on the $1 billion of fixed-rate notes issued in 2017 compared with the $900 of fixed-rate notes that matured in 2017. See Note K to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information regarding our debt obligations, including interest rates. OTHER, NET Net other income was $3 in 2017 , $13 in 2016 and $7 in 2015 . In 2018 , we expect net other expense to be approximately $60 due primarily to the adoption of ASU 2017-07, which requires the non-service cost components of pension and other post-retirement benefit cost to be reported in other income (expense) in the income statement. For further discussion of the adoption of ASU 2017-07, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 36 PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX, NET Our effective tax rate was 28.6% in 2017 , 26.7% in 2016 and 28% in 2015 . The effective tax rate in 2017 includes a $119 unfavorable impact, or 290 basis points, resulting from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017 (tax reform). The primary impact of the change in tax law was the remeasurement of our U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities at the tax rate expected to apply when the temporary differences are realized/settled (remeasured at a rate of 21% versus 35% for the majority of our deferred tax assets and liabilities). The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2016 was due to increased international activity, as well as excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation recognized as an income tax benefit in accordance with ASU 2016-09. We adopted ASU 2016-09 on a prospective basis beginning in 2016. For further discussion, including a reconciliation of our effective tax rate from the statutory federal rate, see Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. For 2018 , we anticipate a full-year effective tax rate of approximately 19% . The expected decrease from 2017 is due primarily to the reduction of the U.S. corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning on January 1, 2018, and the net impact of other tax reform provisions, notably a lower tax rate on income earned from foreign sales of U.S.-produced goods and services. However, the 2017 tax reform eliminated certain tax benefits under the prior tax law, including the domestic production deduction. Further, our non-U.S. businesses, which previously provided a benefit to our effective tax rate, operate in jurisdictions with statutory tax rates that are now similar to the U.S., and in some cases higher. For these reasons, while we continue to expect an effective tax rate slightly below the statutory rate, the difference between the rates is expected to narrow under the new tax law. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAX In 2013, we settled litigation with the U.S. Navy related to the terminated A-12 aircraft contract in the company former tactical military aircraft business. In connection with the settlement, we released some rights to reimbursement of costs on ships under contract at our Bath, Maine, shipyard. As we progressed through the shipbuilding process, we determined that the cost associated with this settlement was greater than anticipated. Therefore, in 2016, we recognized an $84 loss, net of tax, to adjust the previously-recognized settlement value. In addition, we recognized a $10 loss, net of tax, in 2016 related to an environmental matter associated with a former operation of the company. In 2015, we completed the sale of our axle business in the Combat Systems group. In 2016, we recognized a final adjustment of $13 to the loss on the sale of this business. 37 BACKLOG AND ESTIMATED POTENTIAL CONTRACT VALUE Our total backlog, including funded and unfunded portions, was $63.2 billion at the end of 2017 , up 1.6% from $62.2 billion at the end of 2016 . Our total backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations under contracts that meet the criteria in ASC Topic 606 as discussed in Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Our total estimated contract value, which combines total backlog with estimated potential contract value, was $88 billion on December 31, 2017 . AEROSPACE Aerospace funded backlog represents new aircraft and custom completion orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from customers. Unfunded backlog consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services. The group ended 2017 with backlog of $12.5 billion compared with $13.2 billion at year-end 2016 . 38 Orders in 2017 reflected solid demand across our product and services portfolio with especially strong orders in the fourth quarter of 2017. The book-to-bill ratio (orders divided by revenue) was one-to-one for Gulfstream aircraft in 2017. We received orders for all models of in-production Gulfstream aircraft, as well as additional orders for the G500 and G600 aircraft. Beyond total backlog, estimated potential contract value in the Aerospace group was $2 billion on December 31, 2017 , down slightly from $2.1 billion at year-end 2016 . Estimated potential contract value represents primarily options to purchase new aircraft and long-term aircraft services agreements. Demand for Gulfstream aircraft remains strong across customer types and geographic regions, generating orders from public and privately held companies, individuals, and governments around the world. Geographically, U.S. customers represented 55% of the group orders in 2017 and approximately 45% of the group backlog on December 31, 2017 , demonstrating continued strong domestic demand. DEFENSE GROUPS The total backlog in our three defense groups represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts. The funded portion of this backlog includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the U.S. Congress and funded by customers, as well as commitments by international customers that are approved and funded similarly by their governments. We have included in total backlog firm contracts at the amounts that we believe are likely to receive funding, but there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide the same funding level currently anticipated for a given program. Estimated potential contract value in our defense groups includes unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts and work awarded on unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts. Contract options in our defense business represent agreements to perform additional work under existing contracts at the election of the customer. We recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order. For IDIQ contracts, we evaluate the amount of funding we expect to receive and include this amount in our estimated potential contract value. This amount is often less than the total IDIQ contract value, particularly when the contract has multiple awardees. The actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower than our estimate of potential contract value. Total backlog in our defense groups was $50.7 billion on December 31, 2017 , up 3.5% from $49 billion at the end of 2016 , driven by a $5.1 billion contract awarded by the U.S. Navy to complete the design and prototype development of the Columbia-class submarine. Estimated potential contract value was $22.8 billion on December 31, 2017 , compared with $22.9 billion at year-end 2016 . 39 COMBAT SYSTEMS The Combat Systems group total backlog was $17.6 billion at the end of 2017 , down slightly from $17.8 billion at year-end 2016 . The group backlog includes the amount of work remaining on two significant multi-year contracts awarded in 2014: $5.9 billion to provide wheeled armored vehicles and logistics support to a Middle Eastern customer through 2024. $4.1 billion from the U.K. Ministry of Defence to produce AJAX armoured fighting vehicles scheduled for delivery to the British Army through 2024 and related in-service support. The group also has additional international military vehicle production contracts in backlog, notably: $540 for LAVs for several non-U.S. customers, including $350 for the upgrade and modernization of LAV III combat vehicles for the Canadian Army. $430 to produce over 300 armored personnel carriers for the Danish Defence Acquisition and Logistics Organization. $355 to upgrade Duro tactical vehicles for the Swiss government through 2022. $190 to produce Piranha 3+ vehicles in five variants and provide associated program support for an international customer. The group received $1.9 billion of orders for Abrams main battle tank modernization and upgrade programs for the Army and U.S. allies in 2017 , ending the year with backlog of $2.1 billion. For the Army, backlog included $620 to produce M1A2 SEPv3 tanks, deliver M1A2 SEP components, and provide associated program support, and $365 to design and develop SEPv4 prototypes with upgraded sensors . For U.S. allies, backlog included $825 to modernize Abrams main battle tanks for Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. An additional $870 for Abrams tank programs is included in our estimated potential contract value at year-end. The U.S. Army Stryker wheeled combat-vehicle program represented $510 of the group backlog on December 31, 2017 , with vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2019. The group received $500 of Stryker orders in 2017 , including awards to produce double-V-hull vehicles, upgrade vehicles with an integrated 30-millimeter cannon and provide support and engineering services. 40 The Combat Systems group backlog on December 31, 2017 , also included $2.6 billion for multiple weapons systems and munitions programs, including $360 to produce Hydra-70 rockets for the Army. The group estimated potential contract value was $3.2 billion on December 31, 2017 , compared with $4.7 billion at year-end 2016 . Estimated potential contract value decreased in 2017 due to a customer-directed restructuring of a combat-vehicle contract in the Middle East. INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY Unlike our other defense businesses, the Information Systems and Technology group backlog consists of thousands of contracts and is reconstituted each year with new programs and task order awards. The group total backlog was $8.9 billion at the end of 2017 , up 4.8% from $8.5 billion at year-end 2016 . This amount does not include $14.9 billion of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of IDIQ contracts and unexercised options on December 31, 2017 . Funding of IDIQ contracts and options added $4.6 billion to the group backlog in 2017 , over 50% of the group orders. In 2017, the group achieved a book-to-bill ratio of one-to-one or higher for the fourth consecutive year driven by several significant contract awards during the year, including the following: $590 from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for contact center services and cloud hosting support, with $275 remaining in backlog at year-end 2017 . $415 from the U.K. Ministry of Defence to design and develop the next-generation tactical communication and information system in the initial phase of the U.K. Morpheus program. $310 from the U.S. Army for computing and communications equipment under the CHS-4 program. $340 of estimated potential contract value remains under this IDIQ contract. The group backlog at year-end 2017 also included the following key programs: $815 for the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Project (MHP) to provide integrated mission systems, training and support for Canadian marine helicopters. 41 $445 of support and modernization work for the intelligence community, the DoD and the Department of Homeland Security, including the New Campus East, U.S. Naval Air Warfare Center, Enterprise Transport and St. Elizabeths campus infrastructure programs. $415 for combat and seaframe control systems for U.S. Navy Independence-variant Littoral Combat Ships (LCS). $320 for the WIN-T mobile communications network program. The group received $305 of orders in 2017 for additional Increment 2 equipment. $300 to provide supply chain management services to the U.S. Department of State. $260 to provide fire control system modifications for ballistic-missile (SSBN) submarines. $200 for long-term support and capability upgrades for the U.K. Bowman tactical communication system. MARINE SYSTEMS The Marine Systems group backlog consists of long-term submarine and surface ship construction programs, as well as numerous engineering and repair contracts. The group book-to-bill ratio exceeded one-to-one in 2017 , resulting in backlog growth of 6.6% from $22.7 billion at year-end 2016 to $24.2 billion at the end of 2017 . The Virginia-class submarine program was the company largest program in 2017 and the largest contract in the company backlog. The group backlog at year-end 2017 included $11.2 billion for 13 Virginia-class submarines scheduled for delivery through 2023. Navy destroyer programs represented $4 billion of the group backlog at year-end 2017 . We have construction contracts for seven DDG-51 destroyers scheduled for delivery through 2024. Backlog at year-end 2017 also included two ships under the DDG-1000 program scheduled for delivery in 2018 and 2020, respectively. The Marine Systems group backlog on December 31, 2017 , included $245 for construction of ESB auxiliary support ships. The group has delivered three ships in the program, and construction is underway on the fourth and fifth ships, scheduled for delivery in early 2018 and 2019, respectively. 42 In 2016, we were awarded a design and construction contract for the lead ship in the Navy new class of fleet oilers, the John Lewis class (TAO-205), along with options for five additional ships . At year-end 2017 , backlog included $670 for the program, and estimated potential contract value included $2.2 billion for the options. The year-end backlog also included two liquefied natural gas (LNG)-capable Jones Act ships for a commercial customer scheduled for delivery through 2020. Complementing these ship construction programs, engineering services represented approximately $6.5 billion of the Marine Systems group backlog on December 31, 2017 . Design and development efforts on the Columbia-class submarine program represented $5.3 billion of this amount, driven by $5.1 billion awarded in 2017 to complete the design and prototype development of the Columbia-class submarine. An additional $1.2 billion is included in our estimated potential contract value at year end, representing materials to be provisioned on the contract. Year-end backlog for ship and submarine maintenance, repair and other services totaled $1.1 billion , including $780 for surface-ship repair operations. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We place a strong emphasis on cash flow generation. This focus gives us the flexibility for capital deployment while preserving a strong balance sheet to position us for future opportunities. Cash generated by operating activities over the past three years was deployed to pay dividends, fund capital expenditures and business acquisitions, and repurchase our common stock. Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 2015 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,879 $ 2,198 $ 2,607 Net cash (used) provided by investing activities (791 ) (426 ) 200 Net cash used by financing activities (2,399 ) (2,169 ) (4,367 ) Net cash used by discontinued operations (40 ) (54 ) (43 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and equivalents 649 (451 ) (1,603 ) Cash and equivalents at beginning of year 2,334 2,785 4,388 Cash and equivalents at end of year 2,983 2,334 2,785 Short- and long-term debt (3,982 ) (3,888 ) (3,399 ) Net debt $ (999 ) $ (1,554 ) $ (614 ) Debt-to-equity (a) 34.8 % 37.7 % 32.6 % Debt-to-capital (b) 25.8 % 27.4 % 24.6 % (a) Debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total equity as of year end. (b) Debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus total equity as of year end. We expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short- and long-term liquidity needs. We believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy. The following is a discussion of our major operating, investing and financing activities for each of the past three years, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in Item 8. 43 OPERATING ACTIVITIES We generated cash from operating activities of $3.9 billion in 2017 , $2.2 billion in 2016 and $2.6 billion in 2015 . The primary driver of cash flows was net earnings. Cash flows in 2016 and 2015 were affected negatively by growth in operating working capital in our Combat Systems group due to the utilization of deposits and the timing of billings on a large contract for a Middle Eastern customer, and in our Aerospace group from the build-up of inventory related to the new G500 and G600 aircraft programs and the liquidation of customer deposits associated with aircraft deliveries. In 2017, the growth in operating working capital due to these factors slowed and was offset by lower income tax payments. INVESTING ACTIVITIES Cash used for investing activities was $791 in 2017 compared with cash used for investing activities of $426 in 2016 and cash provided by investing activities of $200 in 2015 . Our investing activities include cash paid for capital expenditures and business acquisitions; purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities; and proceeds from asset sales. Capital Expenditures. The primary use of cash for investing activities in all three years was capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $428 in 2017 , $392 in 2016 and $569 in 2015 . We expect capital expenditures of around 2% of revenue in 2018 . Business Acquisitions. In 2017 , we acquired four businesses for an aggregate of $399 . In 2016 , we acquired two businesses for an aggregate of $58 . We did not acquire any businesses in 2015. Marketable Securities. In 2015, we received $500 of proceeds from maturing held-to-maturity securities purchased in 2014. Other net purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities in all three years were not material. Other, Net. Investing activities also include proceeds from asset sales. In 2015, we completed the sale of our axle business in the Combat Systems group and a commercial cyber security business in our Information Systems and Technology group. FINANCING ACTIVITIES Cash used for financing activities was $2.4 billion in 2017 , $2.2 billion in 2016 and $4.4 billion in 2015 . Our financing activities include repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends and debt repayments. Net cash from financing activities also includes proceeds received from debt issuances and employee stock option exercises. Share Repurchases. Our board of directors authorizes management repurchase of outstanding shares of our common stock on the open market from time to time. We repurchased 7.8 million of our outstanding shares for $1.5 billion in 2017 , 14.2 million shares for $2 billion in 2016 and 22.8 million shares for $3.2 billion in 2015 . As a result, we have reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 11% since the end of 2014 . On December 31, 2017 , 7.6 million shares remained authorized by our board of directors for repurchase, approximately 3% of our total shares outstanding. Dividends. On March 1, 2017, our board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of $0.84 per share, the 20 th consecutive annual increase. Previously, the board had increased the quarterly dividend to $0.76 per share in March 2016 and $0.69 per share in March 2015 . Cash dividends paid were $986 in 2017 , $911 in 2016 and $873 in 2015 . 44 Debt Issuances and Repayments. We issued $1 billion of fixed-rate notes in the third quarter of 2017, and we used the proceeds to repay $900 of fixed-rate notes that matured in the fourth quarter of 2017 and for general corporate purposes. In 2016, we repaid $500 of fixed-rate notes on their maturity date with cash on hand and issued $1 billion of fixed-rate notes for general corporate purposes. In 2015, we repaid $500 of fixed-rate notes on their scheduled maturity date with the proceeds from maturing marketable securities. We have no additional material repayments of long-term debt scheduled until 2021. See Note K to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information regarding our debt obligations, including scheduled debt maturities and interest rates. On December 31, 2017 , we had no commercial paper outstanding, but we maintain the ability to access the commercial paper market in the future . We have $2 billion in committed bank credit facilities for general corporate purposes and working capital needs. These credit facilities include a $1 billion multi-year facility expiring in July 2018 and a $1 billion multi-year facility expiring in November 2020 . We may renew or replace these credit facilities in whole or in part at or prior to their expiration dates. We also have an effective shelf registration on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission that allows us to access the debt markets . NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES We emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns. As described below, we use free cash flow from operations and ROIC to measure our performance in these areas. While we believe these metrics provide useful information, they are not defined operating measures under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and there are limitations associated with their use. Our calculation of these metrics may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the method of calculation. As a result, the use of these metrics should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, other GAAP measures. Free Cash Flow. We define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends. We use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a key performance measure in evaluating management. The following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 2015 2014* 2013* Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,879 $ 2,198 $ 2,607 $ 3,828 $ 3,159 Capital expenditures (428 ) (392 ) (569 ) (521 ) (436 ) Free cash flow from operations $ 3,451 $ 1,806 $ 2,038 $ 3,307 $ 2,723 Cash flows as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations: Net cash provided by operating activities 133 % 82 % 86 % 143 % 127 % Free cash flow from operations 119 % 67 % 67 % 124 % 110 % * Prior-period information for 2014 and 2013 has not been restated for ASC Topic 606 and is, therefore, not comparable to the 2017, 2016 and 2015 information. 45 Return on Invested Capital. We believe ROIC is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations. We use ROIC to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management. We define ROIC as net operating profit after taxes divided by average invested capital. Net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus after-tax interest and amortization expense. Average invested capital is defined as the sum of the average debt and shareholders equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss. ROIC excludes goodwill impairments and non-economic accounting changes as they are not reflective of company performance. ROIC is calculated as follows: Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 2015 2014* 2013* Earnings from continuing operations $ 2,912 $ 2,679 $ 3,036 $ 2,673 $ 2,486 After-tax interest expense 76 64 64 67 67 After-tax amortization expense 51 57 75 79 93 Net operating profit after taxes $ 3,039 $ 2,800 $ 3,175 $ 2,819 $ 2,646 Average invested capital $ 18,099 $ 17,168 $ 17,579 $ 18,673 $ 18,741 Return on invested capital 16.8 % 16.3 % 18.1 % 15.1 % 14.1 % * Prior-period information for 2014 and 2013 has not been restated for ASC Topic 606 and is, therefore, not comparable to the 2017, 2016 and 2015 information. ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS On December 31, 2017 , other than operating leases, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following tables present information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments on December 31, 2017 : Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Amount Committed Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than 5 Years Long-term debt (a) $ 5,029 $ 112 $ 215 $ 1,696 $ 3,006 Capital lease obligations 27 2 4 4 17 Operating leases 1,359 258 363 212 526 Purchase obligations (b) 25,168 13,806 8,594 1,983 785 Other long-term liabilities (c) 21,428 4,632 2,677 1,864 12,255 $ 53,011 $ 18,810 $ 11,853 $ 5,759 $ 16,589 (a) Includes scheduled interest payments. See Note K to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a discussion of long-term debt. (b) Includes amounts committed under legally enforceable agreements for goods and services with defined terms as to quantity, price and timing of delivery. This amount includes $17.1 billion of purchase obligations for products and services to be delivered under firm government contracts under which we would expect full recourse under normal contract termination clauses. (c) Represents other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, including the current portion of these liabilities. The projected timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based on management estimates, which are based largely on historical experience. This amount also includes all liabilities under our defined-benefit retirement plans. See Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for information regarding these liabilities and the plan assets available to satisfy them. 46 Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period Commercial Commitments Total Amount Committed Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than 5 Years Letters of credit and guarantees* $ 1,200 $ 585 $ 309 $ 171 $ 135 Aircraft trade-in options* 161 128 33 $ 1,361 $ 713 $ 342 $ 171 $ 135 * See Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a discussion of letters of credit and aircraft trade-in options. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period . On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including most pervasively those related to various assumptions and projections for our long-term contracts and programs. Other significant estimates include those related to goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, pension and other post-retirement benefits, workers compensation, warranty obligations and litigation and other contingencies. We employ judgment in making our estimates but they are based on historical experience, currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances . These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates. We believe our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented. In our opinion, the following policies are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application: Revenue. The majority of our revenue is derived from long-term contracts and programs that can span several years. We account for revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606. The unit of account in ASC Topic 606 is a performance obligation. A contract transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Our performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time. Substantially all of our revenue in the defense groups is recognized over time, because control is transferred continuously to our customers. Typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include labor, material, overhead and, when appropriate, G&A expenses. The majority of our revenue recognized at a point in time is for the manufacture of business-jet aircraft in our Aerospace group. Revenue on these contracts is recognized when the customer obtains control of the asset, which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft . Accounting for long-term contracts and programs involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenue and costs. For long-term contracts, we estimate the profit on a contract as the difference 47 between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract. Contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that often span several years. These assumptions include labor productivity and availability; the complexity of the work to be performed; the cost and availability of materials; the performance of subcontractors; and the availability and timing of funding from the customer. The nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including claims and award and incentive fees. We include in our contract estimates additional revenue for submitted contract modifications or claims against the customer when we believe we have an enforceable right to the modification or claim, the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. In evaluating these criteria, we consider the contractual/legal basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim. We include award or incentive fees in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee. These estimates are based on historical award experience, anticipated performance and our best judgment at the time. Because of our certainty in estimating these amounts, they are included in the transaction price of our contracts and the associated remaining performance obligations. As a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts, we review and update our contract-related estimates regularly. We recognize adjustments in estimated profit on contracts under the cumulative catch-up method. Under this method, the impact of the adjustment on profit recorded to date on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified. Revenue and profit in future periods of contract performance are recognized using the adjusted estimate. The aggregate impact of adjustments in contract estimates increased our operating earnings (and diluted earnings per share) by $323 ( $0.69 ) in 2017 , $16 ( $0.03 ) in 2016 and $271 ( $0.54 ) in 2015 . While no adjustment on any one contract was material to our Consolidated Financial Statements in 2017 , 2016 or 2015 , the amount in 2016 was negatively impacted by a loss on the design and development phase of the AJAX program in our Combat Systems group and cost growth associated with the restart of the Navy DDG-51 program in our Marine Systems group. Consistent with industry practice, we classify assets and liabilities related to long-term contracts as current, even though some of these amounts may not be realized within one year. The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (contract assets), and customer advances and deposits (contract liabilities) on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These assets and liabilities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. Long-lived Assets and Goodwill. We review long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of undiscounted projected cash flows. Impairment losses, where identified, are measured as the excess of the carrying value of the long-lived asset over its estimated fair value as determined by discounted projected cash flows. Goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. We review goodwill for impairment annually or when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not. Such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit. The test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process that requires a significant level of 48 estimation and use of judgment by management, particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units based primarily on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations. This requires numerous assumptions, including the timing of work embedded in our backlog, our performance and profitability under our contracts, our success in securing future business, the appropriate risk-adjusted interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows, and terminal value growth and earnings rates applied to the final year of projected cash flows. Due to the variables inherent in our estimates of fair value, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the result of our impairment analysis. To assess the reasonableness of our discounted projected cash flows, we compare the sum of our reporting units fair value to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium (the excess of the market capitalization over the sum of the reporting units fair values). Additionally, we evaluate the reasonableness of each reporting unit fair value by comparing the fair value to comparable peer companies and recent comparable market transactions. We completed the required annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2017 . The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value. Our reporting units are consistent with our business groups . The estimated fair value of each of our reporting units was well in excess of its respective carrying value as of December 31, 2017 . Commitments and Contingencies. We are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either from the normal course of business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment . Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment. We record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable. The ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known. Other Contract Costs. Other contract costs represent amounts that are not currently allocable to government contracts, such as a portion of our estimated workers compensation obligations, other insurance-related assessments, pension and other post-retirement benefits, and environmental expenses. These costs will become allocable to contracts generally after they are paid. We have elected to defer these costs in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet until they can be allocated to contracts. We expect to recover these costs through ongoing business, including existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs. This assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs, the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity. These estimates are based on our best judgment. If the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected. Retirement Plans. Our defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on several assumptions and estimates. The key assumptions include interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected long-term rates of return on plan assets. We base the discount rates on a current yield curve developed from a portfolio of high-quality, fixed-income investments with maturities consistent with the projected benefit payout period. Beginning in 2016, we refined the method used to determine the service and interest cost components of our net annual benefit cost. Previously, the cost was determined using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve described above. Under the refined method, known as the spot rate approach, we use individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each service cost and discounted benefit obligation payment. We believe this change provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected service cost and discounted benefit obligation cash outflows and 49 corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. We accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate. We determine the long-term rate of return on assets based on consideration of historical and forward-looking returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy. In 2017, we decreased the expected long-term rate of return on assets in our primary U.S. government and commercial pension plans by 75 basis points following an assessment of the historical and expected long-term returns of our various asset classes. These retirement plan assumptions are based on our best judgment, including consideration of current and future market conditions. In the event any of the assumptions change, pension and other post-retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease. For further discussion, including the impact of hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, see Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. As discussed under Other Contract Costs, our contractual arrangements with the U.S. government provide for the recovery of benefit costs for our government retirement plans. We have elected to defer recognition of the benefit costs until such costs can be allocated to contracts. Therefore, the impact of annual changes in financial reporting assumptions on the retirement benefit cost for these plans does not immediately affect our operating results. Accounting Standards Updates. See Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for information regarding accounting standards we adopted in 2017 and other new accounting standards that have been issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) but are not effective until after December 31, 2017 . 50
