ITEM 7 Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW We are a global consumer foods company. We develop distinctive value-added food products and market them under unique brand names. We work continuously to improve our established products and to create new products that meet consumers evolving needs and preferences. In addition, we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer-directed marketing and innovative merchandising. We believe our brand-building strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe. Our fundamental business goal is to generate superior returns for our stockholders over the long term. We believe that increases in net sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share (EPS), and return on average total capital are the key measures of financial performance for our businesses. See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our discussion of total segment operating profit, diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability and return on average total capital, which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Our objectives are to consistently deliver: low single-digit annual growth in net sales; mid single-digit annual growth in total segment operating profit; high single-digit annual growth in EPS; and improvements in return on average total capital. We believe that this financial performance, coupled with an attractive dividend yield, should result in long-term value creation for stockholders. We also return a substantial amount of cash to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. For the fiscal year ended May 29, 2011, our net sales grew 2 percent, total segment operating profit grew 4 percent and diluted EPS grew 20 percent, however our return on average total capital declined by 10 basis points despite these positive earnings metrics. Diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability increased 8 percent from fiscal 2010 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our use of this measure and our discussion of the items affecting comparability). Net cash provided by operations totaled $1.5 billion in fiscal 2011, enabling us to increase our annual dividend payments per share by 17 percent from fiscal 2010 and continue returning cash to stockholders through share repurchases, which totaled $1.2 billion in fiscal 2011. We also made significant capital investments totaling $649 million in fiscal 2011. We achieved the following related to our six key operating objectives for fiscal 2011: Net sales growth of 2 percent was primarily driven by volume gains in our International segment and net price realization and mix. We achieved a 4 percent increase in total segment operating profit despite renewed input cost inflation. Our gross margin as a percent of net sales was comparable to fiscal 2010. We took pricing actions on most of our product lines in fiscal 2011 to partially offset the increases in input costs. In addition, we continued to focus on the other elements of our holistic margin management (HMM) program, which include cost-savings initiatives, marketing spending efficiencies, and profitable sales mix strategies. We continued to invest in media and other brand-building marketing programs. However, our total media and advertising spending decreased from fiscal 2010 levels, which increased 24 percent versus fiscal 2009. We grew our Bakeries and Foodservice segment operating profit, including a focus on higher-margin, branded product lines within our most attractive foodservice customer channels. We continued to grow our business in international markets. We focused on our core platforms of ready-to-eat cereal, super premium ice cream, convenient meal solutions, and healthy snacking by introducing new products and investing to drive sales growth. Details of our financial results are provided in the Fiscal 2011 Consolidated Results of Operations section below. 16 We expect slow improvement in the operating environment for food companies around the globe. Although we believe the environment will remain challenging in fiscal 2012, we expect to deliver another year of quality growth. Excluding the effects of our acquisition of interests in Yoplait S.A.S. and Yoplait Marques S.A.S., we expect to achieve these results: We are targeting mid single-digit growth in net sales primarily driven by net price realization, as our plans assume a modest decline in pound volume. We have a strong line-up of consumer marketing, merchandising, and innovation planned to support our leading brands. We will continue to build our global platforms in markets around the world, accelerating our efforts in rapidly growing emerging markets. We are targeting low single-digit growth in total segment operating profit in fiscal 2012, as we expect our HMM discipline of cost savings, mix management and price realization to largely offset an expected 10 to 11 percent increase in input costs. Our businesses generate strong levels of cash flows. We use some of this cash to reinvest in our business. Our fiscal 2012 plans call for $670 million of expenditures for capital projects, excluding expenditures that may be required for Yoplait S.A.S. On June 28, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase to an annual rate of $1.22 per share, a 9 percent increase from the rate paid in fiscal 2011. As a result of the acquisition of interests in Yoplait entities, we expect to reduce our level of share repurchases in fiscal 2012. We expect that share repurchases will offset normal levels of stock option exercises in fiscal 2012. Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report. FISCAL 2011 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In fiscal 2011, net earnings attributable to General Mills was $1,798 million, up 18 percent from $1,530 million in fiscal 2010, and we reported diluted EPS of $2.70 in fiscal 2011, up 20 percent from $2.24 in fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 results include gains from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories versus fiscal 2010 which included losses. Fiscal 2011 results also include the net benefit from the resolution of uncertain tax matters, and fiscal 2010 results include income tax expense related to the enactment of federal health care reform. Diluted EPS excluding these items affecting comparability was $2.48 in fiscal 2011, up 8 percent from $2.30 in fiscal 2010 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our use of this measure and our discussion of the items affecting comparability). The components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Components of Net Sales Growth Fiscal 2011 vs. 2010 Contributions from volume growth (a) 1 pt Net price realization and mix 1 pt Foreign currency exchange Flat Net sales growth 2 pts (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. Net sales grew 2 percent in fiscal 2011, due to 1 percentage point of volume growth and 1 percentage point of growth from net price realization and mix. Foreign exchange was flat compared to fiscal 2010. Cost of sales increased $91 million in fiscal 2011 to $8,927 million. This increase was driven by $157 million higher net input costs and product mix and an $84 million increase attributable to higher volume, partially offset by a $95 million net decrease in cost of sales related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories as described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report, compared to a net increase of $7 million in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2010, we recorded a charge of $48 million resulting from a change in the capitalization threshold for certain equipment parts. Gross margin grew 3 percent in fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010. Gross margin as a percent of net sales increased by 40 basis points from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011. These improvements were primarily driven by gains from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories in fiscal 2011 versus losses in fiscal 2010. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were up $29 million in fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010, while SG&A expenses 17 as a percent of net sales remained essentially flat from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by a $69 million increase in corporate pension expense partially offset by a 7 percent decrease in advertising and media expense. In fiscal 2010, the Venezuelan government devalued the bolivar fuerte exchange rate against the U.S. dollar. The $14 million foreign exchange loss resulting from the devaluation was substantially offset by a $13 million recovery against a corporate investment. During fiscal 2011, we recorded a net divestiture gain of $17 million. We recorded a gain of $14 million related to the sale of a foodservice frozen baked goods product line in our International segment and a gain of $3 million related to the sale of a pie shell product line in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment. There were no divestitures in fiscal 2010. Interest, net for fiscal 2011 totaled $346 million, $55 million lower than fiscal 2010. The average interest rate on our total outstanding debt was 5.6 percent in fiscal 2011 compared to 6.3 percent in fiscal 2010, generating a $45 million decrease in net interest. Average interest bearing instruments increased $474 million in fiscal 2011, primarily due to more share repurchases than in fiscal 2010, leading to a $30 million increase in net interest. In fiscal 2010, we also recorded a loss of $40 million related to the repurchase of certain notes, which represented the premium paid, the write-off of remaining discount and unamortized fees, and the settlement of related swaps. Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs totaled $4 million in fiscal 2011 as follows: Expense, in Millions Discontinuation of underperforming product line in our U.S. Retail segment $ 1.7 Charges associated with restructuring actions previously announced 2.7 Total $ 4.4 In fiscal 2011, we decided to exit an underperforming product line in our U.S. Retail segment. As a result of this decision, we concluded that the future cash flows generated by this product line were insufficient to recover the net book value of the associated long-lived assets. Accordingly, we recorded a non-cash charge of $2 million related to the impairment of the associated long-lived assets. No employees were affected by these actions. In addition, we recorded $3 million of charges associated with restructuring actions previously announced. In fiscal 2011, we paid $6 million in cash related to restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2011 and previous years. Our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 29.7 percent compared to 35.0 percent in fiscal 2010. The 5.3 percentage point decrease was primarily due to a $100 million reduction to tax expense recorded in fiscal 2011 related to a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concerning corporate income tax adjustments for fiscal years 2002 to 2008. The adjustments primarily relate to the amount of capital loss, depreciation, and amortization we reported as a result of the sale of noncontrolling interests in our General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) subsidiary. Fiscal 2010 income tax expense included a $35 million increase related to the enactment of federal health care reform (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010). This legislation changed the tax treatment of subsidies to companies that provide prescription drug benefits that are at least the equivalent of benefits under Medicare Part D (see the Impact of Inflation section below for additional discussion of this legislation). After-tax earnings from joint ventures for fiscal 2011 decreased to $96 million compared to $102 million in fiscal 2010. The decrease is primarily due to higher advertising and media spending and increased service cost allocations, all in CPW. In fiscal 2011, CPW net sales grew by 3 percent due to a 2 percentage point increase in volume and a 1 percentage point increase from favorable foreign exchange. Net price realization and mix was flat compared to fiscal 2010. Net sales for HDJ increased 4 percent from fiscal 2010 primarily due to 9 percentage points of favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by a 5 percentage point decline in net price realization and mix. Volume was flat compared to fiscal 2010. Average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 18 million in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010, due primarily to the repurchase of 32 million shares since the end of fiscal 2010, partially offset by the issuance of shares upon stock option exercises. FISCAL 2011 CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS Cash and cash equivalents decreased $54 million from fiscal 2010, as discussed in the Liquidity section below. Receivables increased $121 million from fiscal 2010 as a result of foreign currency translation effects of $44 million and sales timing shifts. The allowance for doubtful accounts was essentially unchanged from fiscal 2010. Inventories increased $265 million from fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of increased commodity prices. 18 Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased $105 million from fiscal 2010, due mainly to increases in derivatives receivable balances. Land, buildings, and equipment increased $218 million from fiscal 2010, as capital expenditures of $649 million and a foreign currency translation impact of $55 million were partially offset by depreciation expense of $462 million in fiscal 2011. Goodwill and other intangible assets increased $256 million from fiscal 2010 primarily due to foreign currency translation of $148 million and the acquisitions of the Mountain High yoghurt business and the Pasta Master meals business. We recorded $72 million of goodwill and $45 million of other intangible assets related to these transactions. Other assets increased $99 million from fiscal 2010, driven mainly by a $126 million increase in our prepaid pension assets and a $121 million increase in our investment and advances to joint ventures, partially offset by a decrease of $117 million in non-current interest rate derivatives receivable. Accounts payable increased $146 million to $995 million in fiscal 2011, primarily due to shifts in timing of payments. Long-term debt, including current portion, and notes payable increased $459 million from fiscal 2010 primarily due to the issuance of $1.2 billion of long-term debt in fiscal 2011, partially offset by a $739 million decrease in notes payable. The current and noncurrent portions of net deferred income taxes liability increased $268 million from fiscal 2010 due to contributions to our defined benefit pension plans and book versus tax depreciation differences. Other current liabilities decreased $441 million from fiscal 2010, primarily driven by decreases in accrued taxes of $360 million and a $136 million decrease in consumer marketing accruals. Other liabilities decreased $386 million from fiscal 2010, driven by a decrease of $175 million in pension and postretirement liabilities, a decrease of $158 million in non-current derivatives payable, and a decrease of $43 million in non-current accrued taxes payable. Retained earnings increased $1,069 million from fiscal 2010, reflecting fiscal 2011 net earnings of $1,798 million less dividends paid of $729 million. Treasury stock increased $595 million from fiscal 2010, due to $1,164 million of share repurchases, partially offset by $568 million related to stock-based compensation plans. Additional paid in capital increased $13 million from fiscal 2010, due to stock compensation plan activity. Accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI) decreased by $476 million after-tax from fiscal 2010, primarily driven by foreign currency translation of $358 million and pension and postemployment activity of $128 million. FISCAL 2010 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net earnings attributable to General Mills were $1,530 million in fiscal 2010, up 17 percent from $1,304 million in fiscal 2009, and we reported diluted EPS of $2.24 in fiscal 2010, up 18 percent from $1.90 in fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2010 and 2009 results include losses from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories. Fiscal 2010 results also include income tax expense related to the enactment of federal health care reform, and the fiscal 2009 results include a net divestiture gain, income from a settlement with an insurance carrier, and the impact of a court decision on an uncertain tax matter. Diluted EPS excluding these items affecting comparability was $2.30 in fiscal 2010, up 16 percent from $1.99 in fiscal 2009 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our use of this measure and our discussion of the items affecting comparability). The components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Components of Net Sales Growth Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Contributions from volume growth (a) Flat Net price realization and mix 1 pt Foreign currency exchange Flat Net sales growth 1 pt (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. 19 Net sales grew 1 point in fiscal 2010, driven by 1 percentage point of growth from net price realization and mix. Contributions from volume were flat, including the loss of 2 points of growth from divested products and a 1 percentage point loss from an additional week in fiscal 2009. Foreign exchange did not affect sales growth in fiscal 2010. Cost of sales decreased $546 million in fiscal 2010 to $8,835 million. This decrease was mainly driven by favorable mix, HMM initiatives, and lower input costs. In fiscal 2010, we recorded a $7 million net increase in cost of sales related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories as described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report, compared to a net increase of $119 million in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010, we recorded a charge of $48 million resulting from a change in the capitalization threshold for certain equipment parts, enabled by an upgrade to our parts management system. Gross margin grew 12 percent in fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009. Gross margin as a percent of net sales increased by 400 basis points from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010. These improvements were driven by favorable mix, HMM initiatives and lower input costs. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were up $270 million in fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2010 increased by 2 percentage points compared to fiscal 2009. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by a 24 percent increase in advertising and media expense. In fiscal 2010, the Venezuelan government devalued the bolivar fuerte exchange rate against the U.S. dollar. The effect of the devaluation was a $14 million foreign exchange loss. Also in fiscal 2010, we recorded a $13 million recovery against a corporate investment compared to write downs of $35 million related to various corporate investments in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2009, we recorded a $41 million gain from a settlement with the insurance carrier covering the loss of our La Salte a pasta manufacturing facility in Argentina, which was destroyed by fire in fiscal 2008. There were no divestitures in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2009, we recorded a net divestiture gain of $129 million related to the sale of our Pop Secret product line from our U.S. Retail segment for $192 million in cash. Also in fiscal 2009, we recorded a $38 million loss on the sale of a portion of the assets of our frozen unbaked bread dough product line in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment, including the discontinuation of our frozen dinner roll product line in our U.S. Retail segment that shared a divested facility. In addition, we recorded a $6 million loss in fiscal 2009 on the sale of our bread concentrates product line in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment. Interest, net for fiscal 2010 totaled $402 million, $19 million higher than fiscal 2009. Average interest-bearing instruments decreased $1.0 billion in fiscal 2010, leading to a $58 million decrease in net interest, while average interest rates increased 60 basis points generating a $37 million increase in net interest. The average interest rate on our total outstanding debt was 6.3 percent in fiscal 2010 compared to 5.7 percent in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010, we also recorded a loss of $40 million related to the repurchase of certain notes, which represented the premium paid, the write-off of remaining discount and unamortized fees, and the settlement of related swaps. Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs totaled $31 million in fiscal 2010 as follows: Expense (Income), in Millions Discontinuation of kids refrigerated yogurt beverage and microwave soup product lines $ 24.1 Discontinuation of the breadcrumbs product line at Federalsburg, Maryland plant 6.2 Sale of Contagem, Brazil bread and pasta plant (0.6 ) Charges associated with restructuring actions previously announced 1.7 Total $ 31.4 In fiscal 2010, we decided to exit our kids refrigerated yogurt beverage product line at our Murfreesboro, Tennessee plant and our microwave soup product line at our Vineland, New Jersey plant to rationalize capacity for more profitable items. Our decisions to exit these U.S. Retail segment products resulted in a $24 million non-cash charge against the related long-lived assets. No employees were affected by these actions. We recognized $2 million of other exit costs and completed these actions in fiscal 2011. We also decided to exit our breadcrumb product line at our Federalsburg, Maryland plant in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment. As a result of this decision, we concluded that the future cash flows generated by these products were insufficient to recover the net book value of the associated long-lived assets. Accordingly, we recorded a non-cash charge of $6 million primarily related to the impairment of these long-lived assets and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we sold our manufacturing facility in Federalsburg for $3 million. In fiscal 2010, we also recorded a $1 million net gain on the sale of our previously closed Contagem, Brazil bread and pasta plant for cash proceeds of $6 million, and recorded $2 million of costs related to previously announced restructuring actions. In fiscal 2010, we paid $8 million in cash related to restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2010 and previous years. Our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was 35.0 percent compared to 37.1 percent in fiscal 2009. The 2.1 percentage point decrease primarily reflects an unfavorable court decision in fiscal 2009 on an uncertain tax matter, which increased fiscal 2009 income 20 tax expense by $53 million. In addition, fiscal 2009 included $15 million of tax expense related to nondeductible goodwill write-offs associated with divestitures. Fiscal 2010 income tax expense included a $35 million increase related to the enactment of federal health care reform. This legislation changed the tax treatment of subsidies to companies that provide prescription drug benefits that are at least the equivalent of benefits under Medicare Part D (see the Impact of Inflation section below for additional discussion of this legislation). The fiscal 2010 tax rate also included increased benefits from the domestic manufacturing deduction. After-tax earnings from joint ventures for fiscal 2010 increased to $102 million compared to $92 million in the same period in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010, net sales for CPW grew 6 percent, due to 4 percentage points of growth from net price realization and mix, 1 percentage point from favorable foreign exchange and a 1 percentage point increase in volume, including growth in Russia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. Net sales for HDJ decreased 4 percent, due primarily to an 11 percentage point decline in volume, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange. Average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 4 million in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009, due primarily to the timing of share repurchases including the repurchase of 21 million shares since the end of fiscal 2009, partially offset by the issuance of shares upon stock option exercises. RESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Our businesses are organized into three operating segments: U.S. Retail; International; and Bakeries and Foodservice. The following tables provide the dollar amount and percentage of net sales and operating profit from each segment for fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009: Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 Percent of Percent of Percent of In Millions Dollars Total Dollars Total Dollars Total Net Sales U.S. Retail $ 10,163.9 69 % $ 10,209.8 70 % $ 9,973.6 68 % International 2,875.5 19 2,684.9 18 2,571.8 18 Bakeries and Foodservice 1,840.8 12 1,740.9 12 2,010.4 14 Total $ 14,880.2 100 % $ 14,635.6 100 % $ 14,555.8 100 % Segment Operating Profit U.S. Retail $ 2,347.9 80 % $ 2,385.2 84 % $ 2,206.6 84 % International 291.4 10 192.1 7 239.2 9 Bakeries and Foodservice 306.3 10 263.2 9 178.4 7 Total $ 2,945.6 100 % $ 2,840.5 100 % $ 2,624.2 100 % Segment operating profit excludes unallocated corporate items, gain on divestitures, and restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs because these items affecting operating profit are centrally managed at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by our executive management. U.S. RETAIL SEGMENT Our U.S. Retail segment reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains, and drug, dollar and discount chains operating throughout the United States. Our major product categories in this business segment are ready-to-eat cereals, refrigerated yogurt, ready-to-serve soup, dry dinners, shelf stable and frozen vegetables, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza and pizza snacks, grain, fruit and savory snacks, and a wide variety of organic products including soup, granola bars, and cereal. 21 Components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Components of U.S. Retail Net Sales Growth Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 vs. 2010 vs. 2009 Contributions from volume growth (a) Flat 1 pt Net price realization and mix Flat 1 pt Net sales growth Flat 2 pts (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. In fiscal 2011, net sales for our U.S. Retail segment were $10.2 billion, flat compared to fiscal 2010. Volume on a tonnage basis and net price realization and mix were both flat compared to fiscal 2011. Net sales for this segment totaled $10.2 billion in fiscal 2010 and $10.0 billion in fiscal 2009. Net price realization and mix added 1 percentage point of growth and volume on a tonnage basis contributed 1 percentage point of growth including a loss of 2 percentage points from an additional week in fiscal 2009. Net sales for our U.S. retail divisions are shown in the tables below: U.S. Retail Net Sales by Division Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 Big G $ 2,293.6 $ 2,351.3 $ 2,231.9 Meals 2,131.8 2,146.0 2,139.6 Pillsbury 1,823.9 1,858.2 1,851.9 Yoplait 1,499.0 1,491.2 1,471.0 Snacks 1,378.3 1,315.8 1,237.7 Baking Products 808.6 845.2 842.6 Small Planet Foods and other 228.7 202.1 198.9 Total $ 10,163.9 $ 10,209.8 $ 9,973.6 U.S. Retail Net Sales Percentage Change by Division Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 vs. 2010 vs. 2009 Big G (2 )% 5 % Meals (1 ) Flat Pillsbury (2 ) Flat Yoplait 1 1 Snacks 5 6 Baking Products (4 ) Flat Small Planet Foods 13 3 Total Flat 2 % In fiscal 2011, net sales for Big G cereals declined 2 percent from last year which included Chocolate Cheerios and Wheaties Fuel introductory volume. Meals division net sales decreased 1 percent as Helper dinner mixes and Green Giant canned vegetables declines were partially offset by growth in Old El Paso Mexican products, Progresso ready-to-serve soups and Wanchai Ferry and Macaroni Grill frozen entrees. Pillsbury net sales declined 2 percent due to sales declines in Totino pizza. Net sales for Yoplait grew 1 percent including the acquisition of the Mountain High yoghurt business. Snacks net sales grew 5 percent, driven by Nature Valley and Fiber One grain snack bars. Net sales for Baking Products declined 4 percent. Small Planet Food net sales were up 13 percent driven by double-digit growth for L rabar fruit and nut energy bars. In fiscal 2010, net sales for Big G cereals grew 5 percent driven by Multigrain Cheerios , Cinnamon Toast Crunch , and Fiber One cereals and introductory sales of Chocolate Cheerios and Wheaties Fuel . Meals division net sales were flat, as gains from Green Giant 22 frozen vegetables and Old El Paso Mexican products were offset by lower sales of Progresso ready-to-serve soups. Pillsbury net sales were flat, including gains on Totino pizza and Pizza Rolls snacks and Pillsbury Toaster Strudel pastries offset by lower sales for Pillsbury refrigerated baked goods. Net sales for Yoplait grew 1 percent, led by introductory sales from Yoplait Delights and Yoplait Greek style yogurt. Snacks net sales grew 6 percent, driven by Fiber One bars, Nature Valley grain snacks and several fruit snack varieties. Net sales for Baking Products were flat. Small Planet Food net sales were up 3 percent, reflecting performance of Cascadian Farm cereal and granola bars and L rabar fruit and nut energy bars. Segment operating profit of $2.3 billion in fiscal 2011 declined $37 million, or 2 percent, from fiscal 2010. The decrease was primarily driven by unfavorable supply chain costs of $81 million, partially offset by a 9 percent reduction in advertising and media expense. Segment operating profit of $2.4 billion in fiscal 2010 improved $179 million, or 8 percent, over fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily driven by favorable supply chain costs of $238 million, net price realization and mix of $106 million, and volume growth of $54 million, partially offset by a 22 percent increase in advertising and media expense and higher administrative costs. INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT In Canada, our major product categories are ready-to-eat cereals, shelf stable and frozen vegetables, dry dinners, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza snacks, and grain and fruit snacks. In markets outside North America, our product categories include super-premium ice cream and frozen desserts, refrigerated yogurt, grain snacks, shelf stable and frozen vegetables, refrigerated and frozen dough products, and dry dinners. Our International segment also includes products manufactured in the United States for export, mainly to Caribbean and Latin American markets, as well as products we manufacture for sale to our international joint ventures. Revenues from export activities are reported in the region or country where the end customer is located. Components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Components of International Net Sales Growth Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 vs. 2010 vs. 2009 Contributions from volume growth (a) 6 pts Flat Net price realization and mix 1 pt 3 pts Foreign currency exchange Flat 1 pt Net sales growth 7 pts 4 pts (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. In fiscal 2011, net sales for our International segment were $2,876 million, up 7 percent from fiscal 2010. This growth was driven by 6 percentage points of contributions from volume and 1 percentage point from net price realization and mix. Foreign currency exchange was flat compared to fiscal 2010. Net sales totaled $2,685 million in fiscal 2010, up 4 percent from $2,572 million in fiscal 2009. The growth in fiscal 2010 was driven by 3 percentage points from net price realization and mix and 1 percentage point of favorable foreign currency exchange. Pound volume was flat, reflecting a 2 percentage point reduction from divested product lines. Net sales for our International segment by geographic region are shown in the following tables: International Net Sales by Geographic Region Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 Europe $ 905.5 $ 859.6 $ 849.1 Canada 769.9 709.9 645.9 Asia/Pacific 822.9 720.0 634.5 Latin America 377.2 395.4 442.3 Total $ 2,875.5 $ 2,684.9 $ 2,571.8 23 International Change in Net Sales by Geographic Region Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 vs. 2010 vs. 2009 Europe 5 % 1 % Canada 8 10 Asia/Pacific 14 13 Latin America (5 ) (11 ) Total 7 % 4 % In fiscal 2011, net sales in Europe grew 5 percent driven by growth in H agen Dazs and Nature Valley in the United Kingdom, and Old El Paso in France and Switzerland, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Net sales in Canada increased 8 percent due to favorable foreign exchange and growth in ready to eat cereals. In the Asia/Pacific region, net sales grew 14 percent driven by growth of H agen-Dazs and Wanchai Ferry brands in China, and atta flour in India. Latin America net sales decreased 5 percent driven by unfavorable foreign exchange primarily related to the 2010 devaluation of the Venezuelan currency, partially offset by Diablitos growth in Venezuela and La Salte a growth in Argentina. In fiscal 2010, net sales in Europe increased by 1 percent, driven by growth in Nature Valley and Old El Paso partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Net sales in Canada increased 10 percent due to favorable foreign currency exchange and growth from cereal and Old El Paso . In the Asia/Pacific region, net sales grew 13 percent due to growth from H agen-Dazs shops and Wanchai Ferry products in China. Latin America net sales decreased 11 percent due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange, partially offset by net price realization. Segment operating profit for fiscal 2011 grew 52 percent to $291 million from $192 million in fiscal 2010, primarily driven by volume growth and favorable foreign currency exchange. In fiscal 2010, we incurred a $14 million foreign exchange loss on the revaluation of non-bolivar fuerte monetary balances in Venezuela. Segment operating profit for fiscal 2010 declined 20 percent to $192 million, from $239 million in fiscal 2009, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency effects and a 31 percent increase in advertising and media expense, partially offset by favorable net price realization. In January 2010, the Venezuelan government devalued the bolivar fuerte by resetting the official exchange rate. The effect of the devaluation was a $14 million foreign exchange loss in fiscal 2010, primarily on the revaluation of non- bolivar fuerte monetary balances in Venezuela. We continue to use the official exchange rate to remeasure the financial statements of our Venezuelan operations, as we intend to remit dividends solely through the government-operated Foreign Exchange Administration Board (CADIVI). The devaluation of the bolivar fuerte also reduced the U.S. dollar equivalent of our Venezuelan results of operations and financial condition, but this did not have a material impact on our results. During fiscal 2010, Venezuela became a highly inflationary economy, which did not have a material impact on our results in fiscal 2011 or 2010. BAKERIES AND FOODSERVICE SEGMENT In our Bakeries and Foodservice segment our major product categories are cereals, snacks, yogurt, unbaked and fully baked frozen dough products, baking mixes, and flour. Many products we sell are branded to the consumer and nearly all are branded to our customers. We sell to distributors and operators in many customer channels including foodservice, convenience stores, vending, and supermarket bakeries. Components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Components of Bakeries and Foodservice Net Sales Growth Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 vs. 2010 vs. 2009 Contributions from volume growth (a) Flat -8 pts Net price realization and mix 6 pts -5 pts Foreign currency exchange Flat Flat Net sales growth 6 pts -13 pt (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. 24 For fiscal 2011, net sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice segment increased 6 percent to $1,841 million. The increase in fiscal 2011 was driven by an increase in net price realization and mix of 6 percentage points, primarily from prices indexed to commodity markets. Contributions from volume were flat, including a 2 percentage point decline from a divested product line. For fiscal 2010, net sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice segment decreased 13 percent to $1,741 million. The decrease in fiscal 2010 was driven by 8 percentage points from volume declines, including 8 percentage points from divested product lines and a loss of 2 percentage points from an additional week in fiscal 2009. Net price realization and mix decreased 5 percentage points, primarily from prices indexed to commodity markets. Net sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice segment by customer channel is shown in the following tables: Bakeries and Foodservice Net Sales by Customer Channel Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 Foodservice Distributors $ 557.3 $ 543.3 $ 558.1 Convenience Stores 225.6 202.8 190.4 Bakeries and National Restaurant Accounts 1,057.9 994.8 1,261.9 Total $ 1,840.8 $ 1,740.9 $ 2,010.4 Bakeries and Foodservice Net Sales Percentage Change by Customer Channel Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 vs. 2010 vs. 2009 Foodservice Distributors 3 % (3 )% Convenience Stores 11 7 Bakeries and National Restaurant Accounts 6 (21 ) Total 6 % (13 )% In fiscal 2011, segment operating profit was $306 million, up from $263 million in fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily driven by net price realization and mix and increased grain merchandising earnings, partially offset by higher input costs. Segment operating profit was $263 million in fiscal 2010, up from $178 million in fiscal 2009. The increase was due to lower input costs, plant operating performance, and increased grain merchandising earnings. UNALLOCATED CORPORATE ITEMS Unallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, annual contributions to the General Mills Foundation, and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. This includes gains and losses from mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments in accordance with our policy as discussed in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. For fiscal 2011, unallocated corporate expense totaled $184 million compared to $203 million last year. In fiscal 2011 we recorded a $95 million net decrease in expense related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories, compared to a $7 million net increase in expense last year. This was partially offset by a $69 million increase in corporate pension expense in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2010, we recorded a $13 million recovery against a corporate investment. Unallocated corporate expense totaled $203 million in fiscal 2010 compared to $342 million in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010, we recorded a $7 million net increase in expense related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories, compared to a $119 million net increase in expense in fiscal 2009. Also in fiscal 2010, we recorded a $13 million recovery against a corporate investment compared to $35 million of write-downs against various investments in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2009, we recognized a $41 million gain from an insurance settlement. JOINT VENTURES In addition to our consolidated operations, we participate in two joint ventures. We have a 50 percent equity interest in CPW, which manufactures and markets ready-to-eat cereal products in more than 130 countries and republics outside the United States and Canada. 25 CPW also markets cereal bars in several European countries and manufactures private label cereals for customers in the United Kingdom. We also have a 50 percent equity interest in HDJ, which manufactures, distributes, and markets H agen-Dazs ice cream products and frozen novelties. Our share of after-tax joint venture earnings decreased from $102 million in fiscal 2010 to $96 million in fiscal 2011 primarily due to higher advertising and media spending and increased service cost allocations, all in CPW. Our share of after-tax joint venture earnings increased from $92 million in fiscal 2009 to $102 million in fiscal 2010. The increase is mainly due to lower fiscal 2009 earnings which were reduced by a $6 million deferred income tax valuation allowance. The change in net sales for each joint venture is set forth in the following table: Joint Venture Change in Net Sales Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 vs. 2010 vs. 2009 CPW 3 % 6 % HDJ 4 (4 ) Joint Ventures 4 % 4 % For fiscal 2011, CPW net sales grew by 3 percent due to a 2 percentage point increase in volume and 1 percentage point from favorable foreign exchange. Net price realization and mix was flat compared to fiscal 2010. Net sales for HDJ increased 4 percent from fiscal 2010 primarily due to 9 percentage points of favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by a 5 percentage point decline in net price realization and mix. Volume was flat compared to fiscal 2010. For fiscal 2010, CPW net sales grew by 6 percent due to 4 percentage points of growth from net price realization and mix, 1 percentage point from favorable foreign exchange and a 1 percentage point increase in volume, including growth in Russia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. Net sales for HDJ decreased 4 percent from fiscal 2009 due to an 11 percentage point decline in volume, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange. Selected cash flows from our joint ventures are set forth in the following table: Selected Cash Flows from Joint Ventures Fiscal Year Inflow (Outflow), in Millions 2011 2010 2009 Advances to joint ventures, net $ (1.8 ) $ (128.1 ) $ 8.2 Dividends received 72.7 88.0 68.5 IMPACT OF INFLATION We have experienced significant input cost volatility since fiscal 2006. Our gross margin performance in fiscal 2011 reflects the impact of input cost inflation, primarily on commodities inputs. We expect the cost of commodities and energy to increase at a higher rate in fiscal 2012. We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through planning and operating practices. Our risk management practices are discussed in Item 7A of this report. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Act) was signed into law in March 2010. The Act codifies health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 to 2018. Many provisions in the Act require the issuance of additional guidance from various government agencies. Because the Act does not take effect fully until future years, the Act did not have a material impact on our fiscal 2011 or 2010 results of operations. Given the complexity of the Act, the extended time period over which the reforms will be implemented, and the unknown impact of future regulatory guidance, the full impact of the Act on future periods will not be known until those regulations are adopted. LIQUIDITY The primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations. Over the most recent three-year period, our operations have generated $5.5 billion in cash. A substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to stockholders through share 26 repurchases and dividends. We also use this source of liquidity to fund our capital expenditures. We typically use a combination of cash, notes payable, and long-term debt to finance acquisitions and major capital expansions. Cash Flows from Operations Fiscal Year In Millions 2011 2010 2009 Net earnings, including earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests $ 1,803.5 $ 1,535.0 $ 1,313.7 Depreciation and amortization 472.6 457.1 453.6 After-tax earnings from joint ventures (96.4 ) (101.7 ) (91.9 ) Stock-based compensation 105.3 107.3 117.7 Deferred income taxes 205.3 22.3 215.8 Tax benefit on exercised options (106.2 ) (114.0 ) (89.1 ) Distributions of earnings from joint ventures 72.7 88.0 68.5 Pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions (220.8 ) (17.2 ) (220.3 ) Pension and other postretirement benefit plan (income) expense 73.6 (37.9 ) (27.5 ) Divestitures (gain), net (17.4 ) (84.9 ) Gain on insurance settlement (41.3 ) Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs (income) (1.3 ) 23.4 31.3 Changes in current assets and liabilities (720.9 ) 143.4 176.9 Other, net (43.2 ) 75.5 5.7 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,526.8 $ 2,181.2 $ 1,828.2 In fiscal 2011, our operations generated $1.5 billion of cash compared to $2.2 billion in fiscal 2010. The $654 million decrease primarily reflects an $864 million increased use of cash for net current assets and liabilities and a $200 million voluntary contribution to our principal domestic pension plans, partially offset by the $268 million increase in net earnings and a $183 million change in deferred income taxes primarily related to our pension plan contribution and a change in tax legislation related to depreciation deductions. The increased use of cash for net current assets and liabilities reflects lower other current liabilities, primarily reflecting changes in the timing of marketing activities and related accruals and a payment of $385 million in fiscal 2011 related to our IRS settlement as described in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. In addition, inventories used $223 million more cash in fiscal 2011 reflecting increased input costs. We strive to grow core working capital at or below our growth in net sales. For fiscal 2011, core working capital increased 16 percent, compared to net sales growth of 2 percent, reflecting cost inflation and higher inventories. In fiscal 2010, core working capital increased 3 percent, compared to net sales growth of 1 percent, and in fiscal 2009, core working capital declined 1 percent, compared to net sales growth of 7 percent. In fiscal 2010, our operations generated $2.2 billion of cash compared to $1.8 billion in fiscal 2009, primarily reflecting the $221 million increase in net earnings, including earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Fiscal Year In Millions 2011 2010 2009 Purchases of land, buildings, and equipment $ (648.8 ) $ (649.9 ) $ (562.6 ) Acquisitions (123.3 ) Investments in affiliates, net (1.8 ) (130.7 ) 5.9 Proceeds from disposal of land, buildings, and equipment 4.1 7.4 4.1 Proceeds from divestitures of product lines 34.4 244.7 Proceeds from insurance settlement 41.3 Other, net 20.3 52.0 (22.3 ) Net cash used by investing activities $ (715.1 ) $ (721.2 ) $ (288.9 ) In fiscal 2011, cash used by investing activities decreased by $6 million from fiscal 2010. The decreased use of cash reflects $25 million of proceeds from the divestiture of a foodservice frozen baked goods product line in our International segment and $9 million of proceeds from the sale of a pie shell product line in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment in fiscal 2011. In addition, in fiscal 27 2011, we paid $85 million for the acquisition of the Mountain High yoghurt business for our U.S. Retail segment and $38 million for the acquisition of the Pasta Master meals business in Australia for our International segment. We also invested $131 million in affiliates in fiscal 2010, mainly our CPW joint venture, to repay local borrowings. In fiscal 2010, cash used by investing activities increased by $432 million from fiscal 2009 primarily due to $245 million of proceeds from the sale of certain product lines in fiscal 2009 and $41 million of insurance proceeds received in fiscal 2009 from the settlement with the insurance carrier covering the loss at our La Salte a pasta manufacturing facility in Argentina. We also invested $131 million in affiliates in fiscal 2010. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $670 million in fiscal 2012, excluding any expenditures required to support Yoplait S.A.S. These expenditures support initiatives that are expected to: increase manufacturing capacity for grain snacks; continue HMM initiatives throughout the supply chain; expand International production capacity for Bugles , Nature Valley bars and H agen-Dazs products; and integrate fiscal 2011 acquisitions. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Fiscal Year In Millions 2011 2010 2009 Change in notes payable $ (742.6 ) $ 235.8 $ (1,390.5 ) Issuance of long-term debt 1,200.0 1,850.0 Payment of long-term debt (7.4 ) (906.9 ) (370.3 ) Proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options 410.4 388.8 305.2 Tax benefit on exercised options 106.2 114.0 89.1 Purchases of common stock for treasury (1,163.5 ) (691.8 ) (1,296.4 ) Dividends paid (729.4 ) (643.7 ) (579.5 ) Other, net (10.3 ) (12.1 ) Net cash used by financing activities $ (936.6 ) $ (1,503.8 ) $ (1,404.5 ) Net cash used by financing activities decreased by $567 million in fiscal 2011. In May 2011, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 1.55 percent fixed-rate notes and $400 million aggregate principal amount of floating-rate notes, both due May 16, 2014. The proceeds of these notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper. The floating-rate notes bear interest equal to three-month LIBOR plus 35 basis points, subject to quarterly reset. Interest on the floating-rate notes is payable quarterly in arrears. Interest on the fixed-rate notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. The fixed-rate notes may be redeemed at our option at any time for a specified make whole amount. These notes are senior unsecured, unsubordinated obligations that include a change of control repurchase provision. In June 2010, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.4 percent notes due 2040. The proceeds of these notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper. Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. These notes may be redeemed at our option at any time for a specified make whole amount. These notes are senior unsecured, unsubordinated obligations that include a change of control repurchase provision. In May 2010, we paid $437 million to repurchase in a cash tender offer $400 million of our previously issued debt. We repurchased $221 million of our 6.0 percent notes due 2012 and $179 million of our 5.65 percent notes due 2012. We issued commercial paper to fund the repurchase. In January 2009, we issued $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.65 percent notes due 2019. In August 2008, we issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25 percent notes due 2013. The proceeds of these notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper. Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. These notes may be redeemed at our option at any time for a specified make-whole amount. These notes are senior unsecured, unsubordinated obligations that include a change of control repurchase provision. During fiscal 2011, we repurchased 32 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1,164 million. During fiscal 2010, we repurchased 21 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $692 million. During fiscal 2009, we repurchased 40 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1,296 million. On June 28, 2010, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million shares of our common stock. Purchases under the authorization can be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including the use of call options and other derivative instruments, Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, and accelerated repurchase programs. The authorization has no specified termination date. 28 Dividends paid in fiscal 2011 totaled $729 million, or $1.12 per share, a 17 percent per share increase from fiscal 2010. Dividends paid in fiscal 2010 totaled $644 million, or $0.96 per share, a 12 percent per share increase from fiscal 2009 dividends of $0.86 per share. On June 28, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase to an annual rate of $1.22 per share, a 9 percent increase from the rate paid in fiscal 2011. CAPITAL RESOURCES Total capital consisted of the following: May 29, May 30, In Millions 2011 2010 Notes payable $ 311.3 $ 1,050.1 Current portion of long-term debt 1,031.3 107.3 Long-term debt 5,542.5 5,268.5 Total debt 6,885.1 6,425.9 Noncontrolling interests 246.7 245.1 Stockholders equity 6,365.5 5,402.9 Total capital $ 13,497.3 $ 12,073.9 The increase in total capital from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to net earnings attributable to General Mills of $1.8 billion and an increase in current and long-term debt, partially offset by a decrease in notes payable. The following table details the fee-paid committed and uncommitted credit lines we had available as of May 29, 2011: In Billions Amount Credit facility expiring: October 2012 $ 1.8 October 2013 1.1 Total committed credit facilities 2.9 Uncommitted credit facilities 0.3 Total committed and uncommitted credit facilities $ 3.2 To ensure availability of funds, we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding short-term borrowings. Commercial paper is a continuing source of short-term financing. We issue commercial paper in the United States and Europe. Our commercial paper borrowings are supported by $2.9 billion of fee-paid committed credit lines, consisting of a $1.8 billion facility expiring in October 2012 and a $1.1 billion facility expiring in October 2013. We also have $312 million in uncommitted credit lines that support our foreign operations. As of May 29, 2011, there were no amounts outstanding on the fee-paid committed credit lines and $119 million was drawn on the uncommitted lines. The credit facilities contain several covenants, including a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 2.5. Certain of our long-term debt agreements, our credit facilities, and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May 29, 2011, we were in compliance with all of these covenants. On July 1, 2011, we acquired a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplait S.A.S. and a 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques S.A.S. for an aggregate purchase price of $1.2 billion. Yoplait S.A.S. operates yogurt businesses in several countries, including France and the United Kingdom, and oversees franchise relationships around the world. Yoplait Marques S.A.S. holds the worldwide rights to Yoplait and related trademarks. We financed this transaction using cash available in our foreign subsidiaries and commercial paper. We have $1,031 million of long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current, primarily $1,020 million of 6.0 percent notes which mature on February 15, 2012. We believe that cash flows from operations, together with available short- and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. As of May 29, 2011, our total debt, including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges, was 77 percent in fixed-rate and 23 percent in floating-rate instruments, compared to 75 percent in fixed-rate and 25 percent in floating-rate instruments on May 30, 2010. The change in the fixed-rate and floating-rate percentages was driven by the issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate debt and a decrease in notes payable in fiscal 2011. 29 We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC covering the sale of debt securities. The shelf registration statement will expire in December 2011. Growth in return on average total capital is one of our key performance measures (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our discussion of this measure, which is not defined by GAAP). Return on average total capital decreased from 13.8 percent in fiscal 2010 to 13.7 percent in fiscal 2011 primarily reflecting higher working capital. We also believe that the ratio of fixed charge coverage and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt are important measures of our financial strength. Our fixed charge coverage ratio in fiscal 2011 was 7.03 compared to 6.42 in fiscal 2010. The measure increased from fiscal 2010 as earnings before income taxes and after-tax earnings from joint ventures increased by $224 million and fixed charges decreased by $9 million, driven mainly by lower interest expense. Our operating cash flow to debt ratio decreased 11.7 percentage points to 22.2 percent in fiscal 2011, driven by a decrease in cash flows from operations and an increase in our year-end debt balance. In April 2002, we contributed assets to our subsidiary GMC. In exchange for the contribution of these assets, GMC issued its managing membership interest and its limited preferred membership interests to certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries. We continue to hold the entire managing membership interest, and therefore direct the operations of GMC. The third-party holder of the Class A Interests in GMC receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate, currently equal to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 65 basis points. The preferred return rate of the Class A Interests is adjusted every five years through a negotiated agreement between the Class A Interest holder and GMC, or through a remarketing auction. The next remarketing is scheduled to occur in June 2012 and thereafter in five-year intervals. The holder of the Class A Interests may initiate a liquidation of GMC under certain circumstances, including, without limitation, the bankruptcy of GMC or its subsidiaries, GMC failure to deliver the preferred distributions on the Class A Interests, GMC failure to comply with portfolio requirements, breaches of certain covenants, lowering of our senior debt rating below either Baa3 by Moody or BBB- by Standard & Poor s, and a failed attempt to remarket the Class A Interests as a result of GMC failure to assist in such remarketing. In the event of a liquidation of GMC, each member of GMC will receive the amount of its then current capital account balance. The managing member may avoid liquidation by exercising its option to purchase the Class A Interests. We may exercise our option to purchase the Class A Interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value, plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed make-whole amount. If we purchase these interests, any change in the unrelated third-party investor capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate EPS in that period. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS As of May 29, 2011, we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of $591 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries, and guarantees and comfort letters of $341 million for the debt and other obligations of non-consolidated affiliates, mainly CPW. In addition, off-balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under non-cancelable operating leases, which totaled $261 million as of May 29, 2011. As of May 29, 2011, we had invested in six variable interest entities (VIEs). We determined whether or not we were the primary beneficiary (PB) of each VIE using a qualitative assessment that considered the VIE purpose and design, the involvement of each of the interest holders, and the risks and benefits of the VIE. We have an interest in a contract manufacturer at our former facility in Geneva, Illinois. We are the PB and have consolidated this entity. This entity had property and equipment with a carrying value of $14 million and long-term debt of $15 million as of May 29, 2011. The liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating this entity do not represent additional claims on our general assets. The remaining five VIEs, two of which we are not the PB, are not material to our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity as of and for the year ended May 29, 2011. We have provided minimal financial or other support to VIEs during the current period and there are no arrangements related to VIEs that would require us to provide significant financial support in the future. Our defined benefit plans in the United States are subject to the requirements of the Pension Protection Act (PPA). The PPA revised the basis and methodology for determining defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements as well as maximum contributions to and benefits paid from tax-qualified plans. Most of these provisions were applicable to our domestic defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2011 on a phased-in basis. The PPA may ultimately require us to make additional contributions to our domestic plans. We did not make a contribution to our principal defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2010. We made $200 million of voluntary contributions to our principal domestic plans in fiscal 2011. We do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2012. Actual fiscal 2012 contributions could exceed our current projections, and may be influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts or by changes in regulatory requirements. Additionally, our projections concerning timing of the PPA funding requirements are subject to change and may be influenced by factors such as general market conditions affecting trust asset performance, interest rates, and our future decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the PPA. 30 The following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations, including payments due by period: Payments Due by Fiscal Year 2017 and In Millions Total 2012 2013 - 14 2015 - 16 Thereafter Long-term debt (a) $ 6,565.1 $ 1,030.1 $ 2,134.8 $ 750.1 $ 2,650.1 Accrued interest 114.0 114.0 Operating leases (b) 261.4 74.4 88.9 48.7 49.4 Capital leases 5.9 2.2 2.7 0.8 0.2 Purchase obligations (c) 2,791.4 2,457.6 193.9 74.8 65.1 Total contractual obligations 9,737.8 3,678.3 2,420.3 874.4 2,764.8 Other long-term obligations (d) 1,731.1 Total long-term obligations $ 11,468.9 $ 3,678.3 $ 2,420.3 $ 874.4 $ 2,764.8 (a) Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long-term debt and do not include $3 million for domestic capital leases or $6 million for net unamortized bond premiums and discounts and fair value adjustments.

For purposes of this table, arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure, and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above. (d) The fair value of our interest rate, foreign exchange and grain derivative contracts with a payable position to the counterparty was $86 million as of May 29, 2011, based on fair market values as of that date. Future changes in market values will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or received to settle those instruments in the future. Other long-term obligations mainly consist of liabilities for accrued compensation and benefits, including the underfunded status of certain of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment plans, and miscellaneous liabilities. We expect to pay $18 million of benefits from our unfunded postemployment benefit plans and $10 million of deferred compensation in fiscal 2012. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount of these payments beyond fiscal 2012. As of May 29, 2011, our total liability for uncertain tax positions and the associated accrued interest and penalties was $280 million. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Our significant accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations. These estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement and postemployment benefits. Promotional Expenditures Our promotional activities are conducted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers. These activities include: payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf, such as advertising or in-store displays; discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices; payments to gain distribution of new products; coupons, contests, and other incentives; and media and advertising expenditures. The media and advertising expenditures are generally recognized as expense when the advertisement airs. The cost of payments to customers and other consumer-related activities are recognized as the related revenue is recorded, which generally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels. These estimates are made based on the forecasted customer sales, the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities, and other factors. Differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are normally insignificant and are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. Our accrued trade, coupon, and consumer marketing liabilities were $463 million as of May 29, 2011, and $555 million as of May 30, 2010. Because our total promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as a reduction of revenues) are significant, if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a material effect on our results of operations. Valuation of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have identifiable cash flows independent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the 31 carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals, as appropriate. Intangible Assets Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units. We compare the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit. Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we revalue all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, excluding goodwill, to determine if the fair value of the net assets is greater than the net assets including goodwill. If the fair value of the net assets is less than the carrying amount of net assets including goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our annual long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. We performed our fiscal 2011 assessment as of November 29, 2010 and determined there was no impairment of goodwill for any of our reporting units as their related fair values were substantially in excess of their carrying values. We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets, mainly intangible assets primarily associated with the Pillsbury , Totino , Progresso , Green Giant , Old El Paso , and H agen-Dazs brands, are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. We performed our fiscal 2011 assessment of our brand intangibles as of November 29, 2010. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands was based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which included: projected revenues from our annual long-range plan; assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands; and a discount rate. As of our assessment date, there was no impairment of any of our indefinite-lived intangible assets as their related fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values. As of May 29, 2011, we had $10.5 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. While we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital could result in significant impairment losses and amortization expense. In addition, we assess our investments in our joint ventures if we have reason to believe an impairment may have occurred including, but not limited to, ongoing operating losses, projected decreases in earnings, increases in the weighted average cost of capital or significant business disruptions. The significant assumptions used to estimate fair value include revenue growth and profitability, royalty rates, capital spending, depreciation and taxes, foreign currency exchange rates and a discount rate. By their nature, these projections and assumptions are uncertain. If we were to determine the current fair value of our investment was less than the carrying value of the investment, then we would assess if the shortfall was of a temporary or permanent nature and write down the investment to its fair value if we concluded the impairment is other than temporary. After the earthquakes and tsunami in Japan in March 2011, we assessed the fair value of our investment in HDJ and determined that it exceeded the carrying value by approximately 5 percent. As of May 29, 2011, the carrying value of HDJ consisted of our investment of $61 million and goodwill of $524 million. Sustained declines in business results or an increase in the weighted average cost of capital may adversely affect the fair value of our investment in HDJ, and could result in a future impairment to our investment. Stock-based Compensation The valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements. Annually, we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. We estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility over the expected term of the option, excluding time periods of volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in estimating our stock price volatility. We also have considered, but did not use, implied volatility in our estimate, because trading activity in options on our stock, especially those with tenors of greater than 6 months, is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility. If all other assumptions are held constant, a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2011 volatility assumption would increase the grant-date fair value of our fiscal 2011 option awards by 5 percent. 32 Our expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model. Separate groups of employees have similar historical exercise behavior and therefore were aggregated into a single pool for valuation purposes. The weighted-average expected term for all employee groups is presented in the table below. An increase in the expected term by 1 year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would change the grant date fair value by 16 percent. The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows: Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 Estimated fair values of stock options granted $ 4.12 $ 3.20 $ 4.70 Assumptions: Risk-free interest rate 2.9 % 3.7 % 4.4 % Expected term 8.5 years 8.5 years 8.5 years Expected volatility 18.5 % 18.9 % 16.1 % Dividend yield 3.0 % 3.4 % 2.7 % To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to final intrinsic values. However, these differences can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options, as explained in the following two paragraphs. Furthermore, historical data has a significant bearing on our forward-looking assumptions. Significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then significantly impact the year-over-year comparability of stock-based compensation expense. Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a financing cash flow. The actual impact on future years financing cash flow will depend, in part, on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise-date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant-date fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes. Realized windfall tax benefits are credited to additional paid-in capital within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized shortfall tax benefits (amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings) are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits, if any, and then charged directly to income tax expense, potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate. We calculated a cumulative amount of windfall tax benefits from post-1995 fiscal years for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits and currently have sufficient cumulative windfall tax benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls, such that we do not currently expect future earnings to be affected by this provision. However, as employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control, it is possible that materially different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. Income Taxes We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change. We are subject to federal income taxes in the United States as well as various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our liabilities for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. We adjust these liabilities, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position would usually require the use of cash. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions include the United States (federal and state) and Canada. The IRS has completed its review of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2008 and prior and has proposed adjustments related to the amount of research and development tax credits claimed. We have appealed these proposed adjustments. During fiscal 2011, we reached a settlement with the IRS concerning certain corporate income tax adjustments for fiscal years 2002 to 33 2008. The adjustments primarily relate to the amount of capital loss, depreciation, and amortization we reported as a result of the sale of noncontrolling interests in our GMC subsidiary. As a result, we recorded a $108 million reduction in our total liabilities for uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2011. We made payments totaling $385 million in fiscal 2011 related to this settlement. In addition, we made a payment of $18 million in fiscal 2009 related to adjustments made at the IRS exam level for audits of fiscal years 2004 to 2006. Also during fiscal 2011, the Superior Court of the State of California issued an adverse decision concerning our state income tax apportionment calculations. As a result, we recorded a $12 million increase in our total liabilities for uncertain tax positions. We believe our positions are supported by substantial technical authority and have appealed this decision. We do not expect to make a payment related to this matter until it is definitively resolved. In fiscal 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit issued an opinion reversing a district court decision rendered in fiscal 2008. As a result, we recorded $53 million (including interest) of income tax expense in fiscal 2009 related to the reversal of cumulative income tax benefits from this uncertain tax matter recognized in fiscal years 1992 through 2008. All outstanding liabilities associated with this matter were paid during fiscal 2011. Various tax examinations by United States state taxing authorities could be conducted for any open tax year, which vary by jurisdiction, but are generally from 3 to 5 years. Currently, several state examinations are in progress. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has completed its review of our income tax returns in Canada for fiscal years 2003 to 2005. The CRA has raised assessments for these years that we are currently appealing. We believe our positions are supported by substantial technical authority and are vigorously defending our positions. We do not anticipate that any United States or Canadian tax adjustments will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations. As of May 29, 2011, our total liability for uncertain tax positions and the associated accrued interest and penalties was $280 million. We do not expect to pay any amounts related to uncertain tax positions or accrued interest in the next 12 months. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement and Postemployment Benefit Plans Defined Benefit Pension Plans We have defined benefit pension plans covering most United States, Canadian, and United Kingdom employees. Benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation. Benefits for hourly employees include various monthly amounts for each year of credited service. Our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws. We made $200 million of voluntary contributions to our principal domestic plans in fiscal 2011. We do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2012. Our principal domestic retirement plan covering salaried employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would be allocated to active participants if the plan is terminated within five years of a change in control. Other Postretirement Benefit Plans We also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to the majority of our United States and Canadian retirees. The salaried health care benefit plan is contributory, with retiree contributions based on years of service. We make decisions to fund related trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis. We did not make voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2011. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, was signed into law in March 2010. We have not fully evaluated the effect of the Act, including possible modifications to provider plans, but it could affect the future cost of our benefit plans. Postemployment Benefit Plans Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits to former or inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and members of our Board of Directors, including severance and certain other benefits payable upon death. We recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service. Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service (such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded. We recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants active working life. Accordingly, we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations. Assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans, and the health care cost trend rates. 34 Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan, however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. The investment objective for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit obligations to participants at a reasonable cost to us. Our goal is to optimize the long-term return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk. The defined benefit pension and other postretirement portfolios are broadly diversified across asset classes. Within asset classes, the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations. For the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the long-term investment policy allocations are: 30 percent to equities in the United States; 20 percent to international equities; 10 percent to private equities; 30 percent to fixed income; and 10 percent to real assets (real estate, energy, and timber). The actual allocations to these asset classes may vary tactically around the long-term policy allocations based on relative market valuations. Our historical investment returns (compound annual growth rates) for our United States defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan assets were 20.3 percent, 5.6 percent, 7.5 percent, 9.2 percent, and 10.0 percent for the 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 year periods ended May 29, 2011. Our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the United States have an expected return on plan assets of 9.6 percent. On a weighted-average basis, the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 9.53 percent for fiscal 2011, 9.55 percent for fiscal 2010, and 9.55 percent for fiscal 2009. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by 50 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by $24 million for fiscal 2012. A market-related valuation basis is used to reduce year-to-year expense volatility. The market-related valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income. Discount Rates Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of the last day of our fiscal year for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We also use the same discount rates to determine defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan income and expense for the following fiscal year. We work with our actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the top quartile of AA-rated corporate bond yields, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions. Our weighted-average discount rates were as follows: Weighted-Average Discount Rates Defined Other Benefit Postretirement Postemployment Pension Benefit Benefit Plans Plans Plans Obligations as of May 29, 2011, and fiscal 2012 expense 5.45 % 5.35 % 4.77 % Obligations as of May 30, 2010, and fiscal 2011 expense 5.85 % 5.80 % 5.12 % Fiscal 2010 expense 7.49 % 7.45 % 7.06 % Lowering the discount rates by 50 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2012 by approximately $36.9 million. All obligation-related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants. Health Care Cost Trend Rates We review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to 35 remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 8.5 percent for all retirees. Rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 5.2 percent is reached in 2019 for all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. A one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects: One One Percentage Percentage Point Point In Millions Increase Decrease Effect on the aggregate of the service and interest cost components in fiscal 2012 $ 6.2 $ (5.4 ) Effect on the other postretirement accumulated benefit obligation as of May 29, 2011 82.4 (73.6 ) Any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims. Once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over 15 years, resulting in at least the minimum amortization required being recorded. Financial Statement Impact In fiscal 2011, we recorded net defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan expense of $95 million compared to $11 million of income in fiscal 2010 and $4 million of income in fiscal 2009. As of May 29, 2011, we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of $1.3 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and $180 million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans, mainly as the result of declines in the values of plan assets. These unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension expense and increases in postretirement expense since they currently exceed the corridors defined by GAAP. We use the Retirement Plans (RP) 2000 Mortality Table projected forward to our plans measurement dates to calculate the year-end defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit obligations and annual expense. Actual future net defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance, changes in future discount rates, changes in health care cost trend rates, and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 was signed into law in March 2010. The Act codifies health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 to 2018 with many provisions in the Act requiring the issuance of additional guidance from various government agencies. Estimates of the future impacts of several of the Act provisions are incorporated into our postretirement benefit liability including the elimination of lifetime maximums and the imposition of an excise tax on high cost health plans. These changes resulted in a $24 million increase in our postretirement benefit liability in fiscal 2010. Given the complexity of the Act, the extended time period over which the reforms will be implemented, and the unknown impact of future regulatory guidance, further financial impacts to our postretirement benefit liability and related future expense may occur. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance for fair value measurements providing common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, which for us is the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. In June 2011, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for the presentation of other comprehensive income (OCI). This guidance requires entities to present net income and OCI in either a single continuous statement or in separate consecutive statements. The guidance does not change the components of net income or OCI, when OCI should be reclassified to net income, or the earnings per share calculation. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2013. This guidance will not impact our results of operations or financial position. 36 NON-GAAP MEASURES We have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. Each of the measures is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the Board of Director measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. Management and the Board of Directors believe that these measures provide useful information to investors, and include these measures in other communications to investors. For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure, an explanation of why our management or the Board of Directors believes the non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors, and any additional purposes for which our management or Board of Directors uses the non-GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable GAAP measure. Total Segment Operating Profit Management and the Board of Directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate segment performance. A reconciliation of this measure to operating profit, the relevant GAAP measure, is included in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Diluted EPS Excluding Certain Items Affecting Comparability Management and the Board of Directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate earnings performance on a comparable year-over-year basis. The adjustments are either items resulting from infrequently occurring events or items that, in management judgment, significantly affect the year-over-year assessment of operating results. The reconciliation of diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability to diluted EPS, the relevant GAAP measure, follows: Fiscal Year Per Share Data 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 Diluted earnings per share, as reported $ 2.70 $ 2.24 $ 1.90 $ 1.85 $ 1.59 Mark-to-market effects (a) (0.09 ) 0.01 0.11 (0.05 ) Divestitures gain, net (b) (0.06 ) Gain from insurance settlement (c) (0.04 ) Uncertain tax items (d) (0.13 ) 0.08 (0.04 ) Tax charge - health care reform (e) 0.05 Diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items affecting comparability $ 2.48 $ 2.30 $ 1.99 $ 1.76 $ 1.59 (a) Net (gain) loss from mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories. (b) Net gain on divestitures of certain product lines. (c) Gain on settlement with insurance carrier covering the loss of a manufacturing facility in Argentina. (d) Effects of court decisions and audit settlements on uncertain tax matters. (e) Enactment date charges related to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, affecting deferred taxes associated with Medicare Part D subsidies. 37 Return on Average Total Capital Management and the Board of Directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is important for assessing the utilization of capital and it eliminates certain items which affect year-to-year comparability.
