Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Note numbers refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We discuss below the results of our operations for fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 and the results of our operations for fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. We discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under Capital Resources and Liquidity. Outlook We believe that CVI will continue to compete successfully in the worldwide contact lens market with its disposable spherical, phosphorylcholine (PC) Technology , silicone hydrogel and specialty contact lenses. We believe that market demographics are favorable with the reported incidence of myopia continuing to increase worldwide and with the teenage population in the United States, the age when most contact lens wear begins, projected to grow considerably over the next two decades. CVI expects greater market penetration in Europe and Asia as practitioners increasingly prescribe more specialty lenses. We are in the process of developing and launching a number of new contact lens products to enhance CVI broad and competitive product lines. New products planned for introduction over the next two years include additional lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel and PC Technology materials and new lens designs, including toric and multifocal lenses. We also plan to launch our Proclear 1 Day, a single-use spherical lens, in Japan during the first calendar quarter of 2009. Sales of contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials, a major product material in the industry, have grown significantly. The Company has launched Biofinity and Avaira, silicone hydrogel spherical contact lens products, in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific, excluding Japan. We plan to launch a monthly silicone hydrogel toric lens, under the Biofinity label, in the first quarter of 2009 and a two-week silicone hydrogel toric, under the Avaira label, at the end of calendar 2009. While initial customer reaction from Biofinity and Avaira has been favorable, our future growth may be limited by our late entry into the silicone hydrogel market. We have achieved sufficient manufacturing capacity of Biofinity and Avaira to support our business plan. For both products, however, we face challenges associated with manufacturing using a new material and ramping up production volumes, reducing costs and improving efficiencies. We believe that our ability to succeed with silicone hydrogel products will be an important factor affecting future levels of sales growth and profitability. While we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for the worldwide contact lens market, recent events affecting the economy as a whole, including the uncertainty and instability of the U.S. and international credit markets and recessionary pressures in the United States, have lowered our expectations for fiscal year 2009. We experienced slower than expected sales in October and November of 2008, and we are receiving anecdotal evidence that consumers may be changing their buying habits and extending the use of contact lenses beyond prescribed limits. We believe that these changes are temporary responses to current economic conditions, and we expect the contact lens market to recover with a recovery in the broader economy. 39 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Regarding capital resources, we believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand of $1.9 million plus cash from operating activities and existing credit facilities will fund future operations, capital expenditures, cash dividends and small acquisitions. We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 of approximately $125 million to $140 million, primarily to expand silicone hydrogel and single-use lens manufacturing capacity and for information technology. 2008 Compared with 2007 Highlights: 2008 vs. 2007 Net sales up 12% to $1.06 billion from $950.6 million in fiscal year 2007. Gross profit up 17%; gross margin increased to 57% of net sales from 55%. Operating income up to $127.0 million from $45.9 million. We recorded tax expense of $10.7 million for fiscal year 2008 compared to $11.9 million for fiscal year 2007. Diluted earnings per share $1.43 up from a loss per share of 25 cents. Results for 2008 include $30.6 million of production start up costs, $1.9 million of distribution rationalization costs, $2.5 million of other restructuring and integration costs, $3.4 million of intellectual property and securities litigation costs and $2.9 million write-off of the debt issuance costs of our amended and restated credit agreement. Results from 2007 included $119.1 million of similar items, discussed below.

CVI develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of soft contact lenses for the worldwide vision care market. CSI develops, manufactures and markets medical devices, diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories used primarily by gynecologists and obstetricians. 40 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Our consolidated net sales grew by 12% in 2008 and 11% in 2007. CVI achieved 12% net sales growth primarily on growth of disposable lenses, including single-use lenses, and the sales of our silicone hydrogel lenses, Biofinity and Avaira. CSI achieved 9% net sales growth in 2008 primarily due to 6% organic growth including products marketed directly to hospitals. Net Sales Growth ($ in millions) 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Business unit CVI $ 99.0 12% $ 61.7 8% CSI $ 13.6 9% $ 30.0 24% CVI Net Sales Practitioner and patient preferences in the worldwide contact lens market continue to change. The major shifts are from: Conventional lenses replaced annually to disposable and frequently replaced lenses. Disposable lenses are designed for either daily, two-week or monthly replacement; frequently replaced lenses are designed for replacement after one to three months. Commodity lenses to specialty lenses including toric, multifocal and cosmetic lenses. Commodity spherical lenses to value-added spherical lenses such as continuous wear lenses and lenses to alleviate dry eye symptoms as well as lenses with aspherical optical properties or higher oxygen permeable lenses such as silicone hydrogels. These shifts generally favor CVI product lines of specialty lenses, PC Technology brand spherical lenses, silicone hydrogel spherical lenses and single-use spherical lenses. Additionally, it is important that CVI develop a full range of silicone hydrogel products in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific, excluding Japan. CVI has launched Biofinity and Avaira, its silicone hydrogel spherical lens products in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific. CVI toric products are facing increased pressure due to the launch of silicone hydrogel toric products by its major competitors. CVI has begun production of Biofinity toric, a silicone hydrogel toric lens, and anticipates launching this product in the first calendar quarter of 2009. CVI also plans to launch a second silicone hydrogel toric lens, Avaira toric, by the end of calendar 2009. CVI introduced the following products during 2008: Avaira, a two-week silicone hydrogel spherical lens. Expanded power ranges for Biofinity, a monthly silicone hydrogel spherical lens. Expanded power ranges for Proclear 1 Day, a PC Technology, single-use spherical lens. 41 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Contact lens revenue includes sales of conventional, disposable, long-term extended wear lenses and single-use spherical lenses, some of which are aspherically designed, and specialty lenses toric lenses, cosmetic lenses and multifocal lenses. Aspheric lenses correct for near- and farsightedness and have additional optical properties that help improve visual acuity in low light conditions and can correct low levels of astigmatism and low levels of presbyopia, an age-related vision defect. Toric lens designs correct astigmatism by adding the additional optical properties of cylinder and axis, which correct for irregularities in the shape of the cornea. Cosmetic lenses are opaque and color enhancing lenses that alter the natural appearance of the eye. Multifocal lens designs correct presbyopia. Proclear lenses, manufactured using proprietary phosphorylcholine (PC) Technology , help enhance tissue/device compatibility and offer improved lens comfort.

Americas sales grew 8%, 7% in constant currency, primarily due to market gains of CVI silicone hydrogel lenses, Biofinity and Avaira, PC Technology lenses and single-use lenses. EMEA sales grew 13%, 6% in constant currency, driven by increases in sales of Biofinity, disposable toric and disposable sphere products, including Proclear 1 Day lenses. Sales to the Asia Pacific region grew 24%, 14% in constant currency, primarily due to significant sales growth of single-use and other disposable sphere products, disposable toric products and Biofinity lenses. Net sales growth includes increases in single-use spheres up 45%, at $165.3 million, all disposable spheres up 18% and total spheres up 16%. Biofinity had sales of $50.7 million primarily in Europe and the United States, and Avaira had sales of $7.6 million in the United States. Disposable toric sales grew 11% with total toric sales up 8% and disposable multifocal sales up 26%. CVI line of specialty lenses grew 10%. Older conventional lens products declined 14%, and cosmetic lenses declined 2%. Proclear products continued global market share gains as Proclear toric sales increased 39% to $72.2 million, Proclear spheres, including Biomedics XC and Proclear 1 Day, increased 22% to $124.6 million and Proclear multifocal lenses, including Biomedics XC, increased 40% to $44.4 million. CVI sales growth is driven primarily through increases in the volume of lenses sold as the market continues to move to more frequent replacement. While unit growth and product mix have influenced CVI sales growth, average realized prices by product have not materially influenced sales growth. 42 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) CSI Net Sales CSI net sales increased 9% to $168.3 million with organic sales growth of about 6%. Sales of products marketed directly to hospitals grew 19% and now represent 30% of CSI sales. Women healthcare products used primarily by obstetricians and gynecologists generate 95% of CSI sales. The balance are sales of medical devices outside of women healthcare which CSI does not actively market. While unit growth and product mix have influenced organic sales growth, average realized prices by product have not materially influenced organic sales growth. 2007 Compared with 2006 We began recording share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2006 using the modified prospective transition method whereby prior periods are not restated and do not include such expense. We acquired Ocular on January 6, 2005, and include Ocular in our results from that date. Highlights: 2007 vs. 2006 Net sales up 11% to $950.6 million from $859.0 million in fiscal year 2006. Gross profit down 1%; gross margin decreased to 55% of net sales including production start-up costs and integration and restructuring items, from 61%. Operating income down 59% to $45.9 million from $112.9 million. Operating margin at 5% of net sales including integration and restructuring items. We recorded tax expense of $11.9 million for fiscal year 2007 compared to $7.1 million for fiscal year 2006. Loss per share 25 cents down from diluted earnings per share of $1.44. Results for 2007 include $7.2 million write-off of acquired in-process research and development, $34.4 million of production start up costs, $13.4 million of distribution rationalization costs, $52.8 million of other restructuring and integration costs, $10.4 million of intellectual property and securities litigation costs and $0.9 million write-off of the debt issuance costs of our amended and restated credit agreement. Results from 2006 included $52.7 million of similar items.

AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Net Sales Our consolidated net sales grew by 11% in 2007 and 6% in 2006. CVI achieved 8% net sales growth primarily on growth of disposable lenses, including single-use lenses, and the launch of Biofinity, a silicone hydrogel lens. CSI achieved 24% net sales growth in 2007 driven by acquisitions and organic growth. Net Sales Growth ($ in millions) 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Business unit CVI $ 61.7 8% $ 36.2 5% CSI $ 30.0 24% $ 16.1 15% CVI core product lines of specialty lenses, PC Technology brand spherical lenses, silicone hydrogel spherical lenses and single-use spherical lenses were 70% of CVI worldwide business. Additionally, it is important that CVI develop a range of silicone hydrogel products. CVI has launched Biofinity, its silicone hydrogel lens, with sales in Europe, the United States and Australia and is in the process of expanding its manufacturing capacity to grow sales. CVI anticipates launching a second silicone hydrogel spherical lens in April/May 2008 and commencing the marketing of a silicone hydrogel toric lens at the end of calendar 2008. In addition to CVI silicone hydrogel lens, during 2007 CVI introduced these new products: Biomedics EP , a multifocal lens for emerging presbyopes. Proclear 1 Day, a single-use spherical lens. Proclear toric multifocal, a lens designed to address both astigmatism and presbyopia. CVI Net Sales by Market ($ in millions) 2007 2006 Growth Americas $ 360.5 $ 351.9 2 % Europe 306.4 273.3 12 % Asia Pacific 129.0 109.0 18 % $ 795.9 $ 734.2 8 % CVI worldwide net sales grew 8%, 5% in constant currency. Americas sales grew 2%, the same in constant currency, primarily due to market gains of multifocal and daily disposable lenses offset by the continued market shift in favor of silicone hydrogel products. European sales grew 12%, 3% in constant currency, driven by significant increases in sales of disposable toric and disposable sphere products. Sales to the Asia Pacific region grew 18%, the same in constant currency, primarily due to significant sales growth of single-use and other sphere products and disposable toric products. 44 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Net sales growth includes increases in single-use spheres up 29%, at $113.7 million, all disposable spheres up 10% and total spheres up 8%. Biofinity, CVI silicone hydrogel spherical lens, had sales of $9.8 million primarily in Europe and the United States. Disposable toric sales grew 13% with total toric sales up 8% and disposable multifocal sales up 25%. CVI line of specialty lenses grew 10%. Cosmetic lenses grew 5%, and older conventional lens products declined 13%. Proclear products continued global market share gains as Proclear toric sales increased 47% to $51.9 million, Proclear spheres, including Biomedics XC and Proclear 1 Day, increased 22% to $102.5 million and Proclear multifocal lenses, including Biomedics XC, increased 52% to $31.8 million. CVI sales growth is driven primarily through increases in the volume of lenses sold as the market continues to move to more frequent replacement. While unit growth and product mix have influenced CVI sales growth, average realized prices by product have not materially influenced sales growth. CSI Net Sales CSI net sales increased 24% to $154.8 million with organic sales growth of about 9%. Sales of products marketed directly to hospitals grew 51% and now represent 27% of CSI sales. Women healthcare products used primarily by obstetricians and gynecologists generate more than 94% of CSI sales. The balance are sales of medical devices outside of women healthcare which CSI does not actively market. CSI acquisitions during the year did not significantly affect Cooper consolidated results of operations. While unit growth and product mix have influenced organic sales growth, average realized prices by product have not materially influenced organic sales growth. 2008 Compared to 2007 and 2007 Compared to 2006 Cost of Sales/Gross Profit Gross Profit Percentage of Net Sales 2008 2007 2006 CVI 57% 54% 62% CSI 59% 59% 58% Consolidated 57% 55% 61% CVI margin was 57% in fiscal 2008 compared with 54% in fiscal 2007, the result of changing product mix offset by improvements in manufacturing efficiencies. The changing product mix included a shift to lower margin sphere products, including single-use spheres that represented 18% of lens sales in fiscal 2008 compared to 14% last year. CVI fiscal 2008 cost of sales includes production start-up costs for our new silicone hydrogel products, share-based compensation and integration activities. These costs amounted to $27.9 million or 3% of sales. For fiscal 2007 cost of sales includes production start-up costs for our new silicone hydrogel products, the write off of manufacturing assets associated with Ocular integration activities and share-based compensation expense, which were 9% of sales. CSI margin was 59% in both fiscal 2008 and 2007. Gross margin reflects CSI emphasis on organic growth and continuing efficiencies associated with recent acquisitions offset by higher costs on products sourced outside the United States. 45 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Selling, General and Administrative Expense (SGA) (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 CVI $ 342.5 $ 322.0 $ 284.3 CSI 57.7 54.5 44.7 Headquarters 29.1 31.5 28.8 $ 429.3 $ 408.0 $ 357.8 Consolidated SGA increased by 5% in 2008, 14% in 2007 and 20% in 2006. As a percentage of net sales, consolidated SGA decreased to 40% in 2008, 43% in fiscal 2007 and 42% in 2006. The increase in SGA is primarily due to costs supporting increased sales levels and lenses used in marketing programs offset by increased efficiencies as a result of the rationalization of distribution centers and decreased litigation costs. CVI SGA increased 6% in 2008, primarily due to costs supporting increased sales levels and lenses used in marketing programs and 13% in 2007, primarily due to costs related to the rationalization of distribution centers, lenses used in marketing programs and intellectual property litigation. SGA as a percentage of net sales decreased to 38% in 2008 from 40% in 2007 and 39% in 2006. During fiscal 2007, we were engaged in litigation with regard to our silicone hydrogel product and certain lens design patents. In November 2007, we reached a global settlement agreement with CIBA Vision, the eye care unit of Novartis AG, that resolves all disputes with respect to current patent infringement litigation between the companies. Under the terms of the settlement, the companies have agreed to cross license rights to these patents, and CVI has agreed to pay a royalty on its future net U.S. contact lens sales of Biofinity and Avaira until 2014 and on net sales outside of the United States until 2016. CSI 2008 SGA increased 6% over 2007, which supported the 9% increase in sales, and 2007 SGA increased 22% over 2006. Selling and distributing costs increased to support the emphasis on organic sales growth. Corporate headquarters SGA, which decreased 8% to $29.1 million in 2008 but increased 9% to $31.5 million in 2007 were 3% of consolidated net sales in both periods. The decrease in 2008 was primarily due to expense recovery related to forfeitures of share-based awards. The growth in 2007 was primarily due to share-based compensation expense. The growth since 2006 includes continued expenses for projects and staff to maintain the Company global trading arrangement and costs to comply with corporate governance requirements. Research and Development Expense Research and development (R&D) expense in 2008 decreased 11% from 2007 and increased 15% over 2006 and was 3% of sales in 2008, and 4% of sales in both periods for 2007 and 2006. R&D expense was $35.5 million in 2008, $39.9 million in 2007 and $34.5 million in 2006. R&D expense included acquired in-process research and development of $7.2 million in 2007 for CSI. 46 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) CVI research and development expenditures were $30.7 million, up 11% in 2008, and $27.6 million in 2007, up 17%. CVI research and development activities include programs to develop disposable silicone hydrogel products and product lines utilizing PC Technology . CSI research and development expenditures were $4.7 million, down 7% in 2008, and $5.1 million, up 45% in 2007, net of acquired in-process R&D. CSI research and development activities include the upgrade and redesign of many CSI osteoporosis, in-vitro fertilization, incontinence and assisted reproductive technology products and other obstetrical and gynecological product development activities. Restructuring Expense Restructuring expenses were $1.5 million in 2008 down from $9.7 million in 2007 as CVI completed the integration of Ocular. In connection with the January 6, 2005, acquisition of Ocular, CVI has progressed through our integration plan, optimizing operational synergies of the combined companies including integrating duplicate facilities and expanding utilization of preferred manufacturing and distribution practices. As of October 31, 2008, the total restructuring costs under this integration plan were $49.1 million, of which approximately $30 million were cash related, and are reported as charges to cost of sales or restructuring costs in our Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. Amortization of Intangibles Amortization of intangibles was $16.8 million in 2008, $16.2 million in 2007 and $14.3 million in 2006. Amortization expense increased in both fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 due to acquired intangible assets. Operating Income Operating income grew $14.1 million, or 12%, between 2006 and 2008, increasing 177% or $81.1 million in 2008 after declining 59% or $67.0 million in 2007.

AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Interest Expense Interest expense increased 19% to $50.8 million in 2008, 14% to $42.7 million in 2007 and 26% to $37.3 million in 2006. Excluding the write-off of $3.0 million of unamortized costs related to the repurchase of our 2.625% Convertible Senior Debentures, interest expense increased 12% in 2008. The increases in interest expense are primarily due to higher average debt balances to support capital investments. We had $861.4 million in loans on our credit facility on October 31, 2008, compared to $717.0 million outstanding on October 31, 2007. Other Income (Expense), Net Years Ended October 31, (In thousands) 2008 2007 2006 Interest income $ 298 $ 474 $ 386 Foreign exchange gain (loss) 387 (3,047 ) (1,417 ) Other (expense) income (657 ) 74 (1,201 ) $ 28 $ (2,499 ) $ (2,232 ) Provision for Income Taxes We recorded tax expense of $10.7 million for fiscal year 2008 compared to $11.9 million for fiscal year 2007. Our geographic mix of income changed during 2008, with a decrease in profitability in high tax jurisdictions offset by certain expenses associated with the Ocular integration plan that impacted jurisdictions with lower tax rates. Share-Based Compensation Plans The Company grants various stock-based compensation awards, including stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units. The share-based compensation and related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements in fiscal year 2008 was $14.9 million and $4.0 million, respectively, compared to $17.7 million and $4.3 million, respectively, if fiscal year 2007. As of October 31, 2008, there was $37.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options and restricted stock units, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining vesting period of 2.03 years for nonvested stock options and 2.17 years for restricted stock units. Cash received from options exercised under all share-based compensation arrangements for fiscal 2008 and 2007 was $6.3 million and $9.3 million, respectively. The Company estimates the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model, which requires management to make estimates regarding expected option life, stock price volatility and other assumptions. Groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The Company estimates stock option forfeitures based on historical data for each employee grouping, and adjusts the rate to expected forfeitures periodically. The adjustment of the forfeiture rate will result in a cumulative catch-up adjustment in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. During fiscal year 2008, these adjustments totaled $3.2 million. 48 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 2008 Highlights Operating cash flow $96.5 million, compared to $134.0 million in 2007. Expenditures for purchases of property, plant and equipment $124.9 million, compared to $183.6 million in 2007. Cash payments for acquisitions totaled $3.9 million, compared to $81.0 million in 2007. Net cash inflow from long-term debt totaling $29.4 million compared to $110.8 million in 2007. Comparative Statistics Years Ended October 31, ($ in millions) 2008 2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1.9 $ 3.2 Total assets $ 2,587.6 $ 2,596.2 Working capital $ 270.6 $ 231.0 Total debt $ 904.8 $ 876.6 Stockholders equity $ 1,417.1 $ 1,459.5 Ratio of debt to equity 0.64:1 0.60:1 Debt as a percentage of total capitalization 39% 38% Operating Cash Flows Cash flow provided from operating activities continued as Cooper major source of liquidity, totaling $96.5 million in fiscal 2008 and $134.0 million in 2007. Operating cash flow decreased as we have utilized cash to build inventory in support of new product launches, including lenses for use in marketing programs, payment of income taxes and reduction of accounts payable, net of accounts payable related to capital expenditures. The increase in working capital in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to our adoption of FIN 48, which resulted in a reclassification of certain short-term tax liabilities to long term (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements) and the building of inventories to support new product launches and increasing sales levels. Increases in our long-term borrowings and accounts receivable and a decrease in other accrued liabilities also contributed to the increase. Cash used to pay for capital equipment, while significantly less than the prior year, reduced working capital. At the end of fiscal 2008, Cooper inventory months on hand (MOH) were 8.0 compared to 5.9 at fiscal year-end 2007. However, our adjusted fiscal 2007 MOH was 7.4, net of $27.3 million of charges to costs of sales recorded in our fiscal fourth quarter 2007 associated with our Ocular integration plan, as we continued to build inventory in support of new product launches and distribution center consolidations. Also, our days sales outstanding (DSO) decreased to 58 days at October 31, 2008, from 60 days at October 31, 2007. Based on our experience and knowledge of our customers and our analysis of inventoried products and product levels, we believe that our accounts receivable and inventories are recoverable. 49 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Investing Cash Flows The cash outflow of $128.8 million from investing activities in fiscal 2008 was driven by payments of $3.9 million for acquisitions and capital expenditures of $124.9 million, used primarily to expand manufacturing capacity, consolidate distribution centers and continue the rollout of new information systems. Financing Cash Flows The cash inflow of $31.2 million from financing activities in fiscal 2008 was driven by net proceeds from long-term debt of $29.4 million and $6.3 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by payment of short-term debt of $3.5 million and dividends on our common stock of $2.7 million paid in the first and third quarters of 2008. Risk Management Most of our operations outside the United States have their local currency as their functional currency. We are exposed to risks caused by changes in foreign exchange, principally our pound sterling, euro and Japanese yen-denominated debt and receivables, and from operations in foreign currencies. We have taken steps to minimize our balance sheet exposure. Although we enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our debt or receivables obligations, these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely. We are also exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates, as the interest rate on our Senior Unsecured Revolving Line of Credit varies with the London Interbank Offered Rate. Our significant increase in debt following the acquisition of Ocular has significantly increased the risk associated with changes in interest rates. We have decreased this interest rate risk by hedging a significant portion of variable rate debt effectively converting it to fixed rate debt for varying periods through May 2011. For additional detail, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 1 and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. On January 31, 2007, Cooper entered into a $650 million syndicated Senior Unsecured Revolving Line of Credit (Revolver) and $350 million aggregate principal amount of 7.125% of senior notes (See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). KeyBank led the Revolver refinancing and the Revolver matures on January 31, 2012. In connection with the normal management of our financial liabilities, we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our Senior Notes through open market cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. Outlook Global Market and Economic Conditions In the United States and globally, recent market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth through into the fourth quarter of 2008. For our fiscal year ended October 31, 2008, continued concerns about the systemic impact of inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, bank failures and a 50 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) declining real estate market in the U.S. have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the U.S. and the global economy. These conditions, combined with volatile oil prices, declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have in recent weeks near and subsequent to the end of the fiscal year contributed to substantial declines in capital markets and consumer confidence. As a result of these market conditions, the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads. Concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease to provide funding to borrowers. Continued turbulence in the U.S. and international markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers. If these market conditions continue, they may limit our ability, and the ability of our customers, to timely replace maturing liabilities, and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs, resulting in potential adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. These conditions may also affect the markets for our products as consumers may curtail buying habits similar to the slower than expected contact lens sales in October and November 2008. We believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand of $1.9 million plus cash generated by operating activities and borrowing capacity under our existing credit facilities will fund future operations, capital expenditures, cash dividends and small acquisitions. Management believes that our projected outlook on sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for the next 12 months. At October 31, 2008, we had $138.4 million available under our $650 million syndicated bank credit facility. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS None. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS As of October 31, 2008, we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments Due by Period (In millions) Total 2009 2010 & 2011 2012 & 2013 2014 & Beyond Contractual obligations: Long-term debt $ 861.8 $ $ $ 511.4 $ 350.4 Interest payments on long-term debt 228.8 45.2 91.1 55.1 37.4 Operating leases 187.6 31.3 56.5 39.4 60.4 Total contractual obligations 1,278.2 76.5 147.6 605.9 448.2 Commercial commitments: Stand-by letters of credit 0.2 0.2 Total $ 1,278.4 $ 76.7 $ 147.6 $ 605.9 $ 448.2 51 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The expected future benefit payments for pension plans through 2018 are disclosed in Note 11. Employee Benefits. Inflation and Changing Prices Inflation has had no appreciable effect on our operations in the last three fiscal years. New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) SFAS 157-1, Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement under Statement 13 , and FSP SFAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 . These FSPs defer the effective date in SFAS 157 for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually) and exclude certain leasing transactions accounted for under SFAS 13, Accounting for Leases , from the scope of SFAS 157. The delayed portions of SFAS 157 will be adopted by the Company beginning in its fiscal year ending October 31, 2010, while all other portions of the standard will be adopted by the Company beginning in its fiscal year ending October 31, 2009, as required. The Company does not expect a significant impact from the adoption of this statement on the Company consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS 158). Effective October 31, 2007, we adopted the balance sheet recognition provision of this standard and accordingly recognized the funded status of the Company defined benefit postretirement plan. Effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008, the standard also requires the measurement date for the Company defined benefit postretirement plan assets and benefit obligations to coincide with our fiscal year-end. SFAS 158 provides two transition alternatives related to the change in measurement date provisions. We will adopt the measurement date provisions of SFAS 158 on the first day of our fiscal year ending October 31, 2009. The Company does not expect a significant impact from adopting the measurement date provision of the standard on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS 160 also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of 52 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) the noncontrolling owners. Currently, the Company does not anticipate that the adoption of SFAS 160, which is effective for the Company beginning in our fiscal year ending October 31, 2010, will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any controlling interest in the business and the goodwill acquired. SFAS 141R further requires that acquisition related costs and costs associated with restructuring or exiting activities of an acquired entity will be expensed as incurred. SFAS 141R also establishes disclosure requirements which will require disclosure of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008, which is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of the fiscal year 2010 and will be applied prospectively. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 amends and expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133), with the intent of providing users of the financial statements with an enhanced understanding of how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedge items are accounted for under SFAS 133 and its related interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related hedge items affect an entity financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS 161 requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures above fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments and disclosures about credit-risk related contingent features in derivative agreements. In September 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 133-1 and FIN 45-4, Disclosures about Credit Derivatives and Certain Guarantees An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 and FASB Interpretation No. 45; and Clarification of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 161. This FSP clarifies the FASB intent that the disclosures required by SFAS 161 should be provided for any reporting period (annual or interim) beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of SFAS 161, which, due to the clarification in the FSP, is effective for the Company in our interim period beginning February 1, 2009 and fiscal year ending October 31, 2009, on our consolidated financial statements. In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP APB No. 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14-1). FSP APB 14-1 clarifies that convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) are not addressed by paragraph 12 of APB Opinion No. 14, Accounting for Convertible Debt and Debt Issued with Stock Purchase Warrants . Additionally, this FSP specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. FSP APB 14-1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of FSP APB 14-1, which is effective for the Company in our fiscal year ending October 31, 2010, and related interim periods, on our consolidated financial statements. 53 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In September 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 133-1 and FIN 45-4. This FSP applies to: ( a ) credit derivatives within the scope of SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities; ( b ) hybrid instruments that have embedded credit derivatives; and ( c ) guarantees within the scope of FIN 45, Guarantor Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. This FSP amends Statement 133, to require disclosures by sellers of credit derivatives, including credit derivatives embedded in a hybrid instrument. This FSP also amends FIN 45, to require an additional disclosure about the current status of the payment/performance risk of a guarantee. In addition, this FSP clarifies the FASB intent that the disclosures required by SFAS 161 should be provided for any reporting period (annual or interim) beginning after November 15, 2008. The provisions of this FSP that amend Statement 133 and FIN 45 are effective for reporting periods (annual or interim) ending after November 15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of FSP SFAS 133-1 and FIN 45-4, which is effective for the Company in our interim period beginning February 1, 2009 and fiscal year ending October 31, 2009, on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets . This FSP amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As such, for a recognized intangible asset, an entity shall disclose information that enables users of financial statements to assess the extent to which the expected future cash flows associated with the asset are affected by the entity intent and/or ability to renew or extend the arrangement. The intent of this FSP is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under SFAS 141R, and other GAAP. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of FSP FAS 142-3, which is effective for the Company in our fiscal year ending October 31, 2010, and related interim periods, on our consolidated financial statements. Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies Management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). We believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods. Revenue recognition We recognize product revenue, net of discounts, returns, and rebates in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) No. 104, Revenue Recognition and SFAS No. 48, Revenue Recognition When the Right of Return Exists. As required by these standards, we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned, based on terms of sale with the customer, where persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, delivery has occurred, the seller price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. For contact lenses as well as CSI medical devices, diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories, this 54 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primarily occurs upon product shipment, when risk of ownership transfers to our customers. We believe our revenue recognition policies are appropriate in all circumstances, and that our policies are reflective of our customer arrangements. We record, based on historical statistics, estimated reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs offered including cash discounts, promotional and advertising allowances, volume discounts, contractual pricing allowances, rebates and specifically established customer product return programs. While estimates are involved, historically, most of these programs have not been material to our business, since a high percentage of our revenue is from direct sales to doctors. The Company records taxes collected from customers on a net basis, as these taxes are not included in revenue. Allowance for doubtful accounts Our reported balance of accounts receivable, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, represents our estimate of the amount that ultimately will be realized in cash. We review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis, using historical payment trends and the age of the receivables and knowledge of our individual customers. When our analyses indicate, we increase or decrease our allowance accordingly. However, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, additional allowances may be required. While estimates are involved, bad debts historically have not been a significant factor given the diversity of our customer base, well established historical payment patterns and the fact that patients require satisfaction of healthcare needs in both strong and weak economies. Net realizable value of inventory In assessing the value of inventories, we must make estimates and judgments regarding aging of inventories and other relevant issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products and estimated prices at which those products will sell. On an ongoing basis, we review the carrying value of our inventory, measuring number of months on hand and other indications of salability, and reduce the value of inventory if there are indications that the carrying value is greater than market. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. While estimates are involved, historically, obsolescence has not been a significant factor due to long product dating and lengthy product life cycles. We target to keep, on average, about seven months of inventory on hand to maintain high customer service levels given the complexity of our specialty lens product portfolio. Valuation of goodwill We account for goodwill and evaluate our goodwill balances and test them for impairment in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142). We no longer amortize goodwill. The SFAS 142 goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. Initially, we compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill assigned to it. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. The valuation of each of our reporting units is determined using discounted cash flows, an income valuation approach. A reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment. Our reporting units are the same as our business segments CVI and CSI reflecting the way that we manage our business. We test goodwill for impairment annually during the fiscal third quarter and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist. 55 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We performed an impairment test in our fiscal third quarter 2008, and our analysis indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill. As a result of the decline in the price of our common stock in the fiscal fourth quarter 2008 to a value below the Company per share book value, including goodwill, and given the present stock price volatility and uncertainty surrounding the global economy, the Company performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of October 31, 2008 and determined that no impairment existed in either of its reporting units as of such date. We determined the fair value of our reporting units based on discounted cash flows, an income valuation approach. We used a discount rate of a representative weighted average cost of capital for our business segments in comparison with guideline companies, with consideration given to the current condition of the global economy. In bridging our market capitalization, we used an average closing price of our common stock, and we applied a premium for control based on our review of premiums paid by third parties in comparable recent transactions. Based on the facts and circumstances of the particular market conditions that occurred in the final month of our fiscal year and that were not in existence at the time of our annual impairment test, we used an average closing price of our common stock that represented the period from our release of our results of operations for our fiscal third quarter 2008 through our fiscal yearend, or 56 days. We determined an appropriate premium for control by analyzing individual transactions in our markets and selected target companies whose operations were comparable to our two business segments. Management will continue to monitor the relationship of Cooper market capitalization to both its book value and tangible book value and to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill, and the Company will perform its required annual goodwill impairment test during the fiscal third quarter 2009. Goodwill impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment. If our common stock price continues to trade below book value per share, there are changes in market conditions or a future downturn in our business, or if the annual goodwill impairment test indicates an impairment of our goodwill, the Company may have to recognize a non-cash impairment of its goodwill that could be material, and which could adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized and also adversely affect our total assets, stockholders equity and financial condition. Business combinations We routinely consummate business combinations. We allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on our estimates and judgments of the fair value of net assets purchased, acquisition costs incurred and intangibles other than goodwill. On individually significant acquisitions, we utilize independent valuation experts to provide a basis in order to refine the purchase price allocation, if appropriate. Results of operations for acquired companies are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. Income taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for tax losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes 56 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) the enactment date. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact, if any, of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets. To the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction, a valuation allowance is established. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. Frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates. To determine the tax rate, we are required to estimate full-year income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction. We update the estimated effective tax rate for the effect of significant unusual items as they are identified. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre-tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate, and such changes could be material. In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on November 1, 2007. Under FIN 48, the Company recognizes the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. FIN 48 clarifies how the Company measures the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized, provides guidance as to the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and describes the methods for classifying and disclosing the liabilities within the consolidated financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits. FIN 48 also addresses when the Company should record interest and penalties related to tax positions and how the interest and penalties may be classified within our Consolidated Statement of Operations and presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In connection with the adoption of FIN 48, on November 1, 2007, the Company continued its classification policy of interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as additional income tax expense. Also, we were required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns, and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only partially be sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Share-Based Compensation Effective November 1, 2005, we adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R) as interpreted by SEC SAB No. 107, using the modified prospective transition method. Prior periods have not been restated. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating Cooper stock price volatility, employee stock option exercise behaviors and employee option forfeiture rates. 57 Table of Contents The expected life of the share-based awards is based on the observed and expected time to post-vesting forfeiture and/or exercise. Groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected volatility is based on implied volatility from publicly-traded options on the Company stock at the date of grant, historical implied volatility of the Company publicly-traded options, historical volatility and other factors. The risk-free interest rate is based on the continuous rates provided by the U.S. Treasury with a term equal to the expected life of the award. The dividend yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share, divided by the stock price at the date of grant. As share-based compensation expense recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. SFAS 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience. If factors change and the Company employs different assumptions in the application of SFAS 123R, the compensation expense that it records in future periods may differ significantly from what it has recorded in the current period. In 2005, prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company valued its share-based compensation using the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25), and related interpretations. 58 Table of Contents
