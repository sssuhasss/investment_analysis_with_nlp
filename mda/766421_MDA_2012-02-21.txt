ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand the Company, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. All statements in the following discussion that are not statements of historical information or descriptions of current accounting policy are forward-looking statements. Please consider our forward-looking statements in light of the risks referred to in this report introductory cautionary note and the risks mentioned in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. This overview summarizes the MD&A, which includes the following sections: Year in Review highlights from 2011 outlining some of the major events that happened during the year and how they affected our financial performance. Results of Operations an in-depth analysis of the results of our operations for the three years presented in our consolidated financial statements. We believe this analysis will help the reader better understand our consolidated statements of operations. Financial and statistical data is also included here. This section includes forward-looking statements regarding our view of 2012 . Liquidity and Capital Resources an analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash, contractual obligations, commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements, an overview of financial position and the impact of inflation and changing prices. Critical Accounting Estimates a discussion of our accounting estimates that involve significant judgment and uncertainties. YEAR IN REVIEW Our 2011 consolidated pretax income was $393.7 million compared to $405.9 million in 2010 . The $12.2 million decline was primarily due to the $396.8 million increase in aircraft fuel expense and $111.4 million increase in other operating expenses, partially offset by the $485.5 million improvement in revenues. The increase in fuel cost was driven by the 36.1% increase in raw cost per gallon on a 5.6% increase in consumption. Our improvement in revenues was primarily due to a 9.6% increase in traffic and a 3.3% increase in yield. See Results of Operations below for further discussion of changes in revenues and operating expenses and our reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Accomplishments and Highlights Accomplishments and highlights from 2011 include: We reported record adjusted earnings for 2011 . Alaska and Horizon continued their excellent operational performance again in 2011 as measured by on-time arrivals and completion rate as reported to the Department of Transportation (DOT). As a result, we were awarded the 2011 On-Time Performance Service Award among major North American Airlines by FlightStats.com for the second consecutive year. For the fourth year in a row, Alaska Airlines ranked Highest in Customer Satisfaction among Traditional Network Carriers in 2011 by J.D. Power and Associates. We were the first North America carrier to receive the Joseph S. Murphy Industry Service Award for outstanding public and community service by Air Transport World magazine. For the year, the Wall Street Journal named Alaska Airlines the best performing carrier in the U.S. in its annual Middle Seat analysis. 25 Table of Contents We won the Seattle Business Magazine 2011 Green Award, in the Large Services company category. During the year, we reached a five-year agreement with the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (AMFA) representing the aircraft technicians. For the year, our employees earned $71.9 million in incentive pay for meeting certain operational and financial goals. We also contributed $133.3 million to Alaska defined-benefit pension plans. Horizon Fleet Transition To strengthen the regional operations we implemented several changes in 2011, including: Unifying our external brand to the Alaska Airlines brand, Horizon became a 100% CPA carrier, Horizon transitioned to an all-Q400 fleet, Horizon subleased CRJ-700 aircraft and removed all residual inventory, Horizon outsourced certain activities to third parties, and a limited number of long stage-length routes were transitioned to SkyWest. New Markets In 2011 , we added several non-stop routes to our overall network as follows: New Non-Stop Routes Between Frequency (Weekly) Start Date Bellingham to Honolulu Daily 1/7/2011 Lihue to San Jose 3x weekly 3/27/2011 Lihue to Oakland 4x weekly 3/28/2011 Billings to Portland Daily (seasonal) 6/5/2011 Missoula to Portland Daily (seasonal) 6/5/2011 San Diego to Honolulu Daily 11/17/2011 We will also add new cities and non-stop routes in 2012 as follows: New Non-Stop Routes Between Frequency (Weekly) Start Date San Jose to Palm Springs Daily (seasonal) 2/17/2012 Seattle to Kansas City Daily 3/12/2012 Oakland to Honolulu Daily 4/10/2012 San Jose to Honolulu Daily 4/10/2012 Portland to Long Beach Daily 3/12/2012 San Diego to Santa Rosa Daily 6/4/2012 San Diego to Fresno 2x Daily 6/4/2012 San Diego to Monterey Daily 6/4/2012 Reno to San Jose 2x Daily 6/4/2012 Portland to Bellingham Daily (seasonal) 6/4/2012 Portland to Bozeman Daily (seasonal) 6/4/2012 Portland to Santa Barbara Daily (seasonal) 6/4/2012 Seattle to Philadelphia Daily 6/11/2012 Seattle to Fort Lauderdale (replaces Seattle to Miami) Daily 7/16/2012 The changes above, when combined with the significant number of network changes over the last few years, have diversified our network and made us less dependent on our historical markets in the State of Alaska and up and down the West Coast. We believe our smaller size makes us more nimble than some of our larger competitors, gives us a closer connection with our customers and allows us to identify and respond to market opportunities quickly. 26 Table of Contents Stock Repurchase In 2011, we repurchased 1,309,300 shares of our common stock for $79.5 million under the $50 million repurchase plans authorized by the our Board of Directors in June 2010 and June 2011. Since 2007, we have repurchased 8.4 million shares of common stock under such programs for $262 million for an average price of approximately $31 per share. Outlook Our primary focus every year is to run safe, compliant and reliable operations at our airlines. In addition to our primary objective, our key initiative in 2012 is to focus on the customer travel experience. Our specific focus will be on providing information and mobile capabilities to our customers as well as to speed them through the airport on the day of travel. Our biggest concern for 2012 is the rising cost of fuel. However, with our fuel-efficient aircraft and our fuel hedge portfolio, we believe we are better prepared to handle those rising costs than others in the industry. Our advance bookings suggest our load factors will be up 2.5 pts in February and 2.5 pts in March compared to the same periods in 2011 on an expected 3.5% increase in capacity for the first quarter of 2012. Subsequent Events On February 15, 2012, the board of directors declared a two-for-one split of the Company's common stock to be accomplished by means of a stock distribution. The additional shares will be distributed on March 16, 2012, to the shareholders of record on March 2, 2012. The stock split will increase the Company's outstanding shares from approximately 35.5 million shares to about 71.0 million shares. Our historical outstanding shares will be recast upon the distribution. Additionally, the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase up to $50 million of its common stock with available cash on hand. Furthermore, the board of directors authorized Horizon to purchase two Q400 aircraft in April and June 2012 and sell two Q400 aircraft in the fall of 2012. The expected capital expenditures and aircraft purchase commitments reflect this action. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2011 COMPARED WITH 2010 Our consolidated net income for 2011 was $244.5 million , or $6.66 per diluted share, compared to net income of $251.1 million , or $6.83 per diluted share, in 2010 . Significant items impacting the comparability between the periods are as follows: Both periods include adjustments to reflect the timing of net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses related to our fuel hedge positions. For 2011 , we recognized net mark-to-market losses of $30.1 million ( $18.7 million after tax, or $0.51 per share) compared to losses of $5.3 million ( $3.3 million after tax, or $0.09 per share) in 2010 . 2011 includes Horizon fleet transition costs of $38.9 million ( $24.2 million after tax, of $0.66 per share) compared to $13.2 million ( $8.2 million , or $0.22 per share) in 2010 . ADJUSTED (NON-GAAP) RESULTS AND PER-SHARE AMOUNTS We believe disclosure of earnings excluding the impact of these individual charges is useful information to investors because: We believe it is the basis by which we are evaluated by industry analysts; Our results excluding these items are most often used in internal management and board reporting and decision-making; Our results excluding these adjustments serve as the basis for our various employee incentive plans, thus the information allows investors to better understand the changes in variable incentive pay expense in our consolidated statements of operations; and It is useful to monitor performance without these items as it improves a reader ability to compare our results to those of other airlines. 27 Table of Contents It is consistent with how we present information in our quarterly earnings press releases; Although we are presenting these non-GAAP amounts for the reasons above, investors and other readers should not necessarily conclude that these amounts are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual in nature. Excluding the mark-to-market adjustments and other special charges, our adjusted consolidated net income for 2011 was $287.4 million , or $7.83 per diluted share, compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of $262.6 million , or $7.14 per share, in 2010 .

The changes are summarized in the following table: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 % Change Passenger Mainline $ 3,176.2 $ 2,763.4 14.9 Regional 774.5 725.2 6.8 Total passenger revenue $ 3,950.7 $ 3,488.6 13.2 Freight and mail 108.7 106.2 2.4 Other - net 258.4 237.5 8.8 Total operating revenues $ 4,317.8 $ 3,832.3 12.7 Passenger Revenue Mainline Mainline passenger revenue for 2011 improved by 14.9% on an 8.5% increase in capacity and a 5.9% increase in passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) compared to 2010 . The increase in capacity is driven by the annualization of new routes added in 2010 and new routes in 2011 , most of which was Hawaii. The increase in PRASM was driven by a 3.5% rise in ticket yield and a 1.9 -point increase in load factor compared to the prior year. The increase in yield is due to raising prices to help offset the 36% increase in raw fuel costs. Passenger Revenue Regional Regional passenger revenue increased by $49.3 million or 6.8% compared to 2010 on a 13.4% increase in PRASM compared to 2010 , despite a 5.8% decline in capacity. The increase in PRASM was driven by an 8.8% increase in ticket yield and a 3.2 -point increase in load factor compared to the prior year. The decline in capacity and increase in load factors is due to better matching supply with demand in the regional network. Freight and Mail Freight and mail revenue increased $2.5 million , or 2.4% , primarily due to freight fuel surcharge increases of $5.4 million offset by lower mail revenue on lower volume. Other Net Other net revenue increased $20.9 million , or 8.8% , from 2010 . The increase is primarily due to an increase in our Mileage Plan revenues of $11.6 million with higher commissions driven by a larger number of miles sold to our affinity card partner and a contractual rate increase for those sold miles. Additionally, food and beverages sales increased $4.3 million due to increased volumes. OPERATING EXPENSES Total operating expenses increased $508.2 million , or 15.1% , compared to 2010 mostly as a result of significantly higher fuel costs. We believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows, which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 % Change Fuel expense $ 1,297.7 $ 900.9 44.0 Non-fuel expenses 2,571.2 2,459.8 4.5 Total Operating Expenses $ 3,868.9 $ 3,360.7 15.1 Significant operating expense variances from 2010 are more fully described below. 30 Table of Contents Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits increased during 2011 by $29.6 million , or 3.1% , compared to 2010 . The primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 % Change Wages $ 703.1 $ 674.2 4.3 Pension and defined-contribution retirement benefits 88.3 93.4 (5.5 ) Medical benefits 108.1 109.0 (0.8 ) Other benefits and payroll taxes 91.0 84.3 7.9 Total wages and benefits $ 990.5 $ 960.9 3.1 Wages increased 4.3% on a 1.2% increase in FTEs as a result of increased flying, higher wage rates, and a signing bonus to Alaska's clerical, office and passenger service employees in connection with a new contract ratified in January 2011. Productivity as measured by the number of passengers per FTE increased 5.0% compared to 2010. The 5.5% decline in pension and other retirement-related benefits is primarily due to a reduction in our defined-benefit pension cost driven by the improved funded status at the end of 2010 as compared to the previous year partially offset by a slight increase in defined-contribution expense. Medical benefits decreased 0.8% from the prior year primarily due to a decline in employee healthcare claims, partially offset by an increase in post-retirement medical expense. Other benefits and payroll taxes increased 7.9% from the prior year due to increases in our Workers Compensation and Disability Plan as well as increased payroll taxes in line with increased wages. We expect wages and benefits to be higher in 2012 compared to 2011 due to higher FTEs to support increases in volume and higher pension expense of approximately $15 million. Variable Incentive Pay Variable incentive pay expense decreased from $92.0 million in 2010 to $71.9 million in 2011 . The decrease is due to the fact that in 2010 our financial and operational results exceeded targets more so than in 2011 . If we meet targets established under our Performance Based Pay and Operational Performance Rewards programs, variable incentive pay will be approximately $55 million to $60 million per year. If we exceed the targets, variable incentive pay will be higher. If we do not achieve targets, it will be lower. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel expense includes both raw fuel expense (as defined below) plus the effect of mark-to-market adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio included in our consolidated statement of operations as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases. Our aircraft fuel expense is very volatile, even between quarters, because it includes these gains or losses in the value of the underlying instrument as crude oil prices and refining margins increase or decrease. Raw fuel expense is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport, or the into-plane price, including taxes and fees. Raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs, which can vary by region in the U.S. Raw fuel expense approximates cash paid to suppliers and does not reflect the effect of our fuel hedges. 31 Table of Contents Aircraft fuel expense increased $396.8 million , or 44.0% compared to 2010 . The elements of the change are illustrated in the following table: Year Ended December 31, (in millions, except per gallon amounts) 2011 2010 % Change Fuel gallons consumed 398.3 377.3 5.6 Raw price per gallon $ 3.24 $ 2.38 36.1 Total raw fuel expense $ 1,289.0 $ 898.9 43.4 Net impact on fuel expense from losses arising from fuel-hedging activities 8.7 2.0 NM Aircraft fuel expense $ 1,297.7 $ 900.9 44.0 NM - Not Meaningful Fuel gallons consumed increased 5.6% , primarily as a result of a 5% increase in block hours and a slight increase in fuel burn per block hour as a result of higher load factors. The raw fuel price per gallon increased 36.1% as a result of higher West Coast jet fuel prices. West Coast jet fuel prices are impacted by both the higher price of crude oil, as well as increased refining margins associated with the conversion of crude oil to jet fuel. The average prices of crude oil and refining margins during 2011 were higher by approximately 19% and 141% respectively, as compared to 2010. We also evaluate economic fuel expense, which we define as raw fuel expense adjusted for the cash we receive from, or pay to, hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, and for the premium expense that we paid for those contracts. A key difference between aircraft fuel expense and economic fuel expense is the timing of gain or loss recognition on our hedge portfolio. When we refer to economic fuel expense, we include gains and losses only when they are realized for those contracts that were settled during the period based on their original contract terms. We believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices are currently having on our business because it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operations. Accordingly, many industry analysts evaluate our results using this measure, and it is the basis for most internal management reporting and incentive pay plans. Our economic fuel expense is calculated as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions, except per gallon amounts) 2011 2010 % Change Raw fuel expense $ 1,289.0 $ 898.9 43.4 Less net of cash settlement on settled hedges and premium expense recognized (21.4 ) (3.3 ) NM Economic fuel expense $ 1,267.6 $ 895.6 41.5 Fuel gallons consumed 398.3 377.3 5.6 Economic fuel cost per gallon $ 3.18 $ 2.37 34.2 NM - Not Meaningful As noted above, the total net benefit recognized for hedges that settled during the year was $21.4 million in 2011 , compared to a benefit of $3.3 million in 2010 . These amounts represent the cash received net of the premium expense recognized for those hedges. We currently expect our economic fuel price per gallon to be approximately 18% higher in the first quarter of 2012 due to the rising cost of jet fuel. As both oil prices and refining margins are volatile, we are unable to forecast the full-year cost with any certainty. Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance declined by $10.9 million , or 5.0% , compared to the prior year primarily due to lower costs associated with the return of leased aircraft and lower costs due to the phaseout of the CRJ fleet, offset by increased airframe check costs and components. We expect aircraft maintenance to be slightly higher in 2012 in line with additional block hours and the timing of scheduled maintenance events. 32 Table of Contents Aircraft Rent Aircraft rent declined $22.6 million , or 16.3% , compared to the prior-year period primarily due to $13.7 million less rent related to 11 fewer CRJ 700 aircraft and $5.5 million less rent related to 5 fewer B737 aircraft leased in 2011 compared to 2010 . We currently do not expect any leased aircraft to be returned in 2012, nor do we expect to lease any new aircraft. Landing Fees and Other Rentals Landing fees and other rentals increased $5.4 million , or 2.3% , primarily due to a $3.6 million increase in facilities rents across our network and a $1.8 million increase in our landing fee expenses. Mainline landing fee expenses increased due to a 9% increase in departures, partially offset by decreases in our regional departures of 10%. We expect landing fees and other rentals to be higher in 2012 due to increased rates and a slight increase in departures. Contracted Services Contracted services increased $22.1 million , or 13.6% , primarily due to an increase in capacity purchased flying of $13.2 million compared to the prior year as the new agreement with SkyWest began in May 2011. Additionally, we experienced higher passenger handling of $2.8 million as a result of an increase in the number of flights to airports where vendors are used and an increase in contract labor of $2.1 million. We expect contracted services to be higher in 2012 due to the full year impact of our capacity agreement with SkyWest and the use of contracted labor in Hawaii. Selling Expenses Selling expenses increased by $21.5 million , or 14.0% , compared to 2010 as a result of higher travel agent and ticket distribution costs of $10.8 million and credit card commissions of $6.3 million due to increased revenues of 12.7% . We expect selling expense will be higher in 2012, primarily due to higher revenue-related expenses. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased $16.4 million , or 7.1% , compared to the prior year. This is primarily due to additional depreciation expense of $18.0 million for the B737 mainline aircraft, $6.9 million increase in Q400 aircraft depreciation, offset by a decrease of $4.0 million in CRJ 700 aircraft and other assets that became fully depreciated or were removed from operation. We expect depreciation and amortization to be higher in 2012 in line with our six new aircraft deliveries and the annualization of 2011 deliveries. Food and Beverage Service Food and beverage costs increased $9.7 million , or 16.9% , from the prior year due to an increased number of passengers, increase in sales of buy on board products, the higher cost of some of our fresh food items served on board, and increased costs associated with food delivery. We expect food and beverage costs to be higher in 2012 due to increased passenger and departure volume. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased $34.6 million , or 17.2% , compared to 2010 . The increase is primarily driven by higher personnel non-wage costs such as hotels, meals and per diems of $8.1 million and higher professional service costs of $7.4 million as well as higher costs for communications, property taxes, passenger remunerations, and deicing.We expect other operating expenses to be higher in 2012 due to higher , property taxes, professional services, IT and training costs. Fleet Transition and Restructuring Related Expenses Fleet transition costs increased $25.7 million , as we finalized our transition to an all Q400 fleet. The increase was directly due to net charges of $28.3 million related to the removal of the CRJ-700 aircraft and related inventory and a loss on the final disposition of Q200 aircraft of $10.6 million in 2011. 33 Table of Contents Operating Costs per Available Seat Mile (CASM) Our operating costs per ASM are summarized below: Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 % Change Consolidated: Total operating expenses per ASM (CASM) 13.06 12.12 7.8 Less the following components: Aircraft fuel, including hedging gains and losses 4.38 3.25 34.8 Fleet transition costs 0.13 0.05 NM CASM, excluding fuel and fleet transition costs 8.55 8.82 (3.1 ) Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 % Change Mainline: Total mainline operating expenses per ASM (CASM) 11.87 10.96 8.3 Less the following components: Aircraft fuel, including hedging gains and losses 4.27 3.11 37.3 CASM, excluding fuel 7.60 7.85 (3.2 ) NM - Not Meaningful We have listed separately in the above table our fuel costs per ASM and our unit costs, excluding fuel and other noted items. These amounts are included in CASM, but for internal purposes we consistently use unit cost metrics that exclude fuel and certain special items to measure our cost-reduction progress. We believe that such analysis may be important to investors and other readers of these financial statements for the following reasons: By eliminating fuel expense and certain special items from our unit cost metrics, we believe that we have better visibility into the results of our non-fuel cost-reduction initiatives. Our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by high fixed costs, so even a small reduction in non-fuel operating costs can result in a significant improvement in operating results. In addition, we believe that all domestic carriers are similarly impacted by changes in jet fuel costs over the long run, so it is important for management (and thus investors) to understand the impact of (and trends in) company-specific cost drivers such as labor rates and productivity, airport costs, maintenance costs, etc., which are more controllable by management. Cost per ASM (CASM) excluding fuel and certain special items is one of the most important measures used by management and by the Air Group Board of Directors in assessing quarterly and annual cost performance. CASM excluding fuel (and other items as specified in our plan documents) is an important metric for the employee incentive plan that covers all employees. CASM excluding fuel and certain special items is a measure commonly used by industry analysts, and we believe it is the basis by which they compare our airlines to others in the industry. The measure is also the subject of frequent questions from investors. Disclosure of the individual impact of certain noted items provides investors the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without these special items. We believe that disclosing the impact of certain items, such as fleet transition costs, is important because it provides information on significant items that are not necessarily indicative of future performance. Industry analysts and investors consistently measure our performance without these items for better comparability between periods and among other airlines. Although we disclose our passenger unit revenues, we do not (nor are we able to) evaluate unit revenues excluding the impact that changes in fuel costs have had on ticket prices. Fuel expense represents a large percentage of our total operating expenses. Fluctuations in fuel prices often drive changes in unit revenues in the mid-to-long term. Although we believe it is useful to evaluate non-fuel unit costs for the reasons noted above, we would caution readers of these financial statements not to place undue reliance on unit costs excluding fuel as a measure or predictor of future profitability because of the significant impact of fuel costs on our business. 34 Table of Contents Our current expectations for capacity and operating costs per ASM are summarized below: Forecast Q1 2012 Change Y-O-Y Forecast Full Year 2012 Change Y-O-Y Consolidated: Capacity (ASMs in millions) 7,325 - 7,375 ~ 3.5% 31,100 - 31,600 ~ 6% Cost per ASM excluding fuel and special items (cents) 8.87 - 8.92 1 % 8.40 - 8.45 ~ (1.5)% Forecast Q1 2012 Change Y-O-Y Forecast Full Year 2012 Change Y-O-Y Mainline: Capacity (ASMs in millions) 6,550 - 6,600 ~ 3.5% 27,850 - 28,350 ~ 6% Cost per ASM excluding fuel and special items (cents) 7.90 - 7.95 1% - 1.5% 7.50 - 7.55 ~ (1)% CONSOLIDATED NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE) Net nonoperating expense was $55.2 million in 2011 compared to $65.7 million in 2010 . The $10.5 million decrease is due to lower interest expense due to payments on maturing debt and prepayments of debt in the current year, higher capitalized interest due to higher levels of capital expenditures, offset by lower investment returns in our marketable securities portfolio, and an impairment charge of $6.2 million on an owned aircraft that was leased to another carrier that filed for bankruptcy protection, and other-than-temporary-impairments on mortgage-backed securities. CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX EXPENSE Our effective income tax rate for 2011 was 37.9% , compared to 38.1% for 2010 . The difference between the effective tax rates for both periods and our marginal tax rate of approximately 37.8% is due primarily to miscellaneous non-deductible expenses, such as per diems. Our effective tax rate can vary significantly between quarters and for the full year, depending on the magnitude of non-deductible expenses in proportion to pretax results. 2010 COMPARED WITH 2009 Our consolidated net income for 2010 was $251.1 million , or $6.83 per diluted share, compared to net income of $121.6 million , or $3.36 per diluted share, in 2009 . Significant items impacting the comparability between the periods are as follows: Both periods included adjustments to reflect the timing of net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses related to our fuel hedge positions. For 2010 , we recognized net mark-to-market losses of $5.3 million ( $3.3 million after tax, or $0.09 per share) compared to gains of $88.8 million ( $55.2 million after tax, or $1.53 per share) in 2009 . 2010 included Horizon fleet transition costs of $13.2 million ( $8.2 million after tax, or $0.22 per share). 2009 included the new Alaska pilot contract transitions costs of $35.8 million ( $22.3 million after tax, or $0.62 per share). Excluding the mark-to-market adjustments, fleet transition and restructuring costs, our adjusted consolidated net income for 2010 was $262.6 million , or $7.14 per diluted share, compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of $88.7 million , or $2.45 per share, in 2009 . Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 (in millions, except per share amounts) Dollars Diluted EPS Dollars Diluted EPS Net income and diluted EPS as reported $ 251.1 $ 6.83 $ 121.6 $ 3.36 Pilot contract transition costs, net of tax 22.3 0.62 Fleet transition costs, net of tax 8.2 0.22 Mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments, net of tax 3.3 0.09 (55.2 ) (1.53 ) Net income and diluted EPS, excluding noted items $ 262.6 $ 7.14 $ 88.7 $ 2.45 35 Table of Contents OPERATING REVENUES Total operating revenues increased $432.5 million , or 12.7% , during 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 . The changes are summarized in the following table: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2010 2009 % Change Passenger Mainline $ 2,763.4 $ 2,438.8 13.3 Regional 725.2 668.6 8.5 Total passenger revenue $ 3,488.6 $ 3,107.4 12.3 Freight and mail 106.2 95.9 10.7 Other - net 237.5 196.5 20.9 Total operating revenues $ 3,832.3 $ 3,399.8 12.7 Passenger Revenue Mainline Mainline passenger revenue for 2010 improved by 13.3% on a 5.6% increase in capacity and a 7.3% increase in passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) compared to 2009 . The increase in PRASM was driven by a 2.3% rise in ticket yield and a 4.0 -point increase in load factor compared to the prior year. Passenger Revenue Regional Regional passenger revenue increased by $56.6 million , or 8.5% , compared to 2009 on a 10.2% increase in PRASM compared to 2009 , despite relatively flat capacity. The increase in PRASM was driven by a 6.6% increase in ticket yield and a 2.4 -point increase in load factor compared to the prior year. Freight and Mail Freight and mail revenue increased $10.3 million , or 10.7% , primarily as a result of higher volumes and yield and higher security and freight fuel surcharges. Other Net Other net revenue increased $41.0 million , or 20.9% , from 2009 . The increase is primarily due to Mileage Plan revenues rising by $31.8 million stemming from a larger number of miles sold to our affinity card partner and a contractual rate increase for those sold miles. OPERATING EXPENSES Total operating expenses increased $228.3 million , or 7.3% , compared to 2009 mostly as a result of significantly higher fuel costs. We believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows, which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2010 2009 % Change Fuel expense $ 900.9 $ 658.1 36.9 Non-fuel expenses 2,459.8 2,474.3 (0.6 ) Total Operating Expenses $ 3,360.7 $ 3,132.4 7.3 Significant operating expense variances from 2009 are more fully described below. 36 Table of Contents Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits decreased during 2010 by $27.2 million , or 2.8% , compared to 2009 . The primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2010 2009 % Change Wages $ 674.2 $ 674.6 (0.1 ) Pension and defined-contribution retirement benefits 93.4 124.2 (24.8 ) Medical benefits 109.0 103.9 4.9 Other benefits and payroll taxes 84.3 85.4 (1.3 ) Total wages and benefits $ 960.9 $ 988.1 (2.8 ) Wages were relatively flat on a reduction in FTE compared to 2009 . Wages have not declined in step with the FTE reduction because of the higher wage rates for the pilot group in connection with their new contract effective April 1, 2009 and higher average wages for certain other employees after 2009 and early 2010 furloughs, which are generally seniority-based. However, productivity as measured by the number of passengers per FTE increased 9.2% compared to 2009 . The 24.8% decline in pension and other retirement-related benefits is primarily due to a significant reduction in our defined-benefit pension cost driven by the improved funded status at the end of 2009 as compared to the previous year and the closing of the defined-benefit plans to the new pilot entrants with their new contract in 2009 . Medical benefits increased 4.9% from the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in employee healthcare costs partially offset by a decrease in post-retirement medical expense for the pilot group. Variable Incentive Pay Variable incentive pay expense increased from $76.0 million in 2009 to $92.0 million in 2010 . The increase is primarily due to the fact that in 2010, our financial and operational results exceeded targets established by our Board more so than in 2009 . In 2010 , additional workgroups were included to the PBP plan, resulting in higher earnings than the profit sharing plan in which they previously participated. Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel expense increased $242.8 million , or 36.9% , compared to 2009 . The elements of the change are illustrated in the following table: Year Ended December 31, (in millions, except per gallon amounts) 2010 2009 % Change Fuel gallons consumed 377.3 365.0 3.4 Raw price per gallon $ 2.38 $ 1.88 26.6 Total raw fuel expense $ 898.9 $ 686.2 31.0 Net impact on fuel expense from (gains) and losses arising from fuel-hedging activities 2.0 (28.1 ) NM Aircraft fuel expense $ 900.9 $ 658.1 36.9 NM - Not Meaningful Fuel gallons consumed increased 3.4%, primarily as a result of a 1.1% increase in block hours and an increase in fuel burn due to higher load factors. The raw fuel price per gallon increased 26.6% as a result of higher West Coast jet fuel prices driven by higher crude oil costs and refining margins. 37 Table of Contents Our economic fuel expense is calculated as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions, except per gallon amounts) 2010 2009 % Change Raw fuel expense $ 898.9 $ 686.2 31.0 Plus or minus: net of cash settlement on settled hedges and premium expense recognized (3.3 ) 60.7 NM Economic fuel expense $ 895.6 $ 746.9 19.9 Fuel gallons consumed 377.3 365.0 3.4 Economic fuel cost per gallon $ 2.37 $ 2.05 15.6 NM - Not Meaningful As noted above, the total net benefit recognized for hedges that settled during the period was $3.3 million in 2010 , compared to a loss of $60.7 million in 2009 . These amounts represent the cash received net of the premium expense recognized for those hedges. Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance declined by $6.6 million , or 3.0% , compared to the prior year period. Mainline maintenance decreased due to less expensive events, lower component costs, and decreased costs associated with aircraft returns, offset by increased engine events in the regional business. Aircraft Rent Aircraft rent declined $14.8 million , or 9.6% , compared to 2009 as a result of the return of three B737-400 and two B737-700 leased aircraft, as well as the removal of five CRJ-700 leased aircraft in 2010 . Landing Fees and Other Rents Landing fees and other rents increased $9.6 million , or 4.3% , compared to 2009 . The increase is attributable to higher rates in many airports across our network and more departures. Contracted Services Contracted services increased $12.4 million , or 8.2% , compared to the prior year as a result of increased use of vendors across our network, primarily related to our Hawaii network growth. Selling Expenses Selling expenses increased by $22.0 million , or 16.7% , compared to 2009 as a result of higher credit card and travel agent commissions and ticket distribution costs resulting from the increase in passenger revenue. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased $11.3 million , or 5.2% , compared to the prior year. This is primarily due to four B737-800 aircraft deliveries in 2010 and a full period of depreciation for the ten B737-800 aircraft delivered in 2009 . Food and Beverage Service Food and beverage costs increased $7.4 million , or 14.8% , from 2009 due to an increased number of passengers, the higher cost of some of our fresh food items served on board, and increased costs associated with food delivery. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses declined $13.2 million , or 6.2% , compared to the prior year. The decline is primarily driven by a reduction in outside professional services costs and lower personnel non-wage costs, partially offset by higher property taxes. 38 Table of Contents Fleet Transition and Restructuring Related Expenses We recorded $10.3 million in 2010 related to the removal of five CRJ-700 aircraft from our operations under sublease or lease assignment to third-party carriers. We also recorded $2.9 million of restructuring charges associated with the voluntary separation of a number of employees resulting from the decision to outsource the remaining aircraft heavy maintenance function at Horizon to a third party. In 2009 , fleet transition costs associated with the removal of Q200 aircraft from the operating fleet were $8.8 million as the final Q200 aircraft were removed from operation. During 2009 , in connection with a new four-year contract, Alaska's pilots received a one-time aggregate bonus of $20.3 million. We also recorded transition expense associated with establishing the new sick-leave payout program which totaled $15.5 million, bringing the total pilot contract transition cost to $35.8 million . Operating Costs per Available Seat Mile (CASM) Our operating costs per ASM are summarized below: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 % Change Consolidated: Total operating expenses per ASM (CASM) 12.12 11.82 2.5 Less the following components: Aircraft fuel, including hedging gains and losses 3.25 2.48 31.0 New pilot contract transition costs 0.14 NM Fleet transition costs 0.05 NM CASM, excluding fuel and noted items 8.82 9.20 (4.1 ) Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 % Change Mainline: Total mainline operating expenses per ASM (CASM) 10.96 10.78 1.7 Less the following components: Aircraft fuel, including hedging gains and losses 3.11 2.37 31.2 New pilot contract transition costs 0.15 NM CASM, excluding fuel and noted items 7.85 8.26 (5.0 ) NM - Not Meaningful CONSOLIDATED NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE) Net nonoperating expense was $65.7 million in 2010 compared to $64.5 million in 2009 . Interest expense increased $4.0 million primarily due to the write-off of deferred financing costs and prepayment penalties on debt prepaid in 2010, partially offset by lower average interest rates on our variable-rate debt and a lower average debt balance. Other net nonoperating income (expense) improved by $7.4 million compared to 2009 primarily due to larger realized gains on the sale of marketable securities. CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX EXPENSE Our consolidated effective income tax rate on pretax income for 2010 was 38.1% , compared to 40.1% for 2009 . The difference between the effective tax rates for both periods and our marginal tax rate of approximately 37.9% is due to nondeductible expenses, such as employee per-diem costs and stock-based compensation expense recorded for certain stock awards. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our primary sources of liquidity are: Our existing cash and marketable securities balance of $1.1 billion (which represents 26% of trailing 12 months revenue) and our expected cash from operations; 39 Table of Contents Aircraft financing the 31 unencumbered aircraft (as of December 31, 2011) in our operating fleet that could be financed, if necessary; Our combined $200 million bank line-of-credit facilities (currently none outstanding); Other potential sources such as a forward sale of mileage credits to our bank partner. In 2011 , we paid off outstanding debt associated with seven aircraft and a portion of the outstanding debt for four additional aircraft totaling $164.7 million . In addition, we repurchased $79.5 million of our common stock in 2011 and completed our existing $50 million Board authorization in January 2012. Finally, we made a voluntary contributions to our defined-benefit pension plans of $133.3 million in 2011 , although there were no funding requirements. We will continue to focus on preserving a strong liquidity position and evaluate our cash needs as conditions change. We believe that our current cash and marketable securities balance combined with future cash flows from operations and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future. In our cash and marketable securities portfolio, we invest only in securities that meet our overall investment strategy of maintaining and securing investment principal. Our investment portfolio is managed by reputable financial institutions and is continually reviewed to ensure that the investments are aligned with our strategy. As of December 31, 2011 , we had a $12.2 million unrealized gain on our $1.1 billion cash and marketable securities balance. The table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity: (in millions, except per share and debt-to-capital amounts) December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 Change Cash and marketable securities $ 1,140.9 $ 1,208.2 $ (67.3 ) Cash and marketable securities as a percentage of trailing twelve months revenue 26 % 32 % (6.0) pts Long-term debt, net of current portion 1,099.0 1,313.0 (214.0 ) Shareholders equity 1,173.2 1,105.4 67.8 Long-term debt-to-capital assuming aircraft operating leases are capitalized at seven times annualized rent 62%:38% 67%:33% (5.0) pts The following discussion summarizes the primary drivers of the increase in our cash and marketable securities balance and our expectation of future cash requirements. ANALYSIS OF OUR CASH FLOWS Cash Provided by Operating Activities During 2011 , net cash provided by operating activities was $696.0 million , compared to $552.7 million during 2010 . The $143.3 million million increase was primarily driven by increased revenues during 2011, higher advanced ticket sales, reduced cash spend on aircraft rent, and increases in miles sold to our Mileage Plan partners, partially offset by higher fuel and non-fuel operating expenses. We typically generate positive cash flows from operations, and expect to use a portion to invest in capital expenditures. Cash Used in Investing Activities Our investing activities are primarily made up of capital expenditures and, to a lesser extent, purchases and sales of marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities was $403.3 million during 2011 , compared to $295.2 million in 2010 . Our capital expenditures were $387.4 million , or $202.1 million higher than in 2010 due to eight Q400 aircraft purchases and advance deposits related to our delivery schedule for the next two years. In addition, we spent $107.9 million related to the renovation of Terminal 6 at LAX as the project progresses towards completion in the spring of 2012. For financial reporting purposes we are considered the owner of the assets under construction. When we transfer the project to Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA), this asset will remain on our balance sheet 40 Table of Contents as we will not qualify for sale accounting due to our continuing involvement with the facility. As of December 31, 2011, we estimate that the total cost of the project will be approximately $235.0 million , of which $210 million will be reimbursed by LAWA. Amounts that have currently been reimbursed and future reimbursements will be included in the consolidated statement of cash flows as a financing activity. We currently expect capital expenditures for 2012 to be as follows (in millions): 2012 Aircraft-related (a) $ 370 Non-aircraft 85 Total Air Group $ 455 (a) Includes two additional aircraft authorized subsequent to December 31, 2011 The expected increase in capital expenditures from 2011 is due to payments associated with the deliveries of three B737-800 aircraft, th ree B737-900ER, and advance deposits related to our aircraft delivery schedule discussed later under "Aircraft Purchase Commitments". We preliminarily expect 2013 capital expenditures to be approximately $360 million . Cash Used by Financing Activities Net cash used by financing activities was $280.0 million during 2011 and $332.2 million during 2010 . During the current year we had scheduled debt payments of $168.8 million , debt prepayments of $164.7 million , and stock repurchases of $79.5 million , offset by the issuance of $106.5 million debt that was used to pay-off existing debt with higher interest rates. We plan to meet our capital and operating commitments through internally generated funds from operations and cash and marketable securities on hand, along with additional debt financing if necessary. Bank Line-of-Credit Facility The Company has two $100 million credit facilities. Both facilities have variable interest rates based on LIBOR plus a specified margin. Borrowings on one of the $100 million facilities, which expires in March 2013 , are secured by aircraft. Borrowings on the other $100 million facility are secured by certain accounts receivable, spare engines, spare parts and ground service equipment. During 2011, we modified the second facility by extending the term from March 2014 to March 2016 and reduced the commitment fee. The Company has no immediate plans to borrow using either of these facilities. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS Aircraft Purchase Commitments Overall, we had firm orders to purchase 27 aircraft, as set forth below. We have options to acquire 42 additional B737s and options to acquire 10 Q400s. The following table summarizes aircraft purchase commitments by year: Aircraft Delivery Period - Firm Orders 2012 2013 2014 2015 Beyond 2015 Total B737-800 3 1 2 6 B737-900ER 3 9 7 19 Q400 (a) 2 2 Total 8 9 8 2 27 (a) Includes two additional aircraft authorized subsequent to December 31, 2011 We expect to pay for the firm future aircraft deliveries with cash on hand. If we exercise our options for additional deliveries, we may finance the aircraft through internally generated cash, long-term debt, or operating lease arrangements. Future Fuel Hedge Positions We use both call options for crude oil futures and swap agreements for jet fuel refining margins to hedge against price volatility 41 Table of Contents of future jet fuel consumption. We have refining margin swaps in place for approximately 50% of our first quarter 2012 estimated jet fuel purchases at an average price of 83 cents per gallon and 11% of our second quarter 2012 estimated purchases at an average price of 76 cents per gallon. Our crude oil positions are as follows: Approximate % of Expected Fuel Requirements Weighted-Average Crude Oil Price per Barrel Average Premium Cost per Barrel First Quarter 2012 50% $100 $6 Second Quarter 2012 50% $100 $10 Third Quarter 2012 50% $100 $10 Fourth Quarter 2012 50% $100 $10 Full Year 2012 50% $100 $9 First Quarter 2013 44% $95 $13 Second Quarter 2013 38% $94 $14 Third Quarter 2013 33% $95 $14 Fourth Quarter 2013 27% $97 $14 Full Year 2013 35% $95 $14 First Quarter 2014 22% $98 $14 Second Quarter 2014 16% $97 $14 Third Quarter 2014 11% $94 $14 Fourth Quarter 2014 6% $102 $12 Full Year 2014 14% $97 $14 Contractual Obligations The following table provides a summary of our principal payments under current and long-term debt obligations, operating lease commitments, aircraft purchase commitments and other obligations as of December 31, 2011 . (in millions) 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Beyond 2016 Total Current and long-term debt obligations $ 207.9 $ 165.9 $ 122.3 $ 118.9 $ 116.5 $ 575.4 $ 1,306.9 Operating lease commitments (a) 200.1 166.7 153.3 121.7 90.8 242.2 974.8 Aircraft purchase commitments 372.4 289.3 158.7 32.0 1.4 2.8 856.6 Interest obligations (b) 63.9 53.3 45.2 40.0 34.6 79.6 316.6 Other obligations (c) 69.2 50.0 43.9 28.1 18.3 26.5 236.0 Total $ 913.5 $ 725.2 $ 523.4 $ 340.7 $ 261.6 $ 926.5 $ 3,690.9 (a) Operating lease commitments generally include aircraft operating leases, airport property and hangar leases, office space, and other equipment leases. (b) For variable-rate debt, future obligations are shown above using interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2011 . (c) Includes minimum obligations under our long-term power-by-the-hour maintenance agreements and obligations associated with third-party CPAs with SkyWest and PenAir. Refer to the "Commitments" note in the consolidated financial statements for further information. Pension Obligations The table above excludes contributions to our various pension plans, which estimate to be $35 million to $50 million per year, although there is no minimum required contribution in 2012 . In both 2011 and 2010 , we made year-end voluntary supplemental pension contributions of $100 million, bringing the funding total in both years to approximately $300 million. The unfunded liability for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans was $306.3 million at December 31, 2011 compared to $200.3 million at December 31, 2010 . This results in an 81% funded status on a projected benefit obligation basis compared to 85% funded as of December 31, 2010 . The decrease in funded status, despite voluntary contributions, is directly due to a lower discount rate resulting in an actuarial loss of $206.3 million , thus increasing the projected benefit obligation and lower projected asset returns. 42 Table of Contents Credit Card Agreements We have agreements with a number of credit card companies to process the sale of tickets and other services. Under these agreements, there are material adverse change clauses that, if triggered, could result in the credit card companies holding back a reserve from our credit card receivables. Under one such agreement, we could be required to maintain a reserve if our credit rating is downgraded to or below a rating specified by the agreement. Under another such agreement, we would be obligated to maintain a reserve if our cash and marketable securities balance fell below $350 million. We are not currently required to maintain any reserve under these agreements, but if we were, our financial position and liquidity could be materially harmed. RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL We strive to provide a return to our investors that exceeds the cost of the capital employed in our business. Our target return on invested capital (ROIC) is 10%. We surpassed this goal in both 2011 and 2010, but have not historically reached this threshold on average over our business cycle. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations in this MD&A is based upon our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those that reflect significant management judgment and uncertainties and that potentially may result in materially different results under varying assumptions and conditions. Management has identified the following critical accounting estimates and has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee. MILEAGE PLAN Our Mileage Plan loyalty program awards miles to member passengers who fly on our airlines and many of our travel partners. Additionally, we sell miles to third parties, such as our bank partner, for cash. In either case, the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on our airlines or any of our travel partners. As long as the Mileage Plan is in existence, we have an obligation to provide this future travel. For miles earned by passengers who fly on us or our travel partners, we recognize a liability and a corresponding selling expense for the obligation to provide travel in the future. For miles sold to third parties, the majority of the sales proceeds are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when the award transportation is provided. The commission component of these sales proceeds (defined as the proceeds we receive from the sale of mileage credits minus the amount we defer) is recorded as other-net revenue in the period that miles are sold. This represents services provided by the Company to its business partners and relates primarily to the use of the Company's logo and trademarks along with access to the Company's Mileage Plan members. Commission revenue recognized for the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2010 and 2009 was $138.2 million , $123.7 million and $96.8 million , respectively. The deferred revenue is recognized as passenger revenue when awards are issued and flown on one of our airlines, and as other-net revenue for awards issued and flown on partner airlines. At December 31, 2011 , we had approximately 124 billion miles outstanding, resulting in an aggregate liability and deferred revenue balance of $680.5 million . Both the liability and the deferred revenue are determined based on several assumptions that require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate. There are uncertainties inherent in estimates; therefore, an incorrect assumption could greatly affect the amount and/or timing of revenue recognition or Mileage Plan expenses. The most significant assumptions in accounting for the Mileage Plan are described below. 1. The rate at which we defer sales proceeds from sold miles: We defer an amount that represents our estimate of the fair value of a free travel award by looking to the sales prices of comparable paid travel. As our estimates of fair value change, the amount we defer changes, resulting in the recognition of a higher or lower portion of the cash proceeds from the sale of miles as commission revenue in any given period. A 1% increase in the estimated fair value of travel awards (and related deferral rate) would decrease commission revenue by approximately $2.4 million. This amount would instead be recognized in a future period when award travel takes place. 43 Table of Contents 2. The number of miles that will not be redeemed for travel (breakage): The liability for outstanding Mileage Plan mileage credits includes all mileage credits that are expected to be redeemed, including mileage credits earned by members whose mileage account balances have not yet reached the minimum mileage credit level to redeem an award. Our estimates of the number of miles that will not be redeemed (breakage) consider historical activity in our members accounts and other factors. A hypothetical 1.0% change in our estimate of breakage (currently 12% in the aggregate) has approximately a $7 million effect on the liability. 3. The number of miles used per award (i.e., free ticket): We estimate how many miles will be used per award. For example, our members may redeem credit for free travel to various locations or choose between a highly restricted award and an unrestricted award. Our estimates are based on the current requirements in our Mileage Plan program and historical travel redemption patterns. 4. The number of awards redeemed for travel on our airlines versus other airlines: The cost for us to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost we will pay to our travel partners. We estimate the number of awards that will be redeemed on our airlines versus on our travel partners and accrue the estimated costs based on historical redemption patterns. If the number of awards redeemed on our travel partner is higher or lower than estimated, we may need to adjust our liability and corresponding expense. 5. The costs that will be incurred to provide award travel: When a frequent flyer travels on his or her award ticket on one of our airlines, incremental costs such as food, fuel and insurance are incurred to carry that passenger. We estimate what these costs will be (excluding any contribution to overhead and profit) and accrue a liability. If the passenger travels on another airline on an award ticket, we often must pay the other airline for carrying the passenger. The other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often substantially higher than the costs we would incur to carry that passenger. We estimate how much we will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and accrue a liability accordingly. The costs actually incurred by us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued, and therefore we may need to adjust our liability and recognize a corresponding expense. We regularly review significant Mileage Plan assumptions and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary. Any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations. PENSION PLANS Accounting rules require recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of an entity defined-benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the financial statements and requires recognition of the funded status in other comprehensive income. Pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods and is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements. We recognized expense for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans of $42.2 million , $50.2 million , and $93.0 million in 2011 , 2010 , and 2009 , respectively. We expect the 2012 expense to be approximately $57 million. The calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of important assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases. As of December 31, 2011 , we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate a long-term rate of return of 7.25%, which is down 50 basis points from the expected rate at December 31, 2010. This rate was developed using historical data, the current value of the underlying assets, as well as long-term inflation assumptions. We regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as appropriate. This expected long-term rate of return on plan assets at December 31, 2011 is based on an allocation of U.S. and non-U.S. equities and U.S. fixed-income securities. Decreasing the expected long-term rate of return by 0.5% (from 7.25% to 6.75%) would increase our estimated 2012 pension expense by approximately $6.4 million. Pension liability and future pension expense increase as the discount rate is reduced. We discounted future pension obligations using a rate of 4.65% and 5.55% at December 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively. The discount rate at December 31, 2011 was 44 Table of Contents determined using current rates earned on high-quality long-term bonds with maturities that correspond with the estimated cash distributions from the pension plans. Decreasing the discount rate by 0.5% (from 4.65% to 4.15%) would increase our projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2011 by approximately $119 million and increase estimated 2012 pension expense by approximately $10 million. All of our defined-benefit pension plans are now closed to new entrants. Additionally, benefits in our non-union defined-benefit plans will be frozen January 1, 2014. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict what these factors will be in the future. LONG-LIVED ASSETS As of December 31, 2011 , we had approximately $3.4 billion of property and equipment and related assets, net of accumulated depreciation. In accounting for these long-lived assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, changes in fleet plans, the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate. Factors indicating potential impairment include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long-lived assets, management decisions regarding the future use of the assets, a significant change in the long-lived assets condition, and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long-lived asset. There is inherent risk in estimating the fair value of our aircraft and related parts and their salvage values at the time of impairment. Actual proceeds upon disposition of the aircraft or related parts could be materially less than expected, resulting in additional loss. Our estimate of salvage value at the time of disposal could also change, requiring us to increase the depreciation expense on the affected aircraft.
