Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The information provided in this Item 7 should be read in conjunction with KU's Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes. Capitalized terms and abbreviations are explained in the glossary. Dollars are in millions, unless otherwise noted. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" includes the following information: "Overview" provides a description of KU and its business strategy. "Financial and Operational Developments" includes a review of Net Income and discusses certain events that are important to understanding KU's results of operations and financial condition. "Results of Operations" provides a summary of KU's earnings and a description of key factors expected to impact future earnings. This section ends with "Statement of Income Analysis," which includes explanations of significant changes in principal items on KU's Statements of Income, comparing 2011, 2010 and 2009. "Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources" provides an analysis of KU's liquidity position and credit profile. This section also includes a discussion of rating agency decisions and capital expenditure projections. "Financial Condition - Risk Management" provides an explanation of KU's risk management programs relating to market and credit risk. "Application of Critical Accounting Policies" provides an overview of the accounting policies that are particularly important to the results of operations and financial condition of KU and that require its management to make significant estimates, assumptions and other judgments of matters inherently uncertain. Overview Introduction KU, headquartered in Lexington, Kentucky, is a regulated utility engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electric energy, in Kentucky, Virginia and Tennessee. KU and its affiliate, LG&E, are wholly owned subsidiaries of LKE. LKE, a limited liability company, became a wholly owned subsidiary of PPL when PPL acquired all of LKE's interests from E.ON US Investments Corp. on November 1, 2010. Following the acquisition, both KU and LG&E continue operating as subsidiaries of LKE, which is now an intermediary holding company in PPL's group of companies. Refer to "Item 1. Business - Background" for a description of KU's business. Business Strategy KU's overall strategy is to provide reliable, safe and competitively priced energy to its customers. A key objective for KU is to maintain a strong credit profile through managing financing costs and access to credit markets. KU continually focuses on maintaining an appropriate capital structure and liquidity position. Successor and Predecessor Financial Presentation KU's Financial Statements and related financial and operating data include the periods before and after PPL's acquisition of LKE on November 1, 2010, and have been segregated to present pre-acquisition activity as the Predecessor and post-acquisition activity as the Successor. Predecessor activity covers the time period prior to November 1, 2010. Successor activity covers the time period after October 31, 2010. Certain accounting and presentation methods were changed to acceptable alternatives to conform to PPL's accounting policies, which are discussed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements. The cost bases of certain assets and liabilities were changed as of November 1, 2010, as a result of the application of push-down basis of accounting, which was used to record the fair value adjustments of assets and liabilities at the acquisition date. Consequently, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the Successor periods are not comparable to the Predecessor periods; however, the core operations of KU have not changed as a result of the acquisition. 174 Financial and Operational Developments Net Income Successor Predecessor Two Months Ten Months Year Ended Ended Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, October 31, December 31, 2011 2010 2010 2009 Net Income $ 178 $ 35 $ 140 $ 133 The operating results for 2011 and 2010 include the effect of KU's base rate increases, which became effective August 1, 2010, partially offset by net cost increases, which have not yet been reflected in the rates charged by KU. Retail sales volumes increased during 2010 compared with 2009 as a result of increased consumption primarily due to increased heating degree days during the first and third quarters of 2010 and increased cooling degree days during the second and third quarters of 2010. See "Results of Operations" below for further discussion and analysis of the results of operations. TC2 KU and LG&E constructed a 732 MW summer capacity coal-fired unit, TC2, which is jointly owned by KU (60.75%) and LG&E (14.25%), together with the Illinois Municipal Electric Agency and the Indiana Municipal Power Agency (combined 25%). With limited exceptions, KU and LG&E took care, custody and control of TC2 in January 2011. KU and LG&E and the construction contractor further amended the construction agreement to provide that the contractor will complete certain actions to identify and complete any necessary modifications to allow operation of TC2 on all fuels in accordance with initial specifications prior to certain dates, and amending the provisions relating to liquidated damages. A number of remaining issues regarding these matters are still under discussion with the contractor. See Notes 8 and 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information. Registered Debt Exchange Offer by KU In April 2011, KU filed a Registration Statement with the SEC, related to an offer to exchange certain first mortgage bonds issued in November 2010, in transactions not subject to registration under the Securities Act of 1933, with similar but registered securities. The 2011 Registration Statement became effective in June 2011, and the exchange was completed in July 2011 with substantially all of the first mortgage bonds being exchanged. See Note 7 to the Financial Statements and KU's 2011 Registration Statement for additional information. CSAPR In July 2011, the EPA signed the CSAPR, which finalizes and renames the Clean Air Transport Rule (Transport Rule) proposed in August 2010, and made revisions to the rule on February 7, 2012. This rule applies to the Kentucky coal plants. The CSAPR is meant to facilitate attainment of ambient air quality standards for ozone and fine particulates by requiring reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions. In December 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (Court) stayed implementation of the CSAPR and left CAIR in effect pending a final resolution on the merits of the validity of the rule. Oral argument on the various challenges to the CSAPR is scheduled for April 2012, and a final decision on the validity of the rule could be issued as early as May 2012. With respect to KU's Kentucky coal-fired generating plants, the stay of the CSAPR will initially only impact the unit dispatch order. With the return of the CAIR and KU's significant number of sulfur dioxide allowances, those units will be dispatched with lower operating cost, but slightly higher sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions. However, a key component of the Court's final decision, even if the CSAPR is upheld, will be whether the ruling delays the implementation of the CSAPR by one year for both Phases I and II, or instead still requires the significant sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide reductions associated with Phase II to begin in 2014. KU's CSAPR compliance strategy is based on over-compliance during Phase I to generate allowances sufficient to cover the expected shortage during the first two years of Phase II (2014 and 2015) when additional pollution control equipment will be installed. Should Phase I of the CSAPR be shortened to one year, it will be more difficult and costly to provide enough excess allowances in one year to meet the shortage projected for 2014 and 2015. See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the CSAPR. 175 Pending Bluegrass CTs Acquisition and NGCC Construction In September 2011, KU and LG&E filed a CPCN with the KPSC requesting approval to build a 640 MW NGCC at the existing Cane Run plant site. In conjunction with this request and to meet new, stricter EPA regulations, KU anticipates retiring three older coal-fired electric generating units. These units are located at the Green River and Tyrone plants, which have a combined summer rating of 234 MW. KU and LG&E also requested approval to purchase the Bluegrass CTs, which are expected to provide up to 495 MW of peak generation supply. KU anticipates that its share of the NGCC construction and the acquisition of the Bluegrass CTs could require up to $500 million in capital costs including related transmission projects. Formal requests for recovery of the costs associated with the NGCC construction and the acquisition of the Bluegrass CTs were not included in the CPCN filing with the KPSC but are expected to be included in future rate proceedings. The KPSC issued an Order on the procedural schedule in the CPCN filing that has discovery, scheduled through early February 2012. A KPSC order on the CPCN filing is anticipated in the second quarter of 2012. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information. ECR Filing - Environmental Upgrades In June 2011, in order to achieve compliance with new and pending mandated federal EPA regulations, KU filed an ECR plan with the KPSC requesting approval to install environmental upgrades for certain of its coal-fired plants along with the recovery of the expected $1.1 billion in associated capital costs, as well as operating expenses incurred. The ECR plan detailed upgrades that will be made to certain of KU's coal-fired generating plants to continue to be compliant with EPA regulations. In November 2011, KU filed a unanimous settlement agreement, stipulation and recommendation with the KPSC. In December 2011, KU received KPSC approval in its proceedings relating to the ECR plan. The KPSC Order approved the terms of the November 2011 settlement agreement entered into between KU and the parties to the ECR proceedings. The KPSC Order authorized the installation of environmental upgrades at certain plants during 2012-2016 representing approximate capital costs of $900 million at KU. In connection with the approved projects, the KPSC Order allows recovery through the ECR rate mechanism of the capital costs and operating expenses of the projects and granted CPCN for their construction. The KPSC Order also confirmed an existing 10.63% authorized return on equity for projects remaining from earlier ECR plans and provided for an authorized return on equity of 10.10% for the approved projects in the 2011 ECR proceedings. The KPSC Order noted KU's consent to defer the requested approval for certain environmental upgrades at its E.W. Brown generating plant, which represented approximately $200 million in capital costs. KU retained the right to operate and dispatch the E.W. Brown generating plant in accordance with applicable environmental standards and the right to request approval of the deferred projects and related costs in future regulatory proceedings. See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information. Storm Recovery In December 2009, a major snowstorm hit KU's Virginia service area causing approximately 30,000 customer outages. During the normal 2009 Virginia Annual Information Filing (AIF), KU requested that the VSCC establish a regulatory asset and defer for future recovery $6 million in incremental operation and maintenance expenses related to the storm restoration. In March 2011, the VSCC Staff issued its report on KU's 2009 AIF stating that it considered this storm damage to be extraordinary, non-recurring and material to KU. The Staff Report also recommended establishing a regulatory asset for these costs, with recovery over a five-year period upon approval in the next base rate case. In March 2011, a regulatory asset of $6 million was established for actual costs incurred. In June 2011, the VSCC issued an Order approving the recommendations contained in the Staff Report. KU received approval in its 2011 base rate case to recover this regulatory asset over a five-year period ending October 2016. In September 2009, the KPSC approved the deferral of $57 million of costs associated with a severe ice storm that occurred in January 2009 and a wind storm that occurred in February 2009. Additionally, in December 2008, the KPSC approved the deferral of $2 million of costs associated with high winds from the remnants of Hurricane Ike in September 2008. KU received approval in its 2010 base rate case to recover these regulatory assets over a ten-year period beginning August 2010. Virginia Rate Case In April 2011, KU filed an application with the VSCC requesting an annual increase in electric base rates for its Virginia jurisdictional customers of $9 million, or 14%. In September 2011, a settlement stipulation was reached between KU and the VSCC Staff and filed with the VSCC for consideration. In October 2011, the VSCC approved the stipulation with two modifications that were accepted by KU. The VSCC issued an Order closing the proceeding in October 2011. The approved 176 revenue increase was $7 million annually, based on a return on equity of 10.3%, with new base rates effective November 1, 2011. Results of Operations As previously noted, KU's results for the time periods after October 31, 2010 are on a basis of accounting different from its results for time periods prior to November 1, 2010. When discussing KU's results of operations material differences resulting from the different basis of accounting will be isolated for purposes of comparability. See "Overview - Successor and Predecessor Financial Presentation" for further information. The utility business is affected by seasonal weather. As a result, operating revenues (and associated operating expenses) are not generated evenly throughout the year. Revenue and earnings are generally higher during the first and third quarters and lower during the second quarter due to weather. The following table summarizes the significant components of net income for 2011, 2010, and 2009 and the changes therein: Earnings Successor % Combined Successor Predecessor % Predecessor Change Two Months Ten Months Change Year Ended 2011 Year Ended Ended Ended 2010 Year Ended December 31, vs. December 31, December 31, October 31, vs. December 31, 2011 2010 2010 2010 2010 2009 2009 Operating Revenues $ 1,548 2 $ 1,511 $ 263 $ 1,248 12 $ 1,355 Fuel 516 4 495 78 417 14 434 Energy purchases 112 (36) 175 28 147 (12) 199 Other operation and maintenance 362 8 336 65 271 10 306 Depreciation 186 28 145 26 119 9 133 Taxes, other than income 19 90 10 1 9 (29) 14 Total Operating Expenses 1,195 3 1,161 198 963 7 1,086 Other Income (Expense) - net (1) (200) 1 1 (83) 6 Interest Expense 70 (10) 78 10 68 4 75 Income Taxes 104 6 98 20 78 46 67 Net Income $ 178 2 $ 175 $ 35 $ 140 32 $ 133 The changes in the components of Net Income between these periods were due to the following factors. 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Margin $ 52 $ 111 Other operation and maintenance (12) (27) Depreciation (28) (7) Taxes, other than income (9) 4 Other Income (Expense) - net (2) (5) Interest Expense 8 (3) Income Taxes (6) (31) $ 3 $ 42 See "Statement of Income Analysis - Margin - Changes in Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for an explanation of margin. Other operation and maintenance increased in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily due to $19 million of higher steam costs, the result of increase scope of scheduled outages including those at Ghent and Green River plants, along with higher variable costs from increased generation. Other operation and maintenance increased in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to higher administrative and general costs of $13 million, higher steam costs of $6 million and higher transmission operation costs of $5 million. Administrative and general costs increased due to higher bad debt costs, higher labor costs and higher property and public liability insurance costs. Depreciation expense was $25 million higher in 2011 compared with 2010, due to TC2 commencing dispatch in January 2011. Taxes, other than income increased in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily due to a $5 million clean coal incentive tax credit that KU was able to apply to property tax in 2010. 177 Income taxes increased in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to the $28 million impact of higher pre-tax income, primarily due to margin. 2012 Outlook KU projects lower earnings in 2012 compared with 2011, as revenue increases are not expected to offset operating expense increases, including depreciation, due to more plant in service. Actual results will be dependent on the effects of the economy and the impact of weather on retail sales among other variables. As a result of the stay out provision established in the settlement of the PPL-LKE acquisition, KU is generally unable to implement an increase in base rates in Kentucky before January 1, 2013. Earnings in 2012 are subject to various risks and uncertainties. See "Forward-Looking Information," the rest of this Item 7, Notes 6 and 15 to the Financial Statements and "Business," and "Risk Factors" in this Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and factors that may impact future earnings. Statement of Income Analysis -- Margin Non-GAAP Financial Measure The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as a non-GAAP financial measure, "Margin." Margin is not intended to replace "Operating Income," which is determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of overall operating performance. Other companies may use different measures to analyze and to report on the results of their operations. Margin is a single financial performance measure of KU's operations. In calculating this measure, utility revenues and expenses associated with approved cost recovery tracking mechanisms are offset. These mechanisms allow for recovery of certain expenses, returns on capital investments associated with environmental regulations and performance incentives. Certain costs associated with these mechanisms, primarily ECR and DSM, are recorded as "Other operation and maintenance" expenses and the depreciation associated with ECR equipment is recorded as "Depreciation" expense. As a result, this measure represents the net revenues from KU's operations. This performance measure is used, in conjunction with other information, internally by senior management to manage operations and analyze actual results compared with budget. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The following tables reconcile "Operating Income" to "Margin" as defined by KU for 2011, 2010 and 2009. 2011 Successor Operating Margin Other (a) Income (b) Operating Revenues $ 1,548 $ 1,548 Operating Expenses Fuel 516 516 Energy purchases 112 112 Other operation and maintenance 49 $ 313 362 Depreciation 48 138 186 Taxes, other than income 19 19 Total Operating Expenses 725 470 1,195 Total $ 823 $ (470) $ 353 Successor Predecessor Two Months Ended December 31, 2010 Ten Months Ended October 31, 2010 Operating Operating Margin Other (a) Income (b) Margin Other (a) Income (b) Operating Revenues $ 263 $ 263 $ 1,248 $ 1,248 Operating Expenses Fuel 78 78 417 417 Energy purchases 28 28 147 147 Other operation and maintenance 6 $ 59 65 29 $ 242 271 Depreciation 6 20 26 29 90 119 Taxes, other than income 1 1 9 9 Total Operating Expenses 118 80 198 622 341 963 Total $ 145 $ (80) $ 65 $ 626 $ (341) $ 285 178 2009 Predecessor Operating Margin Other (a) Income (b) Operating Revenues $ 1,355 $ 1,355 Operating Expenses Fuel 434 434 Energy purchases 199 199 Other operation and maintenance 32 $ 274 306 Depreciation 30 103 133 Taxes, other than income 14 14 Total Operating Expenses 695 391 1,086 Total $ 660 $ (391) $ 269 (a) Represents amounts excluded from Margin. (b) As reported on the Statements of Income. Changes in Non-GAAP Financial Measures Margins were higher by $52 million for 2011 compared with 2010. New KPSC rates went into effect on August 1, 2010, contributing an additional $64 million in operating revenues over the prior year. Partially offsetting the rate increase were lower retail volumes resulting from weather and economic conditions. Other Operation and Maintenance Changes in other operation and maintenance expense were due to the following: 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Fuel for generation (a) $ 6 $ 1 Steam operation (b) 10 4 Distribution maintenance (3) Steam maintenance (c) 9 2 Transmission operation (d) (1) 5 Administrative and general (e) 7 13 Other generation maintenance (2) 3 Other (3) 5 Total $ 26 $ 30 (a) Fuel handling costs are included in fuel for electric generation on the Statements of Income for the Successor's periods and are in other operation and maintenance expense on the Statements of Income for the Predecessor's periods. (b) Steam operation costs increased in 2011 compared with 2010, due to increased generation, the result of TC2 commencing dispatch in 2011. (c) Steam maintenance costs increased in 2011 compared with 2010, due to an increase in the scope of scheduled outages including those at Ghent and Green River. (d) Transmission operation costs increased in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to a settlement agreement with a third party resulting in the establishment of a regulatory asset in 2009, net of twelve months of amortization expense recorded in 2010. (e) Administrative and general costs increased in 2011 compared with 2010, due to higher outside services costs of $2 million, higher labor costs of $1 million and higher pension costs of $1 million, partially offset by $2 million of lower bad debt costs. Administrative and general costs increased in 2010 compared with 2009, due higher bad debt costs of to $4 million, higher labor costs of $1 million, and higher property and public liability insurance costs of $2 million. Bad debt costs increased in 2010 compared with 2009, due to higher billed revenues and a higher net charge-off percentage, partially offset by higher late payment charges. Depreciation Changes in depreciation were due to the following: 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 TC2 (dispatch began in January 2011) $ 25 E.W. Brown sulfur dioxide scrubber equipment (placed in-service in June 2010) 8 $ 7 Ghent Unit 2 sulfur dioxide scrubber equipment (placed in-service in May 2009) 3 Other 8 2 Total $ 41 $ 12 179 Taxes, Other Than Income Taxes, other than income increased by $9 million in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to a $5 million state coal tax credit that was applied to 2010 property taxes. The remaining increase was due to higher assessments, primarily from significant property additions. Interest Expense The changes in interest expense were due to: 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Interest rates (a) $ (18) $ (3) Long-term debt balances (b) 8 1 Other 2 5 Total $ (8) $ 3 (a) Interest rates on the first mortgage bonds issued in November 2010 were lower than the rates on the loans from the Fidelia Corporations in place through October 2010. (b) KU's long-term debt principal balance was $169 million higher as of December 31, 2010 compared with December 31, 2009 and did not change from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011. The higher interest expense in 2011 was the result of higher long-term debt balances for the last two months of 2010. Income Taxes Changes in income taxes were due to the following: 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Higher pre-tax income $ 4 $ 28 Other 2 3 Total $ 6 $ 31 Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources KU expects to continue to have adequate liquidity available through operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents and its credit facilities. KU currently has no plans to access capital markets in 2012. KU's cash flows from operations and access to cost-effective bank and capital markets are subject to risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to: changes in market prices for electricity; changes in commodity prices that may increase the cost of producing power or decrease the amount KU receives from selling power; operational and credit risks associated with selling and marketing products in the wholesale power markets; unusual or extreme weather that may damage KU's transmission and distribution facilities or affect energy sales to customers; reliance on transmission and distribution facilities that KU does not own or control to deliver its electricity and natural gas; unavailability of generating units (due to unscheduled or longer-than-anticipated generation outages, weather and natural disasters) and the resulting loss of revenues and additional costs of replacement electricity; the ability to recover and the timeliness and adequacy of recovery of costs associated with regulated utility businesses; costs of compliance with existing and new environmental laws; any adverse outcome of legal proceedings and investigations with respect to KU's current and past business activities; deterioration in the financial markets that could make obtaining new sources of bank and capital markets funding more difficult and more costly; and a downgrade in KU's credit ratings that could adversely affect its ability to access capital and increase the cost of credit facilities and any new debt. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors" for further discussion of risks and uncertainties affecting KU's cash flows. At December 31, KU had the following: 180 Successor Predecessor 2011 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 31 $ 3 $ 2 The changes in KU's cash and cash equivalents position resulted from: Successor Predecessor Two Months Ten Months Year Ended Ended Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, October 31, December 31, 2011 2010 2010 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 438 $ 29 $ 344 $ 253 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (273) (88) (340) (507) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (137) 58 (2) 254 Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 28 $ (1) $ 2 $ Auction Rate Securities At December 31, 2011, KU's tax-exempt revenue bonds that are in the form of auction rate securities and total $96 million continue to experience failed auctions. Therefore, the interest rate continues to be set by a formula pursuant to the relevant indentures. For the period ended December 31, 2011, the weighted-average rate on KU's auction rate bonds in total was 0.27%. See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information about long-term debt securities. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 17%, or $65 million, in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily as a result of: an increase in net income adjusted for non-cash effects of $115 million (deferred income taxes and investment tax credits of $81 million and depreciation of $41 million, partially offset by defined benefit plans - expense of $2 million and other noncash items of $8 million); a net decrease in working capital related to unbilled revenues of $21 million due to colder weather in December 2010 as compared with December 2009, and milder weather in December 2011 as compared with December 2010; partially offset by an increase in discretionary defined benefit plan contributions of $30 million made in order to achieve KU's long-term funding requirements; the timing of ECR collections of $28 million; and an increase in cash outflows related to accrued taxes of $19 million due to an accrual in excess of payments made in 2010 for the 2010 tax year and the payment of the 2010 tax liability in 2011, along with payments made in 2011 over the accrual for the 2011 tax year. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 47%, or $120 million, in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily as a result of: lower storm expenses of $59 million; the timing of ECR collections of $48 million; a decrease in cash outflows related to inventory of $27 million, primarily due to a nominal change in inventory levels in 2010 and lower consumption in 2009 due to lower generation; and an increase in net income adjusted for non-cash effects of $8 million (depreciation of $12 million and other noncash items of $11 million, partially offset by deferred income taxes and investment tax credits of $47 million and defined benefit plans - expense of $10 million), partially offset by higher interest payments of $14 million due to an accelerated settlement with E.ON AG. 181 Investing Activities The primary use of cash in investing activities in 2011, 2010 and 2009 was capital expenditures. See "Forecasted Uses of Cash" for detail regarding projected capital expenditures for the years 2012 through 2016. Net cash used in investing activities decreased by 36%, or $155 million, in 2011 compared with 2010, as a result of a decrease in capital expenditures of $155 million, primarily due to the completion of KU's scrubber program in 2010 and TC2 being dispatched in 2011. Net cash used in investing activities decreased by 16%, or $79 million, in 2010 compared with 2009, as a result of a decrease in capital expenditures of $88 million, primarily due to lower expenditures related to the construction of TC2 and major storm events that occurred in 2009, partially offset by a decrease in restricted cash of $9 million. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $137 million in 2011 compared with net cash provided by financing activities of $56 million in 2010, primarily as a result of less long-term debt issuances and higher dividends to LKE. In 2011, cash used in financing activities consisted of: the payment of common stock dividends to LKE of $124 million; a net decrease in notes payable with affiliates of $10 million; and the payment of debt issuance and credit facility costs of $3 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was $56 million in 2010 compared with $254 million in 2009. In spite of significant new debt issuances associated with the repayments to E.ON AG affiliates in connection with PPL's acquisition of LKE, cash provided by financing was less in 2010 due to lower increases in debt in 2010 and the payment of dividends in 2010; whereas, KU received equity contributions in 2009. In the two months of 2010 following the acquisition, cash provided by financing activities of the Successor consisted of: the issuance of first mortgage bonds of $1,489 million after discounts and the issuance of debt of $1,331 million to a PPL affiliate to repay debt due to an E.ON AG affiliate upon the closing of PPL's acquisition of LKE, partially offset by the repayment of debt to an E.ON AG affiliate of $1,331 million upon the closing of PPL's acquisition of LKE; the repayment of debt to a PPL affiliate of $1,331 million upon the issuance of first mortgage bonds; a net decrease in notes payable with affiliates of $83 million; and the payment of debt issuance and credit facility costs of $17 million. In the ten months of 2010 preceding PPL's acquisition of LKE, cash used in financing activities by the Predecessor consisted of: the payment of common stock dividends to LKE of $50 million, partially offset by a net increase in notes payable with affiliates of $48 million. In 2009, cash provided by financing activities of the Predecessor consisted of: the issuance of debt of $150 million to an E.ON AG affiliate; the receipt of capital contributions of $75 million from LKE; and a net increase in notes payable with affiliates of $29 million. See "Forecasted Sources of Cash" for a discussion of KU's plans to issue debt securities, as well as a discussion of credit facility capacity available to KU. Also see "Forecasted Uses of Cash" for a discussion of plans to pay dividends on common securities in the future, as well as maturities of long-term debt. KU's long-term debt securities activity through December 31, 2011 was: 182 Debt Issuances Retirement Non-cash Exchanges (a)(b) KU First Mortgage Bonds $ 1,500 $ (1,500) Total Exchanged $ 1,500 $ (1,500) (a) Issuances are net of pricing discounts, where applicable and exclude the impact of debt issuance costs. (b) In April 2011, KU filed a 2011 Registration Statement with the SEC related to offers to exchange securities issued in November 2010 in transactions not registered under the Securities Act of 1933 with similar but registered securities. The registration became effective in June 2011, and the exchanges were completed in July 2011 with all securities being exchanged. See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information about long-term debt securities. Forecasted Sources of Cash KU expects to continue to have sufficient sources of cash available in the near term, including various credit facilities and operating cash flow. KU currently has no plans to access capital markets in 2012. In February 2012, KU established a commercial paper program for up to $250 million to provide an additional financing source to fund its short-term liquidity needs. Commercial paper issuances will be supported by KU's Syndicated Credit Facility. Credit Facilities At December 31, 2011, KU's total committed borrowing capacity under its credit facilities and the use of this borrowing capacity were: Letters of Unused Capacity Borrowed Credit Issued Capacity Syndicated Credit Facility (a) (c) $ 400 $ 400 Letter of Credit Facility (b) 198 $ 198 (a) In June 2011, KU amended its Syndicated Credit Facility such that the fees and the spread to benchmark interest rates for borrowings depend upon KU's senior secured long-term debt rating rather than the senior unsecured debt rating. (b) In April 2011, KU entered into a new $198 million letter of credit facility that has been used to issue letters of credit to support outstanding tax-exempt bonds. KU pays customary commitment and letter of credit fees under the new facility. The facility matures in April 2014. In August 2011, KU amended its letter of credit facility such that the fees depend upon KU's senior secured long-term debt rating rather than the senior unsecured debt rating. (c) In October 2011, KU amended its Syndicated Credit Facility. The amendment included extending the expiration date from December 2014 to October 2016. Under this facility KU continues to have the ability to make cash borrowings and to request the lenders to issue letters of credit. The commitments under KU's credit facilities are provided by a diverse bank group, with no one bank and its affiliates providing an aggregate commitment of more than 19% of the total committed capacity available to KU. KU participates in an intercompany money pool agreement whereby LKE and/or LG&E make available to KU funds up to $500 million at an interest rate based on a market index of commercial paper issues. At December 31, 2011, there was no balance outstanding. At December 31, 2010, $10 million was outstanding. The interest rate for the period ended December 31, 2010 was 0.25%. See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of KU's credit facilities. Operating Leases KU also has available funding sources that are provided through operating leases. KU leases office space and certain equipment. These leasing structures provide KU additional operating and financing flexibility. The operating leases contain covenants that are typical for these agreements, such as maintaining insurance, maintaining corporate existence and timely payment of rent and other fees. See Note 11 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of the operating leases. Forecasted Uses of Cash In addition to expenditures required for normal operating activities, such as purchased power, payroll, fuel and taxes, KU currently expects to incur future cash outflows for capital expenditures, various contractual obligations, payment of dividends on its common securities and possibly the purchase or redemption of a portion of debt securities. 183 Capital Expenditures The table below shows KU's current capital expenditure projections for the years 2012 through 2016. Projected 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Construction expenditures (a) Generating facilities (b) $ 129 $ 177 $ 217 $ 173 $ 65 Distribution facilities 78 95 86 103 100 Transmission facilities (c) 57 49 53 43 40 Environmental 379 453 411 233 51 Other 13 21 21 24 22 Total Construction Expenditures $ 656 $ 795 $ 788 $ 576 $ 278 (a) Construction expenditures include AFUDC, which is not expected to be significant for the years 2012 through 2016. (b) Includes approximately $500 million of currently estimable costs related to replacement generation units due to EPA regulations not recoverable through the ECR mechanism. KU expects to recover these costs over a period equivalent to the related depreciable lives of the assets through future rate proceedings. (c) Includes approximately $30 million of currently estimable transmission costs related to replacement generation units. KU expects to recover these costs over a period equivalent to the related depreciable lives of the assets through future rate proceedings. KU's capital expenditure projections for the years 2012 through 2016 total approximately $3.1 billion. Capital expenditure plans are revised periodically to reflect changes in operational, market and regulatory conditions. This table includes current estimates for KU's environmental projects related to new and anticipated EPA compliance standards. Actual costs may be significantly lower or higher depending on the final requirements and market conditions. Certain environmental compliance costs incurred by KU in serving KPSC jurisdictional customers are generally eligible for recovery through the ECR mechanism. KU plans to fund its capital expenditures in 2012 with cash on hand, cash from operations and short-term debt. Contractual Obligations KU has assumed various financial obligations and commitments in the ordinary course of conducting its business. At December 31, 2011, the estimated contractual cash obligations of KU were: Total 2012 2013 - 2014 2015 - 2016 After 2016 Long-term Debt (a) $ 1,851 $ 250 $ 1,601 Interest on Long-term Debt (b) 1,546 $ 65 $ 131 135 1,215 Operating Leases (c) 34 9 14 7 4 Coal and Natural Gas Purchase Obligations (d) 1,107 404 549 152 2 Unconditional Power Purchase Obligations (e) 311 9 18 20 264 Construction Obligations (f) 294 217 70 6 1 Pension Benefit Plan Obligations (g) 15 15 Other Obligations (h) 13 3 5 5 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 5,171 $ 722 $ 787 $ 575 $ 3,087 (a) Reflects principal maturities only based on stated maturity dates. See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of variable-rate remarketable bonds issued on behalf of KU. KU does not have any significant capital lease obligations. (b) Assumes interest payments through stated maturity. The payments herein are subject to change, as payments for debt that is or becomes variable-rate debt have been estimated. (c) See Note 11 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (d) Represents contracts to purchase coal, natural gas and natural gas transportation. See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (e) Represents future minimum payments under OVEC power purchase agreements through June 2040. See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (f) Represents construction commitments, including commitments for the Ghent landfill and Brown SCR construction including associated material transport systems for coal combustion residuals, which are also reflected in the Capital Expenditures table presented above. (g) Based on the current funded status of LKE's qualified pension plan, which covers KU employees, no cash contributions are required. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of expected contributions. (h) Represents other contractual obligations. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the amounts presented. Dividends From time to time, as determined by its Board of Directors, KU pays dividends to its sole shareholder, LKE. 184 As discussed in Note 7 to the Financial Statements, KU's ability to pay dividends is limited under a covenant in its $400 million revolving line of credit facility. This covenant restricts the debt to total capital ratio to not more than 70%. Purchase or Redemption of Debt Securities KU will continue to evaluate purchasing or redeeming outstanding debt securities and may decide to take action depending upon prevailing market conditions and available cash. Rating Agency Decisions Moody's, S&P and Fitch periodically review the credit ratings on the debt securities of KU. Based on their respective independent reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings revisions or ratings affirmations. A credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness associated with an issuer and particular securities that it issues. The credit ratings of KU are based on information provided by KU and other sources. The ratings of Moody's, S&P and Fitch are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities of KU. Such ratings may be subject to revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently of each other and any other rating that may be assigned to the securities. A downgrade in KU's credit ratings could result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. In KU's 2011 Registration Statement, KU described its then-current credit ratings in connection with, and to facilitate, an understanding of its liquidity position. As a result of the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act and the attendant uncertainties relating to the extent to which issuers of non-asset backed securities may disclose credit ratings without being required to obtain rating agency consent to the inclusion of such disclosure, or incorporation by reference of such disclosure, in a registrant's registration statement or section 10(a) prospectus, KU is limiting its credit rating disclosure to a description of the actions taken by the rating agencies with respect to KU's ratings, but without stating what ratings have been assigned to KU's securities. The ratings assigned by the rating agencies to KU and its securities may be found, without charge, on each of the respective ratings agencies' websites, which ratings together with all other information contained on such rating agency websites is, hereby, explicitly not incorporated by reference in this report. Following the announcement of PPL's then-pending acquisition of WPD Midlands in March 2011, the rating agencies took the following actions: Moody's affirmed its ratings for KU; S&P revised the outlook and lowered the issuer, senior secured and short-term ratings of KU; and Fitch affirmed its ratings for KU. In April 2011, S&P took the following actions following the completion of PPL's acquisition of WPD Midlands: revised the outlook for KU; raised its short-term ratings of KU; and affirmed its long-term ratings for KU. In May 2011, S&P downgraded its long-term rating of four series of pollution control bonds issued on behalf of KU by one notch in connection with the substitution of the letters of credit enhancing these four bonds. In September 2011, Moody's affirmed its issuer rating for KU. In November 2011, Moody's and S&P affirmed their ratings for KU. In December 2011, Fitch affirmed its ratings for KU. Ratings Triggers KU has various derivative and non-derivative contracts, including contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity, fuel, and commodity transportation and storage, which contain provisions requiring KU to post additional collateral, or permitting the counterparty to terminate the contract, if KU's credit rating were to fall below investment grade. See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of "Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features," including a discussion of the potential additional collateral that would have been required for derivative contracts in a net liability position at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, if KU's credit ratings had been below investment grade, the maximum amount that KU would have been 185 required to post as additional collateral to counterparties was $20 million for both derivative and non-derivative commodity and commodity-related contracts used in its generation and marketing operations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements KU has entered into certain agreements that may contingently require payment to a guaranteed or indemnified party. See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of these agreements. Risk Management Market Risk KU is exposed to market risk from equity instruments, interest rate instruments and commodity instruments, as discussed below. However, regulatory cost recovery mechanisms significantly mitigate those risks. See Notes 1, 18 and 19 to the Financial Statements for information about KU's risk management objectives, valuation techniques and accounting designations. The forward-looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions and model assumptions. Actual future results may differ materially from those presented. These disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future losses, but only indicators of possible losses under normal market conditions at a given confidence level. Commodity Price Risk (Non-trading) KU's rates are set by regulatory commissions and the fuel costs incurred are directly recoverable from customers. As a result, KU is subject to commodity price risk for only a small portion of on-going business operations. KU conducts energy trading and risk management activities to maximize the value of the physical assets at times when the assets are not required to serve KU's or LG&E's customers. KU managed its energy commodity risk using derivative instruments, including swaps and forward contracts. See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for additional disclosures. The balance and change in net fair value of KU's commodity derivative contracts for the periods ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 were not significant. Interest Rate Risk KU has issued debt to finance its operations, which exposes it to interest rate risk. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, KU's potential annual exposure to increased interest expense, based on a 10% increase in interest rates, was not significant. KU is also exposed to changes in the fair value of its debt portfolio. KU estimated that a 10% decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2011, would increase the fair value of its debt portfolio by $72 million compared with $73 million at December 31, 2010. KU had no interest rate hedges outstanding at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. Credit Risk KU is exposed to potential losses as a result of nonperformance by counterparties of their contractual obligations. KU maintains credit policies and procedures to limit counterparty credit risk including evaluating credit ratings and financial information along with having certain counterparties post margin if the credit exposure exceeds certain thresholds. KU is exposed to potential losses as a result of nonpayment by customers. KU maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a historical charge-off percentage for retail customers. Allowances for doubtful accounts from wholesale and municipal customers and miscellaneous receivables are based on specific identification by management. Retail, wholesale and municipal customer accounts are written-off after four months of no payment activity. Miscellaneous receivables are written-off as management determines them to be uncollectible. Certain of KU's derivative instruments contain provisions that require it to provide immediate and on-going collateralization of derivative instruments in net liability positions based upon KU's credit ratings from each of the major credit rating agencies. See Notes 18 and 19 to the Financial Statements for information regarding exposure and the risk management activities. 186 Related Party Transactions KU is not aware of any material ownership interest or operating responsibility by senior management in outside partnerships, including leasing transactions with variable interest entities or other entities doing business with KU. See Note 16 to the Financial Statements for additional information on related party transactions between KU and affiliates. Environmental Matters Protection of the environment is a major priority for KU and a significant element of its business activities. Extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to KU's air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste, among other areas, and the costs of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted with certainty but could be material. In addition, costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws or regulations, or similar rules, are expanded or changed from prior versions by the relevant agencies. Costs may take the form of increased capital or operating and maintenance expenses; monetary fines, penalties or forfeitures or other restrictions. Many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of key suppliers, or customers, such as coal producers, industrial power users, etc.; and may impact the costs for their products or their demand for KU's services. See "Item 1. Business - Environmental Matters" and Note 15 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of environmental matters. New Accounting Guidance See Note 24 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting guidance pending adoption. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Financial condition and results of operations are impacted by the methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies. The following accounting policies are particularly important to the financial condition or results of operations, and require estimates or other judgments of matters inherently uncertain. Changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the Financial Statements (these accounting policies are also discussed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements). KU's senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies, the following disclosures regarding their application and the estimates and assumptions regarding them, with PPL's Audit Committee. 1) Revenue Recognition - Unbilled Revenue Revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers. Because customers of KU's retail operations are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of the actual reading of their electric meters, KU records estimates for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period. Such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of the amount of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last reading of their meters. Such unbilled revenues reflect consideration of estimated usage by customer class, the effect of different rate schedules, changes in weather, and where applicable, the impact of weather normalization or other regulatory provisions of rate structures. In addition to the unbilled revenue accrual resulting from cycle billing, KU makes additional accruals resulting from the timing of customer bills. The accrual of unbilled revenues in this manner properly matches revenues and related costs. At December 31, 2011 and 2010 KU had unbilled revenue balances of $81 million and $89 million. 2) Price Risk Management See "Financial Condition - Risk Management" above. 3) Defined Benefits KU participates in a qualified funded defined benefit pension and a funded other postretirement benefits plan. These plans are applicable to the majority of the employees of KU and are sponsored by LKE. LKE allocates a portion of the liability and net periodic defined benefit pension and other postretirement costs of the plans to KU based on its participation. KU records an asset or liability to recognize the funded status of all defined benefit plans with an offsetting entry to regulatory assets or liabilities. Consequently, the funded status of all defined benefit plans is fully recognized on the Balance Sheets. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information about the plans and the accounting for defined benefits. Certain assumptions are made by LKE regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. When accounting for defined benefits, delayed recognition in earnings of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle. Annual net periodic defined benefit costs are recorded in current earnings based on 187 estimated results. Any differences between actual and estimated results are recorded in regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are expected to be recovered through regulated customer rates. These amounts in regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized to income over future periods. The delayed recognition allows for a smoothed recognition of costs over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans. The primary assumptions are: Discount Rate - The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future. The objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due. Expected Long-term Return on Plan Assets - Management projects the long-term rates of return on plan assets based on historical performance, future expectations and periodic portfolio rebalancing among the diversified asset classes. These projected returns reduce the net benefit costs KU records currently. Rate of Compensation Increase - Management projects employees' annual pay increases, which are used to project employees' pension benefits at retirement. Health Care Cost Trend Rate - Management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care. In selecting a discount rate for its defined benefit plans, LKE starts with a cash flow analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for its plans. In 2010, these plan-specific cash flows were matched against a spot-rate yield curve to determine the assumed discount rate. To develop the spot-rate yield curve, the full universe of Aa-rated non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions) bonds, served as the base from which those with the lowest and highest yields were eliminated to develop an appropriate subset of bonds from which the ultimate yield curve would be built. At that time, management believed this plan-specific cash flow matching model represented the best available tool for estimating the discount rate. Beginning in 2011, LKE utilized a new tool that enhanced this plan-specific cash flow matching methodology by primarily matching the plan-specific cash flows against the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds. This bond matching process begins with the same universe of Aa-rated corporate bonds from which those with the lowest and highest yields were eliminated, similar to the yield curve approach. Individual bonds are then selected based on the timing of each plan's cash flows and parameters are established as to the percentage of each individual bond issue that could be hypothetically purchased and the surplus reinvestment rates to be assumed. This process more accurately approximated the process of settlement of the obligations which better aligned with the objective of selecting the discount rate. At December 31, 2011 LKE decreased the discount rate for its pension plan from 5.52% to 5.12% and decreased the discount rate for its other postretirement benefit plan from 5.12% to 4.78%. The expected long-term rates of return for LKE's defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans have been developed using a best-estimate of expected returns, volatilities and correlations for each asset class. LKE management corroborates these rates with expected long-term rates of return calculated by its independent actuary, who uses a building block approach that begins with a risk-free rate of return with factors being added such as inflation, duration, credit spreads and equity risk. Each plan's specific asset allocation is also considered in developing a reasonable return assumption. At December 31, 2011, LKE's expected return on plan assets was 7.25%. In selecting a rate of compensation increase, LKE considers past experience in light of movements in inflation rates. At December 31, 2011, LKE's rate of compensation increase changed from 5.25% to 4.00%. In selecting health care cost trend rates LKE considers past performance and forecasts of health care costs. At December 31, 2011, LKE's health care cost trend rates were 8.50% for 2012, gradually declining to 5.50% for 2019. A variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant impact on accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and regulatory assets and liabilities allocated to KU. While the charts below reflect either an increase or decrease in each assumption, the inverse of the change would impact the accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and regulatory assets and liabilities for KU by a similar amount in the opposite direction. The sensitivities below reflect an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption and does not include income tax effects. At December 31, 2011, the defined benefit plans were recorded as follows: Pension liabilities $ 83 Other postretirement benefit liabilities 62 188 The following chart reflects the sensitivities in the December 31, 2011 Balance Sheet associated with a change in certain assumptions based on KU's primary defined benefit plans.

For these long-lived assets classified as held and used, such events or changes in circumstances are: a significant decrease in the market price of an asset; a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical condition; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset; a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses; or a current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. For a long-lived asset classified as held and used, impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the asset is impaired, an impairment loss is recorded to adjust the asset's carrying value to its estimated fair value. Management must make significant judgments to estimate future cash flows including the useful lives of long-lived assets, the fair value of the assets and management's intent to use the assets. Alternate courses of action are considered to recover the carrying value of a long-lived asset, and estimated cash flows from the "most likely" alternative are used to assess impairment whenever one alternative is clearly the most likely outcome. If no alternative is clearly the most likely, then a probability-weighted approach is used taking into consideration estimated cash flows from the alternatives. For assets tested for impairment as of the balance sheet date, the estimates of future cash flows used in that test consider the likelihood of possible outcomes that existed at the balance sheet date, including the assessment of the likelihood of a future sale of the assets. That assessment is not revised based on events that occur after the balance sheet date. Changes in assumptions and estimates could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements. For a long-lived asset classified as held for sale, impairment exists when the carrying amount of the asset (disposal group) exceeds its fair value less cost to sell. If the asset (disposal group) is impaired, an impairment loss is recorded to adjust the carrying amount to its fair value less cost to sell. A gain is recognized for any subsequent increase in fair value less cost to sell, but not in excess of the cumulative impairment recognized. 189 For determining fair value, quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence. However, when market prices are unavailable, KU considers all valuation techniques appropriate under the circumstances and for which market participant inputs can be obtained. Generally discounted cash flows are used to estimate fair value, which incorporates market participant inputs when available. Discounted cash flows are calculated by estimating future cash flow streams and applying appropriate discount rates to determine the present value of the cash flow streams. In 2011, KU did not recognize an impairment of any long-lived assets. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. KU's reporting unit has been determined to be at the operating segment level. A goodwill impairment test is performed annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the reporting unit may be greater than the unit's fair value. Additionally, goodwill is tested for impairment after a portion of goodwill has been allocated to a business to be disposed of. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two-step approach. In step 1, KU identifies a potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of KU (the goodwill reporting unit) to its carrying value, including goodwill, on the measurement date. If the estimated fair value exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill, which is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill in a business combination. That is, the estimated fair value is allocated to all of KU's assets and liabilities as if KU had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value of KU was the price paid. The excess of the estimated fair value of KU over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill. KU tested goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of 2011 and no impairment was recognized. Management used both discounted cash flows and market multiples to estimate the fair value of LKE, which involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Applying an appropriate weighting to both the discounted cash flow and market multiple valuations, a decrease in the forecasted cash flows of 10%, an increase in the discount rate by 25 basis points, or a 10% decrease in the multiples would not have resulted in an impairment of goodwill. 5) Loss Accruals Losses are accrued for the estimated impacts of various conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertain or contingent future outcomes. For loss contingencies, the loss must be accrued if (1) information is available that indicates it is probable that a loss has been incurred, given the likelihood of the uncertain future events and (2) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting guidance defines "probable" as cases in which "the future event or events are likely to occur." The accrual of contingencies that might result in gains is not recorded unless recovery is assured. Potential loss contingencies for environmental remediation, litigation claims, regulatory penalties and other events are continuously assessed. The accounting aspects of estimated loss accruals include (1) the initial identification and recording of the loss, (2) the determination of triggering events for reducing a recorded loss accrual and (3) the ongoing assessment as to whether a recorded loss accrual is sufficient. All three of these aspects require significant judgment by management. Internal expertise and outside experts (such as lawyers and engineers) are used, as necessary to help estimate the probability that a loss has been incurred and the amount (or range) of the loss. In 2011, no significant adjustments were made to KU's existing contingencies. See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for commitment and contingency disclosures. Certain other events have been identified that could give rise to a loss, but that do not meet the conditions for accrual. Such events are disclosed, but not recorded, when it is reasonably possible that a loss has been incurred. Accounting guidance defines "reasonably possible" as cases in which "the future event or events occurring is more than remote, but less than likely to occur." See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for disclosure of other potential loss contingencies that have not met the criteria for accrual. When an estimated loss is accrued, the triggering events for subsequently adjusting the loss accrual are identified, where applicable. The triggering events generally occur when the contingency has been resolved and the actual loss is paid or written off, or when the risk of loss has diminished or been eliminated. The following are some of the triggering events that provide for the adjustment of certain recorded loss accruals: 190 Allowances for uncollectible accounts are reduced when accounts are written off after prescribed collection procedures have been exhausted, a better estimate of the allowance is determined or underlying amounts are ultimately collected. Environmental and other litigation contingencies are reduced when the contingency is resolved, KU makes actual payments, a better estimate of the loss is determined or the loss is no longer considered probable. Loss accruals are reviewed on a regular basis to assure that the recorded potential loss exposures are appropriate. This involves ongoing communication and analyses with internal and external legal counsel, engineers, operation management and other parties. 6) Asset Retirement Obligations KU is required to recognize a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets. The initial obligation is measured at its estimated fair value. An equivalent amount is recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset. Until the obligation is settled, the liability is increased, through the recognition of accretion expense in the Statements of Income, for changes in the obligation due to the passage of time. The accretion and depreciation are offset with a regulatory credit on the income statement, such that there is no earnings impact. The regulatory asset created by the regulatory credit is relieved when the ARO has been settled. An ARO must be recognized when incurred if the fair value of the ARO can be reasonably estimated. See Note 21 to the Financial Statements for related disclosures. In determining AROs, management must make significant judgments and estimates to calculate fair value. Fair value is developed using an expected present value technique based on assumptions of market participants that considers estimated retirement costs in current period dollars that are inflated to the anticipated retirement date and then discounted back to the date the ARO was incurred. Changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of the fair value of AROs could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements. Estimated ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of various AROs and the related assets, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the estimate of the obligations. Any change to the capitalized asset is amortized over the remaining life of the associated long-lived asset. At December 31, 2011, KU had AROs totaling $61 million recorded on the Balance Sheet. Of the total amount, $40 million, or 66%, relates to KU's ash ponds. The most significant assumptions surrounding AROs are the forecasted retirement costs, the discount rates and the inflation rates. A variance in the forecasted retirement costs, the discount rates or the inflation rates could have a significant impact on the ARO liabilities. The following chart reflects the sensitivities related to KU's ARO liabilities for ash ponds at December 31, 2011: Change in Impact on Assumption ARO Liability Retirement Cost 10% $ 4 Discount Rate (0.25)% 2 Inflation Rate 0.25% 2 7) Income Taxes Significant management judgment is required in developing KU's provision for income taxes primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns and the determination of deferred tax assets, liabilities and valuation allowances. Significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of benefit recognized related to an uncertain tax position. KU evaluates its tax positions following a two-step process. The first step requires an entity to determine whether, based on the technical merits supporting a particular tax position, it is more likely than not (greater than a 50% chance) that the tax position will be sustained. This determination assumes that the relevant taxing authority will examine the tax position and is aware of all the relevant facts surrounding the tax position. The second step requires an entity to recognize in the financial statements the benefit of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition criterion. The benefit recognized is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of realization upon settlement that exceeds 50%. KU's management considers a number of factors in assessing the benefit to be recognized, including negotiation of a settlement. On a quarterly basis, KU's uncertain tax positions are reassessed by considering information known at the reporting date. Based on management's assessment of new information, a tax benefit may subsequently be recognized for a previously unrecognized tax position, a previously recognized tax position maybe de-recognized, or the benefit of a previously 191 recognized tax position may be remeasured. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements in the future. At December 31, 2011, KU's existing reserve exposure to either increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months is less than $1 million. This change could result from subsequent recognition, de-recognition and/or changes in the measurement of uncertain tax positions. The events that could cause these changes are direct settlements with taxing authorities, litigation, legal or administrative guidance by relevant taxing authorities and the lapse of an applicable statute of limitation. The balance sheet classification of unrecognized tax benefits and the need for valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets also require significant management judgment. Unrecognized tax benefits are classified as current to the extent management expects to settle an uncertain tax position by payment or receipt of cash within one year of the reporting date. Valuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset. Management considers a number of factors in assessing the realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Any tax planning strategy utilized in this assessment must meet the recognition and measurement criteria utilized to account for an uncertain tax position.

As a result, the effects of regulatory actions are required to be reflected in the financial statements. Assets and liabilities are recorded that result from the regulated ratemaking process that may not be recorded under GAAP for non-regulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in regulated customer rates. Regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates. In certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on an understanding with the regulator that rates have been set to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, and the regulated entity is accountable for any amounts charged pursuant to such rates and not yet expended for the intended purpose. The accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities is based on specific ratemaking decisions or precedent for each transaction or event as prescribed by the FERC, the KPSC, the VSCC or the TRA. See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for related disclosures. Management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory and political environments, the ability to recover costs through regulated rates, recent rate orders to other regulated entities and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. Based on this continual assessment, management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery. This assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels, and is subject to change in the future. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, then asset write-off would be required to be recognized in operating income. Additionally, the regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of PP&E and amortization of regulatory assets. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, KU had regulatory assets of $217 million and $230 million. All regulatory assets are either currently being recovered under specific rate orders, represent amounts that are expected to be recovered in future rates or benefit future periods based upon established regulatory practices. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, KU had regulatory liabilities of $535 million and $574 million.
