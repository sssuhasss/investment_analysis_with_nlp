Any of these risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements. Overview Headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, Humana Inc. is one of the nation largest publicly traded health benefits companies, based on our 2004 revenues of $13.1 billion. We offer coordinated health insurance coverage and related services through a variety of traditional and Internet-based plans for employer groups, government-sponsored programs, and individuals. As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately 7.0 million members in our medical insurance programs, as well as approximately 1.7 million members in our specialty products programs. During 2004, 43% of our premiums and administrative services fees were derived from contracts with the federal government, including 17% related to our TRICARE contracts and 15% related to one contract in Florida with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS. Additionally, 37% of our premiums and administrative services fees in 2004 were earned from contracts with employer groups and individuals covering members located in Texas, Illinois, Florida, Kentucky and Ohio. We manage our business with two segments: Commercial and Government. The Commercial segment consists of members enrolled in products marketed to employer groups and individuals, and includes three lines of business: fully insured medical, administrative services only, or ASO, and specialty. The Government segment consists of members enrolled in government-sponsored programs, and includes three lines of business: Medicare Advantage, TRICARE, and Medicaid. We identified our segments in accordance with the aggregation provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information which is consistent with information used by our Chief Executive Officer in managing our business. The segment information aggregates products with similar economic characteristics. These characteristics include the nature of customer groups and pricing, benefits and underwriting requirements. The results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes. We allocate all selling, general and administrative expenses, investment and other income, interest expense, and goodwill, but no other assets or liabilities, to our segments. Members served by our two segments often utilize the same medical provider networks, enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. Our segments also share overhead costs and assets. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. We are somewhat unique in our industry by having revenues and enrollment approximately split between Commercial and Government segments, drawing revenues from group, individual, Medicare, Medicaid and military business lines. We believe that it is difficult to time market cycles and external influences on various parts of our businesses. By remaining committed to varied lines of business with a long-term view, we may benefit through short-term market cycles. We believe our diversification across segments and products allows us to increase our chances of success. 24 Table of Contents Our results are impacted by many factors, but most notably are influenced by our ability to establish and maintain a competitive and efficient cost structure and to accurately and consistently establish competitive premium, ASO fee, and plan benefit levels that are commensurate with our medical and administrative costs. Medical costs are subject to a high rate of inflation due to many forces, including new technologies and medical procedures, increasing capacity and supply of medical services, new prescription drugs and therapies, an aging population, the tort liability system, and government regulations. Our strategy to drive Commercial segment profitability focuses on providing solutions for employers to the rising cost of health care through the use of a variety of innovative and consumer-directed product designs. These products are supported by electronic informational capabilities, including education, tools, and technologies provided primarily through the Internet. To that end, we have developed an innovative suite of products styled as Smart products. We believe that these Smart products offer the best solution for many employers to the problem of quickly rising health care costs for their employees. Membership in our Smart products and other consumer-directed health plans exceeded 280,000 members at December 31, 2004, more than doubling from a year ago. We believe that growth in these products, which are offered both on a fully-insured and ASO basis and may ultimately be competitively priced to produce higher margins, is a key component, among other items, for further improvement in the results of our Commercial segment. Additionally, we have increased the diversification of our commercial membership base, not only through our consumer-choice products, but also by (1) expanding our ASO membership to take advantage of our network discounts in the mid-market group segment and (2) launching our HumanaOne individual product to address an increasing migration of insureds from small group. While we expect our Smart products to become a driver of growth in the years ahead as health care inflation persists, we are enhancing the traditional products which comprise the bulk of our commercial portfolio today by applying our consumer-choice innovation. Other important factors which impact our Commercial segment profitability are both the competitive pricing environment and market conditions. With respect to pricing, there is a tradeoff between sustaining or increasing underwriting margins versus increasing or decreasing enrollment. We have experienced a decline in our membership in the 2 to 300 life group size as a result of pricing actions by some competitors who we perceive as desiring to gain market share in certain markets. With respect to market conditions, we are impacted by economies of scale on administrative overhead. As a result of a decline in preference for tightly-managed HMO products, medical costs have become increasingly comparable among the larger competitors. Product design and consumer involvement have become more important drivers of medical services consumption, and administrative expense efficiency is becoming a more significant driver of commercial margin sustainability. Consequently, we continually evaluate our administrative expense structure and realize administrative expense savings through productivity gains. Additionally, because our Commercial segment shares overhead costs with our Government segment, an increase or decrease in the size of our Government operations impacts our Commercial segment profitability. In our Government segment, after being awarded the South Region contract in 2003, we transitioned our TRICARE business to one of three newly-created regions under the government revised TRICARE program. On July 1, 2004, our Regions 2 and 5 contract servicing approximately 1.1 million TRICARE members became part of a new North Region, which was awarded to another contractor. On August 1, 2004, our Regions 3 and 4 contract became part of our new South Region contract. On November 1, 2004, the Region 6 contract, previously administered by the same contractor, with approximately 1 million members, became part of the South Region contract. The members added with the Region 6 contract essentially offset the members lost four months earlier with the Regions 2 and 5 contract. With the transition complete, we look forward to a more stable level of TRICARE membership in 2005 and the start of the second option year under the South contract on April 1, 2005. As more fully discussed on page 45, TRICARE revenues consist of an underwriting fee, healthcare services provided to beneficiaries which, in turn, are reimbursed, and administrative services fees primarily related to claim processing and customer service. In our Medicare business, the passage of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, or MMA, in December 2003 demonstrated the federal government commitment to providing health 25 Table of Contents benefits and options to seniors and has started the resurgence of Medicare as a business line that should bring us accelerating growth in 2005 and 2006. We already have established Medicare Private Fee-For-Service plans in eleven new states, and recently have received approvals from CMS establishing Local Medicare PPO plans in many of our existing markets where we have established competitive networks. Medicare Private Fee-For-Service plans generally offer additional benefits compared to traditional Medicare in exchange for a monthly premium paid by the member. These plans typically include a prescription drug benefit with no provider network restrictions. Local Medicare PPO plans typically will offer an even higher level of benefits to members, including a prescription drug benefit and a lower level of member cost-sharing on many benefits while seeking medical services from in-network providers. These products are more fully-described beginning on page 6. We continue to evaluate additional states and local markets where we believe we can be competitive with these products and anticipate further expansion during 2005. Accordingly, we anticipate an organic increase in our Medicare Advantage enrollment of 10% to 15% during 2005. Including the February 2005 acquisition of CarePlus Health Plans of Florida, as more fully described below, we anticipate having approximately 470,000 to 485,000 Medicare Advantage members at December 31, 2005. Although still under evaluation, we believe we are well-positioned to participate in Medicare Regional PPO plans and the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan, as established by the MMA, beginning in 2006. In connection herewith, we have notified CMS of our intent to bid on these programs. As a long-time successful participant in the Medicare program, we believe that we possess (1) the business competencies and management experience with senior product design, (2) a robust and scalable multi-channel distribution system, (3) an established and competitive network including a national retail pharmacy network, and (4) an established brand awareness with seniors; all of which will enable us to compete for market share in this expanding business line over the next several years. Other highlights include the following: On April 1, 2004, we acquired Ochsner Health Plan for $157.1 million in cash, establishing a new market in New Orleans, Louisiana for our Commercial and Medicare lines of business and on February 16, 2005, we acquired CarePlus Health Plans of Florida, increasing our Medicare presence in South Florida. These transactions are more fully-described below and in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. Diluted earnings per share of $1.72 for 2004, an increase of 22.0% from $1.41 per share in 2003. The Government segment pretax earnings for 2004 of $273.8 million increased $50.1 million, or 22.4%, from $223.7 million during 2003. The Commercial segment pretax earnings of $142.0 million in 2004 were 17.4% higher compared to pretax earnings of $121.0 million in 2003. Consolidated revenues for 2004 of $13.1 billion increased 7.2% from $12.2 billion for 2003 resulting from the Ochsner acquisition and an increase in per member premiums. The consolidated medical expense ratio in 2004 of 84.1% increased from 83.5% in 2003 while the consolidated SG&A expense ratio of 14.5% in 2004 declined from 15.4% in 2003. Cash flows from operations of $347.8 million in 2004 decreased from $413.1 million in the prior year primarily due to the timing of Medicare Advantage premium remittances more fully discussed in the liquidity section on page 35. During 2004, we repurchased 3.8 million common shares for $67.0 million at an average price of $17.83 per share. We intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain critical accounting principles and estimates impact our financial statements. Recent Acquisitions On February 16, 2005, we acquired CarePlus Health Plans of Florida, or CarePlus, as well as its affiliated 10 medical centers and pharmacy company for approximately $450 million in cash including the acquisition of 26 Table of Contents approximately $32 million of statutory capital and surplus in excess of the minimum statutory requirements. CarePlus provides Medicare Advantage HMO plans and benefits to approximately 50,000 Medicare eligible beneficiaries in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. This acquisition enhances our Medicare market position in South Florida. We financed the transaction with $156 million of cash on hand and $294 million of borrowings under our credit agreement. The purchase price is subject to a balance sheet settlement process with a nine month claims run-out period. On April 1, 2004, we acquired Ochsner Health Plan, or Ochsner, from the Ochsner Clinic Foundation for $157.1 million in cash. Ochsner, a Louisiana health plan, added approximately 152,600 commercial medical members, primarily in fully insured large group accounts, and approximately 33,100 members in the Medicare Advantage program. This acquisition enabled us to enter a new market with significant market share which should facilitate new sales opportunities in this and surrounding markets, including Houston, Texas. These transactions are more fully described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. 27 Table of Contents Comparison of Results of Operations for 2004 and 2003 Certain financial data for our two segments was as follows for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003: Change 2004 2003 Dollars Percentage (in thousands, except ratios) Premium revenues: Fully insured $ 6,614,482 $ 6,240,806 $ 373,676 6.0 % Specialty 349,564 320,206 29,358 9.2 % Total Commercial 6,964,046 6,561,012 403,034 6.1 % Medicare Advantage 3,086,598 2,527,446 559,152 22.1 % TRICARE 2,127,595 2,249,725 (122,130 ) (5.4 )% Medicaid 511,193 487,100 24,093 4.9 % Total Government 5,725,386 5,264,271 461,115 8.8 % Total $ 12,689,432 $ 11,825,283 $ 864,149 7.3 % Administrative services fees: Commercial $ 166,032 $ 122,846 $ 43,186 35.2 % Government 106,764 148,830 (42,066 ) (28.3 )% Total $ 272,796 $ 271,676 $ 1,120 0.4 % Income before income taxes: Commercial $ 142,010 $ 121,010 $ 21,000 17.4 % Government 273,840 223,706 50,134 22.4 % Total $ 415,850 $ 344,716 $ 71,134 20.6 % Medical expense ratios (a): Commercial 83.9 % 82.9 % 1.0 Government 84.3 % 84.3 % Total 84.1 % 83.5 % 0.6 SG&A expense ratios (b): Commercial 16.4 % 16.9 % (0.5 ) Government 12.2 % 13.4 % (1.2 ) Total 14.5 % 15.4 % (0.9 ) (a) Represents total medical expenses as a percentage of premium revenue.

Medical membership was as follows at December 31, 2004 and 2003: Change 2004 2003 Members Percentage Commercial segment medical members: Fully insured 2,286,500 2,352,800 (66,300 ) (2.8 )% ASO 1,018,600 712,400 306,200 43.0 % Total Commercial 3,305,100 3,065,200 239,900 7.8 % Government segment medical members: Medicare Advantage 377,200 328,600 48,600 14.8 % Medicaid 478,600 468,900 9,700 2.1 % TRICARE 1,789,400 1,849,700 (60,300 ) (3.3 )% TRICARE ASO 1,082,400 1,057,200 25,200 2.4 % Total Government 3,727,600 3,704,400 23,200 0.6 % Total medical membership 7,032,700 6,769,600 263,100 3.9 % This table of financial data should be reviewed in connection with the discussion on the following pages. 28 Table of Contents Summary Net income was $280.0 million, or $1.72 per diluted share, in 2004 compared to $228.9 million, or $1.41 per diluted share, in 2003. The increase in net income consisted of improved profits in both of our business segments, driven by higher earnings from our Medicare and commercial lines of business. The 2003 results included expenses for asset impairments as more fully described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Premium Revenues and Medical Membership Premium revenues increased 7.3% to $12.7 billion for 2004, compared to $11.8 billion for 2003. Higher premium revenues resulted primarily from the Ochsner acquisition, as more fully described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, and an increase in Medicare Advantage and fully insured commercial premium rates. Items impacting premium rates include changes in premium and government reimbursement rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership, the mix of product offerings, and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership. Commercial segment premium revenues increased 6.1% to $7.0 billion for 2004, compared to $6.5 billion for 2003. This increase resulted from the Ochsner acquisition and increases in per member premiums in the 6% to 8% range on our fully insured commercial business partially offset by membership attrition. Per member premium increases of 6% to 8% include the impact of an increasing mix of individual products into our fully insured membership. A lower premium corresponding to lower benefits on products sold to individuals reduced our composite per member premium trend by approximately 150 to 200 basis points. Our fully insured commercial medical membership decreased 2.8%, or 66,300 members, to 2,286,500 at December 31, 2004 including the addition of 152,600 members from the acquisition of Ochsner. The decrease is primarily due to the lapse of certain under-performing large group accounts totaling approximately 94,000 members in 2004 and continued attrition due to the ongoing competitive environment within the small to mid-market group fully-insured accounts, partially offset by membership gains in the Individual product lines. We expect fully insured commercial per member premiums to increase in the 6.5% to 8.5% range for 2005, including the lowering effect of approximately 200 basis points from an anticipated higher mix of Individual membership. Government segment premium revenues increased 8.8% to $5.7 billion for 2004, compared to $5.3 billion for 2003. This increase primarily was attributable to our Medicare Advantage operations. Medicare Advantage membership was 377,200 at December 31, 2004, compared to 328,600 at December 31, 2003, an increase of 48,600 members, or 14.8%, including 33,100 members added through the acquisition of Ochsner. Per member premiums for our Medicare Advantage business increased in the 9% to 11% range for 2004, reflecting higher reimbursement associated with the MMA and including changes associated with the phase in of the risk adjusted payment methodology by CMS during 2004. See page 6 for further description of our Medicare Advantage products and the CMS risk adjusted payment methodology. For 2005, we expect premium increases per member in the same range of 9% to 11% exclusive of the CarePlus acquisition and membership growth of approximately 10% to 15% also exclusive of the CarePlus acquisition. Including the February 2005 acquisition of CarePlus, we expect Medicare Advantage enrollment of approximately 470,000 to 485,000 at December 31, 2005. TRICARE premium revenues decreased 5.4% in 2004 reflecting the transition to the new South Region contract which included a temporary loss of approximately 1 million members for 4 months. The TRICARE contract transition is more fully described on page 8. Administrative Services Fees Our administrative services fees for 2004 were $272.8 million, an increase of $1.1 million, or 0.4%, from $271.7 million for 2003. This increase resulted primarily from higher Commercial ASO membership partially offset by lower fees related to TRICARE change in government-contracted services. 29 Table of Contents For the Commercial segment, administrative services fees increased $43.2 million, or 35.2%, from $122.8 million for 2003 to $166.0 million for 2004. This increase corresponds to the higher level of ASO membership at December 31, 2004, which was 1,018,600 members, compared to 712,400 at December 31, 2003, an increase of 43%. Administrative services fees for the Government segment decreased $42.1 million, or 28.3%, from $148.8 million for 2003 to $106.8 million for 2004. This decline resulted from the transition to the new South Region contract which carved out certain government programs including the administration of pharmacy and medical benefits to senior members over the age of 65. We stopped providing services under these separate programs beginning June 1, 2004. Investment and Other Income Investment and other income totaled $142.1 million in 2004, an increase of $12.7 million from $129.4 million in 2003. This increase primarily resulted from an increase in the average invested balance partially offset by a decrease in net realized capital gains of approximately $8.4 million. The investment of cash flows from operations contributed to the increase in the average invested balance and added approximately $18.8 million to interest income. The average yield on investment securities was 3.6% in 2004 compared to 3.5% in 2003. Medical Expense The consolidated MER for 2004 was 84.1%, increasing 60 basis points from 83.5% for 2003 primarily due to the increase in the MER for the Commercial segment. The Commercial segment MER for 2004 was 83.9%, increasing 100 basis points from 2003 of 82.9%. The 100 basis point increase was primarily due to underwriting losses associated with a large customer account serving approximately 89,000 members and a very competitive pricing environment in the 2 to 300 life customer segment. The 89,000 large group account lapsed on January 1, 2005. Increasing per member premiums commensurate with claims trend becomes more difficult in a competitive pricing environment. Fully insured commercial medical cost trends are expected to rise in the range of 6.5% to 8.5% for 2005, including the lowering effect of approximately 200 basis points due to a growing mix of Individual membership. The Government segment MER for 2004 was 84.3%, flat when compared to 2003. The Medicare Advantage premium increases were consistent with medical cost increases for 2004 reflecting our efforts of adjusting benefit levels commensurate with reimbursement rates. SG&A Expense The consolidated SG&A expense ratio for 2004 was 14.5%, decreasing 90 basis points from 15.4% for 2003. This decrease, as well as the decrease in each of our segments SG&A expense ratio, is the result of revenue growth in excess of administrative cost inflation and operational efficiencies including gains from completing the consolidation of seven service centers into four during 2003. Included in 2003 were costs of $17.2 million from the impairment of the Jacksonville, Florida service center building more fully described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. These costs increased the 2003 SG&A expense ratio 10 basis points. The consolidated SG&A expense ratio is expected to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5% for 2005 reflecting the continuing beneficial effect of growth in revenues and membership leveraging fixed costs. The Commercial segment SG&A expense ratio decreased 50 basis points from 16.9% for 2003 to 16.4% for 2004. The Commercial segment SG&A expense ratio for 2003 included an approximate 10 basis point impact from the Jacksonville, Florida building writedown. 30 Table of Contents The Government segment SG&A expense ratio decreased 120 basis points from 13.4% for 2003 to 12.2% for 2004. The Government segment SG&A expense ratio for 2003 included an approximate 20 basis point impact from the Jacksonville, Florida building writedown. Depreciation and amortization for 2004 totaled $117.8 million compared to $126.8 million for 2003, a decrease of $9.0 million, or 7.1%. Accelerated depreciation from reducing the estimated useful life of software increased depreciation expense $9.3 million in 2004 and $13.5 million in 2003. We review the carrying value and useful life of software when changes in the use of the asset in our operations indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or the estimated useful life changes. Amortization of other intangible assets decreased when the other intangible assets allocated to an acquired TRICARE contract became fully amortized in the second quarter of 2003. This was partially offset by the increased amortization expense associated with other intangible assets recorded in connection with the April 1, 2004 Ochsner acquisition. Interest Expense Interest expense was $23.2 million for 2004, compared to $17.4 million for 2003, an increase of $5.8 million. This increase primarily resulted from higher average outstanding debt, due to the issuance of $300 million senior notes in August 2003. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate in 2004 of 32.7% decreased 0.9% compared to the 33.6% effective tax rate in 2003. Our effective tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate due primarily to tax-exempt investment income. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate. We expect an effective tax rate in 2005 of approximately 30%. This is lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the resolution of a contingent gain during the first quarter of 2005 in connection with the expiration of the statute of limitation on a tax position related to the 2000 tax year and tax exempt investment income. 31 Table of Contents Comparison of Results of Operations for 2003 and 2002 Certain financial data for our two segments was as follows for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002: Change 2003 2002 Dollars Percentage (in thousands, except ratios) Premium revenues: Fully insured $ 6,240,806 $ 5,499,033 $ 741,773 13.5 % Specialty 320,206 337,295 (17,089 ) (5.1 )% Total Commercial 6,561,012 5,836,328 724,684 12.4 % Medicare Advantage 2,527,446 2,629,597 (102,151 ) (3.9 )% TRICARE 2,249,725 2,001,474 248,251 12.4 % Medicaid 487,100 462,998 24,102 5.2 % Total Government 5,264,271 5,094,069 170,202 3.3 % Total $ 11,825,283 $ 10,930,397 $ 894,886 8.2 % Administrative services fees: Commercial $ 122,846 $ 103,203 $ 19,643 19.0 % Government 148,830 141,193 7,637 5.4 % Total $ 271,676 $ 244,396 $ 27,280 11.2 % Income (loss) before income taxes: Commercial $ 121,010 $ (15,174 ) $ 136,184 897.5 % Government 223,706 225,108 (1,402 ) (0.6 )% Total $ 344,716 $ 209,934 $ 134,782 64.2 % Medical expense ratios(a): Commercial 82.9 % 83.5 % (0.6 ) Government 84.3 % 83.8 % 0.5 Total 83.5 % 83.6 % (0.1 ) SG&A expense ratios(b): Commercial 16.9 % 18.0 % (1.1 ) Government 13.4 % 13.5 % (0.1 ) Total 15.4 % 15.9 % (0.5 ) (a) Represents total medical expenses as a percentage of premium revenue.

The increase in earnings resulted primarily from significant improvement in operating earnings for the Commercial segment and a decrease in expenses for asset impairments and other unusual items. Premium Revenues and Medical Membership Premium revenues increased 8.2%, to $11.8 billion, for 2003 compared to $10.9 billion for 2002. Higher premium revenues resulted primarily from increases in fully insured commercial premium rates and an increase in TRICARE premiums. Items impacting premium rates include changes in premium and government reimbursement rates, as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership, the mix of product offerings, and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership. Commercial segment premium revenues increased 12.4%, to $6.6 billion, for 2003 compared to $5.8 billion for 2002. This improvement resulted primarily from increases in per member premiums in the 12% to 14% range for 2003 on our fully insured commercial business. Additionally, our fully insured commercial medical membership increased 0.5% or 12,500 members, to 2,352,800 at December 31, 2003 compared to 2,340,300 at December 31, 2002. Government segment premium revenues increased 3.3%, to $5.3 billion, for 2003 compared to $5.1 billion for 2002. This increase primarily was attributable to our TRICARE business, partially offset by a reduction in our Medicare Advantage membership. Rates were increased upon annual renewal of our base TRICARE contract and led to an increase in TRICARE premium revenues of $248.3 million, or 12.4%, compared to 2002. Medicare Advantage membership was 328,600 at December 31, 2003 compared to 344,100 at December 31, 2002, a decline of 15,500 members, or 4.5%. This decline resulted as we exited several counties in some of our markets effective January 1, 2003 and general attrition in certain markets as a result of annual changes to benefit designs. Per member Medicare premiums increased in the 4% to 6% range for 2003. Administrative Services Fees Administrative services fees for 2003 were $271.7 million, an increase of $27.3 million from $244.4 million for 2002. For the Commercial segment, administrative services fees increased $19.6 million, or 19.0%, to $122.8 million. This increase corresponds to the higher level of ASO membership at December 31, 2003, which was 712,400 members, compared to 652,200 members at December 31, 2002 and also reflects an increase in the average fees received per member. Administrative services fees for the Government segment increased $7.6 million when comparing 2003 to 2002. This increase resulted from contractual adjustments related to TRICARE for Life, a program for seniors in which we provided medical benefit administrative services. Investment and Other Income Investment and other income totaled $129.4 million in 2003, an increase of $43.0 million from $86.4 million in 2002. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in net realized capital gains due to a $15.2 million gain from the sale of privately held venture capital investments and lower investment impairment losses, a result of an improving market. We recorded investment impairment losses of $3.2 million in 2003 compared to $27.2 million in 2002. Higher average invested balances offset lower interest rates. The average yield on investment securities was 3.5% in 2003, declining from 4.6% in 2002. Medical Expense The consolidated MER for 2003 was 83.5%, decreasing 10 basis points from 83.6% for 2002. The Commercial segment MER for 2003 was 82.9%, decreasing 60 basis points from 83.5% for 2002. The improvement in the MER primarily resulted from per member premium rate increases in excess of medical cost trends for our large group customers and the attrition of groups with higher medical expense ratios. The Government segment medical expense ratio for 2003 was 84.3%, increasing 50 basis points from 83.8% for 2002. This increase primarily was attributable to TRICARE as a result of having a higher level of revenues from bid price adjustment activity in 2002. 33 Table of Contents SG&A Expense The consolidated SG&A expense ratio decreased 50 basis points in 2003 primarily because of a decrease in severance and related employee benefit costs of $29.0 million, the absence of 2002 expenses of $30.1 million associated with a contingent contractual provider dispute and other items, offset by an increase in building impairments of $14.8 million. Increased operating efficiency led to the consolidation of seven service centers into four and an enterprise-wide workforce reduction affecting administrative expenses in both 2003 and 2002 by recording expenses for severance and related employee benefit costs and building impairments. Severance and related employee benefit costs, more fully described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, amounted to $11.2 million in 2003 and $40.2 million in 2002. The 2002 severance amount primarily related to the service center consolidation. Building impairments, more fully described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, amounted to $17.2 million in 2003 and $2.4 million in 2002. During 2002, we recorded $30.1 million of administrative expenses for a contingent contractual provider dispute and other items associated with our 1997 acquisition of Physician Corporation of America, or PCA. The $30.1 million of expenses in 2002 resulted from three issues. First, on January 28, 2003, we settled a dispute with a provider for $8.3 million primarily regarding old claims of PCA subsidiaries dating prior to Humana 1997 acquisition. Second, during the fourth quarter of 2002, as a December 2, 2002 trial date approached, efforts intensified to reach settlement of an old PCA shareholder dispute for periods prior to Humana 1997 acquisition of PCA. As a result, we accrued $15.7 million because the loss was probable and the amount could be reasonably estimated. We reversed $1.8 million of this reserve when the final settlement was paid during the third quarter of 2003. Third, in connection with an agreement reached in November 2002, we partially wrote-off a note receivable of $6.1 million from the purchaser of our workers compensation business which was sold in 2000. The agreement with the purchaser resulted when a significant customer contract was terminated in the fourth quarter of 2002. We acquired the workers compensation business in connection with the 1997 PCA acquisition. The Commercial and Government segments SG&A expense ratios likewise were impacted by the same items described previously. Depreciation and amortization was $126.8 million in 2003, an increase of $6.1 million, or 5.0%, from $120.7 million in 2002. The increase results from accelerated depreciation of software in 2003 of $13.5 million, as more fully described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, partially offset by lower amortization related to other intangible assets as costs associated with the government contract acquired with the TRICARE 2 and 5 transaction became fully amortized in the second quarter of 2003. Interest Expense Interest expense was $17.4 million in 2003, an increase of $0.1 million from $17.3 million in 2002. This increase primarily resulted from higher average outstanding debt due to the issuance of $300 million senior notes in August 2003 offset by lower interest rates. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate in 2003 of 33.6% increased 1.6% compared to the 32% effective tax rate in 2002. The increase in the effective tax rate primarily resulted from a lower proportion of tax-exempt investment income to pretax income. During 2002, the Internal Revenue Service completed their audit of all open years prior to 2000 which resulted in a favorable adjustment to the estimated accrual for income taxes of approximately $32.6 million. This was offset by an increase of approximately $24.5 million in the capital loss valuation allowance after we reevaluated probable capital gain realization in the allowable carryforward period based upon our capital gain experience beginning in 2000 and consideration of alternative tax planning strategies. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate. 34 Table of Contents Liquidity Our primary sources of cash include receipts of premiums, administrative services fees, investment income, and proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities and from borrowings. Our primary uses of cash include disbursements for claims payments, administrative expenses, interest expense, and taxes, purchases of investment securities and capital expenditures and payments on borrowings. Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $580.1 million at December 31, 2004 from $931.4 million at December 31, 2003. The change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 is summarized as follows: 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 347,809 $ 413,140 $ 321,408 Net cash used in investing activities (624,081 ) (382,837 ) (204,974 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (75,053 ) 179,744 (46,497 ) (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (351,325 ) $ 210,047 $ 69,937 Cash Flow from Operating Activities Our operating cash flows in 2004 were significantly impacted by the timing of the Medicare Advantage premium remittance which is payable to us on the first day of each month. When the first day of a month falls on a weekend or holiday, we have historically received this payment at the end of the previous month. As such, the Medicare Advantage receipts for January 2004 of $211.9 million and January 2003 of $205.8 million were received in December 2003 and December 2002, respectively, because January 1 is a holiday. This timing accounts for a significant portion of the unearned revenues balance on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003. Beginning in 2005, the monthly premium payment schedule includes a change in timing from previous practice. As a result of this change, the January 2005 payment of $290.3 million originally scheduled to be received on Friday, December 31, 2004, was changed to Monday, January 3, 2005, or one business day later. Therefore, we received only 11 monthly Medicare Advantage premium remittances during 2004 versus 12 monthly premium remittances during 2003. Other than the impact from the timing of the Medicare Advantage premium receipts, the increase in net income and cash generated from changes in working capital increased our operating cash flow in 2004 compared to 2003. The most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of receipts for premiums and administrative services fees and payments of medical expenses. We illustrate these changes with the following summary of receivables and medical and other expenses payable. The detail of total net receivables was as follows at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002: Change 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 (in thousands) TRICARE: Base receivable $ 396,355 $ 266,656 $ 197,544 $ 129,699 $ 69,112 Bid price adjustments (BPAs) 25,601 92,875 104,044 (67,274 ) (11,169 ) Change orders 6,021 7,073 57,630 (1,052 ) (50,557 ) 427,977 366,604 359,218 61,373 7,386 Less: long-term portion of BPAs (38,794 ) (86,471 ) 38,794 47,677 TRICARE subtotal 427,977 327,810 272,747 100,167 55,063 Commercial and other 186,144 178,577 146,882 7,567 31,695 Allowance for doubtful accounts (34,506 ) (40,400 ) (30,178 ) 5,894 (10,222 ) Total net receivables $ 579,615 $ 465,987 $ 389,451 113,628 76,536 Reconciliation to cash flow statement: Change in long-term receivables (52,583 ) (61,316 ) Provision for doubtful accounts 6,433 7,416 Receivables from acquisition (16,420 ) Change in receivables in cash flow statement $ 51,058 $ 22,636 35 Table of Contents TRICARE base receivables increased in 2004 due to the transition to the reimbursement model under the South Region contract beginning on August 1, 2004. Under our former TRICARE contracts with a fixed price, we bore the cost of changes in the underlying pattern of health care for which the government was at risk until subsequently reimbursed in a later period through a bid price adjustment, or BPA process. The fixed price and BPA process added variability to our revenues, related receivables and operating cash flows because the timing of the settlement was uncertain. Under the new TRICARE South region contract, the fixed price and BPA process was eliminated and replaced with a new reimbursement model. Under the new reimbursement model, claims paid are reimbursed by the federal government generally within 30 business days. The delivery of health care services results in a lag between the time the service is provided and ultimately reimbursed by the federal government, typically three months. Thus, TRICARE receivables are generally collected over a three to four month period. Likewise, TRICARE medical claims payable are generally paid over the same three to four month period. TRICARE base receivables increased in 2003 as rates under our base TRICARE contract increased upon the annual renewal of the contracts for Regions 3 and 4 and Regions 2 and 5. The detail of medical and other expenses payable was as follows at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002: Change 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 (in thousands) IBNR(1) $ 1,164,518 $ 1,043,360 $ 946,596 $ 121,158 $ 96,764 Reported claims in process(2) 97,801 74,262 105,422 23,539 (31,160 ) Other medical expenses payable(3) 159,691 154,534 90,113 5,157 64,421 Total medical and other expenses payable $ 1,422,010 $ 1,272,156 $ 1,142,131 149,854 130,025 Reconciliation to cash flow statement: Medical and other expenses payable from acquisition (71,063 ) Change in medical and other expenses payable in cash flow statement $ 78,791 $ 130,025 (1) IBNR represents an estimate of medical expenses payable for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) at the balance sheet date. The level of IBNR is primarily impacted by membership levels, medical claim trends and the receipt cycle time, which represents the length of time between when a claim is initially incurred and when the claim form is received (i.e. a shorter time span results in a lower IBNR). (2) Reported claims in process represents the estimated valuation of processed claims that are in the post claim adjudication process, which consists of administrative functions such as audit and check batching and handling. (3) Other medical expenses payable includes capitation and pharmacy payables. The balance due to our pharmacy benefit administrator fluctuates due to bi-weekly payments and the month-end cutoff. Medical and other expenses payable increased during 2004 and 2003 due primarily to medical claims inflation. Changes in other liabilities primarily resulted from the timing of payments for taxes, payments related to our TRICARE contract including subcontractors and general vendor payables. Cash Flow from Investing Activities During 2004, we paid $141.8 million to acquire Ochsner, net of $15.3 million of cash acquired. We reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows at an increasing rate over the last several years in investment securities, primarily short-duration fixed income securities, totaling $407.3 million in 2004, $283.1 million in 2003 and $17.9 million in 2002. Our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our technology initiatives and administrative facilities necessary for activities such as claims processing, billing and collections, 36 Table of Contents medical utilization review, and customer service. Total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were $114.1 million in 2004, $101.3 million in 2003, and $112.1 million in 2002. Excluding acquisitions, we expect our total capital expenditures in 2005 to be approximately $115 million, most of which will be used for our technology initiatives and improvement of administrative facilities. Proceeds from the sale of property and equipment relate primarily to consolidating our service centers in Jacksonville and San Antonio including the sale of the Jacksonville office tower in 2004 for $14.8 million and a San Antonio office building for $5.9 million in 2003. Cash Flow from Financing Activities We repurchased 3.8 million common shares for $67.0 million at an average price of $17.83 per share in 2004, 3.7 million common shares for $44.1 million at an average price of $12.03 per share in 2003 and 6.4 million common shares for $74.0 million at an average price of $11.56 per share in 2002. Authorization for additional common share repurchases expired in January 2005. During 2003, we issued $300 million 6.3% senior notes due August 1, 2018 in order to term-out our short-term debt and take advantage of historically low interest rates. In addition, during 2003 we received proceeds of $31.6 million in exchange for new swap agreements. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information regarding our borrowings and swap agreements. Credit Agreement On September 29, 2004, we replaced our existing credit agreements with a new 5-year $600 million unsecured revolving credit agreement which will expire in September 2009. We previously maintained two unsecured revolving credit agreements consisting of a $265 million, 4-year revolving credit agreement and a $265 million, 364-day revolving credit agreement. Under the agreement, at our option, we can borrow on either a competitive advance basis or a revolving credit basis. The revolving credit portion of the agreement bears interest at either a fixed rate or floating rate based on LIBOR plus a spread. The spread, which varies depending on our credit ratings, ranges from 50 to 112.5 basis points. We also pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization. This facility fee, currently 15 basis points, may fluctuate between 12.5 and 37.5 basis points, depending upon our credit ratings. In addition, a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points is payable for any day in which borrowings under the facility exceeds 50% of the total $600 million commitment. The competitive advance portion of any borrowings will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate basis, at our option. The 5-year $600 million credit agreement contains customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary events of default, including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of net worth, minimum interest coverage, and maximum leverage ratios. At December 31, 2004, we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenant requirements. The terms of this credit agreement also includes standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing, including a customary material adverse effect clause which could limit our ability to borrow. We have not experienced a material adverse effect, and we know of no circumstances or events which would be reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect. We do not believe the material adverse effect clause poses a material funding risk to Humana in the future. We have other relationships, including financial advisory and banking, with some of the parties to the new agreement. The maximum amount available for borrowing under the credit agreement was $594.6 million at December 31, 2004, reduced from the $600 million due to securing letters of credit of $5.4 million under the credit agreement. No amounts have ever been drawn on these letters of credit. On February 16, 2005, we paid approximately $450 million in cash for CarePlus including approximately $32 million of statutory capital and surplus in excess of the minimum statutory requirement as well as estimated transaction costs. We financed the transaction with $156 million of cash on hand and $294 million of borrowings under our credit agreement. After the CarePlus transaction, we have $300.6 million of remaining borrowing capacity under the credit agreement. 37 Table of Contents Commercial Paper Program We maintain and may issue short-term debt securities under a commercial paper program when market conditions allow. The program is backed by our credit agreement described above. Aggregate borrowings under both the credit agreement and commercial paper program generally will not exceed $600 million. In connection with the credit arrangement, the conduit commercial paper program allowing indirect access to the commercial paper market through a third party was cancelled. At December 31, 2004, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Shelf Registration Our universal shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission allows us to register debt or equity securities, from time to time, with the amount, price and terms to be determined at the time of the sale. After the issuance of our $300 million, 6.30% senior notes in August 2003, we have up to $300 million remaining from a total of $600 million under the universal shelf registration. The universal shelf registration allows us to use the net proceeds from any future sales of our securities for our operations and for other general corporate purposes, including repayment or refinancing of borrowings, working capital, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, or the repurchase of our outstanding securities. We believe our financial condition is strong and that our cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity markets and borrowing capacity, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and fund future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures. However, adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future. Our investment-grade credit rating at December 31, 2004 was Baa3 according to Moody Investors Services, Inc., or Moody s, and BBB, according to Standard & Poor Corporation, or S&P. A downgrade to Ba2 or lower by Moody and BB or lower by S&P would give the counterparties of three of our interest rate swap agreements with a $300 million notional amount, the right, but not the obligation, to cancel the interest rate swap agreement. If cancelled, we would pay or receive an amount based on the fair market value of the swap agreement. Assuming these swap agreements had been cancelled on December 31, 2004, we would have received $12.1 million, net. Other than the swap agreements, adverse changes in our credit ratings may not create, increase, or accelerate any liabilities. In addition, we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry. Our parent company is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries, most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions. Our parent company liquidity improved during 2004 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increasing $39.9 million to $439.3 million at December 31, 2004 compared to $399.4 million at December 31, 2003. See Schedule 1 to this Form 10-K beginning on page 105 for our parent company financial information. Regulatory Requirements Certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends, loans, or other cash transfers to Humana Inc., our parent company, require minimum levels of equity, as well as limit investments to approved securities. The amount of dividends that may be paid to Humana Inc. by these subsidiaries, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entity level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus. In most states, prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required. As of December 31, 2004, we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $1,185.5 million in our state regulated health insurance subsidiaries. Each of these subsidiaries was in compliance with applicable statutory requirements which aggregated $717.2 million. Although the minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume, product mix, and the quality of assets held, minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level. Certain states rely on risk-based capital requirements, or RBC, to define the required levels of equity. RBC is a model developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to 38 Table of Contents monitor an entity solvency. This calculation indicates recommended minimum levels of required capital and surplus and signals regulatory measures should actual surplus fall below these recommended levels. If RBC were adopted by all states at December 31, 2004, each of our subsidiaries would be in compliance and we would have $405.6 million of aggregate capital and surplus above any of the levels that require corrective action under RBC. Contractual Obligations We are contractually obligated to make payments for years subsequent to December 31, 2004 as follows: Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years (in thousands) Debt(1) $ 898,288 $ 648 $ 301,114 $ 295,080 $ 301,446 Interest(2) 229,563 43,439 56,804 40,518 88,802 Operating leases(3) 232,654 65,088 84,931 52,775 29,860 Purchase and other obligations(4) 43,787 27,693 13,154 2,044 896 Total $ 1,404,292 $ 136,868 $ 456,003 $ 390,417 $ 421,004 (1) Debt includes $294 million of borrowings under the Credit Agreement which matures on September 28, 2009 related to the February 16, 2005 CarePlus acquisition. Debt payments could be accelerated upon violation of debt covenants. We believe the likelihood of debt covenant violation is remote. (2) Interest includes the estimated contractual interest payments under our debt agreements net of the effect of the associated swapagreements assuming no change in the variable LIBOR rate as of December 31, 2004. (3) We lease facilities, computer hardware, and other equipment under long-term operating leases that are noncancelable and expire on various dates through 2017. We sublease facilities or partial facilities to third party tenants for space not used in our operations which partially mitigates our operating lease commitments. An operating lease, accounted for under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases , is a type of off-balance sheet arrangement. Assuming we acquired the asset, rather than leased, we would have recognized a liability for the financing of these assets. See also Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. (4) Purchase and other obligations include agreements to purchase services, primarily information technology related services, or to make improvements to real estate that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum levels of service to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the appropriate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Indemnifications and Guarantees Our operating lease of an airplane, which expires January 1, 2010, provides for a residual value payment of no more than $4.8 million at the end of the lease term. At the end of the term we have the right to exercise a purchase option or the airplane can be sold to a third party. If we decide not to exercise our purchase option, we must pay the lessor a maximum amount of $4.8 million. This amount will be reduced by the net sales proceeds in excess of $4.2 million from the sale of the airplane to a third party. Through indemnity agreements approved by the state regulatory authorities, certain of our regulated subsidiaries generally are guaranteed by Humana Inc., our parent company, in the event of insolvency for (1), member coverage for which premium payment has been made prior to insolvency; (2), benefits for members then hospitalized until discharged; and (3), payment to providers for services rendered prior to insolvency. Our parent also has guaranteed the obligations of our TRICARE subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of us, or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may 39 Table of Contents include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial. Related Parties No related party transactions had a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Certain immaterial related party transactions are discussed in our Proxy Statement for the meeting to be held April 26, 2005 see Certain Transactions with Management and Others. Market Risk-Sensitive Financial Instruments and Positions The level of our pretax earnings is subject to risk due to changes in investment income from our fixed income portfolio which is partially offset by both our debt position and the short-term duration of the fixed income investment portfolio. We evaluated the impact on our investment income and debt expense resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100, 200 and 300 basis points over the next twelve-month period, as reflected in the following table. The modeling technique used to calculate the pro forma net change in pretax earnings considered the cash flows related to fixed income investments and debt, which are subject to interest rate changes during a prospective twelve-month period. This evaluation measures parallel shifts in interest rates and may not account for certain unpredictable events that may effect interest income, including, among others, unexpected changes of cash flow into and out of the portfolio, shifts in the asset mix between taxable and tax-exempt securities, and spread changes specific to various investment categories. In the past ten years, changes in 3 month LIBOR rates during the year have exceeded 300 basis points twice, have not changed between 200 and 300 basis points, have changed between 100 and 200 basis points once and have changed by less than 100 basis points seven times. LIBOR was 2.56% at December 31, 2004. Our model assumed the maximum possible reduction in LIBOR could not exceed 256 basis points.

No termination notices were received in connection with our currently existing contracts. In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, or MMA, was signed into law. We believe MMA offers new opportunities in our Medicare programs, including our HMO, PPO, and Private Fee-For-Service products. We have made additional investments in the Medicare Advantage program to enhance our ability to participate in these expanded programs. 40 Table of Contents Our TRICARE South Region contract, which we were awarded in 2003, covers approximately 2.9 million beneficiaries. The South Region is one of the three regions in the United States as defined by the Department of Defense. The contract is for a five-year period subject to annual renewals at the federal government option with the second option period scheduled to begin April 1, 2005. We currently have Medicaid contracts with the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration through June 30, 2005. Our other Medicaid contracts are in Florida and Illinois, and are annual contracts. As of December 31, 2004, Puerto Rico accounted for approximately 83% of our total Medicaid membership. The loss of any of the contracts above or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative action, including reductions in premium payments to us, or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Legal Proceedings We are party to a variety of legal actions in the ordinary course of business, including employment matters, breach of contract actions, tort claims, and shareholder suits involving alleged securities fraud. A description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under Legal Proceedings of Item 3 in Part 1. We cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty, and we are incurring expenses in defense of these matters. In addition, recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims. Therefore, these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. We continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies related primarily to medical cost and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities, goodwill, and long-lived assets. These estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events, and accordingly, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Medical Expense Recognition Medical expenses are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported, or IBNR. IBNR represents a substantial portion of our medical and other expenses payable as follows: December 31, 2004 Percentage of Total December 31, 2003 Percentage of Total (dollars in thousands) IBNR $ 1,164,518 81.9 % $ 1,043,360 82.0 % Reported claims in process 97,801 6.9 % 74,262 5.8 % Other medical expenses payable 159,691 11.2 % 154,534 12.2 % Total medical and other expenses payable $ 1,422,010 100.0 % $ 1,272,156 100.0 % Estimating IBNR is complex and involves a significant amount of judgment. Accordingly, it represents a critical accounting estimate. Changes in this estimate can materially affect, either favorably or unfavorably, our results from operations and overall financial position. For example, a 100 basis point, or 1 percent, change in the 41 Table of Contents estimate of our medical and other expenses payable at December 31, 2004, which represents approximately 40% of total liabilities, would require an adjustment of approximately $14 million in a future period in which a revision in the estimate became known. We develop our estimate for IBNR using actuarial methodologies and assumptions, primarily based upon historical claim payment and claim receipt patterns, as well as historical medical cost trends. Depending on the period for which incurred claims are estimated, we apply a different method in determining our estimate. For periods prior to the most recent three months, the key assumption used in estimating our IBNR is that the completion factor pattern remains consistent over a rolling 12-month period after adjusting for known changes in claim inventory levels and known changes in claim payment processes. Completion factors result from the calculation of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have historically been adjudicated as of the reporting period. For the most recent three months, the incurred claims are estimated primarily from a trend analysis based upon per member per month claims trends developed from our historical experience in the preceding months, adjusted for known changes in estimates of recent hospital and drug utilization data, provider contracting changes, changes in benefit levels, product mix, and weekday seasonality. The completion factor method is used for the months of incurred claims prior to the most recent three months because the historical percentage of claims processed for those months is at a level sufficient to produce a consistently reliable result. Conversely, for the most recent three months of incurred claims, the volume of claims processed historically is not at a level sufficient to produce a reliable result, which therefore requires us to examine historical trend patterns as the primary method of evaluation. Medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy. The drivers of medical cost trends include increases in the utilization of hospital facilities, physician services, prescription drugs, and new medical technologies, as well as the inflationary effect on the cost per unit of each of these expense components. Other external factors such as government-mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, increases in medical services capacity, direct to consumer advertising for prescription drugs and medical services, an aging population, catastrophes, and epidemics also may impact medical cost trends. Internal factors such as system conversions, claims processing cycle times, changes in medical management practices and changes in provider contracts also may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends. All of these factors are considered in estimating IBNR and in estimating the per member per month claims trend for purposes of determining the reserve for the most recent three months. Additionally, we continually prepare and review follow-up studies to assess the reasonableness of the estimates generated by our process and methods over time. The results of these studies are also considered in determining the reserve for the most recent three months. Each of these factors requires significant judgment by management. The completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the IBNR estimate. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on December 31, 2004 data: Completion Factor(a): Claims Trend Factor(b): (Decrease) Increase in Factor Increase (Decrease) in Medical and Other Expenses Payable (Decrease) Increase in Factor (Decrease) Increase in Medical and Other Expenses Payable (dollars in thousands) (3 %) $ 141,000 (3 %) $ (66,000 ) (2 %) $ 92,000 (2 %) $ (44,000 ) (1 %) $ 45,000 (1 %) $ (23,000 ) 1 % $ (43,000 ) 1 % $ 20,000 2 % $ (84,000 ) 2 % $ 42,000 3 % $ (123,000 ) 3 % $ 63,000 (a) Reflects estimated potential changes in medical and other expenses payable caused by changes in completion factors for incurred months prior to the most recent three months. 42 Table of Contents (b) Reflects estimated potential changes in medical and other expenses payable caused by changes in annualized claims trend used for the estimation of per member per month incurred claims for the most recent three months. Most medical claims are paid within a few months of the member receiving service from a physician or other health care provider. As a result, these liabilities generally are described as having a short-tail , which causes less than 2% of our medical and other expenses payable as of the end of any given period to be outstanding for more than 12 months. As such, we expect that substantially all of the 2004 estimate of medical and other expenses payable will be known and paid during 2005. Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards. Actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that the liabilities established for IBNR have a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient, or such that the liabilities established for IBNR are sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. Adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate. Therefore, in many situations, the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice. IBNR established in connection with our TRICARE contracts is typically more difficult to estimate than for our other operations, because there are more variables that impact the estimate. These variables include continual changes in the number of eligible beneficiaries, changes in the utilization of military treatment facilities and changes in levels of benefits versus the original contract provisions. Many of these variables are impacted significantly by an increase or decrease in military activity involving the United States armed forces. Additionally, we transitioned to the new TRICARE South Region contract during the latter half of 2004. Accordingly, our historical claims experience and familiarity with claim payment patterns for this block of business is not as mature as our other lines of business. We have considered all of these factors in establishing our IBNR estimate. Each of these factors required significant judgment by management. As more fully described on page 45, our TRICARE contract contains risk-sharing provisions with the Department of Defense and with subcontractors, which effectively limit profits and losses when actual claim experience varies from the targeted medical claim amount negotiated in our annual bid. As a result of these contract provisions, the impact of changes in estimates for prior year TRICARE medical claims payable on our results of operations is reduced substantially, whether positive or negative. As more fully described on pages 10 and 11, we have a substantial percentage of our Medicare and Medicaid membership under risk-sharing arrangements with providers. Accordingly, the impact of changes in estimates for prior year medical claims payable on our results from operations that are attributable to our Medicare and Medicaid lines of business may also be significantly reduced, whether positive or negative. 43 Table of Contents The following table provides a reconciliation of changes in medical and other expenses payable for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002: 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Balances at January 1 $ 1,272,156 $ 1,142,131 $ 1,086,386 Acquisitions 71,063 Incurred related to: Current year 10,763,105 9,955,491 9,125,915 Prior years (93,458 ) (76,070 ) 12,281 Total incurred 10,669,647 9,879,421 9,138,196 Paid related to: Current year (9,504,331 ) (8,710,393 ) (8,002,610 ) Prior years (1,086,525 ) (1,039,003 ) (1,079,841 ) Total paid (10,590,856 ) (9,749,396 ) (9,082,451 ) Balances at December 31 $ 1,422,010 $ 1,272,156 $ 1,142,131 Amounts incurred related to prior years vary from previously estimated liabilities as the claims are ultimately settled. Negative amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims being ultimately settled for amounts less than originally estimated (favorable development). Positive amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims ultimately being settled for amounts greater than originally estimated (unfavorable development). As summarized in the previous table, claim reserve balances at December 31, 2003 ultimately settled during 2004 for $93.5 million less than the amounts originally estimated, representing 0.9% of medical claim expenses incurred in 2003. During 2003, claim reserve balances at December 31, 2002 ultimately settled for $76.1 million less than the amounts originally estimated, representing 0.8% of medical claim expenses recorded in 2002. This $17.4 million change in the amounts incurred related to prior years resulted primarily from favorable development in our Medicare line of business as a result of better than expected utilization in the latter half of 2003. The substantial majority of this favorable development in the Medicare business occurred under risk-sharing arrangements with providers, which resulted in minimizing the impact on our reported 2004 results from operations. During 2002, claim reserve balances at December 31, 2001 ultimately settled for $12.3 million more than the amounts originally recorded, representing 0.1% of medical claim expenses recorded in 2001. The $88.4 million change in the amounts incurred related to prior years during 2003 consists of $68.3 million attributable to our TRICARE operations with the remaining $20.1 million primarily resulting from fourth quarter 2002 utilization in our commercial medical products ultimately being lower than originally estimated. The $68.3 million change in TRICARE incurred related to prior years resulted from establishing medical expense reserves resulting from enhanced benefits enacted for TRICARE beneficiaries as a result of congressional legislation, as well as lower than originally estimated utilization of medical services by TRICARE beneficiaries in the second half of 2002. Revenue Recognition We generally establish one-year contracts with commercial employer groups, subject to cancellation by the employer group 30-day written notice. Our contracts with federal or state governments are generally multi-year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions with the exception of our Medicare Advantage contracts with the federal government which renew annually. Our commercial contracts establish rates on a per member basis for each month of coverage. Except for TRICARE contracts discussed in the following section, our government contracts also establish monthly rates per member but may have additional amounts due to us based on items 44 Table of Contents such as age, working status, or specific health issues of the member. Changes in revenues from CMS for our Medicare Advantage products resulting from the periodic changes in risk adjustment scores for our membership are recognized when the amounts become determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. Premium revenues and ASO fees are estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates. In addition, we adjust revenues for estimated changes in an employer enrollment and customers that ultimately may fail to pay. Enrollment changes not yet reported by an employer group, an individual, or the government, also known as retroactive membership adjustments, are estimated based on historical trends. We monitor the collectibility of specific accounts, the aging of receivables, as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions, and reflect any required adjustments in the current period revenue. We bill and collect premium and ASO fee remittances from employer groups, the federal and state governments, and individual Medicare Advantage members monthly. Premium and ASO fee receivables are presented net of allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts and retroactive membership adjustments. Premiums and ASO fees received prior to the period members are entitled to receive services are recorded as unearned revenues. TRICARE Contract In 2004, TRICARE revenues represented 17% of total premiums and administrative services fees. The single TRICARE contract for the South Region includes multiple revenue generating activities and as such was evaluated under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables . We allocate the consideration to the various components based on the relative fair values of the components. TRICARE revenues consist generally of (1) an insurance premium for assuming underwriting risk for the cost of civilian healthcare services delivered to eligible beneficiaries; (2) healthcare services provided to beneficiaries which are in turn reimbursed by the federal government; and, (3) administrative service fees related to claim processing, customer service, enrollment, disease management and other services. We recognize the insurance premium as revenue ratably over the period coverage is provided. Health care services reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period health care services are provided. Administrative service fees are recognized as revenue in the period services are performed. The TRICARE contract contains provisions whereby the federal government bears a substantial portion of the risk associated with financing the cost of health benefits. Annually, we negotiate a target healthcare cost amount, or target cost, with the federal government and determine an underwriting fee. Any variance from the target cost is shared. We earn more revenue or incur additional costs based on the variance in actual health care costs versus the negotiated target cost. We receive 20% for any cost underrun, subject to a ceiling that limits the underwriting profit to 10% of the target cost. We pay 20% for any cost overrun, subject to a floor that limits the underwriting loss to negative 4% of the target cost. A final settlement occurs 12 to 18 months after the end of each contract year to which it applies. We defer the recognition of any revenues for favorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost underruns until the amount is determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. We estimate and recognize unfavorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost overruns currently in operations as an increase in medical expenses. The TRICARE contract contains provisions to negotiate change orders. Change orders occur when we perform services or incur costs under the directive of the federal government that were not originally specified in our contract. Under federal regulations we may be entitled to an equitable adjustment to the contract price in these situations. Change orders may be negotiated and settled at any time throughout the year. We record revenue applicable to change orders when services are performed and these amounts are determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Our former TRICARE contracts for Regions 3 and 4 and Regions 2 and 5, which expired during 2004, contained provisions for not only change orders but for bid price adjustments, or BPAs as well. There are no provisions for BPAs in our current TRICARE contract. BPAs were utilized to retroactively adjust revenues for 45 Table of Contents the impact of the items for which the federal government retains risk, including the risks associated with changes in usage levels at military treatment facilities, or MTFs, change in the number of persons eligible for TRICARE benefits, and medical unit cost inflation. We work closely with the federal government to obtain and review eligibility and MTF workload data, and to quantify and negotiate amounts recoverable or payable under our contractual BPA requirements. Final settlement of BPAs occurs only at specified intervals, typically in excess of 6 months after the end of a contract year. We record revenues applicable to BPAs when these amounts are determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Investment Securities Investment securities totaled $2,494.1 million, or 44% of total assets at December 31, 2004. Debt securities totaled $2,452.0 million, or 98% of our total investment portfolio. More than 94% of our debt securities were of investment-grade quality, with an average credit rating of AA+ by Standard & Poor at December 31, 2004. Most of the debt securities that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end (BB or better) of the non-investment grade spectrum. Our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types. Duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in market value and changes in interest rates, providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our debt securities to changes in interest rates. However, actual market values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration. The average duration of our debt securities was approximately 3.3 years at December 31, 2004. Based on this duration, a 1% increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our debt securities by approximately $80 million. Our investment securities are categorized as available for sale and, as a result, are stated at fair value. Fair value of publicly traded debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices. Non-traded debt securities are priced independently by a third party vendor. Fair value of venture capital debt securities that are privately held, or where an observable quoted market price does not exist, are estimated using a variety of valuation methodologies. Such methodologies include reviewing the value ascribed to the most recent financing, comparing the security with securities of publicly traded companies in a similar line of business, and reviewing the underlying financial performance including estimating discounted cash flows. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of applicable deferred taxes, are included as a component of stockholders equity until realized from a sale or impairment. Gross unrealized losses and fair value, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at December 31, 2004, included the following: Less than 12 months 12 months or more Total Fair Value Unrealized Losses Fair Value Unrealized Losses Fair Value Unrealized Losses (in thousands) U.S. Government obligations $ 486,209 $ (3,717 ) $ 4,351 $ (136 ) $ 490,560 $ (3,853 ) Tax exempt municipal securities 316,913 (3,346 ) 26,869 (647 ) 343,782 (3,993 ) Corporate and other securities 171,048 (1,846 ) 32,719 (1,418 ) 203,767 (3,264 ) Mortgage-backed securities 28,865 (430 ) 16,581 (753 ) 45,446 (1,183 ) Redeemable preferred stocks 6,266 (158 ) 1,238 (12 ) 7,504 (170 ) Debt securities 1,009,301 (9,497 ) 81,758 (2,966 ) 1,091,059 (12,463 ) Non-redeemable preferred stocks 8,455 (240 ) 10,789 (329 ) 19,244 (569 ) Total investment securities $ 1,017,756 $ (9,737 ) $ 92,547 $ (3,295 ) $ 1,110,303 $ (13,032 ) We regularly evaluate our investment securities for impairment. We consider factors affecting the investee, factors affecting the industry the investee operates within, and general debt and equity market trends. We consider the length of time an investment fair value has been below carrying value, the near term prospects for 46 Table of Contents recovery to carrying value and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or market recovery is realized. If and when a determination is made that a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary, the related investment is written down to its estimated fair value through earnings. The risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations; facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time; or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment. The determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment. The discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments. The status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment. Unrealized losses at December 31, 2004 resulted from 254 positions from a total of 797 positions held. Less than 4% of the carrying value of our consolidated investment securities have been in an unrealized loss position greater than one year. The unrealized losses at December 31, 2004 generally can be attributed to changes in interest rates. All issuers of securities trading at an unrealized loss remain current on all contractual payments and we believe it is probable that we will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the debt securities. After taking into account these and other factors, including our ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery or maturity, we determined the unrealized losses on these investment securities were temporary. There were no impairment losses recorded in 2004. We recorded impairment losses of $3.2 million in 2003 and $27.2 million in 2002 after an evaluation indicated that a decline in fair value below the cost basis was other than temporary. Goodwill and Long-lived Assets At December 31, 2004, goodwill and other long-lived assets represented 23% of total assets and 63% of total stockholders equity. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , requires that we not amortize goodwill to earnings, but instead that we test goodwill at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. A reporting unit is one level below our Commercial and Government segments. The Commercial segment two reporting units consist of fully and self-insured medical and specialty. The Government segment three reporting units consist of Medicare Advantage, TRICARE and Medicaid. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition. Our strategy, long-range business plan, and annual planning process supports our goodwill impairment tests. These tests are based primarily on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows under several scenarios. We used a range of discount rates that correspond to our weighted-average cost of capital. Key assumptions including changes in membership, premium yields, medical cost trends and certain government contract extensions are consistent with those utilized in our long-range business plan and annual planning process. If these assumptions differ from actual, the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected. Goodwill impairment tests completed in each of the last three years did not result in an impairment loss. Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets. These assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life, and are subject to impairment reviews. We periodically review long-lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. In assessing recoverability, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist, and, if so, estimate fair value. We also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our long-lived assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life, including accelerating depreciation for these assets. We recognized losses due to 47 Table of Contents impairment and accelerated depreciation from changes in estimated useful life of $9.3 million in 2004, $30.8 million in 2003 and $2.4 million in 2002. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB 51 , or FIN 46. The primary objectives of FIN 46 are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights (variable interest entities, or VIEs) and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the VIE (the primary beneficiary). In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46-R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an interpretation of ARB 51 (revised December 2003) , which amended certain provisions of FIN 46 and delayed implementation for entities that are not considered special purpose entities until the first quarter of 2004. As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate or knowingly seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or SPEs, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of December 31, 2004, we are not involved in any SPE transactions. The adoption of FIN 46 or FIN 46-R did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123R, Share-Based Payment , or Statement 123R, which requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock-based compensation. This requirement represents a significant change because fixed-based stock option awards, a predominate form of stock compensation for us, were not recognized as compensation expense under APB 25. Statement 123R requires the cost of the award, as determined on the date of grant at fair value, be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (usually the vesting period). The grant-date fair value of the award will be estimated using option-pricing models. We are required to adopt Statement 123R no later than July 1, 2005 under one of three transition methods, including a prospective, retrospective and combination approach. We disclose on page 67 the effect of expensing stock options under a fair value approach using the Black-Scholes pricing model for 2004, 2003 and 2002. We currently are evaluating all of the provisions of Statement 123R and the expected effect on us including, among other items, reviewing compensation strategies related to stock-based awards, selecting an option pricing model and determining the transition method. In March 2004, the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 03-1, or EITF 03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments . EITF 03-1 includes new guidance for evaluating and recording impairment losses on certain debt and equity investments when the fair value of the investment security is less than its carrying value. In September 2004, the FASB delayed the previously scheduled third quarter 2004 effective date until the issuance of additional implementation guidance, expected in 2005. Upon issuance of a final standard, we will evaluate the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Cautionary Statements This document includes both historical and forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are made within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and we are including this statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events, trends and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, among other things, the information discussed below. In making these 48 Table of Contents statements, we are not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or results. Our business is highly complicated, regulated and competitive with many different factors affecting results. If the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members, or if our estimates of medical claim reserves based upon our estimates of future medical claims are inadequate, our profitability could decline. We use a significant portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members. These costs include claims payments, capitation payments, allocations of some centralized expenses and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members. These costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members. Generally, premiums in the health care business are fixed for one-year periods. Accordingly, costs we incur in excess of our medical cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums. We estimate the costs of our future medical claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns, medical inflation, historical developments, including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns, and other relevant factors. We also record medical claims reserves for future payments. We continually review estimates of future payments relating to medical claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves. However, increases in the use or cost of services by our members, competition, government regulations and many other factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums. These factors may include: increased use of medical facilities and services, including prescription drugs; increased cost of such services; the Company membership mix; variances in actual versus estimated levels of cost associated with new products, benefits or lines of business, product changes or benefit level changes; membership in markets lacking adequate provider networks; changes in the demographic characteristics of an account or market; termination of capitation arrangements resulting in the transfer of membership to fee-for-service arrangements; changes or reductions of our utilization management functions such as preauthorization of services, concurrent review or requirements for physician referrals; possible changes in our pharmacy rebate program with drug manufacturers; catastrophes, including acts of terrorism, epidemics, or severe weather; the introduction of new or costly treatments, including new technologies; medical cost inflation; and new government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes. Failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient medical claim reserves may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. If we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, our membership and profitability could decline. We are in a highly competitive industry. Many of our competitors are more established in the health care industry and have a larger market share and greater financial resources than we do in some markets. In addition, 49 Table of Contents other companies may enter our markets in the future, including emerging competitors in the Medicare Advantage program and in consumer-directed health plans, such as Health Savings Accounts ( HSA ). We believe that barriers to entry in many markets are not substantial, so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily, and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors. Contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually. While health plans compete on the basis of many factors, including service and the quality and depth of provider networks, we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition. In addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs, we face intense competitive pressure to contain premium prices. Factors such as business consolidations, strategic alliances, legislative reform and marketing practices create pressure to contain premium price increases, despite being faced with increasing medical costs. The commercial pricing environment, particularly in the 2 to 300 member groups, is extremely competitive, and several of our competitors, including public and not-for-profit companies, are pricing aggressively to gain market share. Premium increases, introduction of new product designs, and our relationship with our providers in various markets, among other issues, could also affect our membership levels. Other actions that could affect membership levels include the possible exit of or entrance to Medicare Advantage or Commercial markets. To determine the fixed monthly payments per member to pay to managed care plans, CMS has implemented a risk adjustment model that uses diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings (hospital outpatient department and physician visits). CMS has also redesigned its data collection and processing system to reduce administrative data burden on Medicare health plans. In 2004, the portion of risk adjusted payment was increased to 30 percent, from 10 percent in 2003. The 100% phase-in of risk adjusted payment will be completed in 2007; the portion of risk adjusted payment will increase to 50 percent in 2005 and 75 percent in 2006. Under the new risk adjustment methodology, Humana and all managed care organizations must collect, capture and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to CMS twice a year. As a result of this process and the phasing in of the risk adjustment methodology described above, our CMS monthly payments per member may change materially, either favorably or unfavorably. If we do not compete effectively in our markets, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share, if membership does not increase as we expect, or if it declines, or if we lose accounts with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our future performance depends in large part upon our management team ability to execute our strategy to position the Company for the future. This strategy includes the growth of our Commercial segment business, with emphasis on our ASO and individual products, introduction of new products and benefit designs, including our Smart, consumer-choice products, opportunities created with the new Medicare Advantage products, the adoption of new technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and contracts. We believe that by combining our abilities in product design, clinical programs and consumer engagement, we can achieve cost savings for our customers and our company. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our operational and strategic initiatives that are intended to position the Company for future growth or that the products we design will be accepted. Failure to implement this strategy or to contain our administrative expenses in line with our membership may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 50 Table of Contents If we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data, or to strategically implement new information systems, or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our business depends significantly on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business. Our business strategy involves providing members and providers with easy to use products that leverage our information to meet their needs. Our ability to adequately price our products and services, provide effective and efficient service to our customers, and to timely and accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems. As a result of our past and on-going acquisition activities, we have acquired additional systems. We have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems we operate, have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities, and are gradually migrating existing business to fewer systems. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity, we could have operational disruptions, have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes, have regulatory problems, have increases in operating expenses, lose existing customers, have difficulty in attracting new customers, or suffer other adverse consequences. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, and changing customer preferences. We depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systems-related support, equipment, facilities, and certain data, including data center operations, data network, voice communication services and pharmacy data processing. This dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties failure to perform adequately under the contract, due to internal or external factors. A change in service providers could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which could adversely affect our operating results. We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trade secrets and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry. We expect software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this area grows. There can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems, developing new systems to support our operations, integrating new systems, protecting our proprietary information, and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future. Failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial positions, results of operations and cash flows. If we fail to manage prescription drug costs successfully, our financial results could suffer. In general, prescription drug costs have been rapidly rising over the past few years. These increases are due to the introduction of new drugs costing significantly more than existing drugs, direct to consumer advertising by the pharmaceutical industry that creates consumer demand for particular brand-name drugs, and members seeking medications to address lifestyle changes. In order to control prescription drug costs, we have implemented multi-tiered copayment benefit designs for prescription drugs, including our four-tiered copayment benefit design, Rx4 and an Rx allowance program organized by evidence based impact. We cannot assure that these efforts will be successful in controlling costs. Failure to control these costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 51 Table of Contents We are involved in various legal actions, which, if resolved unfavorably to us, could result in substantial monetary damages. We are a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business, including employment and employment discrimination-related suits, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, and tort claims. We, together with some of our competitors in the health benefits business are defendants in a number of purported class action lawsuits. These include an action originally filed against us and nine of our competitors that purports to be brought on behalf of health care providers. Two companies have now settled this action. This suit alleges breaches of federal statutes, including ERISA and RICO. Depending upon the outcome of these cases, these lawsuits may cause or force changes in the practices of the managed care industry. In addition, because of the nature of the health care business, we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations, including the design, management and offering of products and services. These include and could include in the future: claims relating to the methodologies for calculating premiums; claims relating to the denial of health care benefits; challenges to the use of some software products used in administering claims; medical malpractice actions based on our medical necessity decisions or brought against us on the theory that we are liable for our providers alleged malpractice; allegations of anti-competitive and unfair business activities; provider disputes over compensation and termination of provider contracts; disputes related to self-funded business, including actions alleging claim administration errors; claims related to the failure to disclose some business practices; and claims relating to customer audits and contract performance. In some cases, substantial non-economic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal False Claims Act, RICO and other statutes may be sought. While we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities, other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded. Additionally, the cost of business insurance coverage has increased significantly. As a result, we have increased the amount of risk that we self-insure, particularly with respect to matters incidental to our business. We believe that we are adequately insured for claims in excess of our self-insurance. However, some types of damages, like punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance, particularly in those jurisdictions in which coverage of punitive damages is prohibited. Insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future. A description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under Legal Proceedings in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. We cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty, and we are incurring expenses in the defense of these matters. Therefore, these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. As a government contractor, we are exposed to additional risks that could adversely affect our business or our willingness to participate in government health care programs. A significant portion of our revenues relates to federal and state government health care coverage programs, including the TRICARE, Medicare Advantage, and Medicaid programs. These programs involve various risks, including: At December 31, 2004, under one of our contracts with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, we provided health insurance coverage to approximately 231,700 members in Florida. This contract accounted for approximately 15% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the 52 Table of Contents year ended December 31, 2004. The loss of this and other CMS contracts or significant changes in the Medicare Advantage program as a result of legislative or administrative action, including reductions in payments to us or increases in benefits to members without corresponding increases in payments, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; At December 31, 2004, our TRICARE business, which accounted for approximately 17% of our total premiums and ASO fees during 2004, consisted of the South Region contract. The South Region contract is a five-year contract, subject to annual renewals at the Government option that covers approximately 2.9 million beneficiaries. This contract also is generally subject to frequent change from events and circumstances such as the escalated conflict in the Middle East. These changes may include a reduction or increase in the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll, in the revenue we receive or in our administrative or health care costs. In the event government reimbursements were to decline from projected amounts, our failure to reduce the health care costs associated with these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business. The loss of our current TRICARE contract would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows; At December 31, 2004, under our contract with the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration, we provided health insurance coverage to approximately 396,600 Medicaid members in Puerto Rico. This contract, which expires June 30, 2005 accounted for approximately 3% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2004. Due to the election of a new governor and a new Commissioner of Insurance in Puerto Rico, the renewal of the Medicaid contract is uncertain. At this time we are unable to predict the outcome. The loss of this contract or significant changes in the Puerto Rico Medicaid program as a result of legislative or administrative action, including reductions in payments to us or increases in benefits to members without corresponding increases in payments, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; changes to these government programs in the future may also affect our ability or willingness to participate in these programs; higher comparative medical costs; government regulatory and reporting requirements; higher marketing and advertising costs per member as a result of marketing to individuals as opposed to groups; and the possibility of temporary or permanent suspension from participating in government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, if we are convicted of fraud or other criminal conduct in the performance of a health care program or if there is an adverse decision against us under the federal False Claims Act. Our industry is currently subject to substantial government regulation, which, along with possible increased governmental regulation or legislative reform, increases our costs of doing business and could adversely affect our profitability. The health care industry in general, and health insurance, particularly health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, and preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, are subject to substantial federal and state government regulation, including: regulation relating to minimum net worth; licensing requirements; approval of policy language and benefits; mandated benefits and processes; provider compensation arrangements; 53 Table of Contents member disclosure; approval of entry, withdrawal or re-entry into a state or market; premium rates; and periodic examinations by state and federal agencies. State regulations require our licensed, operating subsidiaries to maintain minimum net worth requirements and restrict some investment activities. Additionally, those regulations restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make dividend payments, loans, loan repayments or other payments to us. In recent years, significant federal and state legislation affecting our business has been enacted. State and federal governmental authorities are continually considering changes to laws and regulations applicable to us and are currently considering regulations relating to: mandatory benefits and products; rules tightening time periods in which claims must be paid; medical malpractice reform; defining medical necessity; health insurance access; provider compensation and contract language; disclosure of provider fee schedules and other data about payments to providers, sometimes called transparency; product flexibility and use of innovative technology; disclosure of provider quality information; health plan liability to members who fail to receive appropriate care; disclosure and composition of physician networks; formation of regional/national association health plans for small employers; adding further restrictions and administrative requirements on the use, retention, transmission, processing, production and disclosure of personally identifiable health information; physicians ability to collectively negotiate contract terms with carriers, including fees; and mental health parity. All of these proposals could apply to us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals or licenses or that legislative or regulatory change will not have a material adverse effect on our business. Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain required approvals could adversely affect our revenue or the number of our members, increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, has adopted risk-based capital requirements, also known as RBC, which is subject to state-by-state adoption and to the extent implemented, sets minimum capitalization requirements for insurance and HMO companies. The NAIC recommendations for life insurance companies were adopted in all states and the prescribed calculation for HMOs has been adopted in most states in which we operate. The HMO rules may increase the minimum capital required for some of our subsidiaries. The use of individually identifiable data by our business is regulated at federal and state levels. These laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation. Various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data. Most are derived from the privacy provisions in the 54 Table of Contents federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. HIPAA includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions, establishing uniform health care provider, payer, and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data. Regulations issued in February 2003 set standards for the security of electronic health information requiring compliance by April 21, 2005. Violations of these rules will subject us to significant penalties. Compliance with HIPAA regulations requires significant systems enhancements, training and administrative effort. The final rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws, but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent. HIPAA could also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates. Another area receiving increased focus is the time in which various laws require the payment of health care claims. Many states already have legislation in place covering payment of claims within a specific number of days. However, due to provider groups advocating for laws or regulations establishing even stricter standards, procedures and penalties, we expect additional regulatory scrutiny and supplemental legislation with respect to claims payment practices. The provider-sponsored bills are characterized by stiff penalties for late payment, including high interest rates payable to providers and costly fines levied by state insurance departments and attorneys general. This legislation and possible future regulation and oversight could expose our Company to additional liability and penalties. We are also subject to various governmental audits and investigations. These can include audits and investigations by state attorneys general, CMS, the Office of the Inspector General of Health and Human Services, the Office of Personnel Management, the Department of Justice, the Department of Labor, the Defense Contract Audit Agency, and state Departments of Insurance and Departments of Health. Several Attorneys General are currently investigating the practices of insurance brokers, including those of certain of the companies in the health care industry. All of these activities could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in various programs, or the imposition of fines, penalties and other sanctions. In addition, disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our industry or our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services. If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members, our business could be adversely affected. We contract with physicians, hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members. Our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers. These providers may share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a cost-effective manner. In any particular market, providers could refuse to contract with us, demand to contract with us, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us, less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, some providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions and negotiating power. In addition, physician or practice management companies, which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage, may, in some cases, compete directly with us. If these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected. In some situations, we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care physicians for an actuarially determined, fixed, per-member-per-month fee under which physicians are paid an amount to provide all required medical services to our members (i.e. capitation). The inability of providers to properly manage costs under these capitation arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship with us. In addition, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with 55 Table of Contents whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. The financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us, even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider. There can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations. Our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries is restricted. Because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of Humana Inc., the parent company. These subsidiaries generally are regulated by states Departments of Insurance. In most states, we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts, or, in some states, any amount. In addition, we normally notify the state Departments of Insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval. We are also required by law to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. Debt ratings are an important factor in our competitive position. Claims paying ability, financial strength, and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. We believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to certain of our customers, and our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings. Each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future. Our ratings reflect each rating agency opinion of our financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders, but are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common stock and should not be relied upon as such. Downgrades in our ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business. The health benefits industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry. This publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation, including some large jury awards, legislative activity, regulation and governmental review of industry practices. These factors may adversely affect our ability to market our products or services, may require us to change our products or services, may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require us to pay large judgments or fines. Any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
