ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We are a diversified chemical company serving agricultural, consumer and industrial markets globally with innovative solutions, applications and market-leading products. We operate in three distinct business segments: Agricultural Products, Specialty Chemicals and Industrial Chemicals. Our Agricultural Products segment develops, markets and sells all three major classes of crop protection chemicals insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides with particular strength in insecticides and herbicides. These products are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of insects, weeds and disease, as well as pest control in non-agricultural markets. Specialty Chemicals consists of our BioPolymer and lithium businesses. This segment focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture, color, structure and physical stability, pharmaceutical additives for binding, encapsulation and disintegrant applications, ultrapure biopolymers for medical devices and lithium for energy storage specialty polymers and pharmaceutical synthesis. Our Industrial Chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials, including soda ash, hydrogen peroxide, specialty peroxygens, zeolites and silicates. Through December 31, 2010, our Industrial Chemicals segment also held a niche position in phosphorous chemicals products, however, in November 2010, we made the decision to exit the phosphate business with the shutdown of our Huelva facility in Spain. 2011 Highlights Our businesses continue to experience positive results primarily from higher volumes and higher pricing. Results for 2011 reflect increases in both consolidated revenues and earnings in all three of our operating segments driven by solid performance. We also made significant progress towards our Vision 2015 strategic plan. The following are the more significant developments in our businesses during the year ended December 31, 2011: Revenue of $3,377.9 million in 2011 increased $381.2 million or 13 percent versus last year when excluding the $119.6 million impact of revenues from the exited phosphate and sulfur derivatives businesses in Spain during 2010. Revenue increased in all businesses and in all regions. A more detailed review of revenues by segment are included under the section entitled Results of Operations . On a regional basis-adjusted to exclude exited businesses discussed above- sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa increased eight percent, sales in Asia were up 19 percent, sales in Latin America grew 22 percent and sales in North America were up six percent. Our gross margin of $1,167.4 million increased $116.7 million or approximately 11 percent versus last year. Gross margin percent of approximately 35 percent increased slightly by one percentage point compared to last year, as higher selling prices were mostly offset by higher costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding non-operating pension and postretirement charges, of $428 million increased $36.7 million or approximately nine percent, largely due to increased spending on targeted growth initiatives and to a lesser extent foreign exchange. 24 Table of Contents Adjusted earnings after-tax from continuing operations attributable to FMC stockholders of approximately $429 million increased approximately $68 million or 19 percent primarily due to higher operating results in all three of our segments and to a lesser extent a lower effective tax rate. See the disclosure of our Adjusted Earnings Non-GAAP financial measurement below under the section titled Results of Operations . In 2011, we incurred restructuring charges largely associated with the phase out of the Sodium Percarbonate plant assets in La Zaida, Spain which represented a $21 million charge. We also completed the following Vision 2015 growth initiatives: In July 2011, we established Ruralco Soluciones, a joint venture in Argentina to directly access that country's large and growing agrochemicals market. This acquisition fits our Vision 2015 strategy to expand our reach in rapidly developing economies, and will allow FMC to accelerate its growth and market access in Argentina's crop protection market. In August 2011, we entered into development and distribution agreements with Christian Hansen and Marrone Bio Innovations, respectively for biological products used in agricultural applications. In September 2011, we formed Natronx Technologies in partnership with Church & Dwight and TATA Chemicals to manufacture and market sodium-based, dry sorbents for air pollution control in electric utility and industrial boiler operations. In October 2011, we completed the acquisition of the persulfates business of RheinPerChemie to accelerate our shift to high-margin specialty peroxygens. The acquisition strengthens FMC Peroxygens' global reach and immediately broadens our product portfolio for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Additionally, the acquisition of RPC will enable FMC to globalize our specialty peroxygens franchises in environmental, electronics, food safety and other applications. In November 2011, we completed the acquisition of South Pole Biogroup Ltda, a natural colors and health ingredients producer to broaden our food ingredients portfolio. The acquisition further expands our portfolio of natural specialty products used in the food, beverage, personal care, nutrition and pharmaceutical markets. Also in November 2011, we acquired the assets of Adventus Intellectual Property, expanding our growing portfolio of advanced specialty solutions serving the global site remediation market, adding new bioremediation technology for chlorinated organic compounds, pesticides and hazardous metals that complement our existing peroxygen-based solutions. The acquisition enables FMC to broaden its growing portfolio of advanced specialty solutions serving the global site remediation market. In December 2011, we acquired the Rovral and Sportak fungicide product lines from BayerCrop Science. These established fungicides are highly effective, resistance management technologies that are used worldwide with brands well recognized by leading agricultural customers around the world. Rovral and Sportak are registered in more than 50 countries, and are used in a wide range of crops, including cereals, canola, soybean, rice, potatoes, fruits and vegetables. They offer fungicidal performance in terms of disease control, are well suited to integrated pest management strategies, and are useful tools in anti-resistance programs. 2012 Outlook In 2012, we expect another year of solid performance. We expect to have increased revenues driven by higher volumes in our Agricultural Products segment, particularly in Latin America, North America and Asia, as a result of strong market conditions and higher selling prices and volumes in both Specialty and Industrial Chemicals. We expect an increase in earnings, mostly driven by higher sales as discussed above. Our projected earnings increase is expected to be partially offset by higher spending on growth initiatives and higher raw material costs and energy costs. We expect cash flow from our business segments to remain strong. 25 Table of Contents Results of Operations 2011, 2010 and 2009 Overview The following presents a reconciliation of our segment operating profit to net income attributable to FMC stockholders as seen through the eyes of management. For management purposes, we report the operating performance of each of our business segments based on earnings before interest and income taxes excluding corporate expenses, other income (expense), net and corporate special income/(charges). SEGMENT RESULTS RECONCILIATION (in Millions) Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Revenue Agricultural Products $ 1,464.5 $ 1,241.8 $ 1,051.6 Specialty Chemicals 879.1 824.5 753.1 Industrial Chemicals 1,038.5 1,054.8 1,026.7 Eliminations (4.2 ) (4.8 ) (5.2 ) Total $ 3,377.9 $ 3,116.3 $ 2,826.2 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes Agricultural Products $ 348.3 $ 309.5 $ 289.0 Specialty Chemicals 199.8 185.0 159.6 Industrial Chemicals 154.5 122.9 89.7 Eliminations (0.1 ) 0.2 (0.1 ) Segment operating profit $ 702.5 $ 617.6 $ 538.2 Corporate expense (62.5 ) (63.0 ) (44.1 ) Other income (expense), net (18.7 ) (5.4 ) (30.5 ) Operating profit before the items listed below (1) 621.3 549.2 463.6 Interest expense, net (39.4 ) (39.3 ) (27.0 ) Corporate special income (charges): Restructuring and other (charges) income (32.4 ) (151.9 ) (132.8 ) Non-operating pension and postretirement (charges) income (2) (14.5 ) (19.9 ) 3.0 Acquisition-related charges (0.8 ) (7.1 ) Provision for income taxes (136.5 ) (132.0 ) (53.0 ) Discontinued operations, net of income taxes (31.8 ) (33.6 ) (18.2 ) Net income attributable to FMC stockholders $ 365.9 $ 172.5 $ 228.5 ____________________ (1) Results for all segments including corporate expense and other income (expense) are net of noncontrolling interests of $16.3 million , $12.4 million and $10.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The majority of these noncontrolling interests pertain to our Industrial Chemicals segment. (2) Beginning in 2011, we reclassified for all periods presented non-operating pension and postretirement charges to its own line item within the above table. Our non-operating pension and postretirement costs are defined as those costs related to interest, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains and losses and the impacts of any plan curtailments or settlements. These costs were previously included within Other income (expense), net in the above table and are primarily related to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance and we consider these costs to be outside our operational performance. We exclude these non-operating pension and postretirement costs as we believe that removing them provides a better understanding of the underlying profitability of our businesses, provides increased transparency and clarity in the performance of our retirement plans and enhances period-over-period comparability. We continue to include the service cost and amortization of prior service cost in our operating segments noted above. We believe these elements reflect the current year operating costs to our businesses for the employment benefits provided to active employees. 26 Table of Contents The following chart, which is provided to assist the readers of our financial statements, depicts certain after-tax charges (gains). These items are excluded by us in the measures we use to evaluate business performance and determine certain performance-based compensation. These after-tax items are discussed in detail within the Other results of operations section that follows. Additionally, the chart below discloses our Non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted after-tax earnings from continuing operations attributable to FMC stockholders reconciled from the GAAP financial measure Net income attributable to FMC stockholders . We believe that this measure provides useful information about our operating results to investors and securities analysts. We also believe that excluding the effect of restructuring and other income and charges, non-operating pension and postretirement charges and certain tax adjustments from operating results allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of our underlying businesses from period to period. This measure should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP.

Additionally, in the discussion below, please refer to our chart titled "Segment Results Reconciliation" within the Results of Operations section. All comparisons are between the periods unless otherwise noted. Segment Results For management purposes, segment operating profit is defined as segment revenue less segment operating expenses (segment operating expenses consist of costs of sales and services, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses). We have excluded the following items from segment operating profit: corporate staff expense, interest income and expense associated with corporate debt facilities and investments, income taxes, gains (or losses) on divestitures of businesses, restructuring and other charges (income), non-operating pension and postretirement charges, investment gains and losses, loss on extinguishment of debt, asset impairments, Last-in, First-out ( LIFO ) inventory adjustments, acquisition related charges and other income and expense items. Information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Agricultural Products (in Millions) Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2011 2010 $ % Revenue $ 1,464.5 $ 1,241.8 $ 222.7 18 % Operating Profit 348.3 309.5 38.8 13 Revenue of $1,464.5 million increased approximately 18 percent versus the prior year period due to strong sales in North America, Latin America and Asia slightly offset by the expected decline in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA). North America revenue of $284.4 million increased 12 percent due to increased volumes as a result of strong market demand for our pre-emergent herbicides partially offset by unfavorable weather conditions experienced in the second quarter of 2011. Latin America revenue of $782.5 million increased 25 percent driven by favorable market conditions, particularly in Brazil's sugarcane, cotton and soybean markets, and growth in planted acres for key crops. Revenue in Asia of $246.0 million increased 21 percent reflecting continued strong market conditions, particularly in Australia, China, Indonesia, Thailand, Pakistan and 27 Table of Contents India. As expected, these increases were partially offset by a decline in EMEA revenues of four percent to $151.6 million. The decline was primarily driven by the absence of sales of our bifenthrin product in Europe which is further discussed below under "Certain Regulatory Issues." Agricultural Products' operating profit of $348.3 million increased approximately 13 percent compared to prior year, reflecting the strong sales growth partially offset by increased raw material costs and a $24.5 million or 13 percent increase in selling and administrative expenses for focused growth initiatives, higher people-related costs and unfavorable exchange impacts. In 2012, we expect full-year revenue growth of approximately 10 percent reflecting increased volumes in all regions, particularly in Latin America, North America and Asia, due to anticipated strong market conditions and growth in new and recently introduced products and the sales impact of new fungicide products. We expect full-year segment operating profit growth of approximately 10 percent driven by the sales gains partially offset by higher spending on targeted growth initiatives. Certain Regulatory Issues In the European Union ("EU"), following an administrative appeals process, the European Commission's proposal to exclude our bifenthrin product from the European Commission's official list of approved pesticides, was adopted on November 30, 2009. FMC had an additional six months to sell bifenthrin in the EU, through May 2010, and subsequently, in most EU countries, there was up to 6-12 months for further sale by distributors or dealers, and use by farmers. On December 30, 2010, the French Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice adding bifenthrin, along with eight other pesticidal active ingredients, to the Grenelle list of pesticides. While not superseding the remaining sell-out and usage period allowed by the EU decision, the Grenelle listing has had the practical effect of discouraging product use in France during 2011. At the European level, we re-submitted for reconsideration. The European Commission has reviewed the re-consideration dossier and, in December 2011, issued its recommendation that Bifenthrin be included on the approved product list. The Commission's recommendation will now be voted on by Member States - a decision is expected in the first half of 2012. At the French level, we believe that the Grenelle listing was unwarranted and contrary to French administrative law, and we are challenging the decision. Through these efforts, we are seeking to minimize the interruption in future bifenthrin sales in the European market. During 2012, however, we are not selling any bifenthrin for agricultural use into the EU and the absence of such sales will not have a material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. We intend to defend vigorously all our products in the U.S., EU and other countries' regulatory processes where FMC's pesticide products will be reviewed in the ordinary course of regulatory programs during 2012 as part of the ongoing cycle of re-registration in countries around the world. In 2008, the Brazilian health surveillance agency informed us that they intend to review carbofuran along with 13 other major pesticides, but has yet to issue any required formal announcement that identifies their specific concerns or preliminary position on re-registration. We are cooperating and defending our product in this process. Under the Brazilian regulatory process, any recommendation would require public notice and comment as well as concurrence from the Brazilian environmental and agricultural ministries before any regulatory change is effective. Thus, we do not expect a sales impact in Brazil in 2012. Specialty Chemicals (in Millions) Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2011 2010 $ % Revenue $ 879.1 $ 824.5 $ 54.6 7 % Operating Profit 199.8 185.0 14.8 8 Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $879.1 million , an increase of approximately seven percent versus the prior year. The increase was driven primarily by volume increases and higher pricing in BioPolymer and favorable pricing in lithium specialties and favorable currency impacts. BioPolymer revenue of $654.3 million increased approximately seven percent from the prior year. This increase was due to higher volumes which increased revenue by three percent, favorable pricing which impacted sales by two percent and the impact of a stronger euro which accounted for the remaining two percent. The volume gains and higher pricing were realized in both the food ingredients and pharmaceutical markets. Lithium revenue of $224.8 million increased approximately six percent compared to the prior year. Currency impacts resulted in a one percent increase in revenue while pricing was up four percent and volumes were flat as compared to prior year. Lithium has been impacted by tightening of supply. 28 Table of Contents Segment operating profit of $199.8 million increased eight percent versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the volume gains, higher pricing and favorable mix in BioPolymer and favorable pricing in Lithium offset by adverse weather conditions in Argentina which impacted mining operations. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 14 percent or $9.8 million to support growth initiatives. In 2012, we expect full-year revenue growth of approximately 10 percent driven by higher selling prices across the segment and higher volumes in BioPolymer and lithium primaries. Full-year segment operating profit growth is expected to be approximately 10 percent reflecting higher sales, partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs. As we anticipate ongoing growth for microcrystalline cellulose ("MCC") on a global basis, especially high in rapidly developing economies, in March 2011 we completed the expansion of our MCC plant in Cork, Ireland. The expansion, now in full production, increased our global capacity by approximately 25 percent for food and pharmaceutical grade MCC. Industrial Chemicals (in Millions) Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2011 2010 $ % Revenue $ 1,038.5 $ 1,054.8 $ (16.3 ) (2 )% Operating Profit 154.5 122.9 31.6 26 Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $1,038.5 million , a decrease of approximately two percent versus the prior year. The decrease is primarily attributable to the exit of our phosphate and sulfur derivative businesses in Spain during 2010. The absence of phosphate and sulfur derivatives revenue in 2011 resulted in overall revenue declines in the segment of approximately 12 percent. The decline in these revenues were partially offset by higher pricing across the segment, particularly in soda ash, which impacted revenues by approximately six percent. Higher freight billing and favorable currency impacts increased revenue by approximately three percent. Alkali revenues of $696.4 million increased 12 percent over the prior year due to higher pricing particularly in the export market, higher freight billings and slightly higher volumes. Export demand continues to be robust, especially in Asia and Latin America. In our domestic market, we experienced higher pricing due to constrained supply while volume growth continues to be in line with the demand recovery being experienced in flat glass, detergents and chemicals. Peroxygens revenues of $297.4 million increased 10 percent over the prior year driven primarily by higher pricing and favorable currency impacts offset by slightly reduced volumes. The increased pricing was primarily in our hydrogen peroxide and specialty persulfates product lines. Revenues of $44.7 million were 9 percent higher year over year in Zeolites and Silicates from $41.0 million in the prior year. Segment operating profit of $154.5 million increased approximately 26 percent versus the year ago period primarily as a result of the higher pricing documented above. The exited phosphate and sulfur derivative businesses had a loss of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Additionally, the startup costs associated with our Granger soda ash facility were offset by favorable production efficiencies in Alkali. Selling, general and administrative costs increased seven percent or $3.5 million primarily for targeted growth initiatives. In 2012, we expect full-year revenue to be approximately 10 percent due to higher selling prices in soda ash and peroxygens and volume growth in soda ash export markets. We expect full-year operating profit growth of approximately 20 percent, driven by higher sales in soda ash and peroxygens and the continued mix shift toward specialty peroxygens. Venezuela Investment Recent events in Venezuela, such as hyperinflation, devaluation of currency, government price controls, parallel exchange rates, and political issues have created significant risks and uncertainties for the Venezuelan subsidiaries of multinational corporations. We hold a noncontrolling investment in a Venezuelan phosphate business, Tripoliven C.A. The value of this investment on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2011 is approximately $9 million. While there has been a lag between the declaration and payment to us of dividends from Tripoliven, we did receive dividends from Tripoliven during 2010. We do not believe there is any impairment of Tripoliven at December 31, 2011, as Tripoliven continues to operate as a profitable business and we expect in the future to recover at least the value of our investment. If our investment in Tripoliven were to be totally impaired, it would have an immaterial impact on our liquidity or consolidated financial position, but the impairment charge would have a one-time effect on our results of operations in the period in which it would be recorded. 29 Table of Contents Other Results of Operations Corporate expenses We recorded expenses of $62.5 million in 2011 compared to $63.0 million in 2010 . The slight decrease was a result of reduced consulting expenses of approximately $3 million during 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. Consulting expenses incurred in the latter part of 2010 were associated with our global procurement initiative, aimed at reducing the costs of goods and services purchased on a world-wide basis. The majority of these consulting expenses were not repeated in 2011. The decrease in consulting expenses were partially offset by increased costs of approximately $2 million to support our global growth initiatives. Corporate expenses are included as a component of the line item Selling, general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income. Other income (expense), net Other expense increased to $18.7 million in 2011 from $5.4 million in 2010 . The increase was primarily due to expense related to an increase in our LIFO inventory reserves in 2011 of $2.6 million versus 2010 where we had a reduction in the LIFO reserve of $10.4 million, resulting in a period-to-period change of $13 million. Other income (expense), net is included as a component of the line item Costs of sales and services on our consolidated statements of income. Interest expense, net Interest expense, net for 2011 of $39.4 million was relatively flat compared to the same period in 2010 of $39.3 million . Corporate special income (charges) Restructuring and other (charges) income These charges totaled $32.4 million in 2011 compared to $151.9 million in 2010 . Our restructuring and other charges (income) are comprised of restructuring, asset disposals and other charges (income). Please see the table and further discussion regarding our restructuring and other charges (income) in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2011 of $28.0 million were primarily associated with the Sodium Percarbonate phase-out charges of $21.0 million as well as continuing charges related to facility restructurings and shutdowns which were announced in years prior to 2011. Other charges (income) net in 2011 of $4.4 million was primarily associated with charges of $3.1 million for environmental remediation at operating sites. Restructuring and asset disposal charges of $127.2 million in 2010 were primarily associated with the Huelva shutdown charges of $110.4 million as well as continuing charges related to facility restructuring and shutdowns which were announced in years prior to 2010. Other charges (income) net in 2010 of $24.7 million was primarily associated with charges of $14.2 million for environmental remediation at operating sites and a $5.7 million charge related to our Agricultural Products segment acquiring certain rights to a herbicide still under development. The activity of the restructuring charges listed above are also included within Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. We believe the restructuring plans implemented are on schedule and the benefits and savings either have been or will be achieved. Non-operating pension and postretirement (charges) income The charge for 2011 was $14.5 million compared to $19.9 million for 2010. The decrease in charges is primarily the result of a settlement charge of $7.3 million recorded in 2010 associated with the acceleration of previously deferred pension actuarial losses. The acceleration was triggered by a lump-sum payout to our former Chairman and CEO in 2010. No such event occurred for the year ended December 31, 2011. On the consolidated statements of income, these charges are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses . Acquisition-related charges The charge in 2011 of $0.8 million, related to the expensing of the inventory fair value step-up resulting from the application of purchase accounting. The charges for year ended December 31, 2011 relate to a number of acquisitions completed in 2011. On the consolidated statements of income, these charges for all years presented are included in Costs of sales and services . No such charges occurred for the year ended December 31, 2010. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information on our acquisitions. 30 Table of Contents Provision for income taxes Provision for income taxes was $136.5 million for 2011 compared to a provision of $132.0 million for the prior year period resulting in effective tax rates of 24.8 percent and 37.7 percent , respectively. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily a result of the change in tax adjustments recorded in 2011 and 2010 as described below: 2011 tax adjustments were favorable in the amount of $0.9 million primarily related to a reduction of approximately $15 million for our liability for unrecognized tax benefits due to settlements of audits mostly offset by net valuation allowance increases of approximately $13 million. The valuation allowance increase was primarily related to foreign operations because of our expectation that the tax losses at these operations are not expected to be fully recoverable in future years from the earnings. 2010 tax adjustments were unfavorable in the amount of $38.7 million and are primarily a result of recording a $40 million valuation allowance in our Spanish legal entity, predominantly due to the Huelva facility shutdown, for tax losses that are not expected to be fully recoverable in future years from the earnings of the remaining businesses in that entity. 2010 tax adjustments were also impacted by a $3.6 million tax charge associated with the tax treatment of the Medicare Part D subsidy, which was enacted as part of the recent U.S. health care reform legislation. The unfavorable tax adjustments were partially offset by a reduction in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits due to settlements of audits and expiration of statute of limitation and recognition of various tax credits. Excluding the impact of these tax adjustments, our effective tax rate in 2011 was 25.0 percent versus 26.6 percent in 2010. This decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to changes in the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the U.S. In 2011 a larger portion of our foreign earnings were earned by our operations in Hong Kong and Ireland which have lower tax rates than the U.S. These foreign operations service our global businesses and we anticipate that they will continue to be a larger source of earnings for FMC. Discontinued operations, net of income taxes Our discontinued operations represent adjustments to retained liabilities primarily related to operations discontinued between 1976 and 2001. The primary liabilities retained include environmental liabilities, other post-retirement benefit liabilities, self-insurance and long-term obligations related to legal proceedings. Discontinued operations, net of income taxes totaled a charge of $31.8 million for 2011, compared to a charge of $33.6 million 2010. The charges for 2011 were primarily related to an increase in reserves associated with our Front Royal site, operating and maintenance activities for a number of environmental sites and charges for legal reserves and expenses related to discontinued operations. The charges for 2010 were primarily related to an increase in the provision for environmental issues at our Middleport site as well as operating and maintenance activities for a number of environmental sites and charges for legal reserves and expenses related to discontinued operations. Net income attributable to FMC stockholders Net income attributable to FMC stockholders increased to $365.9 million for 2011, from $172.5 million for 2010. The increase was primarily due to higher operating profits in all three of our segments, a lower effective tax rate and lower restructuring and other charges (income). These items were partially offset by the increase in LIFO inventory adjustments. Year ended December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 In the following discussion, year refers to the year ended December 31, 2010, and prior year refers to the year ended December 31, 2009. Additionally, in the discussion below, please refer to our chart titled "Segment Results Reconciliation" within the Results of Operations section. All comparisons are between the periods unless otherwise noted. Segment Results Agricultural Products Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) (in Millions) 2010 2009 $ % Revenue $ 1,241.8 $ 1,051.6 $ 190.2 18 % Operating Profit 309.5 289.0 20.5 7 31 Table of Contents Revenue of $1,241.8 million increased 18 percent versus the prior year, as higher sales were recognized in North America, Latin America and Asia. North America revenue increased 15 percent to $252.0 million due to strong demand for our proprietary herbicides, growth from new and recently introduced products, particularly our newly acquired herbicide, fluthiacet-methyl, and improving market conditions in some non-crop segments. Europe, Middle East and Africa revenue of $158.7 million were flat year over year. Latin America revenue of $628.9 million increased 24 percent due to improved market conditions, particularly in the sugarcane, cotton, soybeans, corn and tobacco segments, and growth in new and recently introduced products. Revenue in Asia increased 21 percent to $202.1 million reflecting better market conditions, the introduction of new products and growth in most countries particularly India, Indonesia, Australia and China. Segment operating profit of $309.5 million increased seven percent compared to the prior year period, reflecting strong sales performance partially offset by higher first-half inventory and distribution costs, and selling and administrative expenses. Higher selling and administrative expenses of $33.7 million or 22 percent increase were primarily due to foreign exchange impacts, higher spending on growth initiatives and increased people-related costs. Specialty Chemicals (in Millions) Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2010 2009 $ % Revenue $ 824.5 $ 753.1 $ 71.4 9 % Operating Profit 185.0 159.6 25.4 16 Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $824.5 million, an increase of approximately nine percent versus the prior-year period. The increase was driven primarily by a robust demand recovery in lithium primaries and strong commercial performance in BioPolymer. BioPolymer revenues of $611.5 million increased six percent from the prior-year period. This increase was primarily due to higher volumes which increased revenue by five percent. BioPolymer experienced broad-based volume gains across both food and pharmaceutical markets. Additionally, improved pricing and mix increased revenue, driven primarily by higher pricing in food ingredients. Lithium revenues of $213.0 million increased 22 percent from the prior-year period primarily due to higher volumes driven by improving economic conditions slightly offset by lower pricing. Higher volumes increased revenue by 29 percent while the lower pricing negatively impacted revenues by seven percent. The improving economic conditions in lithium are driven primarily by growth in battery and metals markets in Asia. Segment operating profit of $185.0 million increased 16 percent versus the year ago period, as volume gains in lithium primaries, favorable commercial performance in BioPolymer and the benefits of productivity initiatives were partially offset by higher raw material costs. Industrial Chemicals (in Millions) Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2010 2009 $ % Revenue $ 1,054.8 $ 1,026.7 28.1 3 % Operating Profit 122.9 89.7 33.2 37 Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $1,054.8 million, an increase of approximately three percent versus the prior-year period. An increase in volumes across the segment increased revenues by eight percent which was offset by a seven percent decline in pricing. Soda ash revenues were up due to increased volumes, particularly in the export market, partially offset by lower prices. The segment experienced volume increases in peroxygens and phosphates offset by reduced selling prices for these products. The higher volumes in the segment also resulted in increased freight billings which increased revenue by three percent. The segment was also negatively impacted by $12 million or one percent decrease due to lower electricity sales due to the divestiture of a Spanish co-generation facility in the third quarter of 2009. In Spain, we operate electricity co-generation facilities and sell excess electricity into the Spanish electrical grid. Segment operating profit of $122.9 million increased approximately 37 percent versus the year ago period, driven by the strong demand recovery and lower raw material and energy costs which more than offset lower selling prices across the segment. 32 Table of Contents Other Results of Operations Corporate expenses We recorded expenses of $63.0 million in 2010 compared to $44.1 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to increased incentive compensation expense of $8.0 million and consulting expense of $7.9 million compared to the prior year. The increase in consulting services was a result of several new initiatives, primarily involving global procurement, aimed at reducing the costs of goods and services purchased on a world-wide basis. Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net is comprised primarily of LIFO inventory adjustments. Other expense was $5.4 million in 2010 compared to $30.5 million in 2009. The decrease was due primarily to income related to a $25.6 million decrease in our LIFO inventory reserves. Interest expense, net The 2010 net interest expense increased to $39.3 million compared to $27.0 million in 2009 primarily due to higher interest rates associated with our senior bond offering in the fourth quarter 2009 whose proceeds were used to pay off lower variable rate debt under our committed credit facilities. Corporate special income (charges) Restructuring and other (charges) income These charges were $151.9 million in 2010 compared to $132.8 million in 2009. Refer to page 30 for a description of these charges incurred during 2010. During 2009, in response to weaker market conditions, we made a number of decisions in that year to realign some of our operating assets. We made the decisions to shut down the peroxygens manufacturing facility in Santa Clara, Mexico, lithium facility in Bayport, Texas, operations in Barcelona, Spain and our lithium metal production unit in Bromborough, UK. We incurred restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2009 of $81.5 million primarily as a result of these decisions. Other charges (income) net in 2009 of $51.3 million were primarily associated with $29.9 million of legal matters mostly in our Industrial Chemicals segment as well as charges of $20.2 million for environmental remediation at operating sites. Legal matters in our Industrial Chemicals segment mostly had to do with a charge of $21.0 million in connection with the resolution of a regulatory matter as well as a $3.3 million charge related to the settlement of a legal matter. Non-operating pension and postretirement (charges) income The charge for 2010 was $19.9 million compared to income of $3.0 million for 2009. The increase in charges is a result of amortization related to pension asset losses incurred in prior periods and a decrease in actual plan discount rates from 2009 to 2010. The charge for 2010 was also impacted by a $7.3 million settlement charge associated with the acceleration of previously deferred pension actuarial losses. The acceleration was triggered by a lump-sum payout to our former Chairman and CEO. Acquisition-related charges The charges in 2009 of $7.1 million related to the expensing of the inventory fair value step-up resulting from the application of purchase accounting. The charges for year ended December 31, 2009 relate to a 2008 acquisition in our Specialty Chemicals segment and a 2009 acquisition in our Agricultural Products segment. Additionally the amount in 2009 includes inventory adjustments related to the third quarter 2008 acquisition in our Specialty Chemicals segment and subsequent alginates business restructuring. Provision for income taxes We recorded a provision of $132.0 million in 2010 compared with a provision of $53.0 million in 2009 resulting in effective tax rates of 37.7 percent and 17.1 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate was impacted by tax adjustments recorded in 2010 and 2009. Refer to page 31 for a description of these tax adjustments recorded during 2010. The tax adjustments recorded in 2009 are described below. 2009 tax adjustments were favorable in the amount of $43.7 million and were primarily a result of a reduction in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits due to favorable settlements of tax audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations as well as the reversal of certain domestic related tax valuation allowances. These domestic valuation allowances were no longer necessary because of our expectation that the related deferred tax assets were likely to be realized. 33 Table of Contents Excluding the impact of these tax adjustments, our effective tax rate in 2010 was 26.6 percent versus 31.1 percent in 2009. The fluctuation is primarily the result of the mix of domestic income compared to income we earn domestically as income earned outside of the U.S. is typically taxed at rates lower than income earned inside the U.S. Discontinued operations, net of income tax Discontinued operations, net of income tax totaled a loss of $33.6 million in 2010 versus a loss of $18.2 million in 2009. Refer to page 31 for a description of our 2010 charges. The 2009 loss is primarily related to environmental charges associated with our Front Royal and Middleport sites and operating and maintenance activities for a number of environmental sites partially offset by recoveries related to our Front Royal site. The 2009 loss also includes charges for legal reserves and expenses related to discontinued operations. Net income attributable to FMC stockholders Net income attributable to FMC stockholders decreased to $172.5 million in 2010 compared with $228.5 million in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to higher restructuring and other charges (income) and increased corporate expenses, interest expense, income taxes and environmental charges. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher profits across all segments. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2011 and 2010, were $158.9 million and $161.5 million , respectively. Of the cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2011, $82.1 million were held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our intent is to reinvest permanently the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and therefore we have not recorded additional taxes that would be payable if we repatriated these earnings. In the event that funds from our foreign subsidiaries are repatriated to the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes on those amounts. At December 31, 2011, we had total debt of $825.6 million as compared to $637.9 million at December 31, 2010. This included $779.1 million and $503.0 million of long-term debt (excluding current portions of $19.5 million and $116.4 million ) at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Other short-term debt, which consists solely of foreign borrowings, increased to $27.0 million at December 31, 2011, compared to $18.5 million at December 31, 2010. 2011 Credit Agreement On August 5, 2011 we executed a new revolving credit facility, referred to as the 2011 Credit Agreement. The 2011 Credit Agreement provides for a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility ($300 million of which is available for the issuance of letters of credit for the account of the Company and certain foreign subsidiaries ("Borrowers") and $50 million of which is available for swing line loans to certain Borrowers) with an expansion feature, subject to certain conditions, to increase the facility to $2.25 billion. There were no borrowings under the 2011 Credit Agreement at inception, and our prior domestic and European credit agreements dated as of August 28, 2007 and February 21, 2008, respectively, were terminated at that time. Loans under the 2011 credit agreement will bear interest at either a floating rate, which will be a base rate, or a Eurocurrency rate equal to the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate for the relevant term, plus in each case an applicable margin. The applicable fully-drawn margin is 1.13 percent per year, subject to adjustment based on the credit rating assigned to our senior unsecured debt. We are required to pay a facility fee on the total amount of the credit facility. The initial facility fee is 0.15 percent per year. The applicable margin and the facility fee are subject to adjustment based on the rating assigned to our long-term senior unsecured debt. Among other restrictions, the 2011 Credit Agreement contains financial covenants applicable to FMC and its consolidated subsidiaries related to leverage (measured as the ratio of debt to adjusted earnings) and interest coverage (measured as the ratio of adjusted earnings to interest expense). Our actual leverage for the four consecutive quarters ended December 31, 2011, was 1.4 which is below the maximum leverage of 3.5 . Our actual interest coverage for the four consecutive quarters ended December 31, 2011, was 15.9 which is above the minimum interest coverage of 3.5 . We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2011. 2011 Senior Notes On November 22, 2011, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.95 percent Senior Notes due 2022. The net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions. 34 Table of Contents Statement of Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $425.6 million , $399.7 million and $343.5 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The table below presents the components of net cash provided by operating activities. Twelve months ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Income from continuing operations before equity in (earnings) loss of affiliates, interest income and expense and income taxes 587.3 387.1 334.7 Significant non-cash expenses (1) 198.4 268.8 198.2 Operating income before non-cash expenses (Non-GAAP) 785.7 655.9 532.9 Change in trade receivables (2) (77.9 ) (109.9 ) (59.3 ) Change in inventories (3) (110.5 ) (7.9 ) 35.4 Change in accounts payable (4) 69.3 106.6 (71.5 ) Change in accrued rebates (5) 15.3 33.2 13.7 Change in all other operating assets and liabilities (6) 1.6 25.5 78.9 Restructuring and other spending (7) (87.3 ) (53.4 ) (37.4 ) Environmental spending, continuing, net of recoveries (8) (12.0 ) (8.9 ) (7.4 ) Pension and other postretirement benefit contributions (9) (67.0 ) (105.2 ) (93.4 ) Cash basis operating income (Non-GAAP) 517.2 535.9 391.9 Interest payments (36.3 ) (38.4 ) (24.3 ) Tax payments (47.9 ) (41.5 ) (24.1 ) Excess tax benefits from share-based compensation (10) (7.4 ) (56.3 ) Cash provided by operating activities 425.6 399.7 343.5 ____________________ (1) Represents the sum of depreciation, amortization, non-cash asset write down, share-based compensation, and pension charges. (2) Overall, the use of cash for trade receivables in each year is primarily due to revenue increases, particularly for Agricultural Products sales in Brazil where terms are significantly longer than the rest of our businesses. The changes year over year primarily represent timing associated with receivables collections. (3) The change in inventory from 2010 to 2011 resulted in a use of cash primarily due to an inventory build to fulfill projected 2012 first quarter demand in Agricultural Products, particularly in North America and Latin America. The change from 2009 to 2010 was largely driven by higher sales in 2010 as well as in 2009 inventories decreased from the end of 2008 due to lower inventory costs in Industrial Chemicals, particularly for the exited phosphate rock product line. (4) The source of cash in 2011 was driven by continued focus on vendor terms and trade practices as well as the increased inventory build at the end of 2011 to satisfy projected demand. In 2010 accounts payable increased as a result of higher focus on payables management. The 2009 accounts payable use of cash was due to the higher cost phosphate rock in payables at the end of 2008 which was replaced by lower cost phosphate rock at the end of 2009. (5) These rebates are associated with our Agricultural Products segment and are primarily in North America and Brazil and generally settle in the fourth quarter of each year. The changes in year over year for each year presented in the table above is primarily associated with timing of payments. (6) Changes in all periods presented primarily represent timing of payments associated with all other operating assets and liabilities. (7) See Note 7 in our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for further details. Included in 2011 amounts is the approximate $44 million payment associated with the European Union fine. See Note 18 in our consolidated financial included in this Form 10-K for further details. 35 Table of Contents (8) Included in our income for each of the years presented are environmental charges of $3.1 million, $14.2 million, and $20.2 million for environmental and remediation at our operating sites, which will be spent in years beyond 2011. The amounts in this row represent environmental remediation spending at our operating sites which were recorded against pre-existing reserves. (9) Amounts include voluntary contributions to our U.S. defined benefit plan of $55 million, $80 million and $75 million, respectively. In 2010 the amount also includes a lump-sum payout of approximately $15 million from our nonqualified pension plan. (10) The significant increase in excess tax benefits in 2010, which are presented as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows, from share-based compensation was due to the use of our remaining U.S. Federal net operating losses in 2010. As a result we recognized in 2010 excess tax benefits generated in years 2006 through 2010. Excess tax benefits in 2011 represent excess tax benefits generated solely in year 2011. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for further discussion on these excess tax benefits. Cash required by operating activities of discontinued operations was $44.3 million , $45.2 million and $42.0 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decrease from 2010 to 2011 is a result of reduced spending on legal proceedings partially offset by increased spending on discontinued environment sites. The change in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to higher spending on legal proceedings associated with discontinued operations partially offset by lower net environmental spending in 2010. Discontinued environmental spending was $21.1 million in 2011 compared to $17.1 million in 2010 and $22.1 million in 2009. The remaining discontinued cash outflows primarily represents spending against reserves for legal proceedings associated with discontinued operations. Cash required by investing activities was $358.0 million , $154.0 million and $200.7 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The change from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to the acquisitions completed during 2011 and higher capital spending associated with capacity expansions as compared to 2010. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included within this Form 10-K for more information on the 2011 acquisitions. The decrease in cash required in 2010 as compared to 2009 was driven primarily by a reduction in acquisitions and capital expenditures. Cash required by financing activities was $25.3 million , $116.6 million and $77.8 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The change in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the issuance of our senior debt notes during 2011 which resulted in a cash inflow of approximately $300 million. This inflow was partially offset by repayments of other long term debt during the year and increased capital stock repurchases as compared to 2010. The change from 2009 to 2010 was due primarily to the repurchases of common stock and lower proceeds from borrowings of long term debt, partially offset by lower repayments under our committed credit facilities and the inclusion of excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. Other potential liquidity needs Our cash needs for 2012 include operating cash requirements, capital expenditures, scheduled mandatory payments of long-term debt, dividend payments, share repurchases, contributions to our pension plans, environmental and asset retirement obligation spending and restructuring. We plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash, cash generated from operations and borrowings under our committed revolving credit facility. Projected 2012 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 30 percent higher than 2011 levels, primarily to increase capacity in BioPolymer, lithium and soda ash. Projected 2012 spending includes approximately $40 million of net environmental remediation spending. This spending does not include expected spending of approximately $10 million in 2012 on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities. Also, we expect to spend approximately $30 million in 2012 for environmental compliance costs, which we will include as a component of costs of sales and services in our consolidated statements of income since these amounts are not covered by established reserves. Capital spending to expand, maintain or replace equipment at our production facilities may trigger requirements for upgrading our environmental controls, which may increase our spending for environmental controls above the foregoing projections. Our U.S. Pension Plan assets increased slightly from $842.4 million at December 31, 2010 to $853.9 million at December 31, 2011. Our U.S. Pension Plan assets comprise approximately 93 percent of our total plan assets with the difference representing plan assets related to foreign pension plans. Due to lower market return expectations, we are reducing our long-term rate of return assumption to 7.75 percent for 2012 from 8.5 percent used in 2011. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included within this Form 10-K for details on how we develop our long-term rate of return assumptions. In order to reduce future funding volatility, we intend to contribute $65 million in 2012, which is in excess of the minimum requirements versus contributions of $55 million in 2011 and $80 million in 2010. We do not believe that the additional contribution will have a 36 Table of Contents significant negative impact on our current and future liquidity needs. However, a continuation of the volatility of interest rates and negative equity returns under current market conditions may require greater contributions to the Plan in the future. On February 18, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250.0 million of our common stock. At December 31, 2011, $139.8 million remained unused from the authorization. On February 17, 2012, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $250.0 million of our common stock. The repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price targets and may be suspended or terminated at any time. Shares may be purchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. During the year ended December 31, 2011, 2,053,478 shares were repurchased under the publicly announced repurchase program for $165.1 million. From time to time we acquire shares from employees in connection with the vesting, exercise and forfeiture of awards under our equity compensation plans. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law. Title VII of the Act contains significant changes in the ways derivatives are regulated. Several U.S. government regulatory agencies and departments are charged with developing the many regulations required under the new law. While the exact effects on FMC cannot be known until final regulations are promulgated, we believe our liquidity requirements will be adequately met by the sources available to us. Commitments We provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain Agricultural Products customers, principally in Brazil, for their seasonal borrowing. The total of these guarantees was $18.5 million and $24.1 million at December 31, 2011, and 2010, respectively, and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets for each date as Guarantees of vendor financing . Short-term debt consisted of foreign credit lines at December 31, 2011, and 2010. We provide parent-company guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries. We continually evaluate our options for divesting real estate holdings and property, plant and equipment that are no longer integral to our operating businesses. In connection with our property and asset sales and divestitures, we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain liabilities, including environmental contamination and taxes that occurred prior to the date of sale. Our indemnification obligations with respect to these liabilities may be indefinite as to duration and may or may not be subject to a deductible, minimum claim amount or cap. As such, it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made or to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss. If triggered, we may be able to recover certain of the indemnity payments from third parties. We have not recorded any specific liabilities for these guarantees. Our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows: Contractual Commitments Expected Cash Payments by Year (in Millions) 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 & beyond Total Debt maturities (1) $ 46.5 $ 5.7 $ 32.5 $ 0.1 $ 743.1 $ 827.9 Contractual interest (2) 37.1 36.7 36.5 35.8 287.7 433.8 Lease obligations (3) 27.4 28.6 26.5 28.8 41.8 153.1 Certain long-term liabilities (4) 2.3 5.7 6.2 6.3 58.0 78.5 Forward energy and foreign exchange contracts (5) Non-contingent acquisition payable (6) 25.9 25.9 Purchase obligations (7) 32.0 21.2 2.4 0.8 19.7 76.1 Total (8) $ 171.2 $ 97.9 $ 104.1 $ 71.8 $ 1,150.3 $ 1,595.3 ____________________ (1) Excluding discounts. (2) Contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on our long-term debt obligations. We had $17.7 million of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at December 31, 2011. The rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at December 31, 2011. Variable rates are market determined and will fluctuate over time. (3) Before sub-lease rental income. (4) Payments associated with our Ewing research and development facility and our Shanghai innovation center. (5) At December 31, 2011, the net value of these contracts results in a net asset position. (6) See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements within this Form 10-K. (7) Purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, price provisions and 37 Table of Contents timing of the transaction. We have entered into a number of purchase obligations for the sourcing of materials and energy where take-or-pay arrangements apply. Since the majority of the minimum obligations under these contracts are take-or-pay commitments over the life of the contract as opposed to a year by year take-or-pay, the obligations in the table related to these types of contacts are presented in the earliest period in which the minimum obligation could be payable under these types of contracts. (8) As of December 31, 2011, the liability for uncertain tax positions was $8.1 million and this liability is excluded from the table above. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and periods in which these liabilities might be paid. Contingencies See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Climate Change We have been following legislative and regulatory developments regarding climate change because the regulation of greenhouse gases, depending on their nature and scope, could subject some of our manufacturing operations to additional costs or limits on operations. On December 29, 2009, EPA's Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule became effective. This rule requires FMC to collect information regarding greenhouse gas emissions from our large sources and report them beginning in 2011. Our Alkali Chemicals Division mines and processes trona ore into soda ash and related products at our facilities near Green River, Wyoming. This activity constitutes most of FMC's greenhouse gas emissions globally. In 2011, we reported to the EPA under the Greenhouse Gas reporting rule approximately 1.6 million metric tons of direct emissions from these operations for 2010. In 2012, we will report approximately 1.9 million metric tons of direct emissions from these operations for 2011. The reason for the increase in emissions was that during 2011, we re-commissioned the first phase of natural soda ash capacity at our Green River facility known as Granger. We expect the total greenhouse gas emissions from our Green River, Wyoming operations to increase further in 2012, reflecting a full year of operations at the Granger facility. In addition, two plants in our BioPolymer business also reported emissions above the EPA's reporting threshold, but each plant's emissions are substantially less than at our Green River facilities, in total less than 0.1 million metric tons. A significant source of greenhouse gas emissions at Green River are process emissions. That is, a significant portion of the greenhouse gases released during the mining and processing of soda ash occurs naturally in the trona ore feedstock. Unlike the situation with energy efficiency, where efficiencies may result in a reduction of greenhouse gases, the amount of greenhouse gases present in the trona ore cannot be reduced. All of the companies producing natural soda ash have such process emissions. Yet, the lower energy intensity of natural soda ash provides a favorable carbon intensity compared with synthetic soda ash produced throughout the rest of the world. Even with the additional emissions from the operation of the Granger facility, our carbon emission intensity is expected to remain favorable compared to our synthetic soda ash competition. Soda ash is an essential raw material in the production of glass of all kinds. Climate change, energy intensity and alternative forms of energy will drive increased production of new forms of glass (lower emissivity glass, solar panel glass, etc.) and will increase the need for this essential raw material from FMC. The soda ash industry has an interest in assuring that climate change legislation or regulation recognizes the benefits of soda ash (particularly natural soda ash) and the challenges facing this industry in controlling its greenhouse gas emissions. It is not possible at this time to predict whether or when Congress may enact climate change legislation in the United States or what provisions might be included in the final legislation. In the absence of federal climate change legislation, EPA has moved forward with a finding of endangerment and a promulgated tailoring rule to apply the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions of the Clean Air Act to greenhouse gas emissions. This rule is being challenged in court. We have announced engineering of a major process optimization involving solution mining to return Granger to nameplate capacity. Although the innovative process will reduce our energy and carbon intensity, if approved by the Board of Directors this optimization project may require a review for greenhouse gas emissions by EPA. Such a review could impact project schedule or cost. Because of the many variables, it is premature to make any estimate of the costs of complying with un-enacted federal climate change legislation or as yet un-implemented federal regulations in the United States. However, we are aware of the potential impacts that could result from emissions regulations in the U.S. that are more stringent than those experienced by our global competitors. These could make it more difficult for us to competitively produce natural soda ash at Green River. A reduction in natural soda ash production as a result of more stringent regulations in the U.S. would lead to more greenhouse gas emissions globally because the lost supply of natural soda ash would be replaced by the more costly and more greenhouse gas intensive synthetic soda ash. 38 Table of Contents At this point our U.S. facilities are not subject to any state or regional greenhouse gas regulation that limits or imposes fees on current emissions, and our foreign operations outside of Europe and Canada are not subject to national or local greenhouse gas regulation. Although some of our European and Canadian operations may be subject to greenhouse gas regulation, the cost to these facilities has not been and is not expected to be material to FMC. We have considered the potential physical risks to FMC facilities and operations and the indirect consequences of regulation or business trends as a result of potential future climate change. Because of the many variables, not only with respect to the science, but also with respect to the nature and effect of future global climate change regulation itself, it is impossible to predict in any meaningful way what type of property damage or disruptions to our operations or indirect consequences might result from future climate change. Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Regulatory Items See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) . The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have described our accounting policies in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. We have reviewed these accounting policies, identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements. We have reviewed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Critical accounting policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition in accordance with U.S. GAAP and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current conditions and other reasonable factors. Environmental obligations and related recoveries We provide for environmental-related obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability, that estimate has been used. Where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used. Estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ), or similar government agencies, are generally accrued no later than when a Record of Decision ( ROD ), or equivalent, is issued, or upon completion of a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study ( RI/FS ), or equivalent, that is submitted by us to the appropriate government agency or agencies. Estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management, as well as by financial and legal management and, if necessary, adjusted as additional information becomes available. The estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination, required remediation methods, and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties. Our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation and/or study of sites at which we are alleged to have released hazardous substances into the environment. Such costs principally include, among other items, RI/FS, site remediation, costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan, management costs, fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort, and future monitoring costs. Estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies, specific site consultants engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites. Included in our environmental liabilities are costs for the operation, maintenance and monitoring of site remediation plans (OM&M). Such reserves are based on our best estimates for these OM&M plans. Over time we may incur OM&M costs in excess of these reserves. However, we are unable to reasonably estimate an amount in excess of our recorded reserves because we cannot reasonably estimate the period for which such OM&M plans will need to be in place or the future annual cost of such remediation, as conditions at these environmental sites change over time. Such additional OM&M costs could be significant in total but would be incurred over an extended period of years. Included in the environmental reserve balance, other assets balance and disclosure of reasonably possible loss contingencies are amounts from third party insurance policies, which we believe are probable of recovery. Provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income, net of probable and estimable recoveries from named Potentially Responsible Parties ( PRPs ) or other third parties. Such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values. 39 Table of Contents In calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves, we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ( CERCLA ) and the analogous state laws on all PRPs and have considered the identity and financial condition of the other PRPs at each site to the extent possible. We have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated, as well as the status of our claims against such parties. Although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of PRPs and other third parties with absolute certainty, the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a site-by-site basis. Our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties. We believe that any recorded recoveries related to PRPs are realizable in all material respects. Recoveries are recorded as either an offset in Environmental liabilities, continuing and discontinued or as Other Assets in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with U.S. accounting literature. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for changes in estimates associated with our environmental obligations. Impairments and valuation of long-lived assets Our long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and long-term investments, goodwill and intangible assets. We test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition. In cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets, which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable. The estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices, volumes, costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time. We perform an annual impairment test of goodwill in the third quarter. The assumptions used to estimate fair value include our best estimate of future growth rates, discount rates and market conditions over a reasonable period. We performed this test in 2011 and determined that no impairment charge was required. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for newly issued accounting guidance associated with the annual impairment test requirements. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for charges associated with long-lived asset disposal costs and the activity associated with the restructuring reserves. Pensions and other postretirement benefits We provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees and retirees. The costs (benefits) and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions, including interest (discount) rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increase for employees. The costs (benefits) and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions, such as average retirement age, mortality, employee turnover, and plan participation. To the extent our plans actual experience, as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans demographics, differs from these assumptions, the costs and obligations for providing these benefits, as well as the plans funding requirements, could increase or decrease. When actual results differ from our assumptions, the difference is typically recognized over future periods. In addition, the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs (benefits) in future periods. We use several assumptions and statistical methods to determine the asset values used to calculate both the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans funding requirements. The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a market-related value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a five-year period. We use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans funding requirements. The actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range, high or low, of the actual market value of assets, and is adjusted accordingly. We select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on high-quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date. In selecting a discount rate as of December 31, 2011, we placed particular emphasis on a discount rate yield-curve provided by our actuary. This yield-curve when populated with projected cash flows that represented the expected timing and amount of our plans' benefit payments, produced a single effective interest discount rate of 4.95 percent, which was used to measure the plan's liabilities, 40 Table of Contents The discount rates used at our December 31, 2011 and 2010 measurement dates were 4.95 percent and 5.40 percent, respectively. The effect of the change in the discount rate from 5.40 percent to 4.95 percent at December 31, 2011 resulted in a $60.6 million increase to our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The effect of the change in the discount rate from 5.90 percent at December 31, 2009 to 5.40 percent at December 31, 2010 resulted in a $6.5 million increase to 2011 pension and other postretirement benefit expense. The change in discount rate from 5.40 percent at December 31, 2010 to 4.95 percent at December 31, 2011 was attributable to a decrease in yields on high quality corporate bonds with cash flows matching the timing and amount of our expected future benefit payments between the 2010 and 2011 measurement dates. Using the December 31, 2010 yield curve, our plan cash flows produced a single weighted-average discount rate of approximately 5.40 percent. Matching our plan cash flows to a similarly constructed curve reflecting high-yielding bonds available as of December 31, 2011, resulted in a single weighted-average discount rate of approximately 4.95 percent. In developing the assumption for the long-term rate of return on assets for our U.S. Plan, we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries, including historical market returns, information on the assumption for long-term real returns by asset class, inflation assumptions, and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates. We also consider the historical performance of our own plan trust, which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 9.36 percent over the last 20 years (which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period) as well as other factors which are discussed in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. Additionally see discussion on long-term rate of return under "Other Potential Liquidity Needs" on page 36. For the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in assumptions see our discussion below. Sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions. A one-half percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $66.9 million and $60.7 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by $6.5 million, $6.4 million and $3.1 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. A one-half percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $73.7 million and $66.6 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and increased pension and other postretirement benefit net periodic benefit cost by $6.6 million, $6.5 million and $4.5 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. A one-half percent increase in the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by $4.6 million, $4.5 million and $4.2 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. A one-half percent decrease in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by $4.6 million, $4.5 million and $4.2 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs (benefits) are found in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. Income taxes We have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the need for this allowance, we have considered a number of factors including future taxable income, the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Similarly, should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made. Additionally, we file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The income tax returns for FMC entities taxable in the U.S. and significant foreign jurisdictions are open for examination and adjustment. We assess our income tax positions and record a liability for all years open to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. We adjust these liabilities, if necessary, upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for additional discussion surrounding income taxes. 41 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. Dividends On January 19, 2012 , we paid dividends aggregating $10.5 million to our shareholders of record as of December 30, 2011 . This amount is included in Accrued and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2011. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we paid $41.2 million , $36.4 million and $36.3 million in dividends, respectively.
