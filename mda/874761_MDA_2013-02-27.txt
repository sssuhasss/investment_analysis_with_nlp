ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Our Business We are a diversified power generation and utility company organized into six market-oriented Strategic Business Units ( SBUs ): US (United States), Andes (Chile, Colombia, and Argentina), Brazil, MCAC (Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean), EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), and Asia. For additional information regarding our business, see Item 1. Business of this Form 10-K. Our Organization The management reporting structure is organized along six SBUs led by our Chief Operating Officer ( COO ), who in turn reports to our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ). Our CEO and COO are based in Arlington, Virginia. During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company completed the restructuring of its operational management and reporting process into six SBUs. For financial reporting purposes, the Company has identified eight reportable segments based on the six SBUs. Accordingly, management discussion and analysis of revenue and gross margin is organized as follows: US SBU US Generation segment US Utilities segment Andes SBU Andes Generation Brazil SBU Brazil Generation segment Brazil Utilities segment MCAC SBU MCAC Generation segment EMEA SBU EMEA Generation segment Asia SBU Asia Generation segment Corporate and Other The Company EMEA and MCAC utilities as well as Corporate are reported within Corporate and Other because they do not require separate disclosure under segment reporting accounting guidance. See Note 17 Segment and Geographic Information included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion of the Company segment structure used for financial reporting purposes. 105 Table of Contents Management Priorities Management is focused on the following priorities: Management of our portfolio of generation and utility businesses to create value for our stakeholders, including customers and shareholders, through safe, reliable, and sustainable operations and effective cost management; Driving our operating business to manage capital more effectively and to increase the amount of discretionary cash available for deployment into debt repayment, growth investments, shareholder dividends and share buybacks; Realignment of our geographic focus. To this end, we will continue to exit markets where we do not have a competitive advantage or where we are unable to earn a fair risk-adjusted return relative to monetization alternatives. In addition, we will focus our growth investments on platform expansions or opportunities to expand our existing operations; and Reduce the cash flow and earnings volatility of our businesses by proactively managing our currency, commodity and political risk exposures, mostly through contractual and regulatory mechanisms, as well as commercial hedging activities. We also will continue to limit our risk by utilizing non-recourse project financing for the majority of our businesses. 2012 Performance During 2012, we executed on a comprehensive plan to improve operations, leverage our global scale and expertise, reduce our overhead and development costs, increase the sources of cash and the returns from our investments, and streamline the portfolio. These actions helped us to achieve our financial targets, despite challenges we faced at certain businesses, including AES Gener in Chile, Eletropaulo in Brazil and DP&L in the U.S. Safe, Reliable and Sustainable Operations. In terms of operating performance, we benefitted from the first full year of contributions from our new businesses, which collectively represented more than 1,900 MW of capacity additions brought on-line with the oversight of our in-house construction management team. We also benefitted from the results of our efforts to enhance the reliability of our generation fleet, particularly at Masinloc (Asia SBU) and Southland (US SBU). Further, we reduced our overhead and development costs by $90 million, exceeding our cost reduction target of $65 million. These positive drivers were partially offset by declines at our Andes and Brazil SBUs due to higher cost of replacement energy, lower prices and outages and in Chile and the negative impact of the tariff reset at Eletropaulo in Brazil. Further, we recognized a $1.82 billion goodwill impairment at DP&L in the U.S. Improving Available Capital and Deployment of Discretionary Cash. In terms of enhancing the sources and uses of our discretionary cash, we improved our available capital by increasing operating cash flow and selling non-core assets. In 2012, we deployed our discretionary cash to pay down $531 million of recourse debt, repurchase 24.8 million shares for $301 million, at an average share price of $12.16, declared the first cash dividend since 1994 and invested $195 million in our subsidiaries to expand our existing facilities. Realigning Our Geographic Focus. Finally, in an effort to streamline our portfolio, we sold eight assets for total equity proceeds to AES of more than $600 million and announced plans to exit five countries (China, Czech Republic, France, Hungary and Ukraine) where we did not have a compelling competitive advantage or where we are unable to earn a fair, risk-adjusted return, relative to monetization alternatives. To supplement our future growth, we commenced construction on 208 MW of platform expansion projects, including Guacolda V in Chile, Tunjita in Colombia and two wind projects in the United Kingdom. Despite some challenges in 2012, we met our financial goals and completed the capital allocation commitments we made to our shareholders. 106 Table of Contents Earnings Per Share Results in 2012 Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 (in millions, except per share amounts) Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ (1.21 ) $ 0.63 $ 0.64 Adjusted earnings per share (a non-GAAP measure) (1) $ 1.24 $ 1.02 $ 0.91 (1) See reconciliation and definition under Non-GAAP Measures. During the year ended December 31, 2012, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased principally due to the goodwill impairment expense of $2.41 per share recognized in connection with the interim goodwill impairment indicator identified during the third quarter at DPL, in the United States. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 10 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further details. Adjusted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, increased by 22% primarily due to the contribution of new businesses, lower general and administrative expenses and a lower share count, partially offset by the tariff reset at Eletropaulo and higher cost of replacement energy and lower prices in Chile. Other Operating Highlights Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 (in millions, except per share amounts) Revenue $ 18,141 $ 16,923 $ 15,443 Gross margin $ 3,714 $ 4,063 $ 3,820 Net (loss) income attributable to The AES Corporation $ (912 ) $ 58 $ 9 Adjusted pre-tax contribution (a non-GAAP measure) (1) $ 1,377 $ 1,078 $ 955 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,901 $ 2,884 $ 3,465 Dividends declared per common share $ 0.08 $ $ (1) See reconciliation and definition below under Non-GAAP Measures . The following briefly describes the key changes in our reported revenue, gross margin, net income attributable to The AES Corporation, net cash provided by operating activities, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per share (a non-GAAP measure) for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to 2011 and 2010 and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Results of Operations and Segment Analysis discussion within Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition below. Components of Revenue and Cost of Sales Revenue includes revenue earned from the sale of energy from our utilities and the production of energy from our generation plants, which are classified as regulated and non-regulated on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, respectively. Revenue also includes the gains or losses on derivatives (including embedded derivatives other than foreign currency embedded derivatives) associated with the sale of electricity. Cost of sales includes costs incurred directly by the businesses in the ordinary course of business. Examples include electricity and fuel purchases, operations and maintenance costs, depreciation and amortization expense, bad debt expense and recoveries, general administrative and support costs (including employee-related costs directly associated with the operations of the business). Cost of sales also includes the gains or losses on derivatives (including embedded derivatives other than foreign currency embedded derivatives) associated with the purchase of electricity or fuel. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Consists of the operating cash flow of all consolidated subsidiaries, including noncontrolling interests. 107 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2012 Revenue increased $1.2 billion, or 7%, to $18.1 billion in 2012 compared with $16.9 billion in 2011. Key drivers of the increase included: the impact of new business of $1.9 billion including DPL, acquired in November 2011; Angamos, Maritza, Laurel Mountain and Changuinola, which commenced commercial operations in April, June, July and October of 2011, respectively, along with MountainView 4 which commenced operations in February 2012; and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $1.3 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and new businesses mentioned above, the SBU drivers included: US Overall favorable impact of $121 million due to the temporary restart of two units at Southland in California, higher prices at IPL in Indiana and fewer outage days at Hawaii, slightly offset by lower volume at IPL due to milder weather. Andes Overall unfavorable impact of $6 million due to lower exports from Termoandes in Argentina to Chile, lower prices in Argentina and the impact of outages in Argentina, almost entirely offset by higher volume in Chile and Argentina and higher prices in Colombia. Brazil Overall favorable impact of $262 million due to higher tariffs to cover pass-through costs, higher contract and spot prices at Tiet and higher demand in the distribution companies partially offset by lower tariff at Eletropaulo due to the tariff reset. MCAC Overall favorable impact of $216 million due to higher prices and volume from gas sales and higher ancillary services in the Dominican Republic, higher pass-through electricity costs in El Salvador and the favorable impact of Esti coming back into service, slightly offset by lower pass-through fuel costs at Merida in Mexico. EMEA Overall unfavorable impact of $70 million due to the sale of 80% of our ownership in Cartagena in February 2012 and lower availability and reduced contract capacity prices in Ballylumford in Northern Ireland, partially offset by a non-recurring arbitration settlement at Cartagena, a mark-to-market loss on an embedded derivative at Sonel in Cameroon in 2011 that did not recur, higher volume and tariffs in the Ukraine and higher volume net of lower prices at Kilroot. Asia Overall favorable impact of $121 million due to higher market demand and the reversal of a contingency at Masinloc in the Philippines and higher demand at Kelanitissa in Sri Lanka caused by lower hydrology and better plant reliability. Gross margin decreased $349 million, or 9%, to $3.7 billion in 2012 compared with $4.1 billion in 2011. Key drivers of the decrease included: the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $172 million; offset by the favorable impact of new business of $463 million, as discussed above. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and new businesses on gross margin as mentioned above, the key SBU drivers included: US Overall favorable impact of $67 million due to the temporary restart of two units at Southland, better availability at Hawaii, higher demand at DPL and higher prices at IPL slightly offset by lower volume at IPL. Andes Overall unfavorable impact of $169 million due to lower prices in Chile, higher replacement energy cost in Chile and outages, outages in Argentina, and maintenance and higher fixed costs in Argentina and Chile partially offset by higher volume in Chile. 108 Table of Contents Brazil Overall unfavorable impact of $689 million due to lower tariffs as a result of the tariff reset of 2011 which was postponed to 2012 at Eletropaulo, for which we have a 16% economic ownership, and higher fixed costs at all businesses partially offset by higher volume and tariffs at Sul. MCAC Overall unfavorable impact of $28 million due to lower volume in Panama and higher fixed costs in Puerto Rico partially offset by the impact of Esti returning to service. EMEA Overall favorable impact of $128 million due to a non-recurring arbitration settlement at Cartagena, a mark-to-market loss on an embedded derivative at Sonel in 2011 that did not recur, higher volume offset by lower prices at Kilroot, higher volume and tariffs in the Ukraine and lower fixed costs at Sonel partially offset by the sale of 80% of our ownership in Cartagena. Asia Overall favorable impact of $66 million due to higher market demand and the reversal of a contingency at Masinloc. Net loss attributable to The AES Corporation was $912 million in 2012, which is a decrease of $1 billion compared to net income of $58 million in 2011. The key driver of the decrease was the goodwill impairment at DPL of $1.82 billion as described in Note 10 Goodwill Impairment and Other Intangible Assets included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. Excluding the goodwill impairment at DPL, the Company would have reported net income attributable to AES of $905 million, which is an improvement of $847 million compared to 2011. The key drivers of this increase were: the favorable impact of gross margin earned by new businesses, mainly our wholly-owned subsidiaries: DPL, Maritza, and Changuinola, unfavorable impact in 2011 of an unrealized mark-to-market derivative at Sonel, which is a 56% owned subsidiary, higher demand at Masinloc, a 92% owned subsidiary, partially offset by a reduced gross margin at Eletropaulo, in which we hold only a 16% economic interest and a lower gross margin earned by our generation businesses in Chile and Argentina; the gains related to the sale in 2012 of 80% of our interest in Cartagena and the sale of our investments in China, as well as the loss recorded in 2011 on the sale of our Argentina distribution businesses; a decrease in losses from the operation of discontinued businesses, mainly related to Eastern Energy in New York, which was deconsolidated in December 2011; the decrease in asset impairments related to Wind projects and Kelanitissa; lower general and administrative expenses in 2012 compared to 2011; and the prior year premium paid on the early retirement of debt in Chile and at IPL. These increases were partially offset by: higher foreign currency transaction losses in 2012 compared to 2011; and an increase in interest expense primarily due to debt at DPL, which was acquired in November 2011, and additional debt at the Parent Company to finance the acquisition of DPL. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $17 million, or 1%, to $2.9 billion during 2012 compared to 2011, mainly due to the following: US an increase of $320 million at our utility businesses primarily due to the operations, net of debt service costs, of DPL which was acquired in November 2011; Andes an increase of $57 million driven by cash provided by the operating activities of the new plant at Angamos, recovery of value added tax at Campiche and reduced working capital requirements at Gener, partially offset by reduced gross margin from Gener operations other than Angamos; 109 Table of Contents Brazil a decrease of $503 million at our utility businesses primarily driven by higher priced energy purchases, regulatory charges and transmission costs payments, higher operating and maintenance expenses and lower accounts receivable collections due to the lower tariff starting in July 2012 at Eletropaulo, partially offset by a lower payment of income taxes; MCAC an increase of $25 million at our generation businesses primarily due to the operations of the Esti plant being back on line from June 2012 and higher volumes of PPA sales at Panama and lower coal volume and price in 2012 at Itabo, partially offset by lower collections and lower sales in the Dominican Republic and higher taxes paid at Panama; EMEA an increase of $42 million driven primarily by cash provided by the operating activities of the new plant at Maritza partially offset by a loss in revenue from a generator failure at Ballylumford in Northern Ireland; and Asia an increase of $88 million driven primarily by Masinloc in the Philippines due to higher demand and reduced working capital requirements. Year Ended December 31, 2011 Revenue increased $1.5 billion, or 10%, to $16.9 billion in 2011 compared with $15.4 billion in 2010. Key drivers of the increase included: the favorable impact of foreign currency of $460 million; and the impact of new businesses of $746 million including Ballylumford in Northern Ireland and DPL in the United States, acquired in August and late November 2011, respectively, and Angamos I, in Chile, and Maritza, in Bulgaria, and Angamos II, in Chile, that commenced operations in April, June and October 2011, respectively. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and new businesses mentioned above, the SBU drivers included: US Overall favorable impact of $3 million due to higher prices related to a fuel adjustment clause almost entirely offset by lower retail and wholesale volume at IPL. Andes Overall favorable impact of $297 million due to higher prices in Argentina and Gener and higher volume at Chivor in Colombia, partially offset by lower prices in Chivor. Brazil Overall unfavorable impact of $128 million due to lower prices at Eletropaulo primarily related to the estimated impact of the July 2011 tariff reset which was finalized by the Brazilian energy regulatory agency in July 2012, partially offset by higher demand at Eletropaulo. MCAC Overall favorable impact of $270 million due to higher prices, volume and gas sales and higher ancillary services in the Dominican Republic, higher prices in Puerto Rico and higher pass-through electricity costs in El Salvador partially offset by outages in Panama. EMEA Overall unfavorable impact of $157 million due to lower revenue from pass-through energy costs at Cartagena in Spain and by an unrealized mark-to-market derivative loss at Sonel in Cameroon partially offset by higher rates in the Ukraine and better plant availability at Ballylumford. Asia Overall unfavorable impact of $12 million due to lower volume and price at Masinloc in the Phillipines almost entirely offset by higher rates and demand at Kelanitissa in Sri Lanka. Gross margin increased $243 million, or 6%, to $4.1 billion in 2011 compared with $3.8 billion in 2010. Key drivers of the increase included: the favorable impact of foreign currency of $111 million; and new businesses of $197 million as discussed above. 110 Table of Contents Excluding the impact of foreign currency and new businesses on gross margin as mentioned above, the key SBU drivers included: US Overall unfavorable impact of $41 million due to higher fuel costs at Shady Point in Oklahoma and Hawaii and lower wholesale margin and retail margin at IPL. Andes Overall favorable impact of $175 million due to higher volume in Electrica Santiago at Gener in Chile. Brazil Overall unfavorable impact of $11 million due to lower prices at Eletropaulo, as discussed above, offset by increased volume and lower fixed costs. MCAC Overall favorable impact of $53 million due to higher volume and prices in the Dominican Republic as discussed above and higher volume in Panama partially offset by outages in Panama. EMEA Overall unfavorable impact of $165 million due to an unrealized mark-to-market derivative loss at Sonel and lower volume and rates at Kilroot in Northern Ireland. Asia Overall unfavorable impact of $71 million due to lower demand and prices and higher fuel and fixed costs at Masinloc. Net income attributable to The AES Corporation increased $49 million to $58 million in 2011, compared to $9 million in 2010. Key drivers of the increase included: an increase in gross margin as described above; a decrease in asset impairment expense due to higher prior year impairments related to the Southland generation facility offset primarily by current year impairments on wind turbines and deposits; and a decrease in losses from discontinued operations primarily related to a gain on sale of Brazil Telecom in 2011 partially offsetting a loss on disposal of our Argentina distribution businesses and losses at other discontinued businesses compared to a significant impairment recorded at New York in 2010. These increases were partially offset by: an increase in interest expense due to increased debt and fees related to the DPL acquisition, reduced interest capitalization at Maritza due to commencement of operations in June 2011, and an unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation in Brazil; and a decrease in net equity in earnings of affiliates partially offset by income tax expense related to the sale of the Company indirect investment in Companhia Energ tica de Minas Gerais ( CEMIG ). Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $581 million, or 17%, to $2.9 billion in 2011 compared with $3.5 billion in 2010, mainly due to the following: US a decrease of $131 million at our generation businesses primarily due to reduced operations in New York prior to its deconsolidation in December 2011, partially offset by the deconsolidation of Thames in 2011; Brazil a decrease of $352 million at our utility businesses primarily driven by higher income tax payments of which $84 million was due to the sale of Brazil Telecom in October 2011, for which the pre-tax net sales proceeds of $890 million are recorded in cash flows from investing activities, and a one-time cash savings of $107 million mainly related to the utilization of a tax credit received as a result of the REFIS program in 2010, lower accounts receivable collections at Eletropaulo and higher payments for energy purchases, operation and maintenance expenses and pension contributions. These impacts were partially offset by higher accounts receivable collections at Sul; Asia a decrease of $56 million at Masinloc, due to lower gross margin. 111 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Measures Adjusted pre-tax contribution ( adjusted PTC ) and Adjusted earnings per Share ( adjusted EPS ) are non-GAAP supplemental measures that are used by management and external users of our consolidated financial statements such as investors, industry analysts and lenders. We define adjusted PTC as pre-tax income from continuing operations attributable to AES excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (c) significant gains or losses due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, (d) significant losses due to impairments, and (e) costs due to the early retirement of debt. Adjusted PTC also includes net equity in earnings of affiliates on an after-tax basis. We define adjusted EPS as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (c) significant gains or losses due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, (d) significant losses due to impairments, and (e) costs due to the early retirement of debt. The GAAP measure most comparable to adjusted PTC is income from continuing operations attributable to AES. The GAAP measure most comparable to adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. We believe that adjusted PTC and adjusted EPS better reflect the underlying business performance of the Company and are considered in the Company internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments and strategic decisions to dispose or acquire business interests or retire debt, which affect results in a given period or periods. In addition, for adjusted PTC, earnings before tax represents the business performance of the Company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, including the effects of tax planning, corresponding to the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Adjusted PTC and adjusted EPS should not be construed as alternatives to income from continuing operations attributable to AES and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which are determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company reported a loss from continuing operations of $1.21 per share in 2012. The Company did not have a loss from continuing operations in 2011 and 2010. For purposes of measuring diluted loss per share under GAAP, potential common stock was excluded from weighted average shares in 2012 as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. However, for purposes of computing adjusted EPS, the Company has included the impact of potential common stock as the inclusion of the defined adjustments result in income for adjusted EPS. The table below reconciles the weighted average shares used in GAAP diluted loss per share to the weighted average shares used in calculating the non-GAAP measure of diluted loss per share, a component of the adjusted EPS calculation. The weighted average shares used in calculating the non-GAAP measure of diluted loss per share has also been used in calculating the per share impact of the adjusting items in the calculation of adjusted EPS.

Business and Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. Some of these factors are also described below. However, management expects that improved operating performance at certain businesses, growth from new business and global cost reduction initiatives may lessen or offset the impact of the challenges described below. If these favorable effects do not occur, or if the challenges described below and elsewhere in this section impact us more significantly than we currently anticipate, or if volatile foreign currencies and commodities move more unfavorably, then these adverse factors (or other adverse factors unknown to us) may impact our gross margin, net income attributable to The AES Corporation and cash flows. We continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. In 2013, we expect to face continued challenges at certain of our businesses: On-going Regulatory Proceedings Some of our utility companies, including DPL in the United States and AES Sul in Brazil, are in the process of their regulated tariff review and/or reset by the applicable regulatory agency. The tariff outcome will determine the amount that our utility companies can charge to customers for electricity. On October 5, 2012, DPL filed an ESP with the PUCO to establish SSO rates that were to be in effect starting January 1, 2013. The plan requested approval of a non-bypassable charge that is designed to recover $138 million per year for five years from all customers. DPL also requested approval of a switching tracker that would measure the incremental amount of switching over a base case and defer the lost value into a regulatory asset which would be recovered from all customers beginning January 2014. The ESP states that DPL plans to file on or before December 31, 2013 its plan for legal separation of its generation assets. The ESP proposes a three year and five month transition to market, whereby a wholesale competitive bidding structure will be phased in to supply generation service to SSO customers. The PUCO is currently reviewing the filing and an evidentiary hearing is scheduled to begin on March 11, 2013. The PUCO authorized that the rates being collected prior to December 31, 2012 would continue until the new ESP rates go into effect. See Item 1. Business United States SBU, DPL included in this Form 10-K for further information. In addition to the regulatory risks noted above, DPL also faces a number of additional uncertainties related to the impact of customer switching and low power prices which could impact DPL results of operations, its ability to refinance certain debt (or to do so on favorable terms) which is due in the near to intermediate term, and/or realize the benefits associated with the remaining goodwill. Any of the above-referenced conditions, events or factors could have a material impact on the Company or its results of operations. AES Sul in Brazil is currently undergoing the tariff reset process. A public hearing has started and will be concluded in March 2013, with the revised tariff to be implemented in April 2013. Macroeconomic and Political Conditions The Company is sensitive to changes in economic and political conditions, including foreign exchange rates. In Argentina and the Dominican Republic, the potential weakening of economic indicators, such as increased inflation, devaluation of the local currency, currency convertibility restrictions and large government deficits could have a material impact on the Company. Potential outcomes can include negative impacts in our gross 116 Table of Contents margin and cash flows, and create an inability of the business to pay dividends or obtain currency to service foreign obligations, all of which can negatively impact the value of our assets. See Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of this Form 10-K for more information. Due to our global presence, the Company has significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. The exposure is primarily associated with the impact of the translation of our foreign subsidiaries operating results from their local currency to U.S. dollars that is required for the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, there is a risk of transaction exposure when an entity enters into transactions, including debt agreements, in currencies other than their functional currency. These risks are further described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K, Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates experienced at our foreign operations . In the year ended December 31, 2012, changes in foreign currency exchange rates have had a significant impact on our operating results. If the current foreign currency exchange rate volatility continues, our gross margin and other financial metrics could be affected. Fluctuations in Commodity Prices The Company is sensitive to changes in natural gas prices. High coal prices relative to natural gas creates pressure at our U.S. businesses, which may affect the results of certain of our coal plants, particularly those which are merchant plants that are exposed to market risk and those that have hybrid merchant risk, meaning those businesses that have a PPA in place, but purchase fuel at market prices or under short term contracts. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this Form 10-K for more information. Global diversification helps us mitigate certain risks. Our presence in mature markets helps mitigate the exposure associated with our businesses in emerging markets. Additionally, our portfolio employs a broad range of fuels, including coal, gas, fuel oil, water (hydroelectric power), wind and solar, which reduces the risks associated with dependence on any one fuel source. However, to the extent the mix of fuel sources enabling our generation capabilities in any one market is not diversified, the spread in costs of different fuels may also influence the operating performance and the ability of our subsidiaries to compete within that market. For example, in a market where gas prices fall to a low level compared to coal prices, power prices may be set by low gas prices which can affect the profitability of our coal plants in that market. In certain cases, we may attempt to hedge fuel prices to manage this risk, but there can be no assurance that these strategies will be effective. We also attempt to limit risk by hedging much of our interest rate and commodity risk, and by matching the currency of most of our subsidiary debt to the revenue of the underlying business. However, we only hedge a portion of our currency and commodity risks, and our businesses are still subject to these risks, as further described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K, We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates . Commodity and power price volatility could continue to impact our financial metrics to the extent this volatility is not hedged. For a discussion of our sensitivities to commodity, currency and interest rate risk, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this Form 10-K. Global Economic Considerations During the past few years, economic conditions in some countries where our subsidiaries conduct business have deteriorated. Global economic conditions remain volatile and could have an adverse impact on our businesses in the event these recent trends continue. Our business or results of operations could be impacted if we or our subsidiaries are unable to access the capital markets on favorable terms or at all, are unable to raise funds through the sale of assets or are otherwise unable to finance or refinance our activities. At this time, several European Union countries continue to face uncertain economic environments, the impacts of which are described below. The Company could also be 117 Table of Contents adversely affected if capital market disruptions result in increased borrowing costs (including with respect to interest payments on the Company or our subsidiaries variable rate debt) or if commodity prices affect the profitability of our plants or their ability to continue operations. The Company could be adversely affected if general economic or political conditions in the markets where our subsidiaries operate deteriorate, resulting in a reduction in cash flow from operations, a reduction in the availability and/or an increase in the cost of capital, or if the value of our assets remains depressed or declines further. Any of the foregoing events or a combination thereof could have a material impact on the Company, its results of operations, liquidity, financial covenants, and/or its credit rating. Our subsidiaries are subject to credit risk, which includes risk related to the ability of counterparties (such as parties to our PPAs, fuel supply agreements, hedging agreements and other contractual arrangements) to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price or to satisfy their financial or other contractual obligations. We have not suffered any material effects related to our counterparties during the year ended December 31, 2012. However, if macroeconomic conditions impact our counterparties, they may be unable to meet their commitments which could result in the loss of favorable contractual positions, which could have a material impact on our business. United States As noted in Item 1A Risk Factors We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates of this Form 10-K and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Commodity Price Risk of this Form 10-K, the Company U. S. businesses continue to face pressure as a result of low natural gas prices, the marginal price setting fuel in most U. S. markets. This has affected the results of certain of our coal-fired plants in the region, including our coal-fired generating assets within our utility businesses, like IPL, which benefit from high wholesale power prices in periods where our available generation exceeds our captive load obligations. At DPL, where retail competition exists, our coal-fired generating assets do not benefit from the captive load offset and, as such, are subject to greater sensitivity to changes in power prices. Businesses that have a PPA in place, but purchase fuel at market prices or under short term contracts may not be fully hedged against changes in either power or fuel prices. On December 27, 2012, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware issued its Order Confirming the Second Amended Joint Plan of Liquidation under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code filed by AES Eastern Energy, L.P. and certain affiliates that owned coal-fired plants in New York and had filed for bankruptcy in 2011. In accordance with its terms, the Plan became effective on December 28, 2012. An integral component of the Plan was the settlement between the Company, the Debtors and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors. Pursuant to that settlement, the Debtors and the Committee have released the Company and its non-debtor affiliates from claims and causes of action they have or may have in the future. In exchange, the Company paid $47 million to and waived all unpaid claims against the Debtors. In addition, the Company assumed a net pension liability of $25 million for employees of AES NY, L.L.C. Argentina In Argentina, the deterioration of certain economic indicators such as non-receding inflation, increased government deficits and foreign currency accessibility combined with the potential devaluation of the local currency and the potential fall in export commodity prices could cause significant volatility in our results of operations, cash flows, the ability to pay dividends to corporate, and the value of our assets. At December 31, 2012, AES had noncurrent assets of $564 million in Argentina, including long-term receivables of $316 million. In addition, recent actions by the Argentine government may indicate deeper government intervention in the local economy. For example, on April 16, 2012, the Argentine government expropriated 51% of the assets of the country largest oil company. The statute used to expropriate the oil company is not applicable to our businesses in Argentina. However, potential deteriorating economic conditions or further government action could have a material impact on the Company or its financial statements. Brazil Given that approximately two-thirds of Brazil electric supply is dependent upon hydroelectric generation, changes in weather conditions can have a significant impact on reservoir levels and electricity prices. 118 Table of Contents The hot, dry summer has cause the reservoir levels to be lower than they have been in a number of years. If reservoir levels are not able to recover, or deteriorate further, it is expected that higher thermal dispatch will cause more volatility in spot prices. Although the purchased energy cost is a pass-through for AES distribution businesses in Brazil, gaps between the purchase of energy and recovery in the tariff could cause temporary cash flow constraints on those businesses. Also, to the extent that the hydroelectric facility would need to purchase energy to meet its contract needs, rather than generate the energy, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Bulgaria Our investments in Bulgaria rely on offtaker contracts with NEK, the state-owned national electricity distribution company. Maritza, a coal-fired generation facility, has experienced on-going delays in collections from their offtaker, although they were able to collect $73 million of past due receivables in the fourth quarter of 2012 from NEK, which brought down the outstanding receivables balance to $55 million as of December 31, 2012. There can be no assurance that the business will succeed in making these collections, which could result in a write-off of the receivables. In addition, depending on NEK ability to honor its obligations and other factors, the value of other assets could also be impaired, or the business may be in default of its loan covenants. The Company has long-lived assets in Bulgaria of $1.8 billion. Any of the above items could have a material impact on our results of operations. For further information on the importance of long-term contracts and our counterparty credit risk, see Item 1A. Risk Factors We may not be able to enter into long-term contracts, which reduce volatility in our results of operations of this Form 10-K. As a result of any of the foregoing events, we may face a loss of earnings and/or cash flows from the affected businesses and may have to provide loans or equity to support affected businesses or projects, restructure them, write down their value and/or face the possibility that these projects cannot continue operations or provide returns consistent with our expectations, any of which could have a material impact on the Company. Euro Zone During the past few years, certain European Union countries have continually faced a sovereign debt crisis and it is possible that this crisis could spread to other countries. This crisis has resulted in an increased risk of default by governments and the implementation of austerity measures in certain countries. If the crisis continues, worsens, or spreads, there could be a material adverse impact on the Company. Our businesses may be impacted if they are unable to access the capital markets, face increased taxes or labor costs, or if governments fail to fulfill their obligations to us or adopt austerity measures which adversely impact our projects. As discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors Our renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties including development, operational and regulatory challenges of this Form 10-K, our renewables businesses are dependent on favorable regulatory incentives, including subsidies, which are provided by sovereign governments, including European governments. If these subsidies or other incentives are reduced or repealed, or sovereign governments are unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments or maintain favorable regulatory incentives for renewables, in whole or in part, this could impact the ability of the affected businesses to continue to sustain and/or grow their operations and could result in losses or asset impairments for these businesses which could be material. The carrying value of our investment in AES Solar Energy Ltd., whose primary operations are in Europe, was $130 million at December 31, 2012. In addition, any of the foregoing could also impact contractual counterparties of our subsidiaries in core power or renewables. If such counterparties are adversely impacted, then they may be unable to meet their commitments to our subsidiaries. If global economic conditions deteriorate further, it could also affect the prices we receive for the electricity we generate or transmit. Utility regulators or parties to our generation contracts may seek to lower our prices based on prevailing market conditions pursuant to PPAs, concession agreements or other contracts as they come up for renewal or reset. In addition, rising fuel and other costs coupled with contractual price or tariff decreases could restrict our ability to operate profitably in a given market. Each of these factors, as well as those discussed above, could result in a decline in the value of our assets including those at the businesses we operate, our equity investments and projects under development and could result in asset impairments that could be material to our operations. We continue to monitor our projects and businesses. 119 Table of Contents Impairments Goodwill The Company seeks business acquisitions as one of its growth strategies. We have achieved significant growth in the past as a result of several business acquisitions, which also resulted in the recognition of goodwill. As noted in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K, there is always a risk that Our acquisitions may not perform as expected. One factor contributing to goodwill is the synergies expected from an acquisition that follow the integration of the acquired business with the existing operations of an entity. Thus, an entity ability to realize benefits of goodwill depends on the successful integration of the acquired business. If such integration efforts are not successful, it could be difficult to realize the benefits of goodwill, which could result in impairment of goodwill. Another factor relates to the market or commodity dynamics, which can change after the acquisition. For example, DPL recognized a goodwill impairment of $1.82 billion during 2012. See Note 10 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets included in Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information. The value of goodwill is also positively correlated with the economic environments in which our acquired businesses operate. Also, the evolving environmental regulations, including GHG regulations, around the world continue to increase the operating costs of our generation businesses. In extreme situations, environmental regulations could even make a once profitable business uneconomical. In addition, most of our generation businesses have a finite life and as the acquired businesses reach the end of their finite lives, the carrying amount of goodwill is gradually realized through their periodic operating results. The accounting guidance, however, prohibits the systematic amortization of goodwill and rather requires an annual impairment evaluation. Thus, as some of our acquired businesses approach the end of their finite lives, they may incur goodwill impairment charges even if there are no discrete adverse changes in the economic environment. For example, Ebute, our 294 MW gas-fired plant in Nigeria, currently operates under a 15 year PPA with the Nigerian national electricity distribution company that expires within the next few years. The inability to replace the PPA on similar terms or identify alternate uses for the plant could adversely affect the carrying amount of Ebute goodwill, which could be material. In our calculation of the fair value of the Ebute reporting unit, we have considered a market participant view that assumes significant expansion of the generation facility, which may be uncertain and is dependent upon regulatory approvals and financing availability, among other uncertainties. The carrying amount of the goodwill at December 31, 2012 was approximately $58 million. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company completed its annual October 1 goodwill impairment evaluation and identified two reporting units, DPL and Ebute, that were considered at risk . A reporting unit is considered at risk when its fair value is not higher than its carrying amount by more than 10%. While there were no potential impairment indicators during the fourth quarter of 2012 related to DPL and Ebute that could result in the recognition of goodwill impairment, it is possible that we may incur goodwill impairment at any of our reporting units in future periods if adverse changes in their business or operating environments occur. The carrying amount of the goodwill at DPL and Ebute as of December 31, 2012 was approximately $759 million and $58 million, respectively. Long-lived assets The global economic conditions and other adverse factors discussed above heighten the risk of significant asset impairment. The Company continually evaluates the impact of any adverse changes in operating and business environments on the fair value of its long-lived assets. Wind turbines During the third quarter of 2012, the Company recognized an impairment expense of $20 million related to certain wind turbines held in storage. The Company determined that these turbines met the held-for-sale criteria due to the ongoing receipt of offers from potential buyers and less viable internal deployment scenarios. The turbines with a carrying amount of $45 million were written down to their estimated fair value (less costs to sell) of $25 million. As of December 31, 2012 the Company concluded the turbines should continue to be classified as held for sale and no adjustment to the carrying amount is required. It is reasonably possible that the turbines could incur further loss in value due to changing market conditions, regulatory environment and advances in technology. Refer to Note 21 Asset Impairment Expense included in Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information 120 Table of Contents Revenue and Gross Margin Analysis US SBU US Generation The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our US Generation segment for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 % Change 2012 vs. 2011 % Change 2011 vs. 2010 ($ in millions) US Generation Revenue $ 861 $ 784 $ 806 10 % -3 % Gross Margin $ 237 $ 200 $ 205 19 % -2 % Fiscal Year 2012 versus 2011 Generation revenue for 2012 increased $77 million, or 10%, from 2011 primarily due to: an increase of $28 million at Southland in California, primarily due to the short-term restart of two generating units at the Huntington Beach which were contracted through October 2012; the impact of new business of $25 million from Mountain View IV in California and Laurel Mountain in West Virginia, which began operations in February of 2012 and July of 2011, respectively; an increase of $13 million in Hawaii and $7 million at Beaver Valley in Pennsylvania, primarily due to higher volumes as a result of fewer outage days; and $7 million higher revenue at Deepwater in Texas, primarily due to the sale of NOx allowances. Generation gross margin for 2012 increased $37 million, or 19%, from 2011 primarily due to: an increase of $21 million at Southland, primarily due to the short-term restart of two generating units at Huntington Beach; an increase of $20 million in Hawaii, primarily due to higher volumes as a result of fewer outage days and lower fixed costs; and the impact of new business of $4 million from Mountain View IV and Laurel Mountain, which began operations in February of 2012 and July of 2011, respectively For the year ended December 31, 2012, revenue increased 10% while gross margin increased 19%, primarily due to higher volumes and the short-term restart of two generating units at Huntington Beach that had a positive impact on gross margin and a decrease in fixed costs. Fiscal Year 2011 versus 2010 Generation revenue for 2011 decreased $22 million, or 3%, from 2010 primarily due to: a decrease in volume of $21 million at Deepwater in Texas due to the layup of the plant in January 2011 caused by high fuel costs and diminishing power prices. Generation gross margin for 2011 decreased $5 million, or 2%, from 2010 primarily due to: higher fuel costs and lower volume at Hawaii of $11 million; higher fuel costs at Shady Point in Oklahoma of $10 million; and 121 Table of Contents a decrease in volume of $6 million at Deepwater as discussed above. These decreases were partially offset by: an increase of $15 million in Hawaii due to a favorable impact of prior year mark-to-market derivative adjustments; and lower fixed costs at Deepwater of $10 million. US Utilities The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our US Utilities segment for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 % Change 2012 vs. 2011 % Change 2011 vs. 2010 ($ in millions) US Utilities Revenue $ 2,898 $ 1,326 $ 1,145 119 % 16 % Gross Margin $ 483 $ 220 $ 250 120 % -12 % Fiscal Year 2012 versus 2011 Utilities revenue for 2012 increased $1.6 billion, or 119%, from 2011 primarily due to: the impact of new business of $1.5 billion from the operations of DPL, in Ohio, which was acquired in November 2011; higher prices of $68 million at IPL in Indiana, primarily due to higher fuel adjustment and other pass-through charges; and higher volume of $27 million at DPL in December 2012, primarily due to increased energy available for wholesale sales caused by switching of regulated customers to other suppliers as well as new retail customers added in the Illinois service territory which are served with power purchased by DPL. These increases were partially offset by: lower prices of $24 million at DPL in December 2012, primarily due to lower capacity revenue and lower average retail prices due to downward price pressure as a result of generation services competition which we expect to continue in 2013 given the cleared auction prices for capacity; and lower volume of $16 million at IPL, primarily due to warmer winter weather in 2012 and because IPL generating units are being priced out of market more often in 2012, reducing wholesale sales opportunities. Utilities gross margin for 2012 increased $263 million, or 120%, from 2011 primarily due to: the impact of new business of $222 million from DPL, in Ohio, in 2012 which was acquired in November 2011; higher margin of $42 million in December 2012, primarily due to increases in wholesale margins due to increased volumes as described above and reductions in fixed operating costs primarily related to the acquisition of DPL by AES; and lower repairs and maintenance costs at IPL of $21 million, primarily due to fewer generating unit outages. 122 Table of Contents These increases were partially offset by: lower rates of $10 million primarily due to DP&L customers switching to DPL Inc. competitive retail supplier; and higher pension expenses of $5 million at IPL, primarily due to a decrease in the estimated pension obligations at December 31, 2011. Fiscal Year 2011 versus 2010 Utilities revenue for 2011 increased $181 million, or 16%, from 2010 primarily due to: an increase of $154 million from the operations of DPL, which was acquired on November 28, 2011; and higher prices of $67 million, primarily due to higher fuel adjustment charges of $57 million at IPL. These increases were partially offset by: lower retail volume of $21 million, primarily due to unfavorable weather and economic conditions at IPL; and lower wholesale volume of $16 million at IPL, primarily due to increased generating unit outages. Utilities gross margin for 2011 decreased $30 million, or 12%, from 2010 primarily due to the following at IPL: lower wholesale margin of $12 million, primarily due to increased generating unit outages; lower retail margin of $11 million, primarily due to unfavorable volume as discussed above; and higher salaries, wages and benefits of $7 million, primarily due to increased overtime and higher pay rates in 2011. These decreases were partially offset by: increase of $6 million from the operations of DPL, which was acquired on November 28, 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2011, revenue increased 16% while gross margin decreased 12%, primarily due to the positive impact of higher-pass through on revenue at IPL, which had no corresponding impact on gross margin and the unfavorable impact on gross margin from one-time acquisition charges of $16 million related to DPL. Andes SBU Andes Generation The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Andes Generation segment for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 % Change 2012 vs. 2011 % Change 2011 vs. 2010 ($ in millions) Andes Generation Revenue $ 3,020 $ 2,989 $ 2,519 1 % 19 % Gross Margin $ 580 $ 743 $ 519 -22 % 43 % 123 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2012 versus 2011 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $66 million, generation revenue for 2012 increased $97 million, compared to 2011 primarily due to: new business impact of $106 million at Angamos in Chile, which commenced operations in 2011, higher spot and contract prices of $75 million at Chivor in Colombia due to pressure on prices from lower water inflows caused by El Nino; and higher contract levels and lower energy prices of $25 million at Gener in Chile.

These decreases were partially offset by: new business contribution of $174 million from Maritza, in Bulgaria, which commenced commercial operations in June 2011; a non-recurring favorable arbitration settlement at Cartagena of $95 million; and an increase of $47 million at Kilroot, in Northern Ireland, primarily due to increased dispatch of the plant. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $22 million, generation gross margin for 2012 increased $134 million, or 31%, from 2011 primarily due to: the new business impact of $117 million at Maritza, as discussed above; 130 Table of Contents a non-recurring favorable arbitration settlement at Cartagena of $95 million; and an increase of $35 million at Kilroot, as discussed above. These increases were partially offset by: a decrease of $68 million from Cartagena as a result of the sale of 80% of our ownership in February 2012; a decrease of $48 million at Ballylumford, as discussed above and also due to higher fixed costs and depreciation; a decrease of $8 million in Kazakhstan primarily due to higher fixed costs; and a decrease of $6 million as a result of the sale of Bohemia, in the Czech Republic, in September 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2012, revenue decreased 8% primarily due to the sale of 80% of our ownership in Cartagena while gross margin increased 26% primarily due to favorable arbitration settlement at Cartagena. Fiscal Year 2011 versus 2010 Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $41 million, generation revenue for 2011 increased $252 million, or 21%, from 2010 primarily due to: the favorable impact of $256 million from the operations at Ballylumford, acquired in August 2010, driven by $224 million resulting from the acquisition and $32 million primarily from better availability due to a planned outage in 2010; and new business of $182 million at Maritza, which commenced commercial operations in June 2011. These increases were partially offset by: a decrease of $160 million at Cartagena primarily due to lower pass-through energy costs; a decrease of $46 million at Kilroot, in Northern Ireland, primarily resulting from the cancellation of the long-term PPA and supplementary agreements in November 2010. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $11 million, generation gross margin for 2011 increased $90 million, or 28%, from 2010 primarily due to: the favorable impact of $77 million from the operations at Ballylumford, acquired in August 2010, driven by $64 million resulting from the acquisition and $13 million primarily from better availability due to a planned outage in 2010; and the new business impact of $66 million at Maritza, which commenced operations in June 2011. These increases were partially offset by: a decrease of $68 million at Kilroot, primarily resulting from cancellation of the long-term PPA and supplementary agreements in November 2010, lower capacity factor due to a decline in market demand, partially offset by CO2 costs passed through in the market price in 2011. 131 Table of Contents Asia SBU Asia Generation The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Asia Generation segment for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 % Change 2012 vs. 2011 % Change 2011 vs. 2010 ($ in millions) Asia Generation Revenue $ 738 $ 626 $ 618 18 % 1 % Gross Margin $ 250 $ 178 $ 241 40 % -26 % Fiscal Year 2012 versus 2011 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $9 million, generation revenue for 2012 increased $121 million, or 19%, from 2011 primarily due to: an increase at Masinloc in the Philippines of $64 million primarily driven by: the $36 million favorable impact of higher market demand, partially offset by lower rates; the reversal of a contingency of $16 million; and the $13 million favorable impact of a mark-to-market adjustment on an inflation-related embedded derivative. an increase of $51 million at Kelanitissa in Sri Lanka primarily attributable to higher offtaker demand as a result of lower hydrology, and higher fuel pass-through revenue, as well as better plant reliability. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $6 million, primarily in the Philippines, generation gross margin for 2012 increased $66 million, or 37%, from 2011 primarily due to the following: an increase at Masinloc in the Philippines of $66 million primarily driven by: the $35 million favorable impact of higher market demand, partially offset by lower rates; the reversal of a contingency of $16 million; and the $13 million favorable impact of a mark-to-market adjustment on an inflation-related embedded derivative. These increases were partially offset by: higher fixed costs of $7 million related to commitment fees on undrawn construction loans at Mong Duong II in Vietnam. For the year ended December 31, 2012, revenue increased 18% while gross margin increased 40%. This was primarily due to the impact of higher spot market margins at Masinloc and a gain on a mark-to-market inflation-related embedded derivative and reversal of a contingency. We expect gross margin in 2013 to be reduced due to a step down in the PPA at Masinloc 132 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2011 versus 2010 Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $20 million, generation revenue for 2011 decreased $12 million, or 2%, from 2010 primarily due to: a decrease of $39 million at Masinloc primarily due to lower generation prices and volume. Spot volume and prices were lower due to flat electricity demand and higher available capacity in the grid; a decrease of $12 million due to the closure of Aixi in China in November 2010; and outages of $9 million at Kelanitissa resulting in lower plant availability in 2011. These decreases were partially offset by: higher generation rates of $18 million due to higher pass-through fuel costs and higher generation volume of $29 million at Kelanitissa due to higher offtaker demand as a result of lower hydrology. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $8 million, generation gross margin for 2011 decreased $71 million, or 29%, from 2010 primarily due to: decrease of $59 million at Masinloc primarily attributable to a combination of flat market demand, lower spot prices, higher coal prices and increased fixed costs. For the year ended December 31, 2011, revenue increased 1% while gross margin decreased 26%, primarily due to higher pass-through fuel costs at Kelanitissa which had a positive impact on revenue but no corresponding impact on gross margin and the negative influence on gross margin arising from lower spot prices at Masinloc, as well as increases in coal prices and fixed costs. Corporate and Other Corporate and other includes the net operating results from our utility businesses in El Salvador, Africa and Europe, which are immaterial for the purposes of separate segment disclosure. The following table excludes inter-segment activity and summarizes revenue and gross margin for Corporate and Other entities for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 % Change 2012 vs. 2011 % Change 2011 vs. 2010 ($ in millions) Revenue El Salvador Utilities $ 850 $ 753 $ 647 13 % 16 % Africa Utilities 458 386 422 19 % -9 % Europe Utilities 491 418 356 17 % 17 % Corp/Other 10 8 10 25 % -20 % Eliminations 0 % 0 % Total Corporate and Other $ 1,809 $ 1,565 $ 1,435 16 % 9 % Gross Margin El Salvador Utilities $ 57 $ 47 $ 56 21 % -16 % Africa Utilities 47 (59 ) 64 180 % -192 % Europe Utilities 30 23 21 30 % 10 % Corp/Other (16 ) (4 ) 3 -300 % -233 % Eliminations 0 % 0 % Total Corporate and Other $ 118 $ 7 $ 144 NM -95 % 133 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2012 versus 2011 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $42 million, Corporate and Other revenue increased $286 million for 2012, or 18% from 2011 primarily due to: higher pass-through tariffs of $76 million in El Salvador primarily due to increased energy prices driven by higher fuel prices; higher volume and rates at our utility businesses in the Ukraine of $79 million; and the unfavorable impact of a mark-to-market derivative adjustment in 2011 at Sonel in Cameroon of $75 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $3 million, Corporate and Other gross margin increased $114 million for 2012 from 2011. The increase was primarily due to: an increase of $107 million at Sonel primarily due to the unfavorable impact of a mark-to-market derivative adjustment in 2011 of $75 million as discussed above. Fiscal Year 2011 versus 2010 Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $14 million, primarily in Cameroon, Corporate and Other revenue increased $116 million from 2010 or 8%, from 2010. The increase was primarily due to: higher pass-through tariffs of $94 million in El Salvador primarily due to increased energy prices driven by higher fuel prices and drier weather; and higher rates at our utility businesses in the Ukraine of $71 million. These increases were partially offset by: a net decrease of $52 million at Sonel in Cameroon primarily due to the unfavorable impact of an unrealized mark-to-market derivative adjustment, partially offset by higher tariff and volume. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $4 million, primarily in Cameroon, Corporate and Other gross margin decreased $133 million for 2011, or 92%, from 2010. The decrease was primarily due to: a decrease of $119 million at Sonel primarily due to the unfavorable impact of an unrealized mark-to-market derivative adjustment and higher fixed costs; and a decrease of $16 million in the Ukraine primarily due to higher fixed costs. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses includes expenses related to corporate and region staff functions and/or initiatives, executive management, finance, legal, human resources, information systems, and development costs. General and administrative expenses decreased $90 million, or 23%, to $301 million in 2012 from 2011. The decrease was primarily due to reduction in business development and systems administration costs. General and administrative expenses remained flat at $391 million in 2011 and 2010. A reduction of business development costs and SAP implementation costs was offset by DPL transaction costs. 134 Table of Contents Interest expense Interest expense increased $19 million, or 1%, to $1.6 billion in 2012 from 2011. This increase was primarily due to debt at DPL, acquired in November 2011, additional indebtedness at the Parent Company to finance the acquisition of DPL, and less interest capitalization due to the commencement of operations at various projects. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense in Brazil, due to lower short-term interest rates, lower debt principal and favorable foreign currency translation, as well as lower interest expense for Cartagena, which was deconsolidated following the sale of 80% of our interest in the first quarter of 2012 and higher capitalized interest at Gener in 2012. Interest expense increased $104 million, or 7%, to $1.6 billion in 2011 from 2010. This increase was primarily due to less interest capitalization at Maritza due to commencement of operations in June 2011, interest on value-added tax for commercial losses at Eletropaulo, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation in Brazil, higher interest rates at Eletropaulo, and increased debt and fees related to the DPL acquisition. These increases were partially offset by lower interest rates at Tiet , and a fee on a non-exercised credit line that was written off in Brazil in 2010. Interest income Interest income decreased $50 million, or 13%, to $349 million in 2012 from 2011. The decrease was mainly in Brazil, due to a reduction in interest-bearing assets, unfavorable foreign currency translation and lower interest rates, partially offset by inflation adjustments on interest-bearing assets and interest earned on receivables for spot sales in the Dominican Republic. Interest income decreased $8 million, or 2%, to $399 million in 2011 from 2010. This decrease was primarily due to the settlement of a dispute related to inflation adjustments for energy sales at Tiet in 2010. The decrease was partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation in Brazil.

Losses of $159 million in the Philippines were primarily due to unrealized foreign exchange losses on embedded derivatives as a result of the forecasted strengthening of the Philippine Peso, partially offset by gains from the 7% appreciation of the Philippine Peso on U.S. Dollar denominated debt at Masinloc, which had been a Philippine Peso functional currency subsidiary. Losses of $16 million in Brazil were primarily due to a 9% devaluation of the Brazilian Real resulting in losses mainly associated with U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities. Gains of $11 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to increases in the valuation of intercompany notes receivable denominated in foreign currencies, resulting from the strengthening of the Euro and British Pound during the year, partially offset by losses related to foreign currency option purchases. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction losses of $39 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. These losses consisted primarily of losses in Chile, Brazil, and at The AES Corporation, partially offset by gains in Argentina. Losses of $19 million in Chile were primarily due to an 11% devaluation of the Chilean Peso, resulting in losses at Gener (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with net working capital denominated in Chilean Pesos, mainly cash, accounts receivable, tax receivables and a $5 million loss on foreign currency derivatives. Losses of $12 million in Brazil were primarily due to a 13% devaluation of the Brazilian Real resulting in losses mainly associated with U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities. Losses of $10 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to decreases in the valuation of intercompany notes receivable denominated in foreign currencies, resulting from the weakening of the Euro and British Pound during the year, partially offset by gains related to foreign currency option purchases. 136 Table of Contents Gains of $16 million in Argentina were primarily due to an unrealized gain on a foreign currency embedded derivative related to government receivables, partially offset by losses due to the 8% devaluation of the Argentine Peso, resulting in losses at AES Argentina (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction losses of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. These losses consisted primarily of losses at The AES Corporation partially offset by gains in Argentina. Losses of $50 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to the devaluation of intercompany notes receivable resulting from the weakening of the Euro and British Pound, and losses on foreign exchange options, partially offset by gains on third-party debt denominated in British Pounds and gains on foreign cash balances. Gains of $12 million in Argentina were primarily due to an unrealized gain on a foreign currency embedded derivative related to government receivables, partially offset by losses due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso by 5%, resulting in losses at AES Argentina (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Other non-operating expense Other non-operating expense was $50 million, $82 million and $7 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. See Note 9 Other Non-Operating Expense included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information. Income taxes Income tax expense on continuing operations increased $74 million, or 12%, to $708 million in 2012. The Company effective tax rates were 225% for 2012 and 29% for 2011. The net increase in the 2012 effective tax rate was principally due to a nondeductible impairment of goodwill at our U.S. utility, DPL. See Note 10 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for additional information regarding goodwill impairment. Income tax expense on continuing operations increased $41 million, or 7%, to $634 million in 2011. The Company effective tax rates were 29% for 2011 and 31% for 2010. The net decrease in the 2011 effective tax rate was primarily due to a tax benefit related to partial release of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets at one of our Brazilian subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2011 and tax expense recorded in the second quarter of 2010 relating to the CEMIG sale transaction. These items were offset by the impact of impairments recorded in 2011 at certain foreign subsidiaries and the tax benefit related to a reversal of a Chilean withholding tax liability recorded in the third quarter of 2010. See Note 9 Other Non-Operating Expense and Note 21 Asset Impairment Expense for additional information regarding the impairments included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. Net equity in earnings of affiliates Net equity in earnings of affiliates increased $36 million, to $34 million in 2012 from a loss of $2 million in 2011. This increase was primarily due to increased tariff pricing, lower coal prices, and lower depreciation at Yangcheng in China in 2012. Additionally, there were impairment charges at AES Solar in 2011 of which our share was $36 million. This was partially offset by lower net income caused by higher electricity purchase costs at Guacolda. 137 Table of Contents Net equity in earnings of affiliates decreased $186 million, or 101%, to a loss of $2 million in 2011. This decrease was primarily due to the sale of our interest in CEMIG during the second quarter of 2010 which resulted in a significant gain, and $72 million of impairments at AES Solar in 2011, of which our share was $36 million. Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $528 million, or 49%, to $555 million in 2012. This decrease was primarily due to decreased gross margin at Eletropaulo as a result of the tariff reset and higher fixed costs. Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $98 million, or 10%, to $1.1 billion in 2011. This increase was primarily due to the appreciation of the Brazilian Real at our Brazilian businesses and increased gross margin at Gener due to increased volume. This was partially offset by lower prices at Eletropaulo primarily related to the estimated impact of the July 2011 tariff reset and lower gross margin at Sonel mainly due to the unfavorable impact of an unrealized mark-to-market derivative loss. Discontinued operations Total discontinued operations was a net gain of $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, and a net loss of $45 million and $422 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. See Note 23 Discontinued Operations and Held for Sale Businesses included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information. Capital Resources and Liquidity Overview As of December 31, 2012, the Company had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $2.0 billion, of which approximately $0.3 billion was held at the Parent Company and qualified holding companies, and short term investments of $0.7 billion. In addition, we had restricted cash and debt service reserves of $1.3 billion. The Company also had non-recourse and recourse aggregate principal amounts of debt outstanding of $15.4 billion and $6.0 billion, respectively. Of the approximately $2.8 billion of our short-term non-recourse debt, $1.4 billion was presented as current because it is due in the next twelve months and $1.4 billion relates to the debt considered in default. We expect such current maturities will be repaid from net cash provided by operating activities of the subsidiary to which the debt relates or through opportunistic refinancing activity or some combination thereof. Approximately $11 million of our recourse debt matures within the next twelve months, which we expect to repay using cash on hand at the Parent Company or through Parent Company liquidity. See further discussion of Parent Company Liquidity below. We rely mainly on long-term debt obligations to fund our construction activities. We have, to the extent available at acceptable terms, utilized non-recourse debt to fund a significant portion of the capital expenditures and investments required to construct and acquire our electric power plants, distribution companies and related assets. Our non-recourse financing is designed to limit cross default risk to the Parent Company or other subsidiaries and affiliates. Our non-recourse debt is a combination of fixed and variable interest rate instruments. Generally, a portion or all of the variable rate debt is fixed through the use of interest rate swaps. In addition, the debt is typically denominated in the currency that matches the currency of the revenue expected to be generated from the benefiting project, thereby reducing currency risk. In certain cases, the currency is matched through the use of derivative instruments. The majority of our non-recourse debt is funded by international commercial banks, with debt capacity supplemented by multilaterals and local regional banks. Given our long-term debt obligations, the Company is subject to interest rate risk on debt balances that accrue interest at variable rates. When possible, the Company will borrow funds at fixed interest rates or hedge its variable rate debt to fix its interest costs on such obligations. In addition, the Company has historically tried to 138 Table of Contents maintain at least 70% of its consolidated obligations at fixed interest rates, including fixing the interest rate through the use of interest rate swaps. These efforts apply to the notional amount of the swaps compared to the amount of related underlying debt. Presently, the Parent Company only material un-hedged exposure to variable interest rate debt relates to indebtedness under its senior secured credit facility. On a consolidated basis, of the Company $15.4 billion of total non-recourse debt outstanding as of December 31, 2012, approximately $4.3 billion bore interest at variable rates that were not subject to a derivative instrument which fixed the interest rate. In addition to utilizing non-recourse debt at a subsidiary level when available, the Parent Company provides a portion, or in certain instances all, of the remaining long-term financing or credit required to fund development, construction or acquisition of a particular project. These investments have generally taken the form of equity investments or intercompany loans, which are subordinated to the project non-recourse loans. We generally obtain the funds for these investments from our cash flows from operations, proceeds from the sales of assets and/or the proceeds from our issuances of recourse debt, common stock and other securities. Similarly, at certain of our businesses, the Parent Company may provide financial guarantees or other credit support for the benefit of counterparties who have entered into contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity, equipment or other services with our subsidiaries or lenders. In such circumstances, if a business defaults on its payment or supply obligation, the Parent Company will be responsible for the business obligations up to the amount provided for in the relevant guarantee or other credit support. At December 31, 2012, the Parent Company had provided outstanding financial and performance-related guarantees or other credit support commitments to or for the benefit of our businesses, which were limited by the terms of the agreements, of approximately $568 million in aggregate (excluding investment commitments and those collateralized by letters of credit and other obligations discussed below). As a result of the Parent Company below investment grade rating, counterparties may be unwilling to accept our general unsecured commitments to provide credit support. Accordingly, with respect to both new and existing commitments, the Parent Company may be required to provide some other form of assurance, such as a letter of credit, to backstop or replace our credit support. The Parent Company may not be able to provide adequate assurances to such counterparties. To the extent we are required and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such counterparties, this will reduce the amount of credit available to us to meet our other liquidity needs. At December 31, 2012, we had $5 million in letters of credit outstanding, provided under the senior secured credit facility, and $215 million in cash collateralized letters of credit outstanding outside of the senior secured credit facility. These letters of credit operate to guarantee performance relating to certain project development activities and business operations. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company paid letter of credit fees ranging from 0.250% to 3.250% per annum on the outstanding amounts. We expect to continue to seek, where possible, non-recourse debt financing in connection with the assets or businesses that we or our affiliates may develop, construct or acquire. However, depending on local and global market conditions and the unique characteristics of individual businesses, non-recourse debt may not be available on economically attractive terms or at all. See Key Trends and Uncertainties, Global Economic Conditions discussion. If we decide not to provide any additional funding or credit support to a subsidiary project that is under construction or has near-term debt payment obligations and that subsidiary is unable to obtain additional non-recourse debt, such subsidiary may become insolvent, and we may lose our investment in that subsidiary. Additionally, if any of our subsidiaries lose a significant customer, the subsidiary may need to withdraw from a project or restructure the non-recourse debt financing. If we or the subsidiary choose not to proceed with a project or are unable to successfully complete a restructuring of the non-recourse debt, we may lose our investment in that subsidiary. Many of our subsidiaries depend on timely and continued access to capital markets to manage their liquidity needs. The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, to refinance existing indebtedness or to fund operations and other commitments during times of political or economic uncertainty may have material adverse effects on 139 Table of Contents the financial condition and results of operations of those subsidiaries. In addition, changes in the timing of tariff increases or delays in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions could affect the cash flows and results of operations of our businesses. As of December 31, 2012, the Company had approximately $359 million and $24 million of trade accounts receivable related to certain of its generation and utility businesses in Latin America classified as other noncurrent assets and current trade accounts receivable, respectively. The noncurrent portion primarily consists of trade accounts receivable that, pursuant to amended agreements or government resolutions, have collection periods that extend beyond December 31, 2013, or one year past the latest balance sheet date. The Company believes such amounts are collectable based on collection history and performance under agreements. For example, since 2004, our subsidiaries in Argentina have entered into three agreements with the Argentine government called Fondos de inversion Mercado Electrico Mayorista ( Foninvemem Agreements ), in which our subsidiaries contributed a portion of their accounts receivable into a fund used to finance the construction of combined cycle and gas-fired plants. Our subsidiaries in Argentina have been collecting the accounts receivable from the combined cycle plants constructed under the first two Foninvemem Agreements since 2010 while the accounts receivable related to the third Foninvemem Agreement are not currently due as commercial operations of the related combined cycle and gas-fired plant are scheduled to begin in 2015. Additionally, our subsidiaries in Argentina have recently reached an agreement with the Argentine government to include certain outstanding receivables covered under government resolutions into the third Foninvemem Agreement. In August 2012, the Argentine government announced its intention of developing a new energy model that would apply to all energy sectors: generation, transmission and distribution companies. The new model is expected to provide enough recovery of costs incurred by the sectors as well as provide for a return on invested capital. To ensure timely collection across the energy sectors of new receivables as they arise, future tariff increases will be needed. No formal communication has been made by the Argentine government as to the timing and implementation of this new model. As of December 31, 2012, the Company had approximately $316 million of trade accounts receivable related to the Foninvemem Agreements and government resolutions classified as other noncurrent assets. See Item 1. Business included in this Form 10-K for further information on these agreements. Capital Expenditures The Company spent $2.3 billion, $2.5 billion and $2.3 billion on capital expenditures in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. A majority of these costs were funded with non-recourse debt consistent with our financial strategy. At December 31, 2012, the Company had a total of $1.2 billion of availability under long-term non-recourse construction credit facilities. We have taken steps to decrease the amount of new discretionary capital spending. We expect to continue funding projects that are currently in the construction phase using existing capital provided by these non-recourse credit facilities as supplemented by internally generated cash flows, Parent Company liquidity, contribution from existing or new partners and other funding sources. As a result, property, plant and equipment and long-term non-recourse debt are expected to increase over the next few years even though the rate of discretionary spending has decreased. While we believe we have the resources to continue funding the projects in construction, there can be no assurances that we will continue to fund all these existing construction efforts. As of December 31, 2012, the Company had $3 million of commitments to invest in subsidiaries under construction and to purchase related equipment that were not included in the letters of credit discussed above. The Company expects to fund these net investment commitments in 2013. The exact payment schedules will be dictated by the construction milestones. We expect to fund these commitments from a combination of current liquidity and internally generated Parent Company cash flow. Environmental Capital Expenditures The Company continues to assess the possible need for capital expenditures associated with international, federal, regional and state regulation of GHG emissions from electric power generation facilities. Currently in the 140 Table of Contents United States there is no Federal legislation establishing mandatory GHG emissions reduction programs (including CO 2 ) affecting the electric power generating facilities of the Company subsidiaries. There are numerous state programs regulating GHG emissions from electric power generation facilities and there is a possibility that federal GHG legislation will be enacted within the next several years. Further, the EPA has adopted regulations pertaining to GHG emissions and has proposed new regulations for electric generating units under Section 111 of the CAA. The EPA regulations and any subsequent Federal legislation, if enacted, may place significant costs on GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric power generation facilities, particularly coal-fired facilities, and in order to comply, CO 2 emitting facilities may be required to purchase additional GHG emissions allowances or offsets under cap-and-trade programs, pay a carbon tax or install new emission reduction equipment to capture or reduce the amount of GHG emitted from the facilities, in the event that reliable technology to do so is developed. The capital expenditures required to comply with any future GHG legislation or any GHG regulations could be significant and unless such costs can be passed on to customers or counterparties, such regulations could impair the profitability of some of the electric power generation facilities operated by our subsidiaries or render certain of them uneconomical to operate, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. With respect to our operations outside the United States, certain of the businesses operated by the Company subsidiaries are subject to compliance with EU ETS and the Kyoto Protocol in certain countries and other country-specific programs to regulate GHG emissions. To date, compliance with the Kyoto Protocol and EU ETS has not had a material adverse effect on the Company consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows because of, among other factors, the cost of GHG emission allowances and/or the ability of our businesses to pass the cost of purchasing such allowances on to customers or counterparties. However, in the event that such counterparties or regulatory authorities challenge our ability to pass these costs on, there can be no assurance that the Company and/or the relevant subsidiary would prevail in any such dispute. Furthermore, even if the Company and/or the relevant subsidiary does prevail, it would be subject to the cost and administrative burden associated with such dispute. In 2012, the Company subsidiaries operated businesses which had total approximate CO 2 emissions of 78.9 million metric tons of which approximately 39.9 million metric tons were emitted in the U.S. (both figures ownership adjusted). Approximately 1.4 million metric tons were emitted by our Warrior Run business, our only business located in a state participating in the RGGI. We believe that legislative or regulatory actions, if enacted, may require a material increase in capital expenditures at our subsidiaries. In the future the actual impact on our subsidiaries capital expenditures from any potential federal program to regulate and reduce GHG emissions, if enacted, and the state and regional programs developed or in the process of development, or any EPA regulation of GHG emissions, will depend on a number of factors, including among others, the GHG reductions required under any such legislation or regulations, the cost of emissions reduction equipment, the price and availability of offsets, the extent to which our subsidiaries would be entitled to receive GHG emission allowances without having to purchase them, the quantity of allowances which our subsidiaries would have to purchase, the price of allowances, and our subsidiaries ability to recover or pass-through costs incurred to comply with any legislative or regulatory requirements that are ultimately imposed and the use of market-based compliance options such as cap-and-trade programs. Consolidated Cash Flows At December 31, 2012, cash and cash equivalents increased $275 million from December 31, 2011 to $2.0 billion. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was due to $2.9 billion of cash provided by operating activities, $1.0 billion of cash used in investing activities, $1.74 billion of cash used in financing activities, a favorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash of $5 million and a $131 million decrease in cash of discontinued and held-for-sale businesses. 141 Table of Contents At December 31, 2011, cash and cash equivalents decreased $811 million from December 31, 2010 to $1.7 billion. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was due to $2.9 billion of cash provided by operating activities, $4.9 billion of cash used for investing activities, $1.41 billion of cash provided by financing activities, an unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash of $122 million and a $79 million increase in cash of discontinued and held-for-sale businesses. $ Change 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 (in millions) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 2,901 $ 2,884 $ 3,465 $ 17 $ (581 ) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (1,023 ) (4,906 ) (2,040 ) 3,883 (2,866 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (1,739 ) 1,412 (706 ) (3,151 ) 2,118 Operating Activities Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2012 resulted primarily from the net loss adjusted for non-cash items, principally gains and losses on sales and disposals and impairment charges, depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes, partially offset by a net use of cash for operating activities of $68 million in operating assets and liabilities. Other assets increased $589 million primarily due to an increase in noncurrent regulatory assets at Eletropaulo, resulting from higher priced energy purchases, regulatory charges and transmission costs which are recoverable through future tariff and the establishment of a noncurrent note receivable at Cartagena in Spain following the arbitration settlement, prior to its deconsolidation. Accounts receivable increased $241 million primarily due to lower collections at Eletropaulo and Andres as well as an increase in revenue at Sul and Kelanitissa. Net income tax payables decreased $47 million primarily from payments of income taxes exceeding accruals for new current tax liabilities. These uses of operating cash flows were offset by an increase of $335 million in other liabilities primarily due to an increase in noncurrent regulatory liabilities at Eletropaulo related to the tariff reset. Accounts payable and other current liabilities increased $330 million primarily due to an increase in current regulatory liabilities at Eletropaulo driven by the tariff reset, offset by a decrease in other current liabilities arising from value added tax payments. Prepaid expenses and other current assets provided $120 million primarily due to the recovery of value added taxes at our construction projects in Chile. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. Operating cash flow resulted primarily from net income adjusted for non-cash items, principally depreciation and amortization, contingencies, deferred income taxes, losses on the extinguishment of debt, gains and losses on sales and disposals and impairment charges as well as a net favorable change of $52 million in operating assets and liabilities. Other liabilities increased $351 million primarily due to an increase in noncurrent regulatory liabilities at Eletropaulo and Sul as the result of lower prices paid for energy purchases compared with the charges recovered through the tariff. Accounts payable and other current liabilities increased $322 million primarily driven by an increase in current regulatory liabilities at Eletropaulo driven by the tariff reset, partially offset by the amount returned to consumers for regulatory liabilities and VAT on commercial losses reversal, as well as an increase in accrued interest on recourse debt at the Parent Company. Income tax payables, net increased $166 million primarily due to accruals for new current tax liabilities offset by payments of income taxes. These favorable changes were partially offset by increases of $403 million in other assets, $236 million in accounts receivable and $141 million in inventory. The increase in other assets was mainly explained by an increase in noncurrent regulatory assets at Eletropaulo, resulting from higher priced energy purchases, transmission costs and regulatory charges compared with charges recovered through the tariff. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in amounts billed at several businesses including Eletropaulo and new plants at Maritza and Angamos. The increase in inventory was primarily driven by higher coal purchases at Gener as well as increased inventory at Angamos as it started operations in 2011. Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. Operating cash flow resulted primarily from net income adjusted for non-cash items, principally depreciation and 142 Table of Contents amortization, contingencies, deferred income taxes, gains and losses on sales and disposals and impairment charges, an undistributed gain from the sale of an equity method investment, as well as a net favorable change of $608 million in operating assets and liabilities. Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased $385 million primarily due to a decrease in current regulatory assets, for the recovery of prior period tariff cycle energy purchases and regulatory charges at Eletropaulo and Sul. Other liabilities increased $257 million primarily driven by an increase in noncurrent regulatory liabilities at Eletropaulo as the result of lower prices paid for energy purchases and transmission costs compared with charges recovered through the tariff. Income tax payables, net increased $166 million primarily due to accruals for new current tax liabilities offset by payments of income taxes. Accounts payable and other current liabilities increased $136 million primarily driven by higher energy purchases at Gener, Eletropaulo and Sul, partially offset by a decrease in the current regulatory liability at Eletropaulo as a result of refunds to consumers of prior period costs through the tariff. These favorable changes were partially offset by an increase of $248 million in other assets and an increase of $98 million in accounts receivable. The increase in other assets was mainly an increase in noncurrent regulatory assets at Eletropaulo as a result of higher priced energy purchases, and regulatory charges compared with charges recovered through the tariff. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in revenue in Alicura and Gener and lower collections at Sonel and Lal Pir. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $17 million, or 1%, to $2.9 billion during 2012 compared to 2011, mainly due to the following: US an increase of $320 million at our utility businesses primarily due to the operations, net of debt service costs, of DPL which was acquired in November 2011; Andes an increase of $57 million driven by cash provided by the operating activities of the new plant at Angamos, recovery of value added tax at Campiche and reduced working capital requirements at Gener, partially offset by reduced gross margin from Gener operations other than Angamos; Brazil a decrease of $503 million at our utility businesses primarily driven by higher priced energy purchases, regulatory charges and transmission costs payments, higher operating and maintenance expenses and lower accounts receivable collections due to the lower tariff starting in July 2012 at Eletropaulo, partially offset by a lower payment of income taxes; MCAC an increase of $25 million at our generation businesses primarily due to the operations of the Esti plant being back on line from June 2012 and higher volumes of PPA sales at Panama and lower coal volume and price in 2012 at Itabo, partially offset by lower collections and lower sales in the Dominican Republic and higher taxes paid at Panama; EMEA an increase of $42 million driven primarily by cash provided by the operating activities of the new plant at Maritza partially offset by a loss in revenue from a generator failure at Ballylumford in Northern Ireland; and Asia an increase of $88 million driven primarily by Masinloc in the Philippines due to higher demand and reduced working capital requirements. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $581 million, or 17%, to $2.9 billion in 2011 compared with $3.5 billion in 2010. This net decrease was primarily due to the following: US a decrease of $131 million at our generation businesses primarily due to reduced operations in New York prior to its deconsolidation in December 2011, partially offset by the deconsolidation of Thames in 2011; Brazil a decrease of $352 million at our utility businesses primarily driven by higher income tax payments of which $84 million was due to the sale of Brazil Telecom in October 2011, for which the pre-tax net sales proceeds of $890 million are recorded in cash flows from investing activities, and a one-time cash savings of $107 million mainly related to the utilization of a tax credit received as a 143 Table of Contents result of the REFIS program in 2010, lower accounts receivable collections at Eletropaulo and higher payments for energy purchases, operation and maintenance expenses and pension contributions. These impacts were partially offset by higher accounts receivable collections at Sul; Asia a decrease of $56 million at Masinloc, due to lower gross margin. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities decreased $3.9 billion to $1.0 billion in 2012 compared to 2011. This decrease was largely attributable to the following: a decrease of $3.5 billion from acquisitions, net of cash acquired, primarily due to the acquisitions of DPL for $3.4 billion in November 2011 and our equity investment in Entek in February 2011 for $150 million; an increase of $315 million in sale of short-term investments, net of purchases, primarily due to an increase of $364 million at our Brazilian subsidiaries mostly due to the prepayment of debentures and working capital demands offset by a decrease of $37 million at Gener; a decrease of $312 million in debt service reserves and other assets primarily due to decreases of $222 million at the Parent Company related to the collateralization of a letter of credit for the Mong Duong project in 2011, $47 million at Sonel related to the repayment of loans in 2012 and $44 million due to the repayment of funds for construction at Changuinola; a decrease of $194 million in capital expenditures primarily due to decreases of $97 million at our wind projects, $89 at Angamos, $75 million at IPL, $73 million at Kribi, $64 million at our Brazilian subsidiaries, $57 million at Changuinola, $38 million at Maritza, $29 million at Sonel and $21 million at Saurashtra, in India. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $166 million at DPL, $70 million at our Mong Duong project, $49 million at Gener and $34 million at Esti; and an increase of $114 million in proceeds from government grants for asset construction for certain domestic wind projects including Laurel Mountain and Mountain View 4; partially offset by: a decrease of $288 million in proceeds from the sale of businesses, net of cash sold, primarily due to $890 million in net cash received for the Telecom sale in October 2011 within Brazil Utilities. These decreases were partially offset by proceeds of $228 million for the sale of Red Oak and Ironwood within US Generation, $10 million from the dissolution of the joint venture in Turkey with IC Ictas Energy Group and $164 million from the subsequent sale of three wholly-owned hydropower plants previously owned by the IC Ictas joint venture to our Entek joint venture in which we hold a 50% interest as well as $63 million from the sale of 80% of our interest in Cartagena within EMEA Generation and $122 million for the sale of Cili and several equity method investments in China within Asia Generation; and a decrease of $199 million in proceeds from a performance bond received at Maritza to compensate for construction delays in 2011. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities increased $3.2 billion to $1.74 billion in 2012 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1.41 billion in 2011. This net increase was primarily attributable to the following: a $3.9 billion decrease in proceeds from issuances of recourse and non-recourse debt including decreases of $3.3 billion at the Parent Company to partially fund the acquisition of DPL in 2011, $635 million at IPL mostly used to refinance debt in 2011 and $466 million at Gener used to refinance debt and fund the construction of Angamos in 2011, offset by an increase of $686 million at our Brazilian subsidiaries mostly related to the issuance of debentures; and 144 Table of Contents a $758 million decrease of net borrowings under revolving credit facilities primarily related to $590 million at the Parent Company due to a $295 million payment in 2012 for the amount borrowed in 2011 as well as decreases of $69 million at AES Argentina due to a $35 million payment in 2012 for the amount borrowed in 2011 and $67 million at Changuinola; partially offset by: a $1.1 billion decrease in repayments of recourse and non-recourse debt, including decreases of $559 million at IPL, $271 million at Gener, $241 million at the Parent Company and $100 million at Sonel, offset by an increase of $181 million at Kribi; and a $193 million decrease in distributions to non-controlling interests, primarily due to decreases at our Brazilian subsidiaries as a result of lower net income; a $162 million decrease in payments for financing fees, attributable to decreases of $74 million at the Parent Company, $39 million at our Mong Duong project in Vietnam and $28 million at Gener. Contractual Obligations A summary of our contractual obligations, commitments and other liabilities as of December 31, 2012 is presented in the table below, which excludes any businesses classified as discontinued operations or held-for-sale (in millions): Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years 5 years and more Other Footnote Reference (5) Debt Obligations (1) $ 21,293 $ 2,844 $ 3,185 $ 5,098 $ 10,166 $ 12 Interest Payments on Long-Term Debt (2) 8,825 1,323 2,403 1,860 3,239 n/a Capital Lease Obligations (3) 217 12 23 22 160 13 Operating Lease Obligations (3) 763 53 99 94 517 13 Electricity Obligations (3) 38,882 2,599 5,960 5,322 25,001 13 Fuel Obligations (3) 8,570 1,555 1,553 844 4,618 13 Other Purchase Obligations (3) 18,796 1,976 3,372 2,295 11,153 13 Other Long-Term Liabilities Reflected on AES Consolidated Balance Sheet under GAAP (4) 854 1 260 64 356 173 n/a Total $ 98,200 $ 10,363 $ 16,855 $ 15,599 $ 55,210 $ 173 (1) Includes recourse and non-recourse debt presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 12 Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K which provides additional disclosure regarding these obligations. These amounts exclude capital lease obligations which are included in the capital lease category, see (3) below. (2) Interest payments are estimated based on final maturity dates of debt securities outstanding at December 31, 2012 and do not reflect anticipated future refinancing, early redemptions or new debt issuances. Variable rate interest obligations are estimated based on rates as of December 31, 2012. (3) See Note 13 Commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information. ( 4 ) These amounts do not include current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet except for the current portion of uncertain tax obligations. Noncurrent uncertain tax obligations are reflected in the Other column of the table above as the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the future payments. In addition, the amounts do not include: (1) regulatory liabilities (See Note 11 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities ), (2) contingencies (See Note 14 Contingencies ), (3) pension and other post retirement employee benefit liabilities (see Note 15 Benefit Plans ) or (4) any taxes (See Note 22 Income Taxes ) except for uncertain tax obligations, as the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future payments. See the indicated notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this 145 Table of Contents Form 10-K for additional information on the items excluded. Derivatives (See Note 6 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ) and incentive compensation are excluded as the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or amount of the future payments. ( 5 ) For further information see the note referenced below in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . Parent Company Liquidity The following discussion of Parent Company Liquidity has been included because we believe it is a useful measure of the liquidity available to The AES Corporation, or the Parent Company, given the non-recourse nature of most of our indebtedness. Parent Company liquidity as outlined below is a non-GAAP measure and should not be construed as an alternative to cash and cash equivalents which are determined in accordance with GAAP, as a measure of liquidity. Cash and cash equivalents are disclosed in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and the Parent Only Unconsolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Schedule I of this Form 10-K. Parent Company liquidity may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. The principal sources of liquidity at the Parent Company level are: dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries, including refinancing proceeds; proceeds from debt and equity financings at the Parent Company level, including availability under our credit facilities; and proceeds from asset sales. Cash requirements at the Parent Company level are primarily to fund: interest; principal repayments of debt; acquisitions; construction commitments; other equity commitments; equity repurchases; taxes; Parent Company overhead and development costs; and dividends on our common stock. 146 Table of Contents The Company defines Parent Company Liquidity as cash available to the Parent Company plus available borrowings under existing credit facilities. The cash held at qualified holding companies represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the Company domiciled outside of the U.S. Such subsidiaries have no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to the Parent Company. Parent Company Liquidity is reconciled to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 as follows: Parent Company Liquidity 2012 2011 (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,970 $ 1,695 Less: Cash and cash equivalents at subsidiaries (1,659 ) (1,495 ) Parent and qualified holding companies cash and cash equivalents 311 200 Commitments under Parent credit facilities 800 800 Less: Letters of credit under the credit facilities (5 ) (12 ) Less: Borrowings under the credit facilities (295 ) Borrowings available under Parent credit facilities 795 493 Total Parent Company Liquidity $ 1,106 $ 693 Recourse Debt: Our recourse debt at year-end was approximately $6.0 billion and $6.5 billion in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The following table sets forth our Parent Company contingent contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012: Contingent contractual obligations Amount Number of Agreements Maximum Exposure Range for Each Agreement (in millions) (in millions) Guarantees $ 568 19 <$1 -$237 Cash collateralized letters of credit 215 9 <$1 -$189 Letters of credit under the senior secured credit facility 5 6 <$1 -$2 Total $ 788 34 As of December 31, 2012, the Company had $3 million of commitments to invest in subsidiaries under construction and to purchase related equipment that were not included in the letters of credit discussed above. The Company expects to fund these net investment commitments in 2013. The exact payment schedules will be dictated by the construction milestones. We expect to fund these commitments from a combination of current liquidity and internally generated Parent Company cash flow. We have a diverse portfolio of performance-related contingent contractual obligations. These obligations are designed to cover potential risks and only require payment if certain targets are not met or certain contingencies occur. The risks associated with these obligations include change of control, construction cost overruns, subsidiary default, political risk, tax indemnities, spot market power prices, sponsor support and liquidated damages under power sales agreements for projects in development, in operation and under construction. In addition, we have an assets sale program through which we may have customary indemnity obligations under certain assets sale agreements. While we do not expect that we will be required to fund any material amounts under these contingent contractual obligations beyond 2012, many of the events which would give rise to such obligations are beyond our control. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to fund our obligations under these contingent contractual obligations if we are required to make substantial payments thereunder. 147 Table of Contents The Company paid a dividend of 4 cents per share to its common stockholders during the fourth quarter of 2012. While we intend to continue payment of dividends and believe we will have sufficient liquidity to do so, we can provide no assurance we will be able to continue payment of dividends. While we believe that our sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future, this belief is based on a number of material assumptions, including, without limitation, assumptions about our ability to access the capital markets (see Key Trends and Uncertainties, Global Economic Conditions ), the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries, currency exchange rates, power market pool prices, and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. In addition, our subsidiaries ability to declare and pay cash dividends to us (at the Parent Company level) is subject to certain limitations contained in loans, governmental provisions and other agreements. We can provide no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that the actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated. See Item 1A. Risk Factors , The AES Corporation is a holding company and its ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness, including its public debt securities, is dependent upon the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries by way of dividends, fees, interest, loans or otherwise . of this Form 10-K. Various debt instruments at the Parent Company level, including our senior secured credit facility, contain certain restrictive covenants. The covenants provide for, among other items: limitations on other indebtedness, liens, investments and guarantees; limitations on dividends, stock repurchases and other equity transactions; restrictions and limitations on mergers and acquisitions, sales of assets, leases, transactions with affiliates and off-balance sheet and derivative arrangements; maintenance of certain financial ratios; and financial and other reporting requirements. As of December 31, 2012, we were in compliance with these covenants at the Parent Company level. Non-Recourse Debt: While the lenders under our non-recourse debt financings generally do not have direct recourse to the Parent Company, defaults thereunder can still have important consequences for our results of operations and liquidity, including, without limitation: reducing our cash flows as the subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to the Parent Company during the time period of any default; triggering our obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support we have provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary; causing us to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets; and triggering defaults in our outstanding debt at the Parent Company. For example, our senior secured credit facilities and outstanding debt securities at the Parent Company include events of default for certain bankruptcy related events involving material subsidiaries. In addition, our revolving credit agreement at the Parent Company includes events of default related to payment defaults and accelerations of outstanding debt of material subsidiaries. Some of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. The total non-recourse debt classified as current in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets amounts to $2.8 billion. The portion of current debt related to such defaults was $1.4 billion at December 31, 2012, all of which was non-recourse debt related to four subsidiaries Maritza, Sonel, Kavarna and Saurashtra. 148 Table of Contents None of the subsidiaries that are currently in default are subsidiaries that met the applicable definition of materiality under AES corporate debt agreements as of December 31, 2012 in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under such indebtedness. However, as a result of additional dispositions of assets, other significant reductions in asset carrying values or other matters in the future that may impact our financial position and results of operations or the financial position of the individual subsidiary, it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries could fall within the definition of a material subsidiary and thereby upon an acceleration trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under the AES Parent Company outstanding debt securities. Critical Accounting Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements of AES are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. AES significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. An accounting estimate is considered critical if: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could materially differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee, as appropriate. Listed below are the Company most significant critical accounting estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our worldwide income tax provision requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are under examination by relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. The Company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each tax jurisdiction when determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes. Accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold. Tax reserves have been established, which the Company believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. While the Company believes that the amounts of the tax estimates are reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may be materially different than the reserve amounts. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of the existing assets and liabilities, and their respective income tax bases. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company provision for income taxes could be adversely impacted by changes to the U.S. taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. Since 2006, the Company has benefitted from the Controlled Foreign 149 Table of Contents Corporation look-through rule, originally enacted for the 2006 through 2009 tax years in the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act ( TIPRA ) of 2005 and retroactively reinstated for the 2010 and 2011 tax years via the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. This provision provides an exception from current U.S. taxation of certain un-repatriated cross-border payments of subsidiary dividends, interest, rents, and royalties. In determining the Company effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company has included the benefits of this provision. On January 3, 2013, the Controlled Foreign Corporation look-through rule was retroactively reinstated to January 1, 2012 for a period of two years through the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. In determining the Company effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company has excluded the benefits of this provision; however it expects to record the benefit of the retroactive reinstatement of the provision for 2012 in the first quarter of 2013. There can be no assurance that this provision will continue to be extended beyond this two year period. Accordingly, if this provision is not renewed, our expected effective tax rate could increase by amounts that may be material. Impairments Our accounting policies on goodwill and long-lived assets are described in detail in Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The Company makes considerable judgments in its impairment evaluations of goodwill and long-lived assets; however, the fair value determination is typically the most judgmental part in an impairment evaluation. The Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit or a long-lived asset (asset group) by applying the approaches prescribed under the fair value measurement accounting framework. Generally, the market approach and income approach are most relevant in the fair value measurement of our reporting units and long-lived assets; however, due to the lack of available relevant observable market information in many circumstances, the Company often relies on the income approach. The Company may engage an independent valuation firm to assist management with the valuation. The decision to engage an independent valuation firm considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including a cost/benefit analysis and the Company internal valuation knowledge of the long-lived asset (asset group) or business. The Company develops the underlying assumptions consistent with its internal budgets and forecasts for such valuations. Additionally, the Company uses an internal discounted cash flow valuation model (the DCF model ), based on the principles of present value techniques, to estimate the fair value of its reporting units or long-lived assets under the income approach. The DCF model estimates fair value by discounting our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts, adjusted to reflect market participant assumptions, to the extent necessary, at an appropriate discount rate. Management applies considerable judgment in selecting several input assumptions during the development of our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts. Examples of the input assumptions that our budgets and forecasts are sensitive to include macroeconomic factors such as growth rates, industry demand, inflation, exchange rates, power prices and commodity prices. Whenever appropriate, management obtains these input assumptions from observable market data sources (e.g., Economic Intelligence Unit) and extrapolates the market information if an input assumption is not observable for the entire forecast period. Many of these input assumptions are dependent on other economic assumptions, which are often derived from statistical economic models with inherent limitations such as estimation differences. Further, several input assumptions are based on historical trends which often do not recur. The input assumptions most significant to our budgets and cash flows are based on expectations of macroeconomic factors which have been volatile recently. It is not uncommon that different market data sources have different views of the macroeconomic factors expectations and related assumptions. As a result, macroeconomic factors and related assumptions are often available in a narrow range; however, in some situations these ranges become wide and the use of a different set of input assumptions could produce significantly different budgets and cash flow forecasts. A considerable amount of judgment is also applied in the estimation of the discount rate used in the DCF model. To the extent practical, inputs to the discount rate are obtained from market data sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Capital IQ, etc.). The Company selects and uses a set of publicly traded companies from the relevant 150 Table of Contents industry to estimate the discount rate inputs. Management applies judgment in the selection of such companies based on its view of the most likely market participants. It is reasonably possible that the selection of a different set of likely market participants could produce different input assumptions and result in the use of a different discount rate. Fair value of a reporting unit or a long-lived asset (asset group) is sensitive to both input assumptions to our budgets and cash flow forecasts and the discount rate. Further, estimates of long-term growth and terminal value are often critical to the fair value determination. As part of the impairment evaluation process, management analyzes the sensitivity of fair value to various underlying assumptions. The level of scrutiny increases as the gap between fair value and carrying amount decreases. Changes in any of these assumptions could result in management reaching a different conclusion regarding the potential impairment, which could be material. Our impairment evaluations inherently involve uncertainties from uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions. Further discussion of the impairment charges recognized by the Company can be found within Note 10 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Note 21 Asset Impairment Expense and Note 9 Other Non-Operating Expense to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Fair Value Fair Value Hierarchy The Company uses valuation techniques and methodologies that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices are not available, valuation models are applied to estimate the fair value using the available observable inputs. The valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity. To increase consistency and enhance disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments, the fair value measurement standard includes a fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into three categories. An asset or liability level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement, where Level 1 is the highest and Level 3 is the lowest. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy, see Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. Fair Value of Financial Instruments A significant number of the Company financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period. The Company makes estimates regarding the valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities include short and long-term investments in debt and equity securities, included in the balance sheet line items Short-term investments and Other assets (Noncurrent) , derivative assets, included in Other current assets and Other assets (Noncurrent) and derivative liabilities, included in Accrued and other liabilities (current) and Other long-term liabilities . Investments are generally fair valued based on quoted market prices or other observable market data such as interest rate indices. The Company investments are primarily certificates of deposit, government debt securities and money market funds. Derivatives are valued using observable data as inputs into internal valuation models. The Company derivatives primarily consist of interest rate swaps, foreign currency instruments, and commodity and embedded derivatives. Additional discussion regarding the nature of these financial instruments and valuation techniques can be found in Note 4 Fair Value included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. 151 Table of Contents Fair Value of Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities Significant estimates are made in determining the fair value of long-lived tangible and intangible assets (i.e., property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill) during the impairment evaluation process. In addition, the majority of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are required to be recognized at fair value under the relevant accounting guidance. In determining the fair value of these items, management makes several assumptions discussed in the Impairments section. Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities We enter into various derivative transactions in order to hedge our exposure to certain market risks. We primarily use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate, commodity and foreign currency exposures. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value except where derivatives qualify and are designated as normal purchase/normal sale transactions. Changes in fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met. Income and expense related to derivative instruments are recognized in the same category as that generated by the underlying asset or liability. See Note 6 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information on the classification. The accounting standards for derivatives and hedging enable companies to designate qualifying derivatives as hedging instruments based on the exposure being hedged. These hedge designations include fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge, are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of the exposure being hedged. The Company has no fair value hedges at this time. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated as and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized into earnings as the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings immediately. For all hedge contracts, the Company provides formal documentation of the hedge and effectiveness testing in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. The fair value measurement accounting standard provides additional guidance on the definition of fair value and defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or exit price. The fair value measurement standard requires the Company to consider and reflect the assumptions of market participants in the fair value calculation. These factors include nonperformance risk (the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled) and credit risk, both of the reporting entity (for liabilities) and of the counterparty (for assets). Due to the nature of the Company interest rate swaps, which are typically associated with non-recourse debt, credit risk for AES is evaluated at the subsidiary level rather than at the Parent Company level. Nonperformance risk on the Company derivative instruments is an adjustment to the initial asset/liability fair value position that is derived from internally developed valuation models that utilize observable market inputs. As a result of uncertainty, complexity and judgment, accounting estimates related to derivative accounting could result in material changes to our financial statements under different conditions or utilizing different assumptions. As a part of accounting for these derivatives, we make estimates concerning nonperformance, volatilities, market liquidity, future commodity prices, interest rates, credit ratings (both ours and our counterparty s) and exchange rates. The fair value of our derivative portfolio is generally determined using internal valuation models, most of which are based on observable market inputs including interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. The Company derives most of its financial instrument market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters and Platt s). In some cases, where market data is not 152 Table of Contents readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to derive market assumptions to determine a financial instrument fair value. In certain instances, the published curve may not extend through the remaining term of the contract and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve. Additionally, in the absence of quoted prices, we may rely on indicative pricing quotes from financial institutions to input into our valuation model for certain of our foreign currency swaps. These indicative pricing quotes do not constitute either a bid or ask price and therefore are not considered observable market data. For individual contracts, the use of different valuation models or assumptions could have a material effect on the calculated fair value. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities Management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes, recent rate orders applicable to other regulated entities and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, any asset write-offs would be required to be recognized in operating income. New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted The Company adopted the new accounting standard on comprehensive income, which became effective January 1, 2012. In addition, the Company early adopted the new accounting standard on the impairment testing of intangible assets. The adoption of these new accounting pronouncements did not have a material impact on the Company financial position or results of operations. See Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information. 153 Table of Contents
