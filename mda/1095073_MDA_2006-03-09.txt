ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION The following is a discussion of the results of operations and financial condition of the Company. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes thereto presented under ITEM 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . RESTRUCTURING On February 24, 2000, a corporate restructuring was completed and Group became the new parent holding company of Holdings, which remains the holding company for Group U.S. operations. Effective January 1, 2005 the principal executive offices of Group were relocated from Barbados to Bermuda. INDUSTRY CONDITIONS The worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive, yet cyclical by product and market. Competition in the types of reinsurance and insurance business that the Company underwrites is based on many factors, including the perceived overall financial strength of the reinsurer or insurer, ratings of the reinsurer or insurer by A.M. Best and/or S&P, underwriting expertise, the jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized, capacity and coverages offered, premiums charged, other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and insurance business offered, services offered, speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in lines written. These factors operate at the individual market participant level to varying degrees, as applicable to the specific participant circumstances. They also operate in aggregate across the reinsurance industry more generally, contributing, in combination with background economic conditions and variations in the reinsurance buying practices of insurance companies (by participant and in the aggregate), to cyclical movements in reinsurance rates, terms and conditions and ultimately reinsurance industry aggregate financial results. The Company competes in the U.S., Bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous global competitors. The Company competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies, subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies, reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international underwriting operations, including underwriting syndicates at Lloyd s. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources than the Company and have established long-term and continuing business relationships throughout the industry, which can be a significant competitive advantage. In addition, the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business and the potential for securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets provide additional sources of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition. In 2004 and 2005, market conditions weakened following hard market conditions that had developed from 2000 through 2003. Pricing for most property and casualty classes declined modestly. Competition increased modestly as well, in part due to the relative profitability achieved by many reinsurers from 2002 through 2004, the attendant buildup of capital by these participants and growing pressures to effectively redeploy this capital. However, this profitability and capital buildup varied significantly by market participant, reflecting the fact that the industry was impacted by significant catastrophe losses in the second half of 2004, generally weak investment market conditions and ongoing adverse loss development. All of these factors depressed the industry aggregate financial performance and perceptions of individual insurer financial strength during the period. For the insurance industry, 2005 was a year of unprecedented catastrophe losses in terms of both frequency and severity, which negatively impacted the financial results of a broad number of (re)insurance market participants. The Company believes that the scope and scale of industry losses have helped to stabilize the weakening that was taking place in many sectors and will lead to generally improving market conditions during 2006 that are likely to vary by product and market. For the property catastrophe and retrocession lines, the Company expects 48 that demand and pricing will increase the most as companies reassess their risk management approach and rating agencies raise the required capital levels for many industry participants. The Company believes that price increases for these two lines will be most pronounced in peak catastrophe zones, such as the southeastern U.S. For remaining property lines, there will likely be modest rate increases, while the casualty markets have generally steadied and are expected to stabilize at adequate pricing levels in 2006 for both insurance and reinsurance. The Company notes that it continues to see opportunities for profitable writings in a variety of classes and lines owing mainly to the general adequacy of underlying pricing. However, the Company continues to examine its view of price adequacy for property lines in light of 2005 unprecedented catastrophe experience from both a frequency and severity perspective. This reexamination is focused on several key factors including the magnitude and character of catastrophe exposures, the level of required capital to support the Company businesses from both the Company and rating agencies perspectives and the actual and potential volatility and variability of results, by product, business class and business unit, including with respect to the reliability of underlying statistical and modeling techniques. 49 FINANCIAL SUMMARY The Company management monitors and evaluates overall Company performance based upon financial results. The following table displays a summary of the consolidated net (loss) income, ratios and shareholders equity for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2005 2004 2003 Gross written premiums $ 4,108,562 $ 4,704,135 $ 4,573,802 Net written premiums 3,972,041 4,531,488 4,315,389 REVENUES: Premiums earned $ 3,963,093 $ 4,425,082 $ 3,737,851 Net investment income 522,833 495,908 402,610 Net realized capital gains (losses) 90,284 89,614 (38,026 ) Net derivative (expense) income (2,638 ) (2,660 ) 5,851 Other (expense) income (18,473 ) 741 (1,033 ) Total revenues 4,555,099 5,008,685 4,107,253 CLAIMS AND EXPENSES: Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 3,724,317 3,291,139 2,600,196 Commission, brokerage, taxes and fees 914,847 975,176 863,933 Other underwriting expenses 123,462 107,120 94,623 Interest expense 73,394 75,539 57,288 Total claims and expenses 4,836,020 4,448,974 3,616,040 (LOSS) INCOME BEFORE TAXES (280,921 ) 559,711 491,213 Income tax (benefit) expense (62,254 ) 64,853 65,185 NET (LOSS) INCOME $ (218,667 ) $ 494,858 $ 426,028 RATIOS: Loss Ratios 94.0 % 74.4 % 69.6 % Commission and brokerage ratio 23.1 % 22.0 % 23.1 % Other underwriting expense ratios 3.1 % 2.4 % 2.5 % Combined ratio 120.2 % 98.8 % 95.2 % Shareholders' equity $ 4,139.7 $ 3,712.5 $ 3,164.9 Overall, the Company was disappointed with its 2005 results. The Company generated a net loss of $218.7 million in 2005, which was $713.5 million less than 2004 net income of $494.9 million. This $713.5 million deterioration was principally driven by $1.1 billion of higher pre-tax catastrophe losses tempered somewhat by improved non-catastrophe prior year reserve development, which improved by $275.8 million to a total net favorable development of $26.4 million. The Company incurred $1.5 billion of pre-tax catastrophe losses in 2005 driven extensively by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. These three devastating events resulted in the worst catastrophe loss year in history for both the insurance industry and the Company. Catastrophe risk is a fundamental risk element to which the Company is exposed. Its risk management framework considers such exposures carefully. As a consequence of the 2005 catastrophe experience, the 50 Company continues to re-examine and adjust its comprehensive framework of risk assessment, accumulation monitoring and risk mitigation seeking balance between risk versus reward in the context of changing market conditions. Meanwhile, the Company is extremely well positioned to respond to generally improving market conditions in 2006 in the aftermath of unprecedented catastrophe losses in late 2005. First, the Company non-catastrophe operating fundamentals remain very strong. Second, the Company capital base is as strong as it has ever been having been recently bolstered by proceeds from secondary offerings. Third, the Company broad, diversified global franchise and low-cost operating platform provide a wide spectrum of business opportunities in a variety of product classes and markets. Lastly, the discipline with which the Company approaches its business remains intact causing it to look opportunistically at improving market conditions while providing its underwriters with the flexibility to decline business that does not meet its objectives regarding underwriting profitability. Revenues. Gross written premiums decreased 12.7% to $4.1 billion in 2005 from $4.7 billion in 2004 reflecting the Company disciplined response to modest market softening in most sectors, particularly earlier in the year. The Company adapted its operations to slow its growth and even decrease writings for some classes of business and reemphasize its focus on profitability as opposed to volume. The classes most affected by these actions were workers compensation insurance, individual risk (re)insurance, medical stop loss reinsurance, UK motor business reinsurance and select U.S. casualty reinsurance classes. As a result, the U.S. Insurance segment decreased 20.2% due to declines in its predominant workers compensation book, while the reinsurance segments declined 10.2% in the aggregate. Net written premiums and net earned premiums declined 12.3% and 10.4%, respectively, to $4.0 billion in 2005 compared to 2004, consistent with the decrease in gross written premiums. Net investment income was $522.8 million in 2005, an increase of 5.4% compared with 2004 reflecting growth in invested assets, partially offset by lower investment portfolio yields from the Company fixed maturities and lower returns from the Company equity investments in limited partnerships. The Company invested asset base at year-end 2005 was $13.0 billion, up $1.4 billion over prior year mainly driven by $1.1 billion of cash flow from operations and $758.3 million of common equity offering net proceeds, partially offset by $250.0 million of senior debt repayment during the period. Cash flows, which have been trending down over the past two years due to increased catastrophe losses and reduced premiums written, remain strong and are reflective of strong operating fundamentals. The embedded investment portfolio yields in 2005 were 4.5% pre-tax and 3.9% after-tax, down from 4.7% and 4.1%, respectively, in 2004, reflective of the Company elevated short-term investment holdings, which had the effect of reducing the Company asset duration and lessening the fixed income portfolio susceptibility to rising interest rates in the future. Net realized capital gains were $90.3 million in 2005 driven by gains on the sale of the Company interest only strips investment portfolio and other portfolio management activities in response to interest rate and credit market movements. Other expenses increased by $19.2 million in 2005 driven primarily by foreign exchange losses. Expenses. Incurred losses and LAE for 2005 were $3.7 billion, an increase of $0.4 billion over 2004, principally related to $1.1 billion higher level of catastrophe losses, partially offset by a $0.4 billion decrease in non-catastrophe prior period reserve adjustments and lower earned premiums. The Company non-catastrophe incurred losses were down 10.5% in 2005, which is broadly in line with the 10.4% decline in net earned premiums, reflective of generally stable business trends. The Company 2005 incurred losses benefited from $26.4 million of favorable prior period reserve adjustments in 2005 comprised of $226.3 million of favorable reserve development on non-catastrophe, non-A&E reserves principally related to property business classes, partially offset by catastrophe reserve development of $118.5 million, mostly from 2004 Florida hurricane 51 events and A&E development of $81.4 million, mostly related to settlement activity with respect to asbestos exposures. Commission, brokerage and tax expenses for 2005 were $914.8 million, a decrease of $60.3 million compared to 2004, principally reflecting decreases in premium volume and changes in business mix. However, the Company commission expense ratio increased by 1.1 points primarily due to an increase in contingent commissions and premium based taxes. Other underwriting expenses for 2005 were $123.5 million, a $16.3 million increase principally reflective of the continued build-out of the U.S. Insurance platform. The Company generated an income tax benefit of $62.3 million in 2005 equating to an effective tax rate of 22.2% applied to its pre-tax loss of $280.9 million for the year. This elevated effective tax rate reflected the impact of the year catastrophe losses on U.S. operations, producing a significant tax loss, partly mitigated by continued profitable operations in the United Kingdom. The Company generated a net loss of $218.7 million in 2005 compared to net income of $494.8 million in 2004. This $713.5 million deterioration in 2005 was principally driven by $1.1 billion of higher catastrophe losses tempered somewhat by improved non-catastrophe prior year reserve development of $0.4 billion. The Company shareholders equity increased by $0.4 billion to $4.1 billion at year-end 2005 driven by $758.7 million of equity offering proceeds, partially offset by the $218.7 million net loss for the period and a $77.8 million reduction in net unrealized appreciation on investments, principally related to fixed-income securities affected by modestly rising interest rates. SEGMENT INFORMATION The Company, through its subsidiaries, operates in five segments: U.S. Reinsurance, U.S. Insurance, Specialty Underwriting, International and Bermuda. The U.S. Reinsurance operation writes property and casualty reinsurance, on both a treaty and facultative basis, through reinsurance brokers, as well as directly with ceding companies within the U.S. The U.S. Insurance operation writes property and casualty insurance primarily through general agent relationships and surplus lines brokers within the U.S. The Specialty Underwriting operation writes A&H, marine, aviation and surety business within the U.S. and worldwide through brokers and directly with ceding companies. The International operation writes property and casualty reinsurance through Everest Re branches in Canada and Singapore, in addition to foreign business written through Everest Re Miami and New Jersey offices. The Bermuda operation provides reinsurance and insurance to worldwide property and casualty markets and reinsurance to life insurers through brokers and directly with ceding companies from its Bermuda office and property and casualty reinsurance to the United Kingdom and European markets through its UK branch. These segments are managed in a carefully coordinated fashion with strong elements of central control, with respect to pricing, risk management, monitoring aggregate exposures to catastrophic events, capital, investments and support operations. Management generally monitors and evaluates the financial performance of these operating segments based upon their underwriting results. Underwriting results include earned premium less losses and LAE incurred, commission and brokerage expenses and other underwriting expenses and are analyzed using ratios, in particular loss, commission and brokerage and other underwriting expense ratios, which, respectively, divide incurred losses, commissions and brokerage and other underwriting expenses by earned premium. The Company utilizes inter-affiliate reinsurance but such reinsurance generally does not impact segment results, as business is generally reported within the segment in which the business was first produced. For selected financial information regarding these segments, see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective January 1, 2004, Everest Re sold its United Kingdom branch to Bermuda Re. Business for this branch was previously included in the International segment and is now included in the Bermuda segment. Due to the 52 sale and in accordance with FAS 131, the Company restated the International and Bermuda segments for the year ended December 31, 2003 to conform to December 31, 2005 and 2004 segment reporting. In 2003, Everest National, another subsidiary of the Company, opened a regional office in California to better serve its western U.S. insurance business. The business produced through this additional office is included in the U.S. Insurance operation. The following tables present the relevant underwriting results for the operating segments for the three years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003: U.S. Reinsurance (Dollars in thousands) 2005 2004 2003 Gross written premiums $ 1,386,168 $ 1,478,159 $ 1,752,302 Net written premiums 1,383,690 1,468,466 1,687,333 Premiums earned $ 1,396,133 $ 1,473,545 $ 1,423,841 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 1,479,560 1,168,563 1,059,087 Commission and brokerage 358,101 373,581 350,641 Other underwriting expenses 23,981 23,390 21,670 Underwriting loss $ (465,509 ) $ (91,989 ) $ (7,557 ) U.S. Insurance (Dollars in thousands) 2005 2004 2003 Gross written premiums $ 932,469 $ 1,167,808 $ 1,069,527 Net written premiums 815,316 1,019,716 923,147 Premiums earned $ 823,015 $ 937,576 $ 823,601 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 530,781 658,777 605,602 Commission and brokerage 132,630 130,380 146,782 Other underwriting expenses 50,491 44,834 38,569 Underwriting gain $ 109,113 $ 103,585 $ 32,648 Specialty Underwriting (Dollars in thousands) 2005 2004 2003 Gross written premiums $ 314,630 $ 487,072 $ 502,888 Net written premiums 299,316 470,571 498,013 Premiums earned $ 301,454 $ 459,284 $ 468,932 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 317,917 302,010 295,397 Commission and brokerage 79,692 129,209 133,531 Other underwriting expenses 6,756 7,068 6,475 Underwriting (loss) gain $ (102,911) $ 20,997 $ 33,529 53 International (Dollars in thousands) 2005 2004 2003 Gross written premiums $ 706,584 $ 687,657 $ 520,800 Net written premiums 704,870 684,390 518,919 Premiums earned $ 683,435 $ 655,694 $ 461,607 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 574,653 419,101 267,707 Commission and brokerage 166,968 161,106 113,091 Other underwriting expenses 12,622 11,298 9,734 Underwriting (loss) gain $ (70,808 ) $ 64,189 $ 71,075 Bermuda (Dollars in thousands) 2005 2004 2003 Gross written premiums $ 768,711 $ 883,439 $ 728,285 Net written premiums 768,849 888,345 687,977 Premiums earned $ 759,056 $ 898,983 $ 559,870 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 821,406 742,688 372,403 Commission and brokerage 177,456 180,900 119,888 Other underwriting expenses 16,153 13,998 12,222 Underwriting (loss) gain $ (255,959 ) $ (38,603 ) $ 55,357 The following table reconciles the underwriting results for the operating segments to income before tax as reported in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the years ended December 31: (Dollars in thousands) 2005 2004 2003 Underwriting (loss) gain $ (786,074 ) $ 58,179 $ 185,052 Net investment income 522,833 495,908 402,610 Realized gain (loss) 90,284 89,614 (38,026 ) Net derivative (expense) income (2,638 ) (2,660 ) 5,851 Corporate expenses (13,459 ) (6,532 ) (5,953 ) Interest expense (73,394 ) (75,539 ) (57,288 ) Other (expense) income (18,473 ) 741 (1,033 ) (Loss) income before taxes $ (280,921 ) $ 559,711 $ 491,213 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 Premiums Written. Gross written premiums decreased 12.7% to $4,108.6 million in 2005 from $4,704.1 million in 2004 reflecting a disciplined underwriting response to modest reinsurance market softening that affected all segments, resulting in an overall premium decline. Premiums declined 35.4% ($172.4 million) in the Specialty Underwriting operation, primarily due to a $145.4 million decrease in A&H business and a $47.9 million decrease in surety business, partially offset by a $20.9 million increase in marine and aviation business. The U.S. Insurance operation decreased 20.2% ($235.3 million), principally as a result of a $242.6 million decrease in workers compensation, resulting primarily from changes in the California workers compensation market. The Bermuda operation decreased 13.0% ($114.7 million) reflecting declines in individual risk underwritten insurance and reinsurance in Bermuda and in motor business reinsurance in the U.K. The U.S. 54 Reinsurance operation decreased 6.2% ($92.0 million), principally relating to a $173.1 million decrease in treaty casualty business and a $29.3 million decrease in facultative business, partially offset by a $118.9 million increase in treaty property business. The International operation increased 2.8% ($18.9 million), resulting primarily from a $75.0 million increase in Asian business, partially offset by a $43.6 million decrease in international business written through the Miami and New Jersey offices, representing primarily Latin American business and an $11.3 million decrease in Canadian business. Ceded premiums decreased to $136.5 million in 2005 from $172.6 million in 2004, principally resulting from the decrease in gross premiums in the U.S. Insurance operations. Ceded premiums generally relate to specific reinsurance purchased by the U.S. Insurance operation and fluctuate based upon the level of premiums written in the individual reinsured programs. Net written premiums decreased by 12.3% to $3,972.0 million in 2005 from $4,531.5 million in 2004, consistent with the decrease in gross written premiums, combined with the decrease in ceded premiums. Premium Revenues. Net premiums earned declined by 10.4% to $3,963.1 million in 2005 from $4,425.1 million in 2004. Contributing to this decrease was a 34.4% ($157.8 million) decrease in the Specialty Underwriting operation, a 15.6% ($139.9 million) decrease in the Bermuda operation, a 12.2% ($114.6 million) decrease in the U.S. Insurance operation and a 5.3% ($77.4 million) decrease in the U.S. Reinsurance operation, partially offset by a 4.2% ($27.7 million) increase in the International operation. Partially tempering the decline in net premiums earned in 2005 were $81.8 million of reinstatement premiums of which $64.4 million were due to Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma. Generally, catastrophe reinsurance provides coverage for one event; however, when limits are exhausted, some contractual arrangements provide for the availability of additional coverage upon the payment of additional premium. This additional premium is referred to as reinstatement premium. There were no such reinstatement premiums for 2004. All of these changes reflect period to period changes in net written premiums and business mix, together with normal variability in earnings patterns. Business mix changes occur not only as the Company shifts emphasis between products, lines of business, distribution channels and markets, but also as individual contracts renew or non-renew, almost always with changes in coverage, structure, prices and/or terms, and as new contracts are accepted with coverages, structures, prices and/or terms different from those of expiring contracts. As premium reporting, earnings, loss and commission characteristics derive from the provisions of individual contracts, the continuous turnover of individual contracts, arising from both strategic shifts and day to day underwriting, can and does introduce appreciable background variability in various underwriting line items. Changes in estimates related to the reporting patterns of ceding companies also affect premiums earned. Expenses Incurred Losses and LAE. Incurred loss and LAE increased by 13.2% to $3,724.3 million in 2005 from $3,291.1 million in 2004. The increase in incurred losses and LAE was principally attributable to the increase in estimated losses due to property catastrophes, partially offset by favorable non-catastrophe prior period reserve development and a lower level of earned premiums. Incurred losses and LAE in 2005 reflected ceded losses and LAE of $95.2 million compared to ceded losses and LAE in 2004 of $141.0 million. The decrease in ceded losses was primarily the result of fluctuations in losses ceded under the specific reinsurance coverages purchased by the U.S. Insurance operation and less ceded premium period over period. The Company loss ratio, which is calculated by dividing incurred losses and LAE by net premiums earned, increased by 19.6 percentage points to 94.0% in 2005 from 74.4% in 2004. This 19.6 point year over year loss ratio deterioration was primarily the result of a 29.5 point increase due to catastrophe losses, partially offset by a 10.2 point improvement in non-catastrophe prior year reserve development. 55 The following table shows the loss ratios for each of the Company operating segments for 2005 and 2004. The loss ratios for all operations were impacted by the factors noted above. Segment Loss Ratios Segment 2005 2004 U.S. Reinsurance 106.0 % 79.3 % U.S. Insurance 64.5 % 70.3 % Specialty Underwriting 105.5 % 65.8 % International 84.1 % 63.9 % Bermuda 108.2 % 82.6 % The segment components of the increase in incurred losses and LAE in 2005 from 2004 were a 37.1% ($155.6 million) increase in the International operation, a 26.6% ($311.0 million) increase in the U.S. Reinsurance operation, a 10.6% ($78.7 million) increase in the Bermuda operation, partially offset by a 19.4% ($128.0 million) decrease in the U.S. Insurance operation and a 5.3% ($15.9 million) decrease in the Specialty Underwriting operation. These changes reflect variability in premiums earned and changes in the loss expectation assumptions for business written, as well as the net prior period reserve development and catastrophe losses discussed above. Incurred losses and LAE for each operation were also impacted by changes in the pricing of the underlying business, as well as variability relating to changes in the mix of business by class and type. The following table shows the net catastrophe losses for each of the Company operating segments for 2005 and 2004. (Dollars in millions) Segment Net Catastrophe Incurred Losses Segment 2005 2004 U.S. Reinsurance $ 707.2 $ 250.7 U.S. Insurance 1.3 1.0 Specialty Underwriting 164.5 18.8 International 254.7 85.9 Bermuda 358.0 33.6 Total $ 1,485.7 $ 390.0 Incurred losses and LAE include catastrophe losses, which include the impact of both current period events and favorable and unfavorable development on prior period events and are net of reinsurance. Individual catastrophe losses are reported net of specific reinsurance, but before recoveries under corporate level reinsurance and potential incurred but not reported ( IBNR ) loss reserve offsets. The Company defines a catastrophe as a property event with expected reported losses of at least $5.0 million before corporate level reinsurance and taxes. Effective for the third quarter 2005, industrial risk losses have been excluded from catastrophe losses with prior periods adjusted for comparison purposes. Catastrophe losses, net of contract specific cessions, were $1,485.7 million in 2005, related principally to aggregate estimated losses driven by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma with catastrophe losses of $765.9 million, $151.0 million and $381.6 million, respectively, but also reflected catastrophe losses related to hurricanes Emily ($19.8 million) and Dennis ($7.0 million), floods in India ($13.2 million), Calgary ($9.6 million) and Europe ($6.2 million) and storms in Ontario ($12.9 million). The 2005 results also reflect net unfavorable reserve development on 2004 and prior catastrophes of $118.5 million. Catastrophe losses, net of contract specific cessions, were $390.0 million in 2004, related principally to aggregate estimated losses of $428.8 million from Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne, Pacific typhoons, Edmonton hailstorms and the Asian tsunami, which were partially offset by $33.4 million of reserve reductions related to the 2001 World Trade Center losses. 56 The following table shows net prior period reserve adjustments for each of the Company operating segments for 2005 and 2004. (Dollars in millions) Segment Net Prior Period Reserve Adjustments Segment 2005 2004 U.S. Reinsurance $ 20.7 $ 77.7 U.S. Insurance (19.5 ) 43.3 Specialty Underwriting (16.1 ) 5.1 International (49.2 ) (15.1 ) Bermuda 37.7 138.4 Total $ (26.4 ) $ 249.4 Net favorable prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $26.4 million compared to net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments of $249.4 million in 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the favorable reserve adjustments included net favorable non-A&E, non-catastrophe reserve adjustments of $226.3 million related primarily to property business classes, partially offset by net unfavorable prior period catastrophe adjustments of $118.5 million related primarily to the 2004 hurricanes and net unfavorable A&E adjustments of $81.4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments included net unfavorable A&E adjustments of $159.4 million and net unfavorable non-A&E, non-catastrophe adjustments of approximately $128.7 million relating primarily to casualty reinsurance. Partially offsetting the 2004 unfavorable development was $38.7 million of favorable catastrophe development principally related to the reduction of reserves for the World Trade Center events. It is important to note that non-A&E accident year reserve development arises from the re-evaluation of accident year results and that such re-evaluations may also impact premiums and commissions attributed by accident year, generally mitigating, in part, the impact of loss development and that such impacts are recorded as part of the overall reserve evaluation process. The U.S. Reinsurance segment accounted for $20.7 million of net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2005, which included $72.5 million of unfavorable catastrophe prior period reserve adjustments, partially offset by favorable net non-A&E, non-catastrophe reserve adjustments of $63.3 million. Net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments were $77.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, which included $102.2 million of unfavorable non-A&E, non-catastrophe prior period reserve adjustments, partially offset by $34.8 million of favorable development primarily due to reserve reduction related to catastrophe losses from the 2001 World Trade Center losses. Asbestos exposures accounted for $11.5 million and $10.3 million of unfavorable reserve adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, there had been a proliferation of claims related to bankruptcies and other financial management improprieties. This increased number of claims, combined with larger claims, has significantly increased incurred losses on the professional liability policies. In the general casualty area, the Company continues to experience losses greater than historical trends for accident years 1998 through 2001. These losses are being driven by adverse trends in litigation and economic variability. The U.S. Insurance segment reflected $19.5 million of net favorable prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $43.3 million of net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2004. The 2005 favorable prior period reserve adjustments related principally to California workers compensation for the 2004 accident year as the results of benefit reform have become clearer and the 2004 unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments related principally to the casualty classes related to accident years 2000 through 2002, where the Company strengthened its reserves for California workers compensation insurance. While management believes the cumulative results through 2005 remain 57 quite positive, there was some deterioration in claim frequency and severity related to accident years 2001 and 2002. The Specialty Underwriting segment had $16.1 million of net favorable prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $5.1 million of net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2004. In 2005, net favorable prior period reserve adjustments reflected $33.0 million of non-A&E, non-catastrophe favorable development on the marine, aviation, surety and A&H classes of business, partially offset by unfavorable catastrophe development of $16.9 million. In 2004, net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments related to the surety and A&H classes of business, partially offset by favorable development in the marine and aviation business lines. The International segment had $49.2 million of favorable net prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $15.1 million of net favorable prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2004. The favorable development in 2005 related primarily to favorable non-asbestos, non-catastrophe reserve development on the Canadian, Asian, and international business of $66.1 million, partially offset by unfavorable property catastrophe loss development of $16.9 million on the same business. The favorable development in 2004 related primarily to 2003 Canadian property catastrophe, international and Asian business. The Bermuda segment reflected $37.7 million of net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $138.4 million of net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2004. The development in the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily the result of $69.9 million of unfavorable A&E prior period reserve development and $12.2 million unfavorable catastrophe development, partially offset by $44.4 million favorable non-A&E, non-catastrophe prior period reserve adjustments primarily from the UK branch produced business. The development in the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily the result of $149.1 million of A&E reserve development. All of the development related to asbestos exposures that were assumed through the September 19, 2000 loss portfolio transfer from Mt. McKinley. Aggregate reserve development related to A&E exposures was $81.4 million and $159.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company has A&E exposure related to contracts written by the Company prior to 1986 and to claim obligations acquired as part of the Mt. McKinley acquisition in September 2000. The reserve strengthening on business written by the Company, net of reinsurance, was $11.5 million and the net strengthening on the acquired Mt. McKinley business was $69.9 million in 2005. Substantially all of the Company A&E exposures relate to insurance and reinsurance contracts with coverage periods prior to 1986. Given the uncertainties surrounding the settlement of A&E losses, management is unable to establish a meaningful range for these obligations. In all cases, the prior period reserve development, sometimes referred to as reserve strengthening, reflects management judgment as to the implications of losses and claim information reported during the period on the Company reserve balances. Underwriting Expenses. The Company expense ratio, which is calculated by dividing underwriting expenses by net premiums earned, was 26.2% in 2005 compared to 24.4% in 2004. 58 The following table shows the expense ratios for each of the Company operating segments for 2005 and 2004. Segment Expense Ratios Segment 2005 2004 U.S. Reinsurance 27.3 % 26.9 % U.S. Insurance 22.2 % 18.7 % Specialty Underwriting 28.6 % 29.6 % International 26.3 % 26.3 % Bermuda 25.5 % 21.7 % Segment underwriting expenses decreased by 4.7% to $1,024.9 million in 2005 from $1,075.8 million in 2004. Commission, brokerage, taxes and fees decreased by $60.3 million, principally reflecting decreases in premium volume and changes in the mix of business. Segment other underwriting expenses increased by $9.4 million as the Company continued to expand operations. Contributing to the segment underwriting expense decreases were a 36.6% ($49.8 million) decrease in the Specialty Underwriting operation, a 3.8% ($14.9 million) decrease in the U.S. Reinsurance operation and a 0.7% ($1.3 million) decrease in the Bermuda operation, partially offset by a 4.5% ($7.9 million) increase in the U.S. Insurance operation and a 4.2% ($7.2 million) increase in the International operation. The changes for each operation expenses principally resulted from changes in commission expenses related to changes in premium volume and business mix by class and type and, in some cases, changes in the use of specific reinsurance, as well as the underwriting performance of the underlying business. The Company combined ratio, which is the sum of the loss and expense ratios, increased by 21.4 percentage points to 120.2% in 2005 as compared to 98.8% in 2004, with the increase principally resulting from elevated catastrophe losses, partially offset by improved prior year development. The following table shows the combined ratios for each of the Company operating segments in 2005 and 2004. The combined ratios for all operations were impacted by the loss and expense ratio variability noted above. Segment Combined Ratios Segment 2005 2004 U.S. Reinsurance 133.3 % 106.2 % U.S. Insurance 86.7 % 89.0 % Specialty Underwriting 134.1 % 95.4 % International 110.4 % 90.2 % Bermuda 133.7 % 104.3 % Investment Results. Net investment income increased 5.4% to $522.8 million in 2005 from $495.9 million in 2004 reflecting growth in invested assets tempered by lower investment yields and lower returns from limited partnership investments. Investable assets increased by $1.4 billion to $13.0 billion in 2005, principally reflecting the effects of investing $1,065.7 million cash flow from operations during the year and $758.3 million net proceeds from issuance of common shares, partially offset by $250.0 million in debt repayment. The lower investment yield reflects the Company elevated short-term investments following its common share capital raising in the fourth quarter, which also reduced the investment income portfolio duration. Investment income for the limited partnerships for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $12.0 million and $42.0 million, respectively. 59 The following table shows a comparison of various investment yields for the periods indicated: 2005 2004 Imbedded pre-tax yield of cash and invested assets at December 31 4.5 % 4.7 % Imbedded after-tax yield of cash and invested assets at December 31 3.9 % 4.1 % Annualized pre-tax yield on average cash and invested assets 4.4 % 5.0 % Annualized after-tax yield on average cash and invested assets 3.8 % 4.2 % The Company, because of its historical income orientation, has generally considered total return, the combination of income yield and capital appreciation/depreciation, to be relatively less important as a measure of performance than its overall income yield. However, in 2005, with changes the Company perceived in overall investment market conditions, the Company continued to reweight its view of total return and added $440.0 million in 2005 of equity securities into the overall investment portfolio. The Company also added $125.5 million of other invested assets, principally limited partnerships. The following table provides a comparison of the Company total return by asset class relative to broadly accepted industry benchmarks for 2005 and 2004. 2005 2004 Company's fixed income portfolio total return 3.2 % 6.5 % Lehman bond aggregate 2.4 % 4.3 % Company's common equity portfolio total return 13.8 % 21.9 % S & P 500 4.9 % 10.9 % Company's other invested asset portfolio total return 7.2 % 43.2 % The Company net realized capital gains were $90.3 million in 2005, which reflected realized capital gains on the Company investments of $106.2 million, including $41.3 million on the sale of interest only strips investments, partially offset by $15.9 million of realized capital losses, which included $7.0 million related to the write-downs in the value of interest only strips deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis in accordance with EITF 99-20. Net realized capital gains were $89.6 million in 2004, which reflected realized capital gains on the Company investments of $164.3 million, including $118.2 million on the sale of interest only strip investments, partially offset by $74.7 million of realized capital losses, which included $65.0 million related to the write-downs in the value of interest only strips deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis in accordance with EITF 99-20. The Company has outstanding seven specialized equity put options in its product portfolio at December 31, 2005. These products meet the definition of a derivative under Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ( FAS 133 ). Net derivative expense from these derivative transactions was $2.6 million and $2.7 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, reflecting changes in fair value for the specialized equity put options. See also Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Expenses. Other expense in 2005 was $18.5 million compared to other income of $0.7 million in 2004. The change in net other expense for 2005 from net other income in 2004 was primarily due to variability in the impact of foreign exchange and share option expense under Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation ( FAS 123 ). Corporate underwriting expenses not allocated to segments were $13.5 million for 2005 as compared to $6.5 million for 2004 as the Company expanded its infrastructure to support operations. 60 Interest expense and fees in 2005 were $73.4 million compared to $75.5 million in 2004. Interest expense and fees in 2005 included $35.5 million relating to the senior notes, $37.4 million relating to the junior subordinated debt securities and $0.4 million relating to the credit line under the Company revolving credit facilities. Interest expense and fees in 2004 included $42.0 million relating to the senior notes, $32.4 million relating to the junior subordinated debt securities and $1.2 million relating to borrowings under the Company revolving credit facilities. The lower interest expense on the senior notes was due to the retirement of the 8.5% senior notes due March 15, 2005, partially offset by the issuance of new 5.4 % senior notes on October 12, 2004. Income Taxes. The Company income tax expense is primarily a function of the statutory tax rates and corresponding net income in the jurisdictions where the Company operates, coupled with the impact from tax preferenced investment income. Variations generally reflect changes in the relative levels of pre-tax income between jurisdictions with different tax rates, and specifically for 2005, also reflected the significant increase in incurred losses relating to catastrophes resulting, ultimately, in a pre-tax loss for the year. The Company recognized income tax benefits of $62.3 million in 2005 compared to income tax expense of $64.9 million in 2004 . The 2004 tax expense was impacted by various issues, including the transfer of the Company UK branch to Bermuda Re, giving rise to a net tax expense. Net (Loss) Income. Net loss was $218.7 million in 2005 compared to net income of $494.9 million in 2004, with the change primarily reflecting reduced underwriting profitability due to catastrophe losses, partially offset by favorable prior period reserve development, related tax benefits and improved investment income. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 Premiums Written. Gross written premiums increased 2.8% to $4,704.1 million in 2004 from $4,573.8 million in 2003, as the Company took advantage of selected growth opportunities, while continuing to maintain a disciplined underwriting approach. Premium growth areas included a 32.0% ($166.9 million) increase in the International operations, primarily due to a $97.7 million increase in international business written through the Miami and New Jersey offices, representing primarily Latin American business, and a $67.2 million increase in Asian business. The Bermuda operation grew 21.3% ($155.2 million) reflecting an emphasis on traditional business classes in Bermuda and the UK. The U.S. Insurance operation grew 9.2% ($98.3 million), principally as a result of a $193.8 million increase in program business other than workers compensation, partially offset by a $95.5 million decrease in workers compensation business. The Specialty Underwriting operation decreased 3.1% ($15.8 million), resulting primarily from a $70.4 million decrease in A&H business, partially offset by an increase in surety business of $29.6 million and an increase in marine and aviation business of $25.0 million. The U.S. Reinsurance operation decreased 15.6% ($274.1 million), principally relating to an $142.5 million decrease in treaty casualty business, a $74.9 million decrease in facultative business, a $32.6 million decrease in treaty property business and a $19.8 million decrease in treaty non-property business. Ceded premiums decreased to $172.6 million in 2004 from $258.4 million in 2003, principally resulting from the inclusion in 2003 of $49.6 million in adjustment premiums relating to claims made under the 2000 accident year aggregate excess of loss element of the Company corporate retrocessional programs, compared with no such adjustment premiums in 2004. Aside from the corporate retrocessional programs, ceded premiums generally relate to specific reinsurance purchased by the U.S. Insurance operation and fluctuate based upon the level of premiums written in the applicable programs. Net written premiums increased by 5.0% to $4,531.5 million in 2004 from $4,315.4 million in 2003, reflecting the increase in gross written premiums, combined with the decrease in ceded premiums. Premium Revenues. Net premiums earned increased by 18.4% to $4,425.1 million in 2004 from $3,737.9 million in 2003. Contributing to this increase was a 60.6% ($339.1 million) increase in the Bermuda operation, a 42.0% ($194.1 million) increase in the International operation, a 13.8% ($114.0 million) increase in the U.S. Insurance operation and a 3.5% ($49.7 million) increase in the U.S. Reinsurance operation, partially offset by a 61 2.1% ($9.6 million) decrease in the Specialty Underwriting operation. All of these changes reflect period to period changes in net written premiums and business mix, together with normal variability in earnings patterns. Business mix changes occur not only as the Company shifts emphasis between products, lines of business, distribution channels and markets, but also as individual contracts renew or non-renew, almost always with changes in coverage, structure, prices and/or terms, and as new contracts are accepted with coverages, structures, prices and/or terms different from those of expiring contracts. As premium reporting, earnings, loss and commission characteristics derive from the provisions of individual contracts, the continuous turnover of individual contracts, arising from both strategic shifts and day to day underwriting, can and does introduce appreciable background variability in various underwriting line items. Changes in estimates related to the reporting patterns of companies also affect premiums earned. Expenses Incurred Losses and LAE. Incurred loss and LAE increased by 26.6% to $3,291.1 million in 2004 from $2,600.2 million in 2003. The increase in incurred losses and LAE was principally attributable to the provision for estimated catastrophe losses from Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne, Pacific typhoons, the Asian tsunami and reserve adjustments for prior period losses, together with the mitigating effects of the increase in net premiums earned and the impact of favorable changes in the Company underlying business mix and aggregate rates, terms and conditions. Incurred losses and LAE in 2004 reflected ceded losses and LAE of $141.0 million compared to ceded losses and LAE in 2003 of $278.4 million. The decrease in ceded losses is primarily the result of the absence in 2004 of cessions under the corporate level aggregate reinsurance covers. The ceded losses and LAE in 2003 included $85.0 million of losses ceded under the 2000 accident year aggregate excess of loss component of the Company corporate retrocessional program and $81.1 million under the LM/Mt. McKinley reinsurance agreement. The Company loss ratio, which is calculated by dividing incurred losses and LAE by net premiums earned, increased by 4.8 percentage points to 74.4% in 2004 from 69.6% in 2003, reflecting the impact of the changes in premiums earned and incurred losses and LAE discussed above, as well as favorable changes in the underlying business mix and aggregate rates, terms and conditions. The following table shows the loss ratios for each of the Company operating segments for 2004 and 2003. The loss ratios for all operations were impacted by the factors noted above. Segment Loss Ratios Segment 2004 2003 U.S. Reinsurance 79.3 % 74.4 % U.S. Insurance 70.3 % 73.5 % Specialty Underwriting 65.8 % 63.0 % International 63.9 % 58.0 % Bermuda 82.6 % 66.5 % The segment components of the increase in incurred losses and LAE in 2004 from 2003 were a 99.4% ($370.3 million) increase in the Bermuda operation, a 56.6% ($151.4 million) increase in the International operation, a 10.3% ($109.5 million) increase in the U.S. Reinsurance operation, an 8.8% ($53.2 million) increase in the U.S. Insurance operation and a 2.2% ($6.6 million) increase in the Specialty Underwriting operation. These changes reflect variability in premiums earned and changes in the loss expectation assumptions for business written, as well as the net prior period reserve development and catastrophe losses discussed above. Incurred losses and LAE for each operation were also impacted by generally improved pricing of the underlying business, as well as variability relating to changes in the mix of business by class and type, which in general reflected a more favorable mix. 62 The following table shows the net catastrophe losses for each of the Company operating segments for 2004 and 2003. (Dollars in millions) Segment Net Catastrophe Incurred Losses Segment 2004 2003 U.S. Reinsurance $ 250.7 $ 22.5 U.S. Insurance 1.0 1.4 Specialty Underwriting 18.8 3.2 International 85.9 1.2 Bermuda 33.6 6.7 Total $ 390.0 $ 35.0 Incurred losses and LAE include catastrophe losses, which include the impact of both current period events and favorable and unfavorable development on prior period events and are net of reinsurance. Individual catastrophe losses are reported net of specific reinsurance, but before recoveries under corporate level reinsurance and potential IBNR reserve offsets. The Company defines a catastrophe as a property event with expected reported losses of at least $5.0 million before corporate level reinsurance and taxes. Effective in 2005, industrial risk losses were excluded from catastrophe losses. As such, prior periods were adjusted for comparison reasons. Catastrophe losses, net of contract specific cessions, were $390.0 million in 2004, relating principally to aggregate estimated losses of $428.8 million from Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne, Pacific typhoons, Edmonton hailstorms and the Asian tsunami, which were partially offset by $33.4 million of reserve reductions related to the 2001 World Trade Center losses. Catastrophe losses, net of contract specific cessions, were $35.0 million in 2003, relating principally to the May 2003 tornado and hailstorm events and Hurricanes Fabian and Isabel. The following table shows net prior period reserve adjustments for each of the Company operating segments for 2004 and 2003. (Dollars in millions) Segment Net Prior Period Reserve Adjustments Segment 2004 2003 U.S. Reinsurance $ 77.7 $ 150.9 U.S. Insurance 43.3 58.7 Specialty Underwriting 5.1 (23.9 ) International (15.1 ) 9.3 Bermuda 138.4 1.8 $ 249.4 $ 196.8 Net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $249.4 million compared to $196.8 million in 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the unfavorable reserve adjustments included net unfavorable A&E adjustments of $159.4 million and net unfavorable non-A&E, non-catastrophe adjustments of approximately $128.7 million relating primarily to casualty reinsurance and workers compensation insurance. Partially offsetting the unfavorable development was favorable catastrophe development of $38.7 million principally related to the reduction of reserves for the World Trade Center events. For the year ended December 31, 2003, net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments for A&E exposures were $50.2 million and net unfavorable non-A&E adjustments were $146.6 million, which were net of a cession of $85 million under the 2000 accident year aggregate excess of loss component of the Company corporate 63 retrocessional program. It is important to note that unfavorable non-A&E accident year reserve development arises from the re-evaluation of accident year results and that such re-evaluations also impact premiums and commissions attributed by accident year, generally mitigating, in part, the impact of loss development and that such impacts are recorded as part of the overall reserve evaluation process. The U.S. Reinsurance segment accounted for $77.7 million of net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2004, which included $34.8 million of favorable development due to the reserve reduction principally related to the catastrophe losses from the World Trade Center events, as compared to net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments of $150.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Asbestos exposures accounted for $10.3 million and $16.8 million of unfavorable reserve adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, with the remainder principally attributable to professional liability and casualty business classes. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, there had been a proliferation of claims relating to bankruptcies and other financial management improprieties. This increased number of claims, combined with larger claims, has significantly increased incurred losses on the professional liability policies. In the general casualty area, the Company continues to experience losses greater than historical trends for accident years 1998 through 2001. These losses are being driven by adverse trends in litigation and economic variability. In both the professional liability and general casualty reinsurance areas, the Company relies upon loss reports from ceding companies. Although the Company may record reserves at higher levels than those reported by ceding companies, actual reported results have exceeded the initial loss indications. The U.S. Insurance segment reflected $43.3 million and $58.7 million of net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments were principally due to accident years 2000 through 2002, where the Company strengthened its reserves for California workers compensation insurance. This was a relatively new book of business and was written in a challenging political and economic environment. While management believes the cumulative results through 2004 remain quite positive, there has been some deterioration in claim frequency and severity related to accident years 2001 and 2002. The Specialty Underwriting segment had $5.1 million of net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2004, principally related to net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments in the surety and A&H business lines, partially offset by favorable development from marine and aviation. The net favorable prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $23.9 million, primarily related to A&H business. The International segment had $15.1 million of favorable net prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2004 and net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments of $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The favorable development in 2004 related primarily to 2003 Canadian property catastrophe, international and Asian business. The prior period reserve development for 2003 related primarily to general casualty business written in the U.S. and Canada on both a quota share and excess basis for accident years 1996 through 2002. The Bermuda segment reflected $138.4 million of net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2004 and $1.8 million of net unfavorable prior reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2003. The development in the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily the result of $149.1 million of A&E reserve development. For the year ended December 31, 2003, reserve adjustments included $33.4 million unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments related to A&E exposures, partially offset by $31.6 million favorable non-A&E adjustments. All of the development related to asbestos exposures were assumed through the September 19, 2000 loss portfolio transfer from Mt. McKinley. 64 Aggregate reserve development related to A&E exposures was $159.4 million and $50.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company has A&E exposure related to contracts written by the Company prior to 1986 and to claim obligations acquired as part of the Mt. McKinley acquisition in September 2000. The reserve strengthening on business written by the Company, net of reinsurance, was $10.3 million and the net strengthening on the acquired business was $149.1 million in 2004. Substantially all of the Company A&E exposures relate to insurance and reinsurance contracts with coverage periods prior to 1986. Given the uncertainties surrounding the settlement of A&E losses, management is unable to establish a meaningful range for these obligations. In all cases, the prior period reserve development, sometimes referred to as reserve strengthening, reflects management judgment as to the implications of losses and claim information reported during the period on the Company reserve balances. Underwriting Expenses. The Company expense ratio, which is calculated by dividing underwriting expenses by net premiums earned, was 24.4% in 2004 compared to 25.6% in 2003. The following table shows the expense ratios for each of the Company operating segments for 2004 and 2003. Segment Expense Ratios Segment 2004 2003 U.S. Reinsurance 26.9 % 26.1 % U.S. Insurance 18.7 % 22.5 % Specialty Underwriting 29.6 % 29.9 % International 26.3 % 26.6 % Bermuda 21.7 % 23.6 % Segment underwriting expenses increased by 12.9% to $1,075.8 million in 2004 from $952.6 million in 2003. Commission, brokerage, taxes and fees increased by $111.2 million, principally reflecting increases in premium volume and changes in the mix of business. Segment other underwriting expenses increased by $11.9 million as the Company continues to expand operations to support its increased business volume. Contributing to the segment underwriting expense increases were a 47.5% ($62.8 million) increase in the Bermuda operation, a 40.4% ($49.6 million) increase in the International operation and a 6.6% ($24.7 million) increase in the U.S. Reinsurance operation, which were partially offset by a 5.5% ($10.1 million) decrease in the U.S. Insurance operation and a 2.7% ($3.7 million) decrease in the Specialty Underwriting operation. The changes for each operation expenses principally resulted from changes in commission expenses related to changes in premium volume and business mix by class and type and, in some cases, changes in the use of specific reinsurance, as well as the underwriting performance of the underlying business. The Company combined ratio, which is the sum of the loss and expense ratios, increased by 3.6 percentage points to 98.8% in 2004 compared to 95.2% in 2003. The following table shows the combined ratios for each of the Company operating segments in 2004 and 2003. The combined ratios for all operations were impacted by the loss and expense ratio variability noted above. Segment Combined Ratios Segment 2004 2003 U.S. Reinsurance 106.2 % 100.5 % U.S. Insurance 89.0 % 96.0 % Specialty Underwriting 95.4 % 92.9 % International 90.2 % 84.6 % Bermuda 104.3 % 90.1 % 65 Investments. Net investment income increased 23.2% to $495.9 million in 2004 from $402.6 million in 2003, principally reflecting the effects of investing $1,487.6 million of cash flow from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, as well as $320.0 million of net proceeds from the issuance of junior subordinated debt securities in March 2004 and $250.0 million of net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in October 2004. The increase also reflected $32.7 million representing an atypical increase in the carrying value of a limited partnership investment. The following table shows a comparison of various investment yields for the periods indicated: 2004 2003 Imbedded pre-tax yield of cash and invested assets at December 31 4.7 % 4.8 % Imbedded after-tax yield of cash and invested assets at December 31 4.1 % 4.1 % Annualized pre-tax yield on average cash and invested assets 5.0 % 5.1 % Annualized after-tax yield on average cash and invested assets 4.2 % 4.4 % The Company, because of its historical income orientation, has generally considered total return, the combination of income yield and capital appreciation/depreciation, to be relatively less important as a measure of performance than its overall income yield. However, in 2004, with changes the Company perceived in overall investment market conditions, the Company continued to reweight its view of total return and added $496.5 million of equity securities in 2004 into the overall investment portfolio. The following table provides a comparison of the Company total return by asset class relative to broadly accepted industry benchmarks for 2004 and 2003. 2004 2003 Company's fixed income portfolio total return 6.5 % 6.2 % Lehman bond aggregate 4.3 % 4.1 % Company's common equity portfolio total return 21.9 % 17.0 % S & P 500 10.9 % 28.7 % Company's other invested asset portfolio total return 43.2 % 26.2 % The Company net realized capital gains were $89.6 million in 2004, which reflected realized capital gains on the Company investments of $164.3 million, including $118.2 million on the sale of interest only strip investments, partially offset by $74.7 million of realized capital losses, which included $65.0 million related to the write-downs in the value of interest only strips deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis in accordance with EITF 99-20, prior to liquidation of the interest only strips portfolio during the second quarter of 2004. Net realized capital losses of $38.0 million in 2003 reflected realized capital losses on the Company investments of $88.7 million, which included $25.7 million relating to write-downs in the value of securities deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis and $46.2 million related to the impairment on interest only strips, partially offset by $50.7 million of realized capital gains, which included $16.8 million of realized capital gains on sales of the interest only strips. The Company had one credit default swap, which it no longer writes, and five specialized equity put options in its product portfolio. These products meet the definition of a derivative under FAS 133. Net derivative expense from these derivative transactions in 2004 was $2.7 million and net derivative income from these derivative transactions in 2003 was $5.9 million, with both periods principally reflecting changes in fair value for the specialized equity put options. See also Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 66 Other Expenses. Other income in 2004 was $0.7 million compared to other expense of $1.0 million in 2003. The decrease in net expense for 2004 was primarily due to variability in the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by other miscellaneous expenses. Corporate underwriting expenses not allocated to segments increased to $6.5 million for 2004 compared with $6.0 million for 2003 as the Company expanded its infrastructure to support increased business volume. Interest expense in 2004 was $75.5 million compared to $57.3 million in 2003. Interest expense in 2004 included $42.0 million related to the senior notes, $32.4 million related to the junior subordinated debt securities and $1.2 million related to borrowings under the Company revolving credit facility. Interest expense in 2003 reflected $38.9 million related to the issuance of the senior notes, $17.0 million related to the junior subordinated debt securities and $1.4 million related to borrowings under the Company revolving credit facility. The increase in interest expense was due to the additional issuance of $320 million of junior subordinated debt securities in March 2004 and the issuance of $250 million of senior notes in October 2004. Income Taxes. The Company income tax expense is primarily a function of the statutory tax rates and corresponding net income in the jurisdictions where the Company operates, coupled with the impact from tax preferenced investment income. Variations between years generally reflect changes in the relative levels of pre-tax income between jurisdictions with different tax rates. Additionally, in conjunction with the transfer of the Company UK Branch to Bermuda Re, there were various tax issues giving rise to net tax expenses. The Company recognized income tax expense of $64.9 million in 2004 compared to $65.2 million in 2003 . Net Income. Net income was $494.9 million in 2004 compared to net income of $426.0 million in 2003, which reflected improved investment income and realized capital gains, partially offset by reduced underwriting profitability due to catastrophe losses. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The following is a summary of the critical accounting policies related to accounting estimates that (1) require management to make assumptions about highly uncertain matters and (2) could materially impact the consolidated financial statements if management made different assumptions. LOSS AND LAE RESERVES. The Company most critical accounting policy is the determination of its loss and LAE reserves. The Company maintains reserves to cover its estimated ultimate liability for losses and LAE with respect to reported and unreported claims relating to both its insurance and reinsurance businesses. Because reserves are estimates of ultimate losses and LAE, management, using a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques, monitors reserve adequacy over time, evaluating new information as it becomes known and adjusting reserves as necessary. Management considers many factors when setting reserves, including: (1) the Company exposure base, generally its premiums earned; (2) its expected loss ratios on current year writings as determined through extensive interaction between its underwriters and actuaries by product and class categories; (3) internal actuarial methodologies which analyze the Company loss reporting and payment experience with similar cases, information from ceding companies and historical trends, such as reserving patterns, loss payments and product mix; (4) current legal interpretations of coverage and liability; (5) economic conditions; and (6) the uncertainties discussed below regarding reserve requirements for A&E claims. Based on these considerations, management believes that adequate provision has been made for the Company insurance and reinsurance loss and LAE reserves. Actual losses and LAE ultimately paid may deviate, perhaps substantially, from such reserves, impacting income in the period in which the change in reserves is made. See also Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company acknowledges that there is more uncertainty in establishing loss reserves on assumed business as compared to direct business. At December 31, 2005 the Company had direct business reserves of $2,059.1 67 million and assumed business loss reserves of $7,067.6 million, of which $255.5 million and $313.4 million, respectively, were loss reserves on asbestos business. Reserving for assumed reinsurance requires evaluating loss information received from ceding companies. Depending on the type of contract and the contractual reporting requirements, ceding companies report losses to the Company in many forms. Generally, proportional/quota share contracts require the submission of a monthly/quarterly account, which includes premium and loss settlement activity for the period with corresponding reserves as established by the ceding company. This information is recorded into the Company records. For certain proportional contracts, there is also an individual loss reporting clause, which requires a detailed loss report on claims that exceed a certain dollar threshold or relate to a particular type of loss. Excess of loss and facultative contracts generally require individual loss reporting with precautionary notices generally sent when losses reach a significant percentage of the attachment point of the contract. All individual loss reports and supporting claim information are managed by the Company experienced claims staff. Based on the evaluation of the claim, the Company may choose to establish additional case reserves greater than those reported by the ceding company. The Underwriting, Claim, Reinsurance Accounting and Internal Audit departments of the Company perform various reviews of the ceding carriers, particularly larger ceding carriers, to ensure that underwriting and claims procedures meet required standards. The claim information received from the ceding companies is compiled into loss development triangles. Accepted actuarial methodologies, supplemented by judgment where appropriate, are then used to develop the appropriate IBNR for the Company. Included in the determination of IBNR, is a factor for reporting lags of the ceded carriers. Each quarter, the Company compares its actual reported losses for the quarter and cumulatively since the most recently completed reserve study to the expected reported losses for the respective period, which may result in additional reserving actions. This is done by aggregate class and/or type of business. This information is used as a tool in the judgmental process by which management assesses the overall adequacy of loss and LAE reserves. ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES. The Company continues to receive claims under expired contracts, both insurance and reinsurance, asserting alleged injuries and/or damages relating to or resulting from environmental pollution and hazardous substances, including asbestos. The Company environmental claims typically involve potential liability for (a) the mitigation or remediation of environmental contamination or (b) bodily injury or property damages caused by the release of hazardous substances into the land, air or water. The Company asbestos claims typically involve potential liability for bodily injury from exposure to asbestos or for property damage resulting from asbestos or products containing asbestos. The Company reserves include an estimate of the Company ultimate liability for A&E claims. This estimate is made based on judgmental assessment of the underlying exposures as the result of: (1) long and variable reporting delays, both from insureds to insurance companies and from ceding companies to reinsurers; (2) historical data, which is more limited and variable on A&E losses than historical information on other types of casualty claims; and (3) unique aspects of A&E exposures for which ultimate value cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques. There are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of the Company potential losses from A&E claims. Among the uncertainties are: (a) potentially long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage; (b) difficulty in identifying sources of asbestos or environmental contamination; (c) difficulty in properly allocating responsibility and/or liability for asbestos or environmental damage; (d) changes in underlying laws and judicial interpretation of those laws; (e) the potential for an asbestos or environmental claim to involve many insurance providers over many policy periods; (f) questions concerning interpretation and application of insurance and reinsurance coverage; and (g) uncertainty regarding the number and identity of insureds with potential asbestos or environmental exposure. With respect to asbestos claims in particular, several additional factors have emerged in recent years that further compound the difficulty in estimating the Company liability. These developments include: (a) continued growth in the number of claims filed, in part reflecting a much more aggressive plaintiff bar and including claims against defendants who may only have a peripheral connection to asbestos; (b) a disproportionate 68 percentage of claims filed by individuals with no functional impairment, which should have little to no financial value but that have increasingly been considered in jury verdicts and settlements; (c) the growth in the number and significance of bankruptcy filings by companies as a result of asbestos claims (including, more recently, bankruptcy filings in which companies attempt to resolve their asbestos liabilities in a manner that is prejudicial to insurers and forecloses insurers from participating in the negotiation of asbestos related bankruptcy reorganization plans); (d) the concentration of claims in a small number of states that favor plaintiffs; (e) the growth in the number of claims that might impact the general liability portion of insurance policies rather than the product liability portion; (f) measures adopted by specific courts to ameliorate the worst procedural abuses; (g) an increase in settlement values being paid to asbestos claimants, especially those with cancer or functional impairment; (h) legislation in some states to address asbestos litigation issues; and (i) the potential that other states or the U.S. Congress may adopt legislation on asbestos litigation. Management believes that these uncertainties and factors continue to render reserves for A&E, and particularly asbestos losses, significantly less subject to traditional actuarial analysis than reserves for other types of losses. Given these uncertainties, management believes that no meaningful range for such ultimate losses can be established. The Company establishes reserves to the extent that, in the judgment of management, the facts and prevailing law reflect an exposure for the Company or its ceding companies. The Company A&E liabilities stem from Mt. McKinley direct insurance business and Everest Re assumed reinsurance business. In connection with the acquisition of Mt. McKinley, which has significant exposure to A&E claims, LM provided reinsurance to Mt. McKinley covering 80% ($160.0 million) of the first $200.0 million of any adverse development of Mt. McKinley reserves as of September 19, 2000 and The Prudential guaranteed LM obligations to Mt. McKinley. Cessions under this reinsurance agreement exhausted the limit available under the contract at December 31, 2003. Due to the uncertainties discussed above, the ultimate losses attributable to A&E, and particularly asbestos, may be subject to more variability than are non-A&E reserves and such variation could have a material adverse effect on the Company financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. See also Notes 1 and 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. With respect to Mt. McKinley, where the Company has a direct relationship with policyholders, the Company aggressive litigation posture and the uncertainties inherent in the asbestos coverage and bankruptcy litigation have provided an opportunity to actively engage in settlement negotiations with a number of those policyholders who have potentially significant asbestos liabilities. Those discussions are oriented towards achieving reasonable negotiated settlements that limit Mt. McKinley liability to a given policyholder to a sum certain. In 2004 and 2005, the Company concluded such settlements or reached agreement in principle with 13 of its high profile policyholders. The Company currently has identified 10 policyholders based on their past claim activity and/or potential future liabilities as High Profile Policyholders and its settlement efforts are generally directed at such policyholders, in part because their exposures have developed to the point where both the policyholder and the Company have sufficient information to be motivated to settle. The Company believes that this active approach will ultimately result in a more cost-effective liquidation of Mt. McKinley liabilities than a passive approach, although it may also introduce additional variability in Mt. McKinley losses and cash flows as reserves are adjusted to reflect the development of negotiations and, ultimately, potentially accelerated settlements. There is less potential for similar settlements with respect to the Company reinsurance asbestos claims. Ceding companies, with their direct obligation to insureds and overall responsibility for claim settlements, are not consistently aggressive in developing claim settlement information and conveying this information to reinsurers, which can introduce significant and perhaps inappropriate delays in the reporting of asbestos claims/exposures to reinsurers. These delays not only extend the timing of reinsurance claim settlements, but 69 also restrict the information available to estimate the reinsurers ultimate exposure. See the discussion below under the heading Financial Condition Loss and LAE Reserves . REINSURANCE RECEIVABLES. The Company utilizes reinsurance agreements to reduce its exposure to large claims and catastrophic loss occurrences. These agreements provide for recovery from reinsurers of a portion of losses and loss expenses under certain circumstances without relieving the insurer of its obligation to the policyholder. In the event reinsurers were unable to meet their obligations under these reinsurance agreements or were able to successfully challenge losses ceded by the Company under the reinsurance contracts, the Company would not be able to realize the full value of the reinsurance recoverable balance. In some cases, the Company may hold partial collateral, including letters of credit and funds held arrangements, for these agreements. The Company establishes reserves for uncollectible balances based on management assessment of the collectibility of the outstanding balances. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the reserve for uncollectible balances was $25.0 million and $25.0 million, respectively. To minimize exposure from uncollectible reinsurance receivables, the Company has a reinsurance credit security committee that generally evaluates the financial strength of a reinsurer prior to entering into a reinsurance arrangement. Additionally, creditworthy foreign reinsurers of business written in the U.S. are generally required to secure their obligations. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for the Company uncollectible balances. Actual uncollectible amounts may vary, perhaps substantially, from such reserves, impacting income in the period in which the change in reserves is made. See also Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Financial Condition Reinsurance Receivables below. PREMIUMS WRITTEN AND EARNED. Premiums written by the Company are earned ratably over the periods of the related insurance and reinsurance contracts or policies. Unearned premium reserves are established to cover the remainder of the unexpired contract period. Such reserves are established based upon reports received from ceding companies or computed using pro rata methods based on statistical data. Premiums earned, and the related costs, which have not yet been reported to the Company, are estimated and accrued. Standard accepted actuarial methodologies are used to estimate earned but not reported premium at each financial reporting date. These earned but not reported premiums are combined with reported earned premiums to comprise the exposure base for determining the Company incurred losses and loss and LAE reserves. Commission expense and incurred losses related to the change in earned but not reported premium are not differentiated from current period reported premium and the effects of both are included in current period company and segment financial results. See also Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table displays the estimated components of earned premiums at December 31 for the periods indicated: (Dollars in thousands) Earned But Not Reported Premium By Segment 2005 2004 2003 U.S. Reinsurance $ 549,866 $ 485,880 $ 391,885 U.S. Insurance 21,267 38,487 38,430 Specialty Underwriting 84,963 136,687 105,865 International 225,664 216,632 169,847 Bermuda 121,147 233,940 120,349 Total $ 1,002,908 $ 1,111,626 $ 826,376 INVESTMENT VALUATION. The Company investment portfolio consists of investments available for sale and equity securities. Accordingly, these securities are marked to market on a quarterly basis. Most securities are 70 traded on national exchanges where market values are readily available. The Company holds some privately placed securities that are either valued by an investment advisor or by the Company using cash flow projections. In 2005 and 2004, the Company owned interest only strips that were accounted for in accordance with EITF 99-20, which sets forth the rules for determining when these securities must be written down to fair value due to impairment. Unrealized gains and losses from market fluctuations are reflected as comprehensive income, while market value declines that are considered other than temporary impairments are reflected in the income statement as realized capital losses. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had unrealized gains net of tax of $214.6 million and $292.3 million, respectively. The Company considers many factors when determining whether a market value decline is other than temporary, including: (1) the length of time the market value has been below book value, (2) the credit strength of the issuer, (3) the issuer market sector, (4) the length of time to maturity and (5) for asset backed securities, increases in prepayments. If management assessments change in the future, the Company may ultimately record a realized loss after management originally concluded that the decline in value was temporary. See also Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. FINANCIAL CONDITION CASH AND INVESTED ASSETS. Aggregate invested assets, including cash and short-term investments, were $12,970.8 million at December 31, 2005, $11,530.2 million at December 31, 2004 and $9,321.3 million at December 31, 2003. The increase in cash and invested assets in 2005 from 2004 resulted primarily from $1,065.7 million in cash flows from operations generated during 2005 and $758.3 million from net proceeds of issuance of common shares, partially offset by the $250.0 million repayment of senior notes due March 15, 2005 and $77.8 million in net pre-tax unrealized depreciation of the Company investments. The $2.2 billion increase in cash and invested assets in 2004 from 2003 resulted primarily from $1,487.6 million in cash flows from operations generated during 2004, $320.0 million from net proceeds of the issuance of junior subordinated debt securities, $250.0 million from net proceeds of the issuance of senior notes and $40.1 million in net pre-tax unrealized appreciation of the Company investments, partially offset by a $70.0 million repayment on the revolving credit agreement. The Company current investment strategy generally seeks to maximize after-tax income through a high quality, diversified, taxable and tax-preferenced fixed maturity portfolio, while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity. The Company mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted continuously, consistent with the Company current and projected operating results, market conditions and the Company tax position. The fixed maturities in the investment portfolio are comprised of available for sale securities. With changes the Company perceives in overall investment market conditions, the Company is reweighting its overall portfolio to modestly increase the emphasis on total return. Additionally, the Company has invested in equity securities, principally public equity index securities, which it believes will enhance the risk-adjusted total return of the investment portfolio. Equity investments accounted for 26.4%, 17.5% and 4.9% of the Company shareholders equity at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company from time to time invests in interest only strips. The Company strategically invests in interest only strips in response to movement in, and levels of, capital market interest rates. These investments are aimed at mitigating potential decreases in unrealized appreciation on the Company fixed income portfolio during a period where management judges that there is very high potential for an increase in general interest rates. These fixed maturity securities give the holder the right to receive interest payments at a stated coupon rate on an underlying pool of mortgages. The interest payments on the outstanding mortgages are guaranteed by entities generally rated AAA. The ultimate cash flow from these investments is primarily dependent upon the average life of the mortgage pool. Generally, as market interest rates and, more specifically, market mortgage rates decline, mortgagors tend to refinance which will decrease the average life of a mortgage pool and decrease expected cash flows. Conversely, as market interest rates and, more specifically, market mortgage rates rise, repayments will slow and the ultimate cash flows will tend to rise. Accordingly, the market value of these investments tends to increase as general interest rates rise and decline as general interest rates fall. These 71 movements are generally counter to the impact of interest rate movements on the Company other fixed income investments. Although the Company invested in interest only strips during 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company had liquidated its positions in interest only strips and held no such securities at December 31, 2005 and 2004. The tables below summarize the composition and characteristics of the Company investment portfolio at December 31: 2005 2004 2003 Fixed maturities 77.5 % 86.3 % 93.6 % Equity securities 8.4 % 5.6 % 1.7 % Short-term investments 11.1 % 5.1 % 1.6 % Other invested assets 2.2 % 1.4 % 1.1 % Cash 0.8 % 1.6 % 2.0 % Total investments and cash 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 2005 2004 2003 Fixed income portfolio duration 4.3 yea rs 5.2 yea rs 4.2 yea rs Fixed income composite credit quality A a1 A a2 A a2 Imbedded end of period yield, pre-tax 4.5 % 4.7 % 4.8 % Imbedded end of period yield, after-tax 3.9 % 4.1 % 4.1 % The increase in short-term investments is due principally to maintaining liquidity to pay catastrophe losses as well as to the issuance of common shares during the fourth quarter of 2005. The increase in equity securities reflects a modest and continuing reweighting of the Company target investment mix. The Company, because of its historical income orientation, has generally considered total return, the combination of income yield and capital appreciation/depreciation, to be relatively less important as a measure of performance than its overall income yield. However, in 2005, with changes the Company perceived in overall investment market conditions, the Company continued to reweight its view of total return and added $440.0 million in 2005 of equity securities into the overall investment portfolio. The following table provides a comparison of the Company total return by asset class relative to broadly accepted industry benchmarks for the periods indicated: 2005 2004 Company's fixed income portfolio total return 3.2 % 6.5 % Lehman bond aggregate 2.4 % 4.3 % Company's common equity portfolio total return 13.8 % 21.9 % S & P 500 4.9 % 10.9 % Company's other invested asset portfolio total return 7.2 % 43.2 % REINSURANCE RECEIVABLES. Reinsurance receivables for both paid and unpaid losses totaled $1,048.7 million at December 31, 2005, $1,210.8 million at December 31, 2004, and $1,284.1 million at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2005, $239.8 million, or 22.9%, was receivable from subsidiaries of London Life. These receivables are collateralized by a combination of letters of credit and funds held arrangements under which the Company has retained the premium payments due the retrocessionaire, recognized liabilities for such amounts and reduced such liabilities as payments are due from the retrocessionaire. In addition, $171.5 million, or 16.4%, was receivable from Transatlantic, $160.0 million, or 15.3%, was receivable from LM, whose obligations are guaranteed by The Prudential and $100.0 million, or 9.5%, was receivable from Continental, 72 which is partially collaterized by funds held arrangements. No other retrocessionaire accounted for more than 5% of the Company receivables. LOSS AND LAE RESERVES. Gross loss and LAE reserves totaled $9,126.7 million at December 31, 2005, $7,836.3 million at December 31, 2004 and $6,361.2 million at December 31, 2003. The increase in 2005 is primarily attributable to increased catastrophe losses, partially offset by favorable net prior period reserve adjustments and reduced premiums earned. The increase in 2004 and 2003 is primarily attributable to increased premiums earned, increase in catastrophe losses and net prior period reserve adjustments in select areas. Normal variability in claim settlements also affected both periods. Effective January 1, 2004, Everest Re sold its United Kingdom branch to Bermuda Re. Business for this branch was previously included in the International segment and is now included in the Bermuda segment. Due to the sale and in accordance with FAS 131, the Company restated the International and Bermuda segments for the years ended December 31, 2003 to conform to December 31, 2005 and 2004 segment reporting. The following tables summarize gross outstanding loss and LAE reserves by segment, segregated into case reserves and IBNR reserves, which are managed on a combined basis, for the periods indicated: Gross Reserves By Segment As of December 31, 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Case Reserves IBNR Reserves Total Reserves % of Total U.S. Reinsurance $ 1,654,597 $ 2,423,192 $ 4,077,789 44.7 % U.S. Insurance 583,729 948,288 1,532,017 16.8 % Specialty Underwriting 273,369 184,719 458,088 5.0 % International 577,276 434,541 1,011,817 11.1 % Bermuda 618,066 779,465 1,397,531 15.3 % Total excluding A&E 3,707,037 4,770,205 8,477,242 92.9 % A&E 526,210 123,250 649,460 7.1 % Total including A&E $ 4,233,247 $ 4,893,455 $ 9,126,702 100.0 % As of December 31, 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Case Reserves IBNR Reserves Total Reserves % of Total U.S. Reinsurance $ 1,354,647 $ 2,174,762 $ 3,529,409 45.0 % U.S. Insurance 599,200 793,451 1,392,651 17.7 % Specialty Underwriting 215,187 158,793 373,980 4.8 % International 421,804 359,073 780,877 10.0 % Bermuda 425,273 605,791 1,031,064 13.2 % Total excluding A&E 3,016,111 4,091,870 7,107,981 90.7 % A&E 571,939 156,386 728,325 9.3 % Total including A&E $ 3,588,050 $ 4,248,256 $ 7,836,306 100.0 % 73 As of December 31, 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Case Reserves IBNR Reserves Total Reserves % of Total U.S. Reinsurance $ 1,271,956 $ 1,835,902 $ 3,107,858 48.9 % U.S. Insurance 445,802 620,895 1,066,697 16.7 % Specialty Underwriting 228,572 80,839 309,411 4.9 % International 353,686 149,717 503,403 7.9 % Bermuda 256,059 352,559 608,618 9.6 % Total excluding A&E 2,556,075 3,039,912 5,595,987 88.0 % A&E 483,433 281,824 765,257 12.0 % Total including A&E $ 3,039,508 $ 3,321,736 $ 6,361,244 100.0 % The changes by segment generally reflect changes in earned premium, changes in business mix, the impact of reserve re-estimations and changes in catastrophe loss reserves, together with claim settlement activity. The fluctuations for A&E reflect the impact of reserve re-evaluations and claim settlement activity. The Company loss and LAE reserves reflect estimates of ultimate claim liability. Such estimates are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis, including re-estimates of prior period reserves, taking into consideration all available information and, in particular, newly reported loss and claim experience. The effect of such re-evaluations impacts incurred losses for the current period. The Company notes that its analytical methods and processes operate at multiple levels including individual contracts, groupings of like contracts, classes and lines of business, internal business units, segments, legal entities, and in the aggregate. The complexities of the Company business and operations require analyses and adjustments, both qualitative and quantitative, at these various levels. Additionally, the attribution of reserves, change in reserves and incurred losses between accident year and underwriting year requires adjustments and allocations, both qualitative and quantitative, at these various levels. All of these processes, methods and practices appropriately balance actuarial science, business expertise and management judgment in a manner intended to assure the accuracy, precision and consistency of the Company reserving practices, which are fundamental to the Company operation. The Company notes however, that the underlying reserves remain estimates, which are subject to variation, and that the relative degree of variability is generally least when reserves are considered in the aggregate and generally increases as the focus shifts to more granular data levels. There can be no assurance that reserves for, and losses from, claim obligations will not increase in the future. However, management believes that the Company existing reserves and reserving methodologies lessen the probability that any such increase would have a material adverse effect on the Company financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In this context, the Company notes that over the past 10 years, its past calendar year operations have been affected variably by effects from prior period reserve re-estimates, with such effects ranging from a favorable $62.1 million in 1997, representing 2.2% of the net prior period reserves for the year in which the adjustment was made, to an unfavorable $249.4 million in 2004, representing 3.7% of the net prior period reserves for the year in which the adjustment was made. The Company has noted that variability had increased for years 1999 to 2003 and has taken actions to attempt to reduce this year to year variability prospectively. 74 The following table represents the reserve levels and ranges as of December 31, 2005 for each of the Company business segments. Outstanding Reserves and Ranges By Segment (1) As of December 31, 2005 (Dollars in thousands) As Reported Low Range % (2) Low Range (2) High Range % (2) High Range (2) Gross Reserves By Segment U.S. Reinsurance $ 4,077,789 -10.2 % $ 3,663,855 10.2 % $ 4,491,723 U.S. Insurance 1,532,017 -14.0 % 1,317,676 14.0 % 1,746,358 Specialty Underwriting 458,088 -12.6 % 400,578 12.6 % 515,598 International 1,011,817 -9.4 % 916,897 9.4 % 1,106,737 Bermuda 1,397,531 -8.0 % 1,286,049 8.0 % 1,509,013 Total Gross Reserves (excluding A&E) 8,477,242 -8.0 % 7,797,978 8.0 % 9,156,506 A&E (All Segments) (3) (4) 649,460 N A 649,460 N A 649,460 Total Gross Reserves (4) $ 9,126,702 N A $ 8,447,438 N A $ 9,805,966 ______________ (1) There can be no assurance that reserves will not ultimately exceed the indicated ranges, requiring additional income statement expense. (2) Although totals are displayed for both the low range and high range amounts, it should be noted that statistically the range of the total is not equal to the sum of the ranges of the segments. (3) Given the uncertainties surrounding the settlement of A&E losses, management is unable to establish a range for these obligations. As a result, these reserves which relate principally to the U.S. Reinsurance and Bermuda segments, have been segregated from reserves for which a range has been determined. (4) NA means not applicable The Company has included ranges for loss reserve estimates determined by the Company actuaries, which are derived through a combination of objective and subjective criteria. The Company notes that its presentation of this information is not directly comparable to similar presentations of other companies as there are no consistently applied actuarial or accounting standards governing such presentations. The Company further notes that its recorded reserves reflect the Company best point estimate of its liabilities and that its actuarial methodologies focus on such point estimates around which ranges are subsequently developed. Depending on the specific segment, the range derived for the loss reserves, excluding reserves for A&E exposures, ranges from minus 8.0% to minus 14.0% for the low range and from plus 8.0% to plus 14.0% for the high range. Both the higher and lower ranges are associated with the U.S. Insurance segment. Within each range, management best estimate of loss reserves is based on the point estimate derived by the Company actuaries in detailed reserve studies. Such ranges are necessarily subjective due to the lack of generally accepted actuarial standards with respect to their development. In particular, the Company notes that the width of the range is dependent on the level of confidence associated with the outcome. For the above presentation, management has assumed what it believes is a reasonable confidence level but notes that there can be no assurance that the Company claim obligations will not vary within and potentially outside of these ranges, requiring incurred loss adjustments in the period the variability is recognized. The Company is not able to establish a meaningful range for A&E reserves. Additional losses, including those relating to latent injuries, and other exposures, which are as yet unrecognized, the type or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by the Company or the reinsurance and insurance industry generally, may emerge in the future. Such future emergence, to the extent not covered by existing retrocessional contracts, could have material adverse effects on the Company future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 75 The Company generally has exposure to A&E losses through its Mt. McKinley operation with respect to insurance policies and through Everest Re with respect to reinsurance contracts. In each case, the Company management and analysis of its exposures takes into account a number of features of its business that differentiate the Company exposures from many other insurers and reinsurers that have significant A&E exposures. Mt. McKinley began writing small amounts of A&E exposed insurance in 1975 and increased the volume of its writings in 1977. These writings ceased in 1984, giving Mt. McKinley an approximate 10-year window of potential A&E exposure, which is appreciably shorter than is the case for many companies with significant A&E exposure. Additionally, due to changes in and standardization of policy forms, it is rare for policies in the 1970s and 1980s to have been issued without aggregate limits on at least the product liability coverage offered; policies issued in earlier decades are generally more at risk of not having aggregate limits. The vast majority of Mt. McKinley A&E exposed insurance policies are excess casualty policies, with aggregate coverage limits, which by definition also have protection afforded by underlying coverage. Mt. McKinley attachment points vary but usually are protected by millions, often tens of millions, of dollars of underlying coverage. The excess nature of most of Mt. McKinley policies also offers protection against non-product claims (for example, claims arising under general liability coverage). Although under some circumstances an excess policy could be exposed to non-product claims, such claims generally pose more of a risk to primary policies because non-product claims are generally less likely to aggregate. In addition, environmental claims arise under general liability coverage, and generally do not aggregate. Thus, these claims tend to create exposure for primary policies to a greater extent than excess policies. Virtually all of the Mt. McKinley policies that are still potentially exposed to claims have policy language providing that expenses were paid within limits rather than in addition to limits. This is a substantial difference from primary coverage, which would most often cover expenses in addition to limits. Everest Re was formed in 1973 but was not fully engaged in underwriting casualty business, under which A&E exposures generally arise, until 1974, and it effectively eliminated A&E exposures through contract exclusions effected in 1984. Therefore, Everest Re has an approximate 11-year window of A&E exposure, much shorter than that of many reinsurance companies that have significant A&E exposures. In the earlier years of its existence, Everest Re was not as heavily involved in casualty business as in property business, which generally is not exposed to asbestos claims. Everest Re generally took smaller lines of exposure per contract than many other reinsurers operating in the casualty reinsurance market and those lines were generally also smaller than the excess limits provided by Mt. McKinley policies. This means that the potential adverse development on Everest Re reinsurance business would not be subject to the same level of volatility as would be the case for companies having greater exposures per risk. Everest Re reinsured both primary and excess policies. However, its claim experience to date indicates that the majority of its reinsurance supported excess policies. As a result, most of Everest Re exposure derives from excess policies similar to those written by Mt. McKinley. With respect to both the Mt. McKinley and Everest Re operations, the Company was not a member of the Asbestos Claims Facility ( Wellington ) or the Center for Claims Resolution ( CCR ) claim settlement facilities. Insurers supporting those facilities made broad commitments concerning the application of insurance coverage to asbestos claims. With respect to its direct insurance exposures, the fact that the Company has not made those commitments may allow it to resolve insurance exposure to Wellington/CCR insureds more economically than if it had joined these facilities. With respect to its reinsurance exposures, although the Company was not a signatory to the Wellington or CCR facilities, it issued reinsurance contracts to ceding companies that were signatories. Because the insurers supporting these facilities have generally paid their exposures more quickly than non-signatory insurers, the Company believes that this has generally meant that it has paid its reinsurance exposure more quickly than it likely would have if it had not been subject to Wellington/CCR payments. 76 The Company believes that its A&E exposures are unique and differentiated, by the points noted above, from those insurers and reinsurers with appreciable A&E exposure but there can be no assurance that such factors will protect the Company from adverse development, perhaps material, or allow it to secure advantages in the settlement of its claims obligations. The following table summarizes incurred losses with respect to A&E on both a gross and net of retrocessions basis for the periods indicated: Asbestos and Environmental Reserves Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Gross Basis: Beginning of period reserves $ 728.3 $ 765.3 $ 667.9 Incurred losses and LAE: Reported losses 110.2 297.1 128.6 Change in IBNR (33.1 ) (125.4 ) 44.0 Total incurred losses and LAE 77.1 171.7 172.6 Paid losses (155.9 ) (208.7 ) (75.2 ) End of period reserves $ 649.5 $ 728.3 $ 765.3 Net Basis: Beginning of period reserves $ 506.7 $ 534.4 $ 527.5 Incurred losses and LAE: Reported losses 102.3 271.8 15.9 Change in IBNR (20.9 ) (112.4 ) 34.3 Total incurred losses and LAE 81.4 159.4 50.2 Paid losses (137.7 ) (187.1 ) (43.3 ) End of period reserves $ 450.4 $ 506.7 $ 534.4 At December 31, 2005, the gross reserves for A&E losses were comprised of $125.2 million representing case reserves reported by ceding companies, $157.6 million representing additional case reserves established by the Company on assumed reinsurance claims, $243.5 million representing case reserves established by the Company on direct insurance claims, including Mt. McKinley, and $123.2 million representing IBNR reserves. The gross incurred losses for A&E exposures increased by $77.1 million and $171.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These increases are the result of re-evaluations by management reflecting additional information received from insureds and ceding companies, ongoing litigation, additional claims received and settlement activity. Management closely monitors this additional information and adjusts reserves accordingly. The net incurred losses primarily reflect the impact of the reinsurance agreement between Mt. McKinley and LM. Industry analysts have developed a measurement, known as the survival ratio, to compare the A&E reserves among companies with such liabilities. The survival ratio is typically calculated by dividing a company current net reserves by the three year average of paid losses, and therefore measures the number of years that it would take to exhaust the current reserves based on historical payment patterns. Using this measurement, the Company net three year A&E survival ratio was 3.7 years at December 31, 2005. Adjusting for the effect of the reinsurance ceded under the reinsurance agreement with LM, this ratio rises to the equivalent of 5.0 years at December 31, 2005. The cession of $160.0 million to the stop loss reinsurance provided by LM in connection with the acquisition of Mt. McKinley results in unpaid proceeds that are not reflected in past net payments and effectively extend the funding available for future net payments. 77 Because the survival ratio was developed as a comparative measure of reserve strength and not of absolute reserve adequacy, the Company considers, but does not rely on, the survival ratio when evaluating its reserves. In particular, the Company notes that loss payout variability, which can be material, due in part to the Company orientation to negotiated settlements, particularly on its Mt. McKinley exposures, significantly impairs the credibility and utility of this measure as an analytical tool. During 2005, the Company made asbestos net claim payments of $68.0 million on Mt McKinley high profile claimants where the claim was either closed or a settlement was reached. Such payments, which are non-repetitive, do for 2005, and will for 2006 and 2007, distort the Company three year survival ratio. Adjusting for such settlements, recognizing total settlements are generally considered fully reserved to an agreed settlement, the Company considers that its adjusted A&E survival ratio for net unsettled claims is 10.7 years, which is closer to prevailing industry norms. Developments in 2005 and 2004 affecting asbestos exposures in general and the Company asbestos exposures in particular, together with enhancements in the Company claim management and analytical processes, resulted in the reserve strengthening noted earlier. These developments and actions have increased the emphasis on asbestos exposures as a separate component of the Company A&E exposures. Despite the Company approach of handling A&E exposures on a combined basis, management believes additional disclosure of the asbestos element of its A&E exposures is appropriate. The following tables summarize reserve and claim activity for asbestos claims, on both a gross and net of ceded reinsurance basis, for the periods indicated with particular emphasis on the differentiation of insured categories within the Mt. McKinley operation, which the Company believes reflects the most volatile element of its asbestos exposures for the years ended December 31: 78 Gross Asbestos Exposures (1) (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Beginning of period reserves: Direct Operations (Mt.

This three year survival ratio, when adjusted for the effect of the reinsurance ceded under the stop loss cover from LM, was 4.8 years and, when adjusted for settlements in place and structured settlements, which are either fully funded by reserves or subject to financial terms that substantially limit the potential variability in the liability, and the stop loss protection from LM, was 12.3 years. SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. The Company shareholders equity increased to $4,139.7 million as of December 31, 2005 from $3,712.5 million as of December 31, 2004, principally reflecting $758.3 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common shares, partially offset by $218.7 million net loss for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $77.8 million in net unrealized appreciation of investments, a $27.0 million decrease in foreign currency translation, $25.4 million in shareholder dividends and an increase of $2.9 million in the minimum pension liability. The Company shareholders equity increased to $3,712.5 million as of December 31, 2004 from $3,164.9 million as of December 31, 2003, principally reflecting $494.9 million of net income for the year ended December 31, 2004, $26.5 million in net proceeds from options exercised, an increase of $25.7 million in net unrealized appreciation of investments and a $22.9 million increase in foreign currency translation, partially offset by $22.4 million in shareholder dividends. Dividends of $25.4 million, $22.4 million and $19.6 million were declared and paid by the Company in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CAPITAL. The Company business operations are in part dependent on the Company financial strength, and the market perception thereof, as measured by shareholders equity, which was $4,139.7 million and $3,712.5 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company has flexibility with respect to capitalization as a result of its perceived financial strength, including its financial strength ratings as assigned by independent rating agencies, and its access to the debt and equity markets. The Company continuously monitors its capital and financial position, as well as investment and security market conditions, both in general and with respect to the Company securities, and responds accordingly. From time to time, the Company has used open market share repurchases to effectively adjust its capital position. It made no such purchases in 2005 or in 2004. In September 2004, the Company authorization to purchase its shares was amended to authorize the repurchase of up to 5 million shares. The Company notes that, outside of its open market repurchase program, it repurchased 10,430 shares in 2005 and 4,800 shares in 2004 from employees in connection with restricted share vestings where individual employees chose to discharge withholding tax liabilities on vesting shares by the surrender of a portion of such shares and 328 shares in 2005 from a non-employee in connection with payment of the option exercise price. At December 31, 2005, 5 million shares remained under the existing repurchase authorization. On December 1, 2005 under the new registration and offering revisions to the Securities Act of 1933, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, as a Well Known Seasoned Issuer. Generally, under this shelf registration statement, Group is authorized to issue common shares, preferred shares, debt securities, warrants and hybrid securities, Holdings is authorized to issue debt securities and Everest Re Capital Trust III ( Capital Trust III ) is authorized to issue trust preferred securities. On December 1, 2005, the Company issued 2,238,000 of its common shares at a price of $102.89 per share, which resulted in $236.4 million of proceeds before expenses of approximately $0.3 million and Holdings sold Group shares it acquired in 2002 at a price of $102.89 per share, which resulted in $46.5 million of proceeds, before expenses of approximately $0.2 million. On June 27, 2003, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, providing for the issuance of up to $975 million of securities. Generally, under this shelf registration statement, Group was authorized to issue common shares, preferred shares, debt securities, warrants and hybrid securities, Holdings was authorized to issue debt securities and Capital Trust II and Capital Trust III were authorized to issue trust 81 preferred securities. This shelf registration statement became effective on December 22, 2003 and was exhausted with the October 6, 2005 transaction described below. The following securities were pursuant to that registration statement. On March 29, 2004, Capital Trust II, an unconsolidated affiliate, issued trust preferred securities resulting in a takedown from the shelf registration statement of $320 million. In conjunction with the issuance of Capital Trust II trust preferred securities, Holdings issued $329.9 million of 6.20% junior subordinated debt securities due March 29, 2034 to Capital Trust II. Part of the proceeds from the junior subordinated debt securities issuance was used for capital contributions to Holdings operating subsidiaries. On October 6, 2004, Holdings completed a public offering of $250.0 million principal amount of 5.40% senior notes due October 15, 2014. The net proceeds were used to retire existing debt at Holdings, which was due and retired on March 15, 2005. On October 6, 2005, the Company expanded the size of the remaining shelf registration to $486.0 million by filing under Rule 462(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and General Instruction IV of Form S-3 promulgated there under. On the same date, the Company entered into an agreement to issue 5,200,000 of its common shares at a price of $91.50 per share, which resulted in $475.8 million in proceeds received on October 12, 2005, before expenses of approximately $0.3 million. This transaction effectively exhausted the December 22, 2003 shelf registration. On July 30, 2002, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, providing for the issuance of up to $475.0 million of securities. Generally, under this shelf registration statement, Group was authorized to issue common shares, preferred shares, debt securities, warrants and hybrid securities, Holdings was authorized to issue debt securities and Capital Trust was authorized to issue trust preferred securities. This shelf registration statement became effective on September 26, 2002 and was effectively exhausted with the April 23, 2003 transaction described below. The following securities were issued pursuant to that registration statement. On November 14, 2002, pursuant to a trust agreement between Holdings and JPMorgan Chase Bank, the property trustee, and Chase Manhattan Bank USA, the Delaware trustee, Capital Trust, an unconsolidated affiliate, completed a public offering of $210.0 million of 7.85% trust preferred securities, resulting in net proceeds of $203.4 million. The proceeds of the issuance were used to purchase $210 million of 7.85% junior subordinated debt securities of Holdings that will be held in trust by the property trustee for the benefit of the holders of the trust preferred securities. In conjunction with the issuance of Capital Trust trust preferred securities, Holdings issued $216.5 million of 7.85% junior subordinated debt securities due November 15, 2032 to Capital Trust. The proceeds from the junior subordinated debt securities issuance were primarily used for capital contributions to Holdings operating subsidiaries. On April 23, 2003, the Company expanded the size of the remaining shelf registration to $318 million by filing a post-effective amendment under Rule 462(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and General Instruction IV of Form S-3 promulgated thereunder. On the same date, the Company issued 4,480,135 of its common shares at a price of $70.75 per share, which resulted in $317.0 million in proceeds, before expenses of approximately $0.2 million. This transaction effectively exhausted the September 26, 2002 shelf registration. Capital Trust will redeem all of the outstanding trust preferred securities when the junior subordinated debt securities are paid at maturity on November 15, 2032. Holdings may elect to redeem the junior subordinated debt securities, in whole or in part, at any time after November 14, 2007. If such an early redemption occurs, the outstanding trust preferred securities would also be proportionately redeemed. 82 On March 14, 2000, Holdings completed public offerings of $200.0 million principal amount of 8.75% senior notes due March 15, 2010 and $250.0 million principal amount of 8.5% senior notes due and retired March 15, 2005. During 2000, the net proceeds of these offerings and additional funds were distributed by Holdings to Group. LIQUIDITY. The Company current investment strategy generally seeks to maximize after-tax income through a high quality, diversified, taxable bond and tax-preferenced fixed maturity portfolio, while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity. The Company mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted continuously, consistent with the Company current and projected operating results, market conditions and tax position. With changes the Company perceives in overall investment market conditions, the Company continues to reweight its view of total return and added $440.0 million in 2005 and $496.5 million in 2004 of equity securities into the overall investment portfolio. The Company liquidity requirements are generally met from positive cash flow from operations. Positive cash flow results from reinsurance and insurance premiums being collected prior to disbursements for claims, which disbursements generally take place over an extended period after the collection of premiums, sometimes a period of many years. Collected premiums are generally invested, prior to their use in such disbursements, and investment income provides additional funding for loss payments. The Company net cash flows from operating activities were $1,065.7 million, $1,487.6 million and $1,653.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Additionally, these cash flows reflected net tax payments of $110.9 million, $100.0 million and $52.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively; net catastrophe loss payments of $459.7 million, $200.9 million and $96.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively; and net A&E settlements of $137.7 million, $187.1 million and $43.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in net cash flows from operations in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to higher claim payments on catastrophes combined with lower premium volume. The decrease in cash flow in 2004 compared with 2003 was primarily due to higher claim payments on catastrophes and increased A&E settlements. In periods for which disbursements for claims and benefits, policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses exceed premium inflows, cash flow from insurance operations would be negative. The effect on cash flow from operations would be partially offset by cash flow from investment income. Additionally, cash flow from investment maturities and dispositions, both short term investments and longer term maturities, would further mitigate the impact on total cash flow. As the exact timing of the payment of claims and benefits cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company maintains portfolios of long term invested assets with varying maturities, along with short-term investments that are intended to provide adequate cash for payment of claims. At December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 the Company held cash and short-term investments of $1,551.0 million and $770.8 million, respectively. Part of the elevated short-term cash position will be used to pay catastrophe claims. In addition to these cash and short-term investments at December 31, 2005, the Company had $0.4 billion, at fair value, of available for sale fixed maturity securities maturing within one year or less, $2.5 billion maturing within one to five years and $7.2 billion maturing after five years. The Company $1.1 billion of equity securities are comprised primarily of securities that can be easily liquidated. These fixed maturity and equity securities, in conjunction with the short-term investments and positive cash flow from operations, provide adequate sources of liquidity for the expected payment of losses in the near future. The Company does not anticipate selling securities or using available credit facilities to pay losses and LAE but has the ability to do so. Sales might result in realized capital gains or losses and the Company notes that at December 31, 2005 it had $214.6 million of net unrealized appreciation, net of $125.5 million of taxes, comprised of $443.1 million of pre-tax appreciation and $103.0 million of pre-tax depreciation. 83 Management expects the trend of positive cash flow from operations, which in general reflects the strength of overall pricing, to persist over the near term; however, this continuing underlying trend will be negatively impacted by future catastrophe payments. In the intermediate and long term, the trend will be impacted by the extent to which competitive pressures change overall pricing available in the Company markets and the extent to which the Company successfully maintains its strategy of emphasizing profitability over volume. Effective December 8, 2004, Group, Bermuda Re, and Everest International entered into a three year, $750 million senior credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the Group Credit Facility ). Wachovia Bank is the administrative agent for the Group Credit Facility. The Group Credit Facility consists of two tranches. Tranche one provides up to $250 million of revolving credit for liquidity and general corporate purposes, and for the issuance of standby letters of credit. The interest on the revolving loans shall, at the option of each of the borrowers, be either (1) Base Rate (as defined below) or (2) an adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus a margin. The Base Rate is the higher of the rate of interest established by Wachovia Bank from time to time as its prime rate or the Federal Funds rate, in each case plus 0.5% per annum. The amount of margin and the fees payable for the Group Credit Facility depend on Group senior unsecured debt rating. Tranche two exclusively provides up to $500 million for the issuance of standby letters of credit on a collateralized basis. The Group Credit Facility requires Group to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1 and to maintain a minimum net worth amount. Minimum net worth is an amount equal to the sum of (i) $2,599 million (base amount) plus (ii) (A) 25% of consolidated net income for each of Group fiscal quarters and (B) 50% of any increase in consolidated net worth attributable to the issuance of ordinary and preferred shares. The base amount is reset at the end of each fiscal year to be the greater of 70% of Group consolidated net worth as of the last day of the fiscal year and the calculated minimum amount of net worth prior to the last day of the fiscal year. As of December 31, 2005, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. During the year ended December 31, 2005, there were no borrowings under tranche one of the Group Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had $122.2 million of letters of credit outstanding under tranche two of the Group Credit Facility. In addition, the Company had $228.3 million in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005 under a $350 million bilateral agreement with Citibank. All of these letters of credit are collateralized by the Company cash and investments. These letters of credit are generally used to collateralize reinsurance assumed by Bermuda Re from jurisdictions where collateralization is generally required for the ceding company to receive credit for such reinsurance recoverables from its principal regulator. Bermuda Re and Everest International also used trust arrangements to provide collateralization to ceding companies, including affiliates. The Company generally avoids providing collateral except where required for ceding companies to receive credit from their regulators. Additionally, at December 31, 2005, $164.4 million of assets were deposited in trust accounts, primarily on behalf of Bermuda Re, as security for assumed losses payable to certain non-affiliated ceding companies. Effective October 10, 2003, Holdings entered into a three year, $150.0 million senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders, replacing the December 21, 1999 three year senior revolving credit facility, which expired on December 19, 2003. Both the October 10, 2003 and December 21, 1999 senior revolving credit agreements, which have similar terms, are referred to as the Holdings Credit Facility . Wachovia Bank is the administrative agent for the Holdings Credit Facility. The Holdings Credit Facility is used for liquidity and general corporate purposes. The Holdings Credit Facility provides for the borrowing of up to $150.0 million with interest at a rate selected by Holdings equal to either, (1) the Base Rate (as defined below) or (2) an adjusted LIBOR plus a margin. The Base Rate is the higher of the rate of interest established by Wachovia Bank from time to time as its prime rate or the Federal Funds rate, in each case plus 0.5% per annum. The amount of margin and the fees payable for the Holdings Credit Facility depends upon Holdings senior unsecured debt rating. 84 The Holdings Credit Facility requires Holdings to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1, Holdings to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.5 to 1 and Everest Re to maintain its statutory surplus at $1.0 billion plus 25% of future aggregate net income and 25% of future aggregate capital contributions after December 31, 2002. As of December 31, 2005, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. During the year ended December 31, 2005, there were no payments made and no incremental borrowings under the Holdings Credit Facility. During the year ended December 31, 2004, there were payments made of $70.0 million and there were no incremental borrowings made under Holdings Credit Facility. During the year ended December 31, 2003, there were no payments made and no incremental borrowings made under Holdings Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, there were outstanding Holdings Credit Facility borrowings of $0.0 million, $0.0 million and $70.0 million, respectively. Interest expense and fees incurred in connection with the Group Credit Facility and the Holdings Credit Facility were $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Interest expense and fees incurred in connection with the Holdings Credit Facility were $1.2 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company 2005 total cash flow, as distinguished from its cash flow from operations, activity in 2005 included $758.3 million of new investable cash from Group issuance of common shares and Holdings sale of Group shares. The total cash flow activity in 2004 included $320.0 million of new investable cash from Holdings issuance of junior subordinated debt securities in March and $246.7 million of new investable cash from Holdings issuance of senior notes securities in October. The total cash flow activity in 2003 included $316.8 million of new investable cash resulting from Group offering of common shares in April of that year. EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHES. Like other insurance and reinsurance companies, the Company is exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single occurrence, whether a natural event, such as a hurricane or an earthquake, or other catastrophe, such as an explosion at a major factory. Any such catastrophic event could generate insured losses in one or more of the Company reinsurance treaties, facultative certificates, or across lines of business, including property and/or casualty. The Company focuses on potential losses that can be generated by any single event as part of its evaluation and monitoring of its aggregate exposures to catastrophic events. Accordingly, the Company employs various techniques to estimate the amount of loss it could sustain from any single catastrophic event in various geographic areas. These techniques range from non-modeled deterministic approaches such as tracking aggregate limits exposed in catastrophe-prone zones and applying historic damage factors to modeled approaches that scientifically measure catastrophe risks using sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation techniques that provide insights into the frequency and severity of expected losses on a probabilistic basis. To date, there is not one universal model capable of projecting the amount and probability of loss in all global geographical regions that the Company conducts business. In addition, the form, quality, and granularity of underwriting exposure data furnished by ceding companies is not always fully aligned with the data requirements for the Company licensed model(s) creating potential imprecision in the potential loss projections. Further, the results from multiple models and analytical methods must be combined and interpolated to estimate potential losses by and across business units. Such combination techniques are inherently difficult to apply and may affect the precision of the Company estimates. Also, most models have not been accurate in forecasting losses from the unprecedented series of hurricanes that impacted the insurance industry in 2004 and 2005. In particular, many models did not fully consider some of the perils and factors, which have been major contributors to the scale of events like the Katrina loss, such as flood, storm surge, and potential demand surge. Finally, uncertainties with respect to future climate patterns and cycles introduce significant uncertainty with respect to the accuracy of loss projections from models using historic long-term frequency and severity data. 85 Nevertheless, when combined with traditional risk management and sound underwriting judgment, catastrophe models continue to be a useful tool for underwriters to price cat-exposed risks and for providing management with quantitative analysis with regard to monitoring and managing its catastrophe risk exposure by zone and risk hazard. Projected losses with respect to catastrophe events are generally summarized in terms of the probable maximum loss or PML. The Company defines PML as its anticipated loss, taking into account contract terms and limits, caused by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area, such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake. The expected PML will vary with the severity of modeled simulated losses and vary with the in-force book of business. The projected severity levels are described in terms of return periods , such as 100-year events and 250-year events . Simply speaking, a 100-year PML corresponds to a 1% probability that losses from an event could exceed the indicated PML; alternatively, it corresponds to a 99% probability that the loss distribution for an event falls below the indicated PML. From a risk management perspective, the Company continues to manage its catastrophe risk such that its largest individual 100-year event, on an after-tax basis, generally does not exceed approximately one-half of projected net income. Management also monitors its largest PMLs at multiple points along the loss distribution curve, such as loss amounts at the 20, 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1,000 year return periods. This monitoring procedure enables management to identify discrete risk zone and risk hazard exposure accumulations for integration into risk, underwriting and capital management processes. The Company catastrophe loss projections, segmented by risk zones, are updated quarterly and reviewed as part of a formal risk management review process. The Company believes that the greatest 1 in 100 year catastrophe exposure world wide from any single event is to a hurricane affecting the U.S. southeast coast where the Company estimates it has a pre-tax PML exposure of $532 million. See also table under Risk Management and Retrocession Arrangements . If such a single catastrophe loss were to occur, management estimates that the effect on the Company income before and after taxes would be approximately $532 million and $415 million, respectively. Such impact represents approximately 10.0% of the Company beginning of year capital. Such estimates involve multiple variables, including which Everest entity would experience the loss, and as a result there can be no assurance that this amount would not be exceeded. The Company employs a retrocessional approach under which the Company may purchase reinsurance to cover specific business written or as a corporate level retrocessional program covering the potential accumulation or aggregation of exposures across some or all of the Company operations. All reinsurance purchasing decisions consider both the potential coverage and market conditions with respect to the pricing, terms, conditions and availability of such coverage, with the aim of securing cost effective protection. The level of reinsurance coverage varies over time, reflecting the underwriter and/or Company view of the changing dynamics of both the underlying exposure and the reinsurance markets. For 2004, 2005 and thus far in 2006, the Company has chosen not to purchase corporate retrocessional protection and to generally de-emphasize the purchase of specific reinsurance by its underwriters, reflecting the Company view that its exposures, in the context of its capital and financial position and current market pricing, do not warrant reinsurance purchases at currently unattractive retrocessional price levels. For 1999, 2000 and 2001, the Company purchased accident year aggregate excess of loss retrocession coverage, which provided up to $175.0 million of recoveries per accident year if Everest Re consolidated statutory basis accident year loss ratio exceeded a loss ratio attachment point provided in the contract for the respective accident years. Each arrangement provided for an adjustment premium, which reduces the net benefit by approximately 50%, in the event that the coverage is used. There are no remaining limits available under these 86 coverages. See ITEM 1, Business Risk Management of Underwriting and Retrocession Arrangements for further details. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. The following table shows the Company contractual obligations for the year ended December 31, 2005: (Dollars in millions) Payments due by period Contractual obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years 8.75% Senior notes $ 200.0 $ - $ - $ 200.0 $ - 5.4% Senior notes 250.0 - - - 250.0 Junior subordinated debt 546.4 - - - 546.4 Interest expense 1,205.9 67.3 134.7 125.9 878.0 Employee benefit plans 6.4 6.4 - - - Operating lease agreements 31.2 6.0 12.1 10.7 2.4 Gross reserve for losses and LAE (1) 9,126.7 2,220.2 3,215.7 983.5 2,707.3 Total $ 11,366.6 $ 2,299.9 $ 3,362.5 $ 1,320.1 $ 4,384.1 ______________ (1) Loss and LAE reserves represent the Company best estimate of losses from claim and related settlement costs. Both the amounts and timing of such payments are estimates, and the inherent variability of resolving claims as well as changes in market conditions make the timing of cash outflows uncertain. Therefore, the ultimate amount and timing of loss and LAE payments could differ from the Company estimates. The senior notes and junior subordinated debt contractual obligations are the responsibility of Holdings. While the Company has sufficient cash flow, liquidity, investments and access to capital markets to satisfy these obligations, Holdings generally depends for its funding upon dividends from Everest Re, its operating insurance subsidiary, capital contributions from Group or access to the capital markets. The Company various operating insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries have sufficient cash flow, liquidity and investments to settle outstanding reserves for losses and LAE. Management believes that the Company, and each of its entities, have sufficient financial resources, or ready access thereto, to meet all obligations. DIVIDENDS During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company declared and paid shareholder dividends of $25.4 million, $22.4 million and $19.6 million, respectively. As an insurance holding company, the Company is partially dependent on dividends and other permitted payments from its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to its shareholders. The payment of dividends to Group by Holdings and to Holdings by Everest Re is subject to Delaware regulatory restrictions and the payment of dividends to Group by Bermuda Re is subject to Bermuda insurance regulatory restrictions. Management expects that, absent extraordinary catastrophe losses, such restrictions should not affect Everest Re ability to declare and pay dividends sufficient to support Holdings general corporate needs and Holdings and Bermuda Re ability to declare and pay dividends sufficient to support Group general corporate needs. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, Everest Re paid dividends to Holdings of $75 million, $70 million and $45 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 Bermuda Re paid dividends to Group of $45 million and $15 million, respectively. See ITEM 1, Business Regulatory Matters Dividends and Note 14A of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. APPLICATION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Financial Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ( FIN 46 ). FIN 46 addresses whether certain types of entities, referred to as variable interest entities ( VIEs ), should be consolidated or deconsolidated in a company financial statements. During December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46R, replacing FIN 46. FIN 46R became 87 effective, for entities that had not adopted FIN 46 as of December 24, 2003. The Company adopted FIN 46R in the first quarter of 2004, resulting in the deconsolidation of Capital Trust and Capital Trust II. For 2003, where applicable, the financial statements have been restated to reflect the deconsolidation. In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Statement 123(R) Share-Based Payment ( FAS 123(R) ). FAS 123(R) requires all share-based compensation awards granted, modified or settled after December 15, 1994 to be accounted for using the fair value method of accounting. Under the modified prospective application, compensation cost is recognized for the outstanding, non-vested awards based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated under FAS 123. As the Company implemented FAS 123 prospectively for grants issued on or after January 1, 2002, the Company does not expect the adoption of the statement to have a material impact on the Company financial condition or results of operation. The application of FAS 123(R) will become effective for fiscal years starting after June 15, 2005. The Company will adopt FAS 123(R) effective January 1, 2006. In November 2005, the FASB issued the FASB Staff Position ( FSP ) FAS 115-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments ( FAS 115-1 ). FAS 115-1 would be applied prospectively and the effective date would be reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company continues to apply Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities ( FAS 115 ), and the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5:M, Other Than Temporary Impairment Of Certain Investments In Debt And Equity Securities and believes that unrealized losses in its investment portfolio are temporary in nature. MARKET SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS The SEC Financial Reporting Release #48 requires registrants to clarify and expand upon the existing financial statement disclosure requirements for derivative financial instruments, derivative commodity instruments and other financial instruments (collectively, market sensitive instruments ). The Company does not generally enter into market sensitive instruments for trading purposes. The Company current investment strategy seeks to maximize after-tax income through a high quality, diversified, taxable and tax-preferenced fixed maturity portfolio, while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity. The Company mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted continuously, consistent with its current and projected operating results, market conditions and the Company tax position. The fixed maturities in the investment portfolio are comprised of non-trading available for sale securities. Additionally, the Company invests in equity securities, which it believes will enhance the risk-adjusted total return of the investment portfolio. The Company has also engaged in a small number of specialized equity put options. The overall investment strategy considers the scope of present and anticipated Company operations. In particular, estimates of the financial impact resulting from non-investment asset and liability transactions, together with the Company capital structure and other factors, are used to develop a net liability analysis. This analysis includes estimated payout characteristics for which the investments of the Company provide liquidity. This analysis is considered in the development of specific investment strategies for asset allocation, duration and credit quality. The change in overall market sensitive risk exposure principally reflects the asset changes that took place during the period, including a reduction of the duration of the fixed maturity portfolio that in turn reduced the impact of interest rate shift on the entire portfolio. The Company $13.0 billion investment portfolio at December 31, 2005 is principally comprised of fixed maturity securities, which are subject to interest rate risk and foreign currency rate risk, and equity securities, which are subject to equity price risk. The impact of the foreign exchange risks on the investment portfolio is generally mitigated by changes in the value of operating assets and liabilities and their associated income statement impact. 88 Interest rate risk is the potential change in value of the fixed maturity portfolio, including short-term investments, due to change in market interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, it includes prepayment risk on the $1,527.2 million of mortgage-backed securities in the $10,042.1 million fixed maturity portfolio. Prepayment risk results from potential accelerated principal payments that shorten the average life and thus the expected yield of the security. The tables below display the potential impact of market value fluctuations and after-tax unrealized appreciation on the Company fixed maturity portfolio (including $1.4 billion of short-term investments) as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 based on parallel and immediate 200 basis point shifts in interest rates up and down in 100 basis point increments. For legal entities with a U.S. dollar functional currency, this modeling was performed on each security individually. To generate appropriate price estimates on mortgage-backed securities, changes in prepayment expectations under different interest rate environments were taken into account. For legal entities with a non-U.S. dollar functional currency, the effective duration of the involved portfolio of securities was used as a proxy for the market value change under the various interest rate change scenarios. All amounts are in U.S. dollars and are presented in millions. 2005 Interest Rate Shift in Basis Points -200 -100 0 100 200 Total Market Value $ 12,516.8 $ 12,007.4 $ 11,485.9 $ 10,931.9 $ 10,377.0 Market Value Change from Base (%) 9.0 % 4.5 % 0.0 % -4.8 -9.7 Change in Unrealized Appreciation After-tax from Base ($) $ 773.7 $ 390.4 $ - $ (410.7 ) $ (820.7 ) 2004 Interest Rate Shift in Basis Points -200 -100 0 100 200 Total Market Value $ 11,798.6 $ 11,172.8 $ 10,533.0 $ 9,882.1 $ 9,262.2 Market Value Change from Base (%) 12.0 % 6.1 % 0.0 % -6.2 -12.1 Change in Unrealized Appreciation After-tax from Base ($) $ 936.7 $ 472.1 $ - $ (478.9 ) $ (936.3 ) The Company had $9,126.7 million and $7,836.3 million of reserves for losses and LAE as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004. These amounts are recorded at their nominal or estimated ultimate payment amount, as opposed to fair value, which would reflect a discount adjustment to reflect the time value of money. Since losses are paid out over a period of time, the fair value of the reserves is less than the nominal value. As interest rates rise, the fair value of the reserves decreases and, conversely, if interest rates decline, the fair value will increase. These movements are the opposite of the interest rate impacts on the fair value of investments since reserves are future obligations. While the difference between fair value and nominal value is not reflected in the Company financial statements, the Company financial results will include investment income over time from the investment portfolio until the claims are paid. The Company loss and loss reserve obligations have an expected duration of approximately 3.9 years, which is reasonably consistent with the Company fixed income portfolio. If the company were to discount its loss and LAE reserves, net of $1.0 billion of reinsurance receivables on unpaid losses, the discount would be approximately $1.5 billion resulting in a discounted reserve balance of approximately $6.6 billion, representing approximately 57% of the fixed maturity market value. The existence of such obligations, and the variable differential between ultimate and fair value, which in theory applies equally to invested assets and insurance liabilities, provides substantial mitigation of the economic effects of interest rate variability even though such mitigation is not reflected in the Company financial statements. 89 Equity risk is the potential change in market value of the common stock and preferred stock portfolios arising from changing equity prices. The Company equity investments are mainly exchange traded and mutual funds, which invest principally in high quality common and preferred stocks that are traded on the major exchanges in the U.S. The primary objective in managing the equity portfolio is to provide long-term capital growth through market appreciation and income. The tables below display the impact on market value and after-tax unrealized appreciation of a 20% change in equity prices up and down in 10% increments as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. The growth in exposure is primarily due to the growth in the equity portfolio. All amounts are in U.S. dollars and are presented in millions. 2005 Change in Equity Values in Percent -20% -10% 0% 10% 20% Market Value of the Equity Portfolio $ 872.7 $ 981.7 $ 1,090.8 $ 1,199.9 $ 1,309.0 After-tax Change in Unrealized Appreciation $ (146.5 ) $ (73.3 ) $ - $ 73.3 $ 146.5 2004 Change in Equity Values in Percent -20% -10% 0% 10% 20% Market Value of the Equity Portfolio $ 520.7 $ 585.8 $ 650.9 $ 716.0 $ 781.0 After-tax Change in Unrealized Appreciation $ (84.6 ) $ (42.3 ) $ - $ 42.3 $ 84.6 Foreign currency rate risk is the potential change in value, income and cash flow arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Each of the Company non-U.S./Bermuda ( foreign ) operations maintains capital in the currency of the country of its geographic location consistent with local regulatory guidelines. Generally, the Company prefers to maintain the capital of its operations in U.S. dollar assets, although this varies by regulatory jurisdiction in accordance with market needs. Each foreign operation may conduct business in its local currency, as well as the currency of other countries in which it operates. The primary foreign currency exposures for these foreign operations are the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling and the Euro. The Company mitigates foreign exchange exposure by a general matching of the currency and duration of its assets to its corresponding operating liabilities. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52 Foreign Currency Translation , the Company translates the assets, liabilities and income of non-U.S. dollar functional currency legal entities to the U.S. dollar. This translation amount is reported as a component of other comprehensive income. 90 The tables below display the potential impact of a parallel and immediate 20% increase and decrease in foreign exchange rates on the valuation of invested assets subject to foreign currency exposure in 10% increments as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. This analysis includes the after-tax impact of translation from transactional currency to functional currency as well as the after-tax impact of translation from functional currency to the U.S. dollar reporting currency. The reduction in exposure between 2005 and 2004 principally arises from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the British Pound Sterling and the Euro throughout the year. All amounts are in U.S. dollars and are presented in millions. 2005 Change in Foreign Exchange Rates in Percent -20% -10% 0% 10% 20% Total After-tax Foreign Exchange Exposure $ (101.0 ) $ (57.0 ) $ - $ 66.4 $ 139.9 2004 Change in Foreign Exchange Rates in Percent -20% -10% 0% 10% 20% Total After-tax Foreign Exchange Exposure $ (180. 8) $ (95.1 ) $ - $ 102.0 $ 209.2 Although not considered material in the context of the Company aggregate exposure to market sensitive instruments, the Company has issued six specialized equity put options based on the S&P 500 index and one specialized equity put option based on the FTSE 100 index, that are market sensitive and sufficiently unique to warrant supplemental disclosure. The Company has sold six specialized equity put options based on the S&P 500 index for total consideration, net of commissions, of $22.5 million. These contracts each have a single exercise date, with original maturities ranging from 12 to 30 years and strike prices ranging from $1,141.21 to $1,540.63. No amounts will be payable under these contracts if the S&P 500 index is at or above the strike price on the exercise dates, which currently fall between June 2017 and March 2031. If the S&P 500 index is lower than the strike price on the applicable exercise date, the amount due will vary proportionately with the percentage by which the index is below the strike price. Based on historical index volatilities and trends and the December 31, 2005 index value, the Company estimates the probability for each contract of the S&P 500 index being below the strike price on the exercise date to be less than 4.8%. The theoretical maximum payouts under the contracts would occur if on each of the exercise dates the S&P 500 index value were zero. The present value of these theoretical maximum payouts using a 6.0% discount factor is $201.2 million. The company has sold one specialized equity put option based on the FTSE 100 index for total consideration, net of commissions, of $6.7 million. This contract has an exercise date of July 2020 and a strike price of 5,989.75. No amount will be payable under this contract if the FTSE 100 index is at or above the strike price on the exercise date. If the FTSE 100 index is lower than the strike price on the applicable exercise date, the amount due will vary proportionately with the percentage by which the index is below the strike price. Based on historical index volatilities and trends and the December 31, 2005 index value, the Company estimates the probability for this FTSE 100 index contract being below the strike price on the exercise date to be less than 8.4%. The theoretical maximum payout under the contract would occur if on the exercise date the FTSE 100 index value was zero. The present value of the theoretical maximum payout using a 6.0% discount factor and current exchange rate is $24.2 million. As these specialized equity put options are derivatives within the framework of FAS 133, the Company reports the fair value of these instruments in its balance sheet and records any changes to fair value in its statement of operations. The Company has recorded fair values for its obligations on these specialized equity put options at December 31, 2005 and 2004 of $36.3 million and $21.5 million, respectively; however, the Company does not 91 believe that the ultimate settlement of these transactions is likely to require a payment that would exceed the initial consideration received or any payment at all. As there is no active market for these instruments, the determination of their fair value is based on an industry accepted option pricing model, which requires estimates and assumptions, including those regarding volatility and expected rates of return. The tables below estimate the impact of potential movements in interest rates and the equity indices, which are the principal factors affecting fair value of these instruments, looking forward from the fair value at December 31, 2005 and 2004.
