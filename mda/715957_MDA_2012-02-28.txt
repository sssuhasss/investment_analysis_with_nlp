A CCOUNTING M ATTERS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Dominion and Virginia Power have identified the following accounting policies, including certain inherent estimates, that as a result of the judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved, could result in material changes to their financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions. Dominion and Virginia Power have discussed the 32 Table of Contents development, selection and disclosure of each of these policies with the Audit Committees of their Boards of Directors. Virginia Power Board of Directors also serves as its Audit Committee. A CCOUNTING FOR R EGULATED O PERATIONS The accounting for Virginia Power regulated electric and Dominion regulated gas operations differs from the accounting for nonregulated operations in that they are required to reflect the effect of rate regulation in their Consolidated Financial Statements. For regulated businesses subject to federal or state cost-of-service rate regulation, regulatory practices that assign costs to accounting periods may differ from accounting methods generally applied by nonregulated companies. When it is probable that regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, these costs are deferred as regulatory assets that otherwise would be expensed by nonregulated companies. Likewise, regulatory liabilities are recognized when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates or when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that have yet to be incurred. Generally, regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into income over the period authorized by the regulator. The Companies evaluate whether or not recovery of their regulatory assets through future rates is probable and make various assumptions in their analyses. The expectations of future recovery are generally based on orders issued by regulatory commissions or historical experience, as well as discussions with applicable regulatory authorities. If recovery of a regulatory asset is determined to be less than probable, it will be written off in the period such assessment is made. See Notes 13 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. A SSET R ETIREMENT O BLIGATIONS Dominion and Virginia Power recognize liabilities for the expected cost of retiring tangible long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists and the ARO can be reasonably estimated. These AROs are recognized at fair value as incurred and are capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived assets. In the absence of quoted market prices, the Companies estimate the fair value of their AROs using present value techniques, in which they make various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, credit-adjusted risk free rates and cost escalation rates. The impact on measurements of new AROs or remeasurements of existing AROs, using different cost escalation rates in the future, may be significant. When the Companies revise any assumptions used to calculate the fair value of existing AROs, they adjust the carrying amount of both the ARO liability and the related long-lived asset. The Companies accrete the ARO liability to reflect the passage of time. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, Dominion recognized $84 million, $85 million and $89 million, respectively, of accretion, and expects to recognize $75 million in 2012. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, Virginia Power recognized $36 million, $35 million and $35 million, respectively, of accretion, and expects to recognize $35 million in 2012. Virginia Power records accretion and depreciation associated with utility nuclear decommissioning AROs as an adjustment to its regulatory liability for nuclear decommissioning. A significant portion of the Companies AROs relates to the future decommissioning of Dominion merchant and Virginia Power utility nuclear facilities. These nuclear decommissioning AROs are reported in the Dominion Generation segment. At December 31, 2011, Dominion nuclear decommissioning AROs totaled $1.2 billion, representing approximately 83% of its total AROs. At December 31, 2011, Virginia Power nuclear decommissioning AROs totaled $559 million, representing approximately 89% of its total AROs. Based on their significance, the following discussion of critical assumptions inherent in determining the fair value of AROs relates to those associated with the Companies nuclear decommissioning obligations. The Companies obtain from third-party specialists periodic site-specific base year cost studies in order to estimate the nature, cost and timing of planned decommissioning activities for their nuclear plants. These cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time they are performed; however, estimates of future cash flows for extended periods of time are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. In addition, the Companies cost estimates include cost escalation rates that are applied to the base year costs. The Companies determine cost escalation rates, which represent projected cost increases over time due to both general inflation and increases in the cost of specific decommissioning activities, for each nuclear facility. The selection of these cost escalation rates is dependent on subjective factors which are considered to be a critical assumption. In December 2011, Dominion recorded a decrease of $290 million in the nuclear decommissioning AROs for its units. Virginia Power recorded a decrease of $95 million in the nuclear decommissioning AROs for its units. The ARO revision was driven by a reduction in anticipated future decommissioning costs due to the expected future recovery from the DOE of certain spent fuel costs based on the Companies contracts with the DOE for disposal of spent nuclear fuel, as well as updated escalation rates. In 2009, as a result of updated decommissioning cost studies and applicable escalation rates, Dominion recorded a decrease of $309 million in the nuclear decommissioning AROs of its units, including a $103 million ($62 million after-tax) reduction in other operations and maintenance expense due to a downward revision in the nuclear decommissioning ARO for a power station unit that is no longer in service. Virginia Power recorded a decrease of $119 million in the nuclear decommissioning AROs for its units. I NCOME T AXES Judgment and the use of estimates are required in developing the provision for income taxes and reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities. The interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty, since tax authorities may interpret the laws differently. Ultimate resolution of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows, and adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities could be material. Given the uncertainty and judgment involved in the determination and filing of income taxes, there are standards for recognition and measurement in financial statements of positions taken or expected to be taken by an entity in its income tax returns. Positions taken by an entity in its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more-likely- than-not recognition threshold, assuming that the position will be 33 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued examined by tax authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information. At December 31, 2011, Dominion had $347 million and Virginia Power had $114 million of unrecognized tax benefits. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded representing future effects on income taxes for temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Dominion and Virginia Power evaluate quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by considering current and historical financial results, expectations for future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income or successfully implement tax planning strategies may affect the realization of deferred tax assets. The Companies establish a valuation allowance when it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2011, Dominion had established $96 million of valuation allowances and Virginia Power had no valuation allowances. A CCOUNTING FOR D ERIVATIVE C ONTRACTS AND O THER I NSTRUMENTS AT F AIR V ALUE Dominion and Virginia Power use derivative contracts such as futures, swaps, forwards, options and FTRs to manage commodity and financial market risks of their business operations. Derivative contracts, with certain exceptions, are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Accounting requirements for derivatives and related hedging activities are complex and may be subject to further clarification by standard-setting bodies. The majority of investments held in Dominion and Virginia Power nuclear decommissioning and Dominion rabbi and benefit plan trust funds are also subject to fair value accounting. See Notes 7 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these fair value measurements. Fair value is based on actively-quoted market prices, if available. In the absence of actively-quoted market prices, management seeks indicative price information from external sources, including broker quotes and industry publications. When evaluating pricing information provided by brokers and other pricing services, the Companies consider whether the broker is willing and able to trade at the quoted price, if the broker quotes are based on an active market or an inactive market and the extent to which brokers are utilizing a particular model if pricing is not readily available. If pricing information from external sources is not available, or if the Companies believe that observable pricing information is not indicative of fair value, judgment is required to develop the estimates of fair value. In those cases, the Companies must estimate prices based on available historical and near-term future price information and use of statistical methods, including regression analysis, that reflect their market assumptions. The Companies maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. U SE OF E STIMATES IN G OODWILL I MPAIRMENT T ESTING As of December 31, 2011, Dominion reported $3.1 billion of goodwill in its Consolidated Balance Sheet. A significant portion resulted from the acquisition of the former CNG in 2000. In April of each year, Dominion tests its goodwill for potential impairment, and performs additional tests more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The 2011, 2010 and 2009 annual tests and any interim tests did not result in the recognition of any goodwill impairment. In general, Dominion estimates the fair value of its reporting units by using a combination of discounted cash flows and other valuation techniques that use multiples of earnings for peer group companies and analyses of recent business combinations involving peer group companies. For Dominion Appalachian E&P operations and Peoples and Hope operations, negotiated sales prices were used as fair value for the tests conducted in 2010 and 2009. Fair value estimates are dependent on subjective factors such as Dominion estimate of future cash flows, the selection of appropriate discount and growth rates, and the selection of peer group companies and recent transactions. These underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time; subsequent modifications, particularly changes in discount rates or growth rates inherent in Dominion estimates of future cash flows, could result in a future impairment of goodwill. Although Dominion has consistently applied the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates that underlie the fair value calculations, such as estimates of future cash flows, and based those estimates on relevant information available at the time, such cash flow estimates are highly uncertain by nature and may vary significantly from actual results. If the estimates of future cash flows used in the most recent tests had been 10% lower, the resulting fair values would have still been greater than the carrying values of each of those reporting units tested, indicating that no impairment was present. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. U SE OF E STIMATES IN L ONG -L IVED A SSET I MPAIRMENT T ESTING Impairment testing for an individual or group of long-lived assets or for intangible assets with definite lives is required when circumstances indicate those assets may be impaired. When an asset carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered impaired to the extent that the asset fair value is less than its carrying amount. Performing an impairment test on long-lived assets involves judgment in areas such as identifying if circumstances indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets, and developing the undiscounted and discounted estimated future cash flows (used to estimate fair value in the absence of market-based value) associated with the asset, including probability weighting such cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. For example, estimates of future cash flows would contemplate factors which may change over time, such as the expected use of the asset, including future production and sales levels, and expected fluctuations of prices of commodities sold and consumed. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of impairments related to certain long-lived assets. 34 Table of Contents E MPLOYEE B ENEFIT P LANS Dominion sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible active employees, retirees and qualifying dependents. The projected costs of providing benefits under these plans are dependent, in part, on historical information such as employee demographics, the level of contributions made to the plans and earnings on plan assets. Assumptions about the future, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates applied to benefit obligations and the anticipated rate of increase in healthcare costs and participant compensation, also have a significant impact on employee benefit costs. The impact of changes in these factors, as well as differences between Dominion assumptions and actual experience, is generally recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining average service period of plan participants, rather than immediately. The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates and healthcare cost trend rates are critical assumptions. Dominion determines the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans by using a combination of: Expected inflation and risk-free interest rate assumptions; Historical return analysis to determine long term historic returns as well as historic risk premiums for various asset classes; Expected future risk premiums, asset volatilities and correlations; Forward-looking return expectations derived from the yield on long-term bonds and the price earnings ratios of major stock market indices; and Investment allocation of plan assets. The strategic target asset allocation for Dominion pension funds is 28% U.S. equity, 18% non-U.S. equity, 33% fixed income, 3% real estate and 18% other alternative investments, such as private equity investments. Strategic investment policies are established for Dominion prefunded benefit plans based upon periodic asset/liability studies. Factors considered in setting the investment policy include those mentioned above such as employee demographics, liability growth rates, future discount rates, the funded status of the plans and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Deviations from the plans strategic allocation are a function of Dominion assessments regarding short-term risk and reward opportunities in the capital markets and/or short-term market movements which result in the plans actual asset allocations varying from the strategic target asset allocations. Through periodic rebalancing, actual allocations are brought back in line with the target. Future asset/liability studies will focus on strategies to further reduce pension and other postretirement plan risk, while still achieving attractive levels of returns. Dominion develops assumptions, which are then compared to the forecasts of other independent investment advisors to ensure reasonableness. An internal committee selects the final assumptions. Dominion calculated its pension cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of 8.50% for 2011, 2010 and 2009. Dominion calculated its other postretirement benefit cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of 7.75% for 2011, 2010 and 2009. The rate used in calculating other postretirement benefit cost is lower than the rate used in calculating pension cost because of differences in the relative amounts of various types of investments held as plan assets. Dominion determines discount rates from analyses of AA/Aa rated bonds with cash flows matching the expected payments to be made under its plans. The discount rates used to calculate pension cost and other postretirement benefit cost were 5.9% in 2011 and 6.60% in 2010 and 2009. Dominion selected a discount rate of 5.50% for determining its December 31, 2011 projected pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. Dominion establishes the healthcare cost trend rate assumption based on analyses of various factors including the specific provisions of its medical plans, actual cost trends experienced and projected, and demographics of plan participants. Dominion healthcare cost trend rate assumption as of December 31, 2011 is 7% and is expected to gradually decrease to 4.60% by 2060 and continue at that rate for years thereafter. The following table illustrates the effect on cost of changing the critical actuarial assumptions previously discussed, while holding all other assumptions constant: Increase in Net Periodic Cost Change in Actuarial Assumption Pension Benefits Other Postretirement Benefits (millions, except percentages) Discount rate (0.25 )% $ 13 $ 2 Long-term rate of return on plan assets (0.25 )% 13 3 Healthcare cost trend rate 1 % N/A 20 In addition to the effects on cost, at December 31, 2011, a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase Dominion projected pension benefit obligation by $163 million and its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $43 million, while a 1.00% increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $174 million. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. R EVENUE R ECOGNITION U NBILLED R EVENUE Virginia Power recognizes and records revenues when energy is delivered to the customer. The determination of sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, the amount of electric energy delivered to customers, but not yet billed, is estimated and recorded as unbilled revenue. This estimate is reversed in the following month and actual revenue is recorded based on meter readings. Virginia Power customer receivables included $360 million and $397 million of accrued unbilled revenue at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The calculation of unbilled revenues is complex and includes numerous estimates and assumptions including historical usage, applicable customer rates, weather factors and total daily electric generation supplied, adjusted for line losses. Changes in generation patterns, customer usage patterns and other factors, which are the basis for the estimates of unbilled revenues, could have a significant effect on the calculation and therefore on Virginia Power results of operations and financial condition. 35 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued Other A CCOUNTING S TANDARDS AND P OLICIES During 2009, Dominion and Virginia Power were required to adopt several new accounting standards, which are discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. D OMINION R ESULTS OF O PERATIONS Presented below is a summary of Dominion consolidated results: Year Ended December 31, 2011 $ Change 2010 $ Change 2009 (millions, except EPS) Net Income attributable to Dominion $ 1,408 $ (1,400 ) $ 2,808 $ 1,521 $ 1,287 Diluted EPS 2.45 (2.31 ) 4.76 2.59 2.17 Overview 2011 VS . 2010 Net income attributable to Dominion decreased by 50%. Unfavorable drivers include the absence of a gain on the sale of Dominion Appalachian E&P operations, lower margins from merchant generation operations, and the impact of less favorable weather, including Hurricane Irene, on electric utility operations. Favorable drivers include the absence of charges related to a workforce reduction program and the absence of a loss on the sale of Peoples, and higher earnings from rate adjustment clauses. 2010 VS . 2009 Net income attributable to Dominion increased by 118%. Favorable drivers include a gain on the sale of Dominion Appalachian E&P operations, lower ceiling test impairment charges related to these properties, the absence of a charge in connection with the settlement of Virginia Power 2009 base rate case proceedings and the impact of favorable weather on electric utility operations. Unfavorable drivers include charges related to a workforce reduction program, a loss on the sale of Peoples, lower margins from merchant generation operations and impairment charges related to certain merchant generation facilities. Analysis of Consolidated Operations Presented below are selected amounts related to Dominion results of operations: Year Ended December 31, 2011 $ Change 2010 $ Change 2009 (millions) Operating Revenue $ 14,379 $ (818 ) $ 15,197 $ 399 $ 14,798 Electric fuel and other energy-related purchases 4,194 44 4,150 (135 ) 4,285 Purchased electric capacity 454 1 453 42 411 Purchased gas 1,764 (286 ) 2,050 (150 ) 2,200 Net Revenue 7,967 (577 ) 8,544 642 7,902 Other operations and maintenance 3,483 (241 ) 3,724 12 3,712 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1,069 14 1,055 (83 ) 1,138 Other taxes 554 22 532 49 483 Gain on sale of Appalachian E&P operations (2,467 ) 2,467 2,467 Other income 179 10 169 (25 ) 194 Interest and related charges 869 37 832 (57 ) 889 Income tax expense 745 (1,312 ) 2,057 1,461 596 Income (loss) from discontinued operations 155 (155 ) (181 ) 26 An analysis of Dominion results of operations follows: 2011 VS . 2010 Net Revenue decreased 7%, primarily reflecting: A $519 million decrease from merchant generation operations, primarily due to a decrease in realized prices ($347 million) and lower generation ($163 million); and A $125 million decrease reflecting the sale of substantially all of Dominion Appalachian E&P operations in April 2010. These decreases were partially offset by: A $32 million increase from Dominion gas transmission business primarily related to an increase in revenue from NGLs; A $28 million increase in producer services primarily related to higher physical margins and favorable price changes on economic hedging positions, all associated with natural gas aggregation, marketing and trading activities; A $13 million increase from electric utility operations, primarily reflecting: The impact of rate adjustment clauses ($169 million); and A decrease in net capacity expenses ($44 million); partially offset by The impact ($120 million) of a decrease in sales to retail customers, primarily due to a decrease in heating and cooling degree days ($220 million), partially offset by an increase in sales due to the effect of favorable economic conditions on customer usage and other factors ($100 million); and A decrease due to a charge based on the Biennial Review Order to refund revenues to customers ($81 million). 36 Table of Contents Other operations and maintenance decreased 6%, primarily reflecting: A $441 million decrease in salaries, wages and benefits primarily related to a 2010 workforce reduction program; partially offset by A $96 million increase due to restoration costs associated with damage caused by Hurricane Irene; and An $89 million net increase in impairment charges related to certain utility and merchant coal-fired generating units. Gain on sale of Appalachian E&P operations reflects a gain on the sale of these operations, as described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest and related charges increased 4%, primarily due to the absence of a benefit recorded in 2010 resulting from the discontinuance of hedge accounting for certain interest rate derivatives ($73 million) and an increase in debt issuances in 2011 ($18 million), partially offset by the recognition of hedging gains that had previously been deferred as regulatory liabilities as a result of the Biennial Review Order ($50 million). Income tax expense decreased $1.3 billion, primarily reflecting lower federal and state taxes largely due to the absence of a gain from the sale of Dominion Appalachian E&P operations recorded in 2010. Loss from discontinued operations reflects the sale of Peoples in 2010. 2010 VS . 2009 Net Revenue increased 8%, primarily reflecting: A $1.1 billion increase from electric utility operations, primarily reflecting: The absence of a charge for the settlement of Virginia Power 2009 base rate case proceedings ($570 million); The impact of rate adjustment clauses ($279 million); An increase in sales to retail customers primarily due to an increase in cooling degree days ($248 million); and An increase in ancillary revenues received from PJM ($78 million), primarily reflecting an increase in the scheduled dispatch of gas and oil-fired generation units to meet higher demand; partially offset by A decrease primarily due to the impact of unfavorable economic conditions on customer usage and other factors ($75 million); A $98 million increase from regulated natural gas distribution operations primarily reflecting increased rider revenue associated with the recovery of bad debt expense ($60 million) and an increase in base rates ($40 million); and A $46 million increase related to natural gas transmission operations largely due to the completion of the Cove Point expansion project. These increases were partially offset by: A $356 million decrease from merchant generation operations due to a decrease at certain nuclear generating facilities ($237 million) primarily due to lower realized prices, a decline in margins at certain fossil generation facilities ($70 million) primarily due to an increase in fuel prices and the expiration of certain requirements-based power sales contracts in December 2009 ($49 million); A $222 million decrease reflecting the sale of substantially all of Dominion Appalachian E&P operations in April 2010; and A $40 million decrease in producer services primarily related to unfavorable price changes on economic hedging positions and lower physical margins, all associated with natural gas aggregation, marketing and trading activities. Other operations and maintenance increased $12 million primarily reflecting: A $240 million net increase in salaries, wages and benefits primarily related to a workforce reduction program; Impairment charges related to certain merchant generating facilities ($194 million); A $103 million increase due to the absence of a benefit in 2009 from a downward revision in the nuclear decommissioning ARO for a unit that is no longer in service; A $56 million increase in bad debt expense at regulated natural gas distribution operations, primarily related to low income assistance programs ($60 million). These expenses are recovered through rates and do not impact net income; and A $42 million increase in certain electric transmission-related expenditures. These increases were partially offset by: A $434 million decrease in ceiling test impairment charges related to the carrying value of Dominion E&P properties; The absence of a $142 million write-off of previously deferred RTO costs in connection with the settlement of Virginia Power 2009 base rate case proceedings; and A $48 million decrease in outage costs due to a decrease in scheduled outage days primarily at certain merchant generation facilities. DD&A decreased 7%, primarily due to the sale of Dominion Appalachian E&P operations ($45 million) and lower amortization due to decreased cost of emissions allowances consumed ($37 million). Other taxes increased 10%, primarily due to additional property tax from increased investments and higher rates ($16 million), an increase in gross receipts tax due to new non-regulated retail energy customers ($14 million) and higher payroll taxes associated with a workforce reduction program ($12 million). Gain on sale of Appalachian E&P operations reflects a gain on the sale of these operations, as described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other income decreased 13%, primarily reflecting an increase in charitable contributions ($46 million) and a decrease in interest income ($15 million); partially offset by the absence of an impairment loss on an equity method investment ($30 million) and higher realized gains (including investment income) on nuclear decommissioning trust funds ($12 million). Interest and related charges decreased 6%, primarily due to a benefit resulting from the net effect of the discontinuance of hedge accounting for certain interest rate hedges and subsequent changes in fair value of these interest rate derivatives ($73 million), partially offset by an increase in interest expense associated with the June 2009 hybrid issuance ($26 million). 37 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued Income tax expense increased $1.5 billion, primarily reflecting higher federal and state taxes largely due to the gain on the sale of Dominion Appalachian E&P business. Loss from discontinued operations primarily reflects a loss on the sale of Peoples. Outlook Dominion strategy is to continue focusing on its regulated businesses while maintaining upside potential in well-positioned nonregulated businesses. The goals of this strategy are to provide earnings per share growth, a growing dividend and to maintain a stable credit profile. Dominion 2011 results were negatively impacted by lower margins from merchant generation operations and less favorable weather on electric utility operations. In 2012, Dominion is expected to experience an increase in net income on a per share basis as compared to 2011. Dominion anticipated 2012 results reflect the following significant factors: The absence of charges incurred in 2011 related to expected plant retirements, impairment of emissions allowances and Hurricane Irene; Construction and operation of growth projects in electric utility operations and associated rate adjustment clause revenue, as well as growth projects in gas transmission and distribution operations; Growth in weather-normalized electric utility sales of 2-2.5% resulting from the recovering economy and rising energy demand; Reductions in certain operations and maintenance expenses; and A reduction in interest expense; partially offset by Lower realized margins from merchant generation operations due to lower commodity prices and the retirement of certain coal units; and An increase in DD&A. Dominion expects the bonus depreciation provisions of the tax legislation enacted by the U.S. Congress in 2010, discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, to reduce income taxes otherwise payable, resulting in cash savings in 2012 and 2013 of approximately $475 million and $700 million, respectively.

Other operations and maintenance decreased $2 million, primarily reflecting: A $267 million decrease in salaries, wages and benefits as well as certain administrative and general costs primarily due to a 2010 workforce reduction program; and A $54 million decrease in planned outage costs primarily due to fewer scheduled outage days at certain generation facilities; partially offset by A $228 million impairment charge related to certain coal-fired generating units; and A $96 million increase due to restoration costs associated with damage caused by Hurricane Irene. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 7%, primarily due to property additions. Other income decreased 12%, primarily due to a decrease in the equity component of AFUDC ($17 million), partially offset by an increase in amounts collectible from customers for taxes in connection with contributions in aid of construction ($5 million). 40 Table of Contents 2010 VS . 2009 Net Revenue increased 33%, primarily reflecting: The absence of a charge for the settlement of the 2009 base rate case proceedings ($570 million); The impact of rate adjustment clauses ($279 million); An increase in sales to retail customers primarily due to an increase in cooling degree days ($248 million); and An increase in ancillary revenues received from PJM ($78 million), primarily reflecting an increase in the scheduled dispatch of gas and oil-fired generation units to meet higher demand. These increases were partially offset by: A decrease primarily due to the impact of unfavorable economic conditions on customer usage and other factors ($75 million). Other operations and maintenance increased 8%, primarily reflecting: A $177 million net increase in salaries, wages and benefits primarily due to a workforce reduction program; A $42 million increase in certain electric transmission-related expenditures; and A $19 million increase in storm damage and service restoration costs. These increases were partially offset by: The absence of a $130 million write-off of previously deferred RTO costs in connection with the settlement of Virginia Power 2009 base rate case proceedings. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 5%, primarily due to property additions. Other taxes increased 14%, primarily reflecting additional property tax due to increased investments and higher rates ($12 million), incremental use tax that is recoverable through a customer surcharge ($8 million) and higher payroll taxes associated with a workforce reduction program ($7 million). Income tax expense increased $395 million, primarily reflecting higher pretax income in 2010. Outlook Virginia Power expects to provide growth in net income in 2012. Virginia Power anticipated 2012 results reflect the following significant factors: The absence of charges incurred in 2011 related to expected plant retirements, impairment of emissions allowances and Hurricane Irene; Growth in weather-normalized electric sales of 2-2.5% resulting from the recovering economy and rising energy demand; and Construction and operation of growth projects and associated rate adjustment clause revenue; partially offset by An increase in planned outages at certain nuclear facilities. Virginia Power expects the bonus depreciation provisions of the tax legislation enacted by the U.S. Congress in 2010, discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, to reduce income taxes otherwise payable, resulting in cash savings of approximately $500 million in 2012.

See Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these items. L IQUIDITY AND C APITAL R ESOURCES Dominion and Virginia Power depend on both internal and external sources of liquidity to provide working capital and to fund capital requirements. Short-term cash requirements not met by cash provided by operations are generally satisfied with proceeds from short-term borrowings. Long-term cash needs are met through issuances of debt and/or equity securities. At December 31, 2011, Dominion had $1.7 billion of unused capacity under its credit facilities, including $341 million of unused capacity under joint credit facilities available to Virginia Power. See additional discussion under Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt . A summary of Dominion cash flows is presented below: Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (millions) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year (1) $ 62 $ 50 $ 71 Cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities 2,983 1,825 3,786 Investing activities (3,321 ) 419 (3,695 ) Financing activities 378 (2,232 ) (112 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 40 12 (21 ) Cash and cash equivalents at end of year (2) $ 102 $ 62 $ 50 (1) 2009 amount includes $5 million of cash classified as held for sale in Dominion Consolidated Balance Sheet. (2) 2009 amount includes $2 million of cash classified as held for sale in Dominion Consolidated Balance Sheet. A summary of Virginia Power cash flows is presented below: Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (millions) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year $ 5 $ 19 $ 27 Cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities 2,024 1,409 1,970 Investing activities (1,947 ) (2,425 ) (2,568 ) Financing activities (53 ) 1,002 590 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 24 (14 ) (8 ) Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 29 $ 5 $ 19 Operating Cash Flows In 2011, net cash provided by Dominion operating activities increased by $1.2 billion, primarily due to lower income tax payments, lower payments related to the Virginia Settlement Approval Order, and the absence of contributions to pension plans made in 2010; partially offset by lower merchant generation margins and the impact of less favorable weather on electric utility operations. In 2011, net cash provided by Virginia Power operating activities increased by $615 million, primarily due to higher deferred fuel cost recoveries in its Virginia jurisdiction, lower payments related to the Virginia Settlement Approval Order, and the absence of contributions to Dominion pension plans made in 2010. The increase was partially offset by the impact of less favorable weather, higher restoration costs due to Hurricane Irene, and net changes in other working capital items. 42 Table of Contents Dominion believes that its operations provide a stable source of cash flow to contribute to planned levels of capital expenditures and maintain or grow the dividend on common shares. In 2010, Dominion Board of Directors adopted a new dividend policy that raised its target payout ratio. In 2012, the Board affirmed the dividend policy and established an annual dividend rate of $2.11 per share of common stock, a 7.1% increase over the 2011 rate. Declarations of dividends are subject to further Board approval. Virginia Power believes that its operations provide a stable source of cash flow to contribute to planned levels of capital expenditures and provide dividends to Dominion. The Companies operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that may negatively impact the timing or amounts of operating cash flows, and which are discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors. C REDIT R ISK Dominion exposure to potential concentrations of credit risk results primarily from its energy marketing and price risk management activities. Presented below is a summary of Dominion credit exposure as of December 31, 2011 for these activities. Gross credit exposure for each counterparty is calculated as outstanding receivables plus any unrealized on- or off-balance sheet exposure, taking into account contractual netting rights. Gross Credit Exposure Credit Collateral Net Credit Exposure (millions) Investment grade (1) $ 349 $ 30 $ 319 Non-investment grade (2) 4 4 No external ratings: Internally rated-investment grade (3) 84 84 Internally rated-non-investment grade (4) 97 97 Total $ 534 $ 30 $ 504 (1) Designations as investment grade are based upon minimum credit ratings assigned by Moody and Standard & Poor s. The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 33% of the total net credit exposure. (2) The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 1% of the total net credit exposure. (3) The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 8% of the total net credit exposure. (4) The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 12% of the total net credit exposure. Virginia Power exposure to potential concentrations of credit risk results primarily from sales to wholesale customers and was not considered material at December 31, 2011. Investing Cash Flows In 2011, net cash used in Dominion investing activities was $3.3 billion as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $419 million in 2010, primarily reflecting the absence of the proceeds received in 2010 from the sale of Dominion Appalachian E&P operations and the sale of Peoples. In 2011, net cash used in Virginia Power investing activities decreased by $478 million, primarily due to lower capital expenditures and restricted funds spent in 2011 as compared to restricted funds deposited in 2010 for the purpose of funding certain qualifying construction projects. Financing Cash Flows and Liquidity Dominion and Virginia Power rely on capital markets as significant sources of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by cash provided by their operations. As discussed in Credit Ratings , the Companies ability to borrow funds or issue securities and the return demanded by investors are affected by credit ratings. In addition, the raising of external capital is subject to certain regulatory requirements, including registration with the SEC for certain issuances and, in the case of Virginia Power, approval by the Virginia Commission. Each of the Companies currently meets the definition of a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules governing the registration, communications and offering processes under the Securities Act of 1933. The rules provide for a streamlined shelf registration process to provide registrants with timely access to capital. This allows the Companies to use automatic shelf registration statements to register any offering of securities, other than those for business combination transactions. In 2011, net cash provided by Dominion financing activities was $378 million as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $2.2 billion in 2010, primarily due to net debt issuances in 2011 as compared to net debt repayments in 2010, reflecting, in part, the use of proceeds in 2010 from the sales of Dominion Appalachian E&P operations and Peoples to repay debt. In 2011, net cash used in Virginia Power financing activities was $53 million as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1.0 billion in 2010, primarily reflecting lower net debt issuances in 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of higher cash flow from operations. C REDIT F ACILITIES AND S HORT -T ERM D EBT Dominion and Virginia Power use short-term debt to fund working capital requirements and as a bridge to long-term debt financings. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly during the course of the year, depending upon the timing and amount of cash requirements not satisfied by cash from operations. In addition, Dominion utilizes cash and letters of credit to fund collateral requirements. Collateral requirements are impacted by commodity prices, hedging levels, Dominion credit ratings and the credit quality of its counterparties. In connection with commodity hedging activities, the Companies are required to provide collateral to counterparties under some circumstances. Under certain collateral arrangements, the Companies may satisfy these requirements by electing to either deposit cash, post letters of credit or, in some cases, utilize other forms of security. From time to time, the Companies vary the form of collateral provided to counterparties after weighing the costs and benefits of various factors associated with the different forms of collateral. These factors include short-term borrowing and short-term investment rates, the spread over these short-term rates at which the Companies can issue commercial paper, balance sheet impacts, the costs and fees of alternative collateral postings with these and other counterparties and overall liquidity management objectives. 43 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued D OMINION Commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding, as well as capacity available under credit facilities, were as follows: December 31, 2011 Facility Limit Outstanding Commercial Paper Outstanding Letters of Credit Facility Capacity Available (millions) Joint revolving credit facility (1) $ 3,000 $ 1,814 $ $ 1,186 Joint revolving credit facility (2) 500 36 464 Total $ 3,500 $ 1,814 (3) $ 36 $ 1,650 (1) This credit facility was entered into in September 2010 with an original maturity date of September 2013.

In December 2010, Brayton Point borrowed approximately $160 million and approximately $75 million in connection with the Massachusetts Development Finance Agency Recovery Zone Facility Bonds, Series 2010 A and the Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds, Series 2010 B, respectively, which mature in 2041. The proceeds are being used to finance certain qualifying facilities at Brayton Point. Due to unfavorable market conditions, Dominion acquired the bonds upon issuance in December 2010 with the intention of remarketing them to third parties at a later time. At December 31, 2010, these bonds had not been remarketed and thus were not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In July 2011, the Series 2010 B bonds were remarketed to a third party using a remarketing process, and bear interest at a variable rate for the first five years, after which they will bear interest at a market rate to be determined at that time. In August 2011, the Series 2010 A bonds were remarketed to third parties using a remarketing process, and bear interest at a coupon rate of 2.25% for the first five years, after which they will bear interest at a market rate to be determined at that time. In December 2010 and September 2009, Virginia Power borrowed $100 million and $60 million, respectively, in connection with the $160 million Industrial Development Authority of Wise County Solid Waste and Sewage Disposal Revenue Bonds, Series 2009 A, which mature in 2040. The proceeds are being used to finance certain qualifying facilities at the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center. Due to unfavorable market conditions, Virginia Power acquired the bonds upon issuance with the intention of remarketing them to third parties at a later time. At December 31, 2010, these bonds had not been remarketed and thus were not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In March 2011, the bonds were remarketed to a third party and bear interest at a variable rate for the first five years, after which they will bear interest at a market rate to be determined at that time. In December 2011, Virginia Power borrowed $75 million in connection with the Economic Development Authority of the County of Chesterfield Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds, Series 2011 A, which mature in 2017 and bear interest during the initial period at a variable rate for the first five years, after which they will bear interest at a market rate to be determined at that time, using a remarketing process. The proceeds were used to refund the principal amount of the Industrial Development Authority of the County of Chesterfield, Virginia Money Market Municipals Pollution Control Revenue Bonds, 44 Table of Contents Series 1987 A and Series 1987 B that would otherwise have matured in June 2017. During 2011, Dominion and Virginia Power repaid and repurchased $637 million and $91 million, respectively, of long-term debt and notes payable. I SSUANCE OF C OMMON S TOCK Dominion maintains Dominion Direct and a number of employee savings plans through which contributions may be invested in the Company common stock. These shares may either be newly issued or purchased on the open market with proceeds contributed to these plans. During 2011, Dominion Direct and the Dominion employee savings plans purchased Dominion common stock on the open market with the proceeds received through these programs, rather than having additional new common shares issued. In January 2012, Dominion began issuing new common shares for these plans. During 2011, Dominion issued approximately 1.2 million shares of common stock and received cash proceeds of $38 million through the exercise of employee stock options. In January 2012, Dominion filed a new SEC shelf registration for the sale of debt and equity securities including the ability to sell common stock through an at the market program. The Company entered into four separate Sales Agency Agreements with each of BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, and Goldman Sachs & Co., to effect sales under the program. However, with the exception of issuing approximately $320 million in equity through employee savings plans, direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plans, and other employee and director benefit plans, Dominion does not anticipate issuing common stock in 2012. In 2011, Virginia Power did not issue any shares of its common stock to Dominion. R EPURCHASE OF C OMMON S TOCK In 2011, Dominion announced that it intended to repurchase between $600 million and $700 million of common stock with cash tax savings resulting from the extension of the bonus depreciation allowance. During 2011, Dominion repurchased approximately 13 million shares of common stock for approximately $601 million on the open market under this program, at an average price of $46.37 per share. Dominion does not plan to repurchase additional shares under this program during 2012. B ORROWINGS F ROM P ARENT Virginia Power has the ability to borrow funds from Dominion under both short-term and long-term borrowing arrangements and at December 31, 2011, its nonregulated subsidiaries had outstanding borrowings, net of repayments, under the Dominion money pool of $187 million. Credit Ratings Credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Dominion and Virginia Power believe that their current credit ratings provide sufficient access to the capital markets. However, disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to Dominion and Virginia Power may affect their ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors. Dominion and Virginia Power credit ratings may affect their liquidity, cost of borrowing under credit facilities and collateral posting requirements under commodity contracts, as well as the rates at which they are able to offer their debt securities. Both quantitative (financial strength) and qualitative (business or operating characteristics) factors are considered by the credit rating agencies in establishing an individual company credit rating. Credit ratings should be evaluated independently and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. The credit ratings for Dominion and Virginia Power are affected by each company financial profile, mix of regulated and nonregulated businesses and respective cash flows, changes in methodologies used by the rating agencies and event risk, if applicable, such as major acquisitions or dispositions. Credit ratings as of February 23, 2012 follow: Fitch Moody Standard & Poor Dominion Senior unsecured debt securities BBB+ Baa2 A- Junior subordinated debt securities BBB- Baa3 BBB Enhanced junior subordinated notes BBB- Baa3 BBB Commercial paper F2 P-2 A-2 Virginia Power Mortgage bonds A A1 A Senior unsecured (including tax-exempt) debt securities A- A3 A- Junior subordinated debt securities BBB Baa1 BBB Preferred stock BBB Baa2 BBB Commercial paper F2 P-2 A-2 As of February 23, 2012, Fitch, Moody and Standard & Poor maintained a stable outlook for their respective ratings of Dominion and Virginia Power. A downgrade in an individual company credit rating would not necessarily restrict its ability to raise short-term and long-term financing as long as its credit rating remains investment grade, but it would likely increase the cost of borrowing. Dominion and Virginia Power work closely with Fitch, Moody and Standard & Poor with the objective of maintaining their current credit ratings. The Companies may find it necessary to modify their business plans to maintain or achieve appropriate credit ratings and such changes may adversely affect growth and EPS. Debt Covenants As part of borrowing funds and issuing debt (both short-term and long-term) or preferred securities, Dominion and Virginia Power must enter into enabling agreements. These agreements contain covenants that, in the event of default, could result in the acceleration of principal and interest payments; restrictions on distributions related to capital stock, including dividends, redemptions, repurchases, liquidation payments or guarantee payments; and in some cases, the termination of credit commitments unless a waiver of such requirements is agreed to by the lenders/security holders. These provisions are customary, with each agreement specifying which covenants apply. These provisions are not necessarily unique to Dominion and Virginia Power. Some of the typical covenants include: The timely payment of principal and interest; Information requirements, including submitting financial reports filed with the SEC and information about changes in Dominion and Virginia Power credit ratings to lenders; Performance obligations, audits/inspections, continuation of the basic nature of business, restrictions on certain matters 45 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued related to merger or consolidation, and restrictions on disposition of all or substantially all assets; Compliance with collateral minimums or requirements related to mortgage bonds; and Limitations on liens. Dominion and Virginia Power are required to pay annual commitment fees to maintain their credit facilities. In addition, their credit agreements contain various terms and conditions that could affect their ability to borrow under these facilities. They include maximum debt to total capital ratios and cross-default provisions. As of December 31, 2011, the calculated total debt to total capital ratio, pursuant to the terms of the agreements, was as follows: Company Maximum Allowed Ratio Actual Ratio (1) Dominion 65 % 57 % Virginia Power 65 % 47 % (1) Indebtedness as defined by the bank agreements excludes junior subordinated notes reflected as long-term debt as well as AOCI reflected as equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These provisions apply separately to Dominion and Virginia Power. If Dominion or Virginia Power or any of either company material subsidiaries fails to make payment on various debt obligations in excess of $100 million, the lenders could require that company to accelerate its repayment of any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and the lenders could terminate their commitment to lend funds to that company. Accordingly, any default by Dominion will not affect the lenders commitment to Virginia Power. However, any default by Virginia Power would affect the lenders commitment to Dominion under the joint credit agreements. Dominion executed RCCs in connection with its issuance of the following hybrid securities: June 2006 hybrids; September 2006 hybrids; and June 2009 hybrids. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for terms of the RCCs. At December 31, 2011, the termination dates and covered debt under the RCCs associated with Dominion hybrids were as follows: Hybrid RCC Termination Date Designated Covered Debt Under RCC June 2006 hybrids 6/30/2036 September 2006 hybrids September 2006 hybrids 9/30/2036 June 2006 hybrids June 2009 hybrids 6/15/2034 (1) 2008 Series B Senior Notes, 7.0% due 2038 (1) Automatically extended, as set forth in the RCC, for additional quarterly periods, to the extent the maturity date is extended. Dominion and Virginia Power monitor the debt covenants on a regular basis in order to ensure that events of default will not occur. As of December 31, 2011, there have been no events of default under or changes to Dominion or Virginia Power debt covenants. Dividend Restrictions The Virginia Commission may prohibit any public service company, including Virginia Power, from declaring or paying a divi- dend to an affiliate if found to be detrimental to the public interest. At December 31, 2011, the Virginia Commission had not restricted the payment of dividends by Virginia Power. Certain agreements associated with Dominion and Virginia Power credit facilities contain restrictions on the ratio of debt to total capitalization. These limitations did not restrict Dominion or Virginia Power ability to pay dividends or receive dividends from their subsidiaries at December 31, 2011. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of potential restrictions on dividend payments by Dominion in connection with the deferral of interest payments on junior subordinated notes, which information is incorporated herein by reference. Future Cash Payments for Contractual Obligations and Planned Capital Expenditures C ONTRACTUAL O BLIGATIONS Dominion and Virginia Power are party to numerous contracts and arrangements obligating them to make cash payments in future years. These contracts include financing arrangements such as debt agreements and leases, as well as contracts for the purchase of goods and services and financial derivatives. Presented below is a table summarizing cash payments that may result from contracts to which Dominion and Virginia Power are parties as of December 31, 2011. For purchase obligations and other liabilities, amounts are based upon contract terms, including fixed and minimum quantities to be purchased at fixed or market-based prices. Actual cash payments will be based upon actual quantities purchased and prices paid and will likely differ from amounts presented below. The table excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than current maturities of long-term debt, interest payable and certain derivative instruments. The majority of Dominion and Virginia Power current liabilities will be paid in cash in 2012.

See Notes 13, 15 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Due to uncertainty about the timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, $75 million of income taxes payable associated with unrecognized tax benefits are excluded. Deferred income taxes are also excluded since cash payments are based primarily on taxable income for each discrete fiscal year. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. P LANNED C APITAL E XPENDITURES Dominion planned capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $4.3 billion, $4.8 billion and $3.9 billion in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. Dominion expenditures are expected to include construction and expansion of electric generation and natural gas transmission, processing, and storage facilities, construction improvements and expansion of electric transmission and distribution assets, purchases of nuclear fuel and the buyout of the lease at Fairless in 2013. Virginia Power planned capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $2.6 billion, $3.0 billion and $2.6 billion in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. Virginia Power expenditures are expected to include construction and expansion of electric generation facilities, construction improvements and expansion of electric transmission and distribution assets and purchases of nuclear fuel. Dominion and Virginia Power expect to fund their capital expenditures with cash from operations and a combination of securities issuances and short-term borrowings. Planned capital expenditures include capital projects that are subject to approval by regulators and the respective company Board of Directors. Based on available generation capacity and current estimates of growth in customer demand, Virginia Power will need additional generation in the future. See DVP, Dominion Generation and Dominion Energy-Properties in Item 1. Business for a discussion of Dominion and Virginia Power expansion plans. These estimates are based on a capital expenditures plan reviewed and endorsed by Dominion Board of Directors in late 2011 and are subject to continuing review and adjustment and actual capital expenditures may vary from these estimates. The Companies may also choose to postpone or cancel certain planned capital expenditures in order to mitigate the need for future debt financings and equity issuances. Use of Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements G UARANTEES Dominion primarily enters into guarantee arrangements on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries. These arrangements are not subject to the provisions of FASB guidance that dictate a guarantor accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others . See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, which information is incorporated herein by reference. L EASING A RRANGEMENT Dominion leases the Fairless generating facility in Pennsylvania from Juniper, the lessor, which began commercial operations in June 2004. Through September 30, 2011, Juniper held various power plant leases, including Fairless. In October 2011, the last lease other than Fairless expired and the related asset was sold by Juniper. With Fairless being its sole remaining asset, Juniper no longer qualified for the business scope exception as of October 2011, which required that Dominion determine whether Juniper is a VIE. Dominion concluded Juniper is a VIE because the entity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations, the power to direct the most significant activities of the entity are not performed by the equity holders, and Dominion, through its residual value guarantee discussed above, guarantees a portion of the residual value of Fairless. The activities that most significantly impact Juniper economic performance relate to the operation of Fairless. The decisions related to the operations of Fairless are made by Dominion and as such, Dominion is considered the primary beneficiary. As the primary beneficiary, Dominion began consolidating Juniper in the fourth quarter of 2011. As a result, this leasing arrangement is no longer considered an off-balance sheet arrangement. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 47 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued F UTURE I SSUES AND O THER M ATTERS See Item 1. Business, Item 3. Legal Proceedings, and Notes 14 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on various environmental, regulatory, legal and other matters that may impact future results of operations and/or financial condition. Environmental Matters Dominion and Virginia Power are subject to costs resulting from a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect human health and the environment. These laws and regulations affect future planning and existing operations. They can result in increased capital, operating and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations. E NVIRONMENTAL P ROTECTION AND M ONITORING E XPENDITURES Dominion incurred approximately $184 million, $228 million and $252 million of expenses (including depreciation) during 2011, 2010, and 2009 respectively, in connection with environmental protection and monitoring activities and expects these expenses to be approximately $223 million and $250 million in 2012 and 2013, respectively. In addition, capital expenditures related to environmental controls were $403 million, $351 million, and $266 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These expenditures are expected to be approximately $228 million and $103 million for 2012 and 2013, respectively. Virginia Power incurred approximately $129 million, $144 million and $134 million of expenses (including depreciation) during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in connection with environmental protection and monitoring activities and expects these expenses to be approximately $149 million and $164 million in 2012 and 2013, respectively. In addition, capital expenditures related to environmental controls were $77 million, $101 million and $109 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These expenditures are expected to be approximately $42 million and $65 million for 2012 and 2013, respectively. F UTURE E NVIRONMENTAL R EGULATIONS Air The CAA is a comprehensive program utilizing a broad range of regulatory tools to protect and preserve the nation air quality. At a minimum, states are required to establish regulatory programs to address all requirements of the CAA. However, states may choose to develop regulatory programs that are more restrictive. Many of Dominion and Virginia Power facilities are subject to the CAA permitting and other requirements. The EPA has finalized rules establishing a new 1-hour NAAQS for NO 2 and a new 1-hour NAAQS for SO 2 , which could require additional NO X and SO 2 controls in certain areas where the Companies operate. Until the states have developed implementation plans for these standards, the impact on Dominion or Virginia Power facilities that emit NO X and SO 2 is uncertain. In January 2010, the EPA also proposed a new, more stringent NAAQS for ozone and had planned to finalize the rule in 2011. In September 2011, the EPA announced a delay from 2011 to 2014 of the rulemaking, therefore NO x controls that may have been required by the rulemaking are also expected to be delayed. However, the EPA decision to delay the rulemaking has been challenged in federal court and the length of delay in possible NO x controls, if any, will depend on the outcome of that litigation. In the interim, the EPA is proceeding with implementation of the current ozone standard and is expected to make final attainment/nonattainment designations by June 2012. Until the litigation is final and the states have developed implementation plans for the new NO X , SO 2 and ozone standards, it is not possible to determine the impact on Dominion or Virginia Power facilities that emit NO X and SO 2 . The Companies cannot currently predict with certainty whether or to what extent the new rules will ultimately require additional controls, however, if significant expenditures are required, it could adversely affect Dominion results of operations, and Dominion and Virginia Power cash flows. In June 2005, the EPA finalized amendments to the Regional Haze Rule, also known as the Clean Air Visibility Rule. The rule requires the states to implement Best Available Retrofit Technology requirements for sources to address impacts to visual air quality through regional haze state implementation plans, but allows other alternative options. The EPA has recently announced a schedule to complete rulemakings on regional haze state implementation plans during 2012. Although Dominion and Virginia Power anticipate that the emission reductions achieved through compliance with other CAA required programs will generally address this rule, additional emission reduction requirements may be imposed on the Companies facilities. Water The CWA is a comprehensive program requiring a broad range of regulatory tools including a permit program to authorize and regulate discharges to surface waters with strong enforcement mechanisms. Dominion and Virginia Power must comply with all aspects of the CWA programs at their operating facilities. In July 2004, the EPA published regulations under CWA Section 316(b) that govern existing utilities that employ a cooling water intake structure and that have flow levels exceeding a minimum threshold. In April 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court granted an industry request to review the question of whether Section 316(b) authorizes the EPA to compare costs with benefits in determining the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact at cooling water intake structures. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in April 2009 that the EPA has the authority to consider costs versus environmental benefits in selecting the best technology available for reducing impacts of cooling water intakes at power stations. It is currently unknown how the EPA will interpret the ruling in its ongoing rulemaking activity addressing cooling water intakes as well as how the states will implement this decision. In April 2011, the EPA published the proposed rule related to Section 316(b) in the Federal Register, and agreed to publish a final rule no later than July 27, 2012. The rule in its proposed form seeks to establish a uniform national standard for impingement, but forgoes the creation of a single technology standard for entrainment. Instead, the EPA proposes to delegate entrainment technology decisions to state regulators. State regulators are to make case-by-case entrainment technology determinations after an examination of nine facility-specific factors, including a social cost-benefit test. 48 Table of Contents The proposed rule governs all electric generating stations with water withdrawals above two MGD, with a heightened entrainment analysis for those facilities over 125 MGD. Under this proposal, Dominion has 18 facilities that may be subject to these proposed regulations. If finalized as proposed, Dominion anticipates that it will have to install impingement control technologies at many of these stations that have once-through cooling systems. Dominion and Virginia Power cannot estimate the need or potential for entrainment controls under the proposed rule as these decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis after a thorough review of detailed biological, technology, cost and benefit studies. However, the impacts of this proposed rule may be material to results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows. Solid and Hazardous Waste In June 2010, the EPA proposed federal regulations under the RCRA for management of coal combustion by-products generated by power plants. The EPA is considering two possible options for the regulation of coal combustion by-products, both of which fall under the RCRA. Under the first proposal, the EPA would classify these by-products as special wastes subject to regulation under subtitle C, the hazardous waste provisions of the RCRA, when destined for disposal at landfills or surface impoundments. Under the second proposal, the EPA would regulate coal combustion by-products under subtitle D of the RCRA, the section for non-hazardous wastes. While the Companies cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter, regulation under either option will affect Dominion and Virginia Power onsite disposal facilities and coal combustion by-product management practices, and potentially require material investments. Climate Change Legislation and Regulation In December 2009, the EPA issued their Final Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act , finding that GHGs endanger both the public health and the public welfare of current and future generations. On April 1, 2010, the EPA and the Department of Transportation National Highway Safety Administration announced a joint final rule establishing a program that will dramatically reduce GHG emissions and improve fuel economy for new cars and trucks sold in the United States. These rules took effect in January 2011 and established GHG emissions as regulated pollutants under the CAA. In May 2010, the EPA issued the Final Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule that, combined with prior actions, require Dominion and Virginia Power to obtain permits for GHG emissions for new and modified facilities over certain size thresholds, and meet best available control technology for GHG emissions. The EPA has issued draft guidance for GHG permitting, including best available control technology. The EPA has also announced a schedule for proposing standards to regulate GHG emissions under the NSPS that would apply to new, modified and existing fossil-fired electric generating units. In August 2011, the EPA announced a delay in the schedule for proposing these regulations. Regulations were expected to be proposed by July 2011 and finalized by May 2012. The schedule for a proposed rulemaking governing a GHG NSPS for existing sources is now delayed beyond January 2012, while a proposed NSPS governing new and modified units is expected to be released in early 2012. There are other legislative proposals that may be considered that would have an indirect impact on GHG emissions. There is the potential for the U.S. Congress to consider a mandatory Clean Energy Standard. In addition to possible federal action, some regions and states in which Dominion and Virginia Power operate have already adopted or may adopt GHG emission reduction programs. Any of these new or contemplated regulations may affect capital costs, or create significant permitting delays, for new or modified facilities that emit GHGs. In July 2008, Massachusetts passed the GWSA. Among other provisions, the GWSA sets economy-wide GHG emissions reduction goals for Massachusetts, including reductions of 25% below 1990 levels by 2020, interim goals for 2030 and 2040 and reductions of 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. No regulations impacting Dominion under the GWSA have been proposed. Dominion operates two coal/oil-fired generating power stations in Massachusetts and acts as a retail electric supplier in Massachusetts, all of which are subject to the implementation of the GWSA. In December 2009, the governors of 11 Northeast and mid-Atlantic states, including Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island (RGGI states plus Pennsylvania) signed a memorandum of understanding committing their states toward developing a low carbon fuel standard to reduce GHG emissions from vehicles. The memorandum of understanding established a process to develop a regional framework by 2011 and examine the economic impacts of a low carbon fuel standard program. Although economic studies and policy options were examined in 2011, a definitive framework has yet to be established. Dodd-Frank Act The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted into law in July 2010 in an effort to improve regulation of financial markets. The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions that will require certain over-the-counter derivatives, or swaps, to be centrally cleared and executed through an exchange or other approved trading platform. Non-financial entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to as end users, can choose to exempt their hedging transactions from these clearing and exchange trading requirements. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act allows applicable regulators, including the CFTC and SEC, to impose initial and variation margin requirements on entities who execute swaps. End users were not expressly exempted from these requirements for non-cleared swaps and rules have been proposed that address the margin obligations to be imposed on non-cleared swaps entered with end users. Final rules for the over-the-counter derivative-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the clearing, exchange trading and margin requirements, will be established through the ongoing rulemaking process of the applicable regulators. In June 2011, both the CFTC and the SEC confirmed that they would not complete the required rulemakings by the July 2011 deadline under the Dodd-Frank Act. Each agency has granted temporary relief from most derivative-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act until the effective date of the applicable rules. Currently, the CFTC temporary relief 49 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued would expire no later than July 16, 2012, if not extended. If, as a result of the rulemaking process, Dominion or Virginia Power derivative activities are not exempted from the clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, the Companies could be subject to higher costs, including from higher margin requirements, for their derivative activities. In addition, implementation of, and compliance with, the over-the-counter derivative provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act by the Companies swap counterparties could result in increased costs related to the Companies derivative activities. Due to the ongoing rulemaking process, the Companies are currently unable to assess the potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Act derivative-related provisions on their financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Nuclear Matters In March 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and subsequent tsunami caused significant damage at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station in northeast Japan. These events have resulted in significant nuclear safety reviews required by the NRC and industry groups such as INPO. Like other U.S. nuclear operators, Dominion has been gathering supporting data and participating in industry initiatives focused on the ability to respond to and mitigate the consequences of design-basis and beyond-design-basis events at its stations. In July 2011, an NRC Task Force provided initial recommendations based on its review of the Fukushima Daiichi accident; and in October 2011, the NRC Staff provided its views on the prioritization of these recommendations and suggested several additional measures. In December 2011, the NRC Commissioners approved the agency staff prioritization and recommendations; and that same month an Appropriations Act directed the NRC to require reevaluation of external hazards (not limited to seismic and flooding hazards) as expeditiously as possible. The NRC anticipates issuance of orders and information requests requiring specific reviews and actions by the first anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami in March 2012. These actions, if adopted, could require nuclear plant modifications and may impact future operations and/or capital requirements at U.S. nuclear facilities, including those owned by Dominion and Virginia Power. In August 2011, a magnitude 5.8 earthquake near Mineral, Virginia caused the two reactors at North Anna to shut down immediately, as designed. Some of the earthquake vibrations briefly exceeded North Anna licensing design basis at certain frequencies, however, Virginia Power inspections have shown no significant damage to equipment at the station from the earthquake. The reactors were placed in cold shutdown condition pending completion of NRC inspection and review. North Anna returned to full service in November 2011, following receipt of NRC approval to restart the two reactors. Cove Point Export and Re-Export Projects In September 2011, Cove Point filed the first part of a two-part domestic export authorization request with the DOE. The DOE approved the request in October 2011. The approval allows for long-term, multi-contract authority to liquefy for export domestically-produced LNG from the Cove Point terminal up to the equivalent of approximately 1 bcf of natural gas per day over a twenty-five year period. The approval also allows for Cove Point to act as an agent for third parties to liquefy for export domestically-produced LNG to other countries that (i) have a free trade agreement with the U.S. that includes natural gas, and (ii) possess the capacity to import LNG via ocean-going carriers. Cove Point filed the second part of the domestic export authorization application in October 2011. In the application, Cove Point requested authority to export domestically-produced LNG to other countries (i) with which the U.S. does not prohibit free trade, but does not have a free trade agreement that includes natural gas, and (ii) that possess the capacity to import LNG via ocean-going carriers. Cove Point is not yet committed to operating an LNG export facility. Cove Point intends to secure customer commitments before deciding whether to proceed, and regulatory approvals will also be required. Subject to a final decision on pursuing the project, as well as securing applicable regulatory and other approvals, construction of liquefaction facilities to convert natural gas into LNG could begin in 2014. In addition to the domestic export project, in August 2011, Cove Point filed an application with the DOE seeking blanket authority to re-export foreign-sourced LNG from the Cove Point terminal. In January 2012, the DOE approved the request to re-export up to the equivalent of 150 bcf of natural gas over a two-year period. The approval allows Cove Point to act as an agent for third parties to re-export LNG to other countries (i) other than those with which the U.S. prohibits free trade, and (ii) that possess the capacity to import LNG via ocean-going carriers. Cove Point must also obtain FERC approval prior to undertaking the minimal construction required for re-export. Brayton Point and Salem Harbor CAA Section 114 Request In May 2010, Dominion received a request for information pursuant to Section 114 of the CAA from the EPA. The request concerns historical operating changes and capital improvements undertaken at Brayton Point and Salem Harbor. Dominion submitted its response to the request in November 2010 and cannot predict the outcome of this matter. Pipeline Safety Act In January 2012, the Pipeline Safety Act was signed into law. The Pipeline Safety Act is intended to address pipeline safety issues that received national attention following a series of significant incidents involving pipelines. The Act provides the U.S. DOT with enhanced safety review authority and requires pipeline owners and operators to confirm, through records or testing, the maximum allowable operating pressure of certain gas pipelines in populated or certain high consequence areas. Operators that fail to confirm the maximum allowable operating pressure for the 50 Table of Contents identified locations within six months of enactment must conduct new testing. The Pipeline Safety Act also requires the U.S. DOT Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to consider certain factors and, if appropriate, to issue regulations requiring automatic shut-off valves on new or replaced pipelines where economically, technically and operationally feasible and to establish time limits for accident and incident notification. In addition, the Act doubles the maximum civil penalty for violations of the U.S. DOT compliance and safety rules from $100,000 to $200,000 for an individual violation and from $1,000,000 to $2,000,000 for a series of violations. While Dominion cannot estimate the potential financial statement impacts of the Pipeline Safety Act, additional operations and maintenance expenses and/or capital expenditures required to comply with the new rules are not expected to be material.
