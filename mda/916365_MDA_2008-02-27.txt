Item 7 . Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and of those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses. Our stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities and offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise: Equine, pet and animal products, including items necessary for their health, care, growth and containment Maintenance products for agricultural and rural use Hardware and tool products Seasonal products, including lawn and garden power equipment Truck and towing products, and Work/recreational clothing and footwear for the entire family. Tractor Supply Company stores typically range in size from 15,500 to 18,500 square feet of inside selling space plus additional outside selling space. We are developing stores using one of five standard prototypes as well as existing building structures. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Del Farm Supply, LLC ( Del ), operates 23 stores, primarily in the Pacific Northwest, that offer a wide selection of products (primarily in the equine, pet and animal category) tailored to those who enjoy the rural lifestyle. Del stores currently range in size from approximately 1,500 to 5,000 square feet of inside selling space plus additional outside and covered/sheltered selling space. Our current and long-term growth strategy is to (1) expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through same-store sales increases, achieved through aggressive merchandising programs with an everyday low prices philosophy and supported by strong customer service, (3) enhance product margin through assortment management, vendor management, sourcing and optimization of transportation and distribution costs, (4) leverage operating costs, especially occupancy, advertising and distribution, (5) expand market opportunities via internet sales, and (6) expand through selective acquisition, as such opportunities arise, to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complimentary strategy to organic growth. We have experienced considerable sales growth over the last five years, with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 17.4%. We plan to continue this growth strategy with an annual projected increase in our unit count of approximately 13%. This growth has expanded our market presence to 764 stores in 43 states. We believe this unit count increase will contribute substantially to our future growth. The acquisition of Del enabled us to establish an initial presence in the Pacific Northwest, primarily in Washington, with three additional stores in Hawaii. We operated 764 retail farm and ranch stores as of December 29, 2007 and have plans to open 95 to 100 stores (including eight to 10 Del stores) in fiscal 2008. We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 650 potential additional markets for new Tractor Supply stores (excluding Del s) in the United States. We have placed significant emphasis on our merchandising programs, evaluating the sales and profitability of our products through detailed line reviews, review of vendor performance measures and modification of the overall product offerings. These efforts, coupled with a strong marketing program and in-depth product knowledge training of our store employees, have enhanced our sales and financial performance. Seasonality and Weather Our business is highly seasonal. Historically, our sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of each year due to the sale of seasonal products. Unseasonable weather, excessive precipitation, natural disasters, drought, and early or late frosts may also affect our sales. We believe, however, that the impact of adverse weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of our stores. We experience our highest inventory and accounts payable levels during our first fiscal quarter each year for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the winter selling season. 16 Table of Contents Inflation Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by inflation. We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, steel, grain, petroleum, corn, soybean and other commodities as well as transportation services. Moreover, in the last few years, energy prices have risen dramatically, which has resulted in increased fuel costs for our business and utility costs for our stores. We have been successful in reducing or mitigating the effects of inflation, principally through selective buying from the most competitive vendors and by increasing retail prices. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful in reducing or mitigating the effect of inflation in the future. Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates Management discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our financial position and/or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates. Description Revenue Recognition and Sales Returns: We recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services. If we receive payment before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise (as per our layaway program), the revenue is deferred until the sale is complete. Revenues from the sale of gift cards are deferred and recognized upon redemption. Judgments and Uncertainties We estimate a liability for sales returns based on a one-year rolling average of historical return trends and we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns associated with past sales. Our estimation methodologies have been consistently applied from year to year, however, as with any estimates, refunds activity may vary from estimated amounts. We recognize a benefit for gift cards when: (i) the gift card or merchandise return card is redeemed by the customer; or (ii) the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote (referred to as breakage ) or (iii) the unredeemed merchandise returns cards expire (one year from issuance). The gift card breakage rate is based upon historical redemption patterns and a benefit is recognized for unredeemed gift cards in proportion to those historical redemption patterns. Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize sales returns in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate sales returns or gift card breakage. However, if actual consumer return or gift card redemption patterns are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our sales return reserve at December 29, 2007, would have affected net earnings by approximately $190,000 in fiscal 2007. A 10% change in our assumptions regarding gift card breakage would have affected net earnings by approximately $225,000 in fiscal 2007. 17 Table of Contents Effect if Actual Results Differ From Description Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions Inventory Valuation: Impairment Risk We identify potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates, sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels and other benchmarks. The estimated inventory valuation reserve to recognize any impairment in value (i.e., an inability to realize the full carrying value) is based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies. We do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term. However, changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves. Our impairment reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding forecasted consumer demand, overall aging, the promotional environment, historical results and current inventory loss trends. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize impairment reserves in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment. However, if assumptions regarding consumer demand or clearance potential for certain products are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our impairment reserve at December 29, 2007, would have affected net earnings by approximately $315,000 in fiscal 2007. Shrinkage Our stores perform physical inventories at least once a year and we have established reserves for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts. This is done by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods sales volumes. Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences. The estimated shrink rate is based on historical experience. We believe historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends. Our shrinkage reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding historical trends, loss prevention measures and new merchandising strategies. We have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize shrinkage in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our shrinkage reserve. However, if our estimates regarding inventory losses are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our shrinkage reserve at December 29, 2007, would have affected net earnings by approximately $810,000 in fiscal 2007. 18 Table of Contents Effect if Actual Results Differ From Description Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions Vendor Support We receive funding from substantially all of our significant merchandise vendors for the promotion of our brand as well as the sale of their products through a variety of programs and arrangements, including guaranteed funding and volume rebate programs. The amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements, which have varying expiration dates ranging in duration from several months to several years. Many agreements are negotiated annually and are based on expected annual purchases of the vendor product. Vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold, which is in compliance with Emerging Issues Task Force No. 02-16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor ( EITF 02-16 ). The amount of expected funding is estimated based upon initial guaranteed commitments, as well as anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors. The estimated purchase volume and related vendor funding is based on our current knowledge of inventory levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store openings and relocations. Although we believe we can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related vendor funding, it is possible that actual results could significantly differ from estimated amounts. Our allocation methodology contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding purchasing activity, target thresholds and vendor attrition. At the end of each fiscal year, the estimated support is reconciled to the actual amounts earned based upon actual purchase activity. We do not believe there is a significant collectibility risk related to vendor support amounts due us at the end of fiscal 2007. Although it is unlikely that there will be any significant reduction in historical levels of vendor support, if such a reduction were to occur, the Company could experience a higher inventory balance and higher cost of sales. If a 10% reserve had been applied against our outstanding vendor support due as of December 29, 2007, net earnings would have been affected by approximately $1.1 million. Freight We incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases. Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories (on an aggregate basis) and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold. We allocate freight as a component of total cost of sales without regard to inventory mix or unique freight burden of certain categories. This assumption has been consistently applied for all years presented. If a 10% increase or decrease had been applied against our current inventory capitalized freight balance, net earnings would have been affected by approximately $3.0 million. 19 Table of Contents Effect if Actual Results Differ From Description Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions Stock-Based Compensation: We have a stock-based compensation plan, which includes incentive and non-qualified stock options, nonvested share awards, and an employee stock purchase plan. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , and Note 2, Shareholders Equity , to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a complete discussion of our stock-based compensation programs. We estimate the fair value of our stock option awards at the date of grant utilizing a Black-Scholes option pricing model. We estimate the fair value of our market-based nonvested share awards at the date of grant utilizing average market price of our stock on the date of the related award. Management reviews its assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third-party valuation advisors to determine the fair value of stock-based compensation awards. Option-pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make subjective assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards. These assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price, expected dividend yield, future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors. In addition to the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value, the estimated forfeiture rate of the awarded options is a critical assumption, as it reduces expense ratably over the vesting period. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. While we update our assumptions annually, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock-based compensation expense. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in stock-based compensation expense that could be material. The reported stock-based compensation expense may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock-based compensation. A 10% change in our stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 29, 2007, would have affected net earnings by approximately $659,000. Self-Insurance Reserves: We self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance, workers compensation and general liability insurance plans. We have stop-loss insurance policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values ($200,000 for employee health insurance claims, $350,000 for workers compensation and $250,000 for general liability). When estimating our self-insured liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and valuations provided by independent third-party actuaries. Management reviews its assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third-party actuaries to determine the adequacy of our self-insured liabilities. The full extent of certain claims, especially workers compensation and general liability claims, may not become fully determined for several years. Our self-insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insurance reserves in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the assumptions we use to calculate insurance reserves. However, if we experience a significant increase in the number of claims or the cost associated with these claims, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our insurance reserves at December 29, 2007, would have affected net earnings by approximately $1.3 million in fiscal 2007. 20 Table of Contents Effect if Actual Results Differ From Description Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions Sales Tax Audit Reserve: A portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers. We obtain exemption information as a necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction. Many of the states in which we conduct business will perform audits to verify our compliance with applicable sales tax laws. The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex environment of compliance. These circumstances also create some risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance. While we believe we reasonably enforce sales tax compliance with our customers and endeavor to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations, there can be no assurance that we, upon final completion of such audits, would not have a significant liability for disallowed exemptions. We review our past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to determine if we have potential exposure for non-compliance. Any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk and our to-date experience with each audit. As each audit progresses, we quantify the exposure based on preliminary assessments made by the state auditors, adjusted for additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment. Our sales tax audit reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the regulatory support for SKU-specific agricultural-based exemptions, ambiguity in state tax regulations, and the level of exemptions support required by applicable states. We have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize the sales tax audit revenue in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate the sales tax liability reserve for current audits. However, if our estimates regarding the ultimate sales tax liability are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our sales tax liability reserve at December 29, 2007, would have affected net earnings by approximately $350,000 in fiscal 2007. Tax Contingencies: Our income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal and state tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record reserves for uncertain tax positions. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. Effective December 31, 2006, we adopted FASB Interpretation ( FIN ) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. Accordingly, we recognize a liability for certain tax benefits that do not meet the minimum requirements for recognition in the financial statements. See Note 10. Our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been met. Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the reserves established for tax benefits not recognized. Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A 10% change in our unrecognized tax benefit reserve at December 29, 2007 would have affected net earnings by approximately $265,000 in fiscal 2007. 21 Table of Contents Effect if Actual Results Differ From Description Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions Goodwill: We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. We complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses, considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm, as appropriate. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill using the methodology described herein, and determined there was no impairment. We determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow and market multiple analyses. These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. It is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations. We have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material. Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset carrying value exceeds the asset estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. We have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. 22 Table of Contents Quarterly Financial Data Our unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2007 and 2006 are shown below (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts): First Second Third Fourth Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Total 2007 Net sales $ 559,832 $ 790,929 $ 629,199 $ 723,252 $ 2,703,212 Gross margin 168,180 250,424 198,647 235,457 852,708 Income from operations 8,980 71,108 29,669 50,284 160,041 Net income 4,999 43,757 17,468 30,017 96,241 Net income per share: (1) Basic $ 0.12 $ 1.10 $ 0.45 $ 0.79 $ 2.45 Diluted $ 0.12 $ 1.08 $ 0.44 $ 0.77 $ 2.40 Same-store sales increase 8.5 % 1.0 % 1.9 % 3.8 % 3.4 % 2006 Net sales $ 465,547 $ 714,944 $ 559,222 $ 629,899 $ 2,369,612 Gross margin 141,995 224,507 174,919 204,725 746,146 Income from operations 1,741 68,931 29,103 48,245 148,020 Net income 525 42,927 18,059 29,497 91,008 Net income per share: (1) Basic $ 0.01 $ 1.07 $ 0.45 $ 0.73 $ 2.27 Diluted $ 0.01 $ 1.05 $ 0.44 $ 0.72 $ 2.22 Same-store sales increase 3.7 % 0.5 % 2.4 % 0.5 % 1.6 % (1) Due to the nature of interim earnings per share calculations, the sum of quarterly earnings per share amounts may not equal the reported earnings per share for the year. 23 Table of Contents Results of Operations Our fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year. References to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended. The fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 contains 53 weeks while the fiscal years ended December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 contain 52 weeks. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of net sales. 2007 2006 2005 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of merchandise sold 68.5 68.5 69.2 Gross margin 31.5 31.5 30.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses 23.7 23.5 22.6 Depreciation and amortization 1.9 1.8 1.6 Income from operations 5.9 6.2 6.6 Interest expense, net 0.2 0.1 0.1 Income before income taxes 5.7 6.1 6.5 Income tax provision 2.1 2.3 2.4 Net income 3.6 % 3.8 % 4.1 % Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 Net sales increased 14.1% to $2,703.2 million in fiscal 2007 from $2,369.6 million in fiscal 2006. This increase resulted from the opening of new stores as well as a same-store sales improvement of 3.4%. Our average transaction value increased 1.1% to $43.60 while same-store transaction value decreased 0.1% for fiscal 2007. Average daily transaction count per store increased 0.6% to 239, and same-store transaction count increased 3.5%. Same-store sales improvements of 3.4% compared to 1.6% in the prior year were strongest in the livestock/pet and truck/towing categories, but were partially offset by lower than expected performance in seasonal and hardware/tool products. In fiscal 2007, we opened 89 new stores (compared to 82 new stores in fiscal 2006), relocated 12 stores (compared to 15 in fiscal 2006) and sold our only Del store located in Canada (compared to one closed store in fiscal 2006). As a percent of sales, gross margin was unchanged at 31.5% compared with the prior year. Reductions in direct product costs were achieved through improved sourcing and mix of sales, but were offset by slightly higher transportation costs and increased shrinkage. As a percent of sales, selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses increased 20 basis points to 23.7% in fiscal 2007 from 23.5% in fiscal 2006. The increase is primarily attributable to increased occupancy and payroll costs from new stores, which generally have higher costs in relation to sales volume than the chain average. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 20.7% in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 due mainly to costs associated with new stores. Net interest expense increased 10 basis points as a percent of sales to $5.0 million in fiscal 2007 from $2.7 million in fiscal 2006. This increase is due largely to borrowings related to the stock repurchase program. Our effective tax rate was 37.9% for fiscal 2007 compared to 37.4% in fiscal 2006, resulting primarily from state taxes relating to the composition of income among the states and the adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes , ( FIN 48 ) relating to uncertainties in income tax positions. This interpretation prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. Tax positions that meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be measured in order to determine the tax benefit to be recognized. We are no longer subject to federal examination for years before 2005, and state and local income tax examinations for years before 2002. We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 in fiscal 2007, as required. As a result, we charged approximately $1.9 million to retained earnings for the cumulative effect of adoption including interest. Interest and penalties were immaterial at the date of adoption. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $2.3 million. In addition, we recognize current interest accrued related to these uncertain tax positions as interest expense. 24 Table of Contents As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2007 increased 5.8% to $96.2 million, or $2.40 per diluted share. Compared to net income of $91.0 million, or $2.22 per diluted share, in fiscal 2006. During 2007, the Company repurchased 3.2 million shares of its stock for $150.0 million as part of our previously announced $200 million share repurchase program. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Net sales increased 14.6% to $2,369.6 million in fiscal 2006 from $2,068.0 million in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2005 included an additional week of sales which impacted the current year sales increase by 1.5%. This increase resulted from the opening of new stores as well as a same-store sales improvement of 1.6%. Our average transaction value increased 2.6% to $43.12 and same-store transaction value increased 0.8% for fiscal 2006. Average daily transaction count per store decreased 2.9% to 238, while same-store transaction count increased 0.7%. Same-store sales improvements of 1.6% compared to 5.7% in the prior year were strongest in the clothing/footwear and equine/pet/animal categories, but were partially offset by lower than expected performance in seasonal power equipment, generators and cold weather-related products, including insulated outerwear, snow removal and heating. In fiscal 2006, we opened 82 new stores (compared to 65 new stores and the acquisition of 16 Del stores in fiscal 2005), relocated 15 stores (compared to 18 in fiscal 2005) and closed one store (compared to one closure in fiscal 2005). As a percent of sales, gross margin increased 80 basis points to 31.7% for fiscal 2006 from 30.9% for fiscal 2005. Gross margin was primarily impacted by a more favorable product mix, increased importing and improved inventory shrinkage. During the year, we refined our method of estimating the freight cost component of inventory based on changes in our business and operating environment which included a change in mix of goods, an increased level of importing and rapidly increasing fuel costs. This refinement provides a more appropriate matching of freight cost incurred with inventory and cost of merchandise sold. This change in estimate increased the inventory value and reduced the freight component of cost of merchandise sold by approximately $2.9 million for fiscal 2006. As a percent of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 90 basis points to 23.5% in fiscal 2006 from 22.6% in fiscal 2005. The increase is primarily attributable to increased occupancy costs and a charge of $9.7 million (or 0.4% of sales) related to stock compensation expense. During the year, we refined our method of estimating the amount of gift cards sold that will ultimately go unredeemed. Our estimate was based on an analysis of gift card sale and redemption patterns across an extended historical timeline. We accordingly recognized a benefit of $2.4 million and $0.3 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. Of the $2.4 million recognized in fiscal 2006, $2.1 million (or 0.1% of sales) was due to a modification of the redemption assumptions based on an analysis of historical redemption patterns. This benefit has been included as a reduction in selling, general, and administrative expenses and is reflected as a reduction of other accrued expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R) Share-Based Payment ( SFAS 123(R) ) using the modified prospective method and began recognizing compensation expense for share-based payments based on the fair value of the awards. Share-based payments include stock option grants and certain transactions under our other stock plans. SFAS 123(R) requires share-based compensation expense recognized since the beginning of fiscal 2006 to be based on the following: a) grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123 for unvested options granted prior to the adoption date; b) grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R) for all share-based payments granted subsequent to the adoption date; and c) the discount on shares sold to employees post-adoption, which represents the difference between the grant date fair value and the employee purchase price. For fiscal 2006, the adoption of the SFAS 123(R) fair value method resulted in additional compensation expense (a component of selling, general and administrative expenses) related to our stock plans that we would not have recognized had we continued to account for share-based compensation under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, 25 Table of Contents Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees ( APB 25 ). For fiscal 2006, this share-based compensation expense lowered pre-tax income by $9.7 million and net income by $6.1 million. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 24.3% in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 due mainly to costs associated with new and relocated stores and remodeled existing stores. Net interest expense increased 64.7% in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005. This increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates in fiscal 2006 and interest incurred as the result of federal and sales tax audits; partially offset by a reduction in average long-term borrowings under our revolving credit agreement. Our effective tax rate was 37.4% for fiscal 2006 compared to 36.5% in fiscal 2005, resulting primarily from a higher effective income tax rate due to the non-deductibility of certain stock compensation expense related to the adoption of SFAS123(R). As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2006 increased 6.2% to $91.0 million, or $2.22 per diluted share, which includes a $9.7 million charge, or $0.15 per diluted share, in stock compensation expense. This compares to net income of $85.7 million, or $2.09 per diluted share, in fiscal 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources In addition to normal operating expenses, our primary ongoing cash requirements are for expansion, remodeling and relocation programs, including inventory purchases and capital expenditures. Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are funds provided from operations, commitments available under our revolving credit agreement, capital and operating leases and normal trade credit. Our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the spring and winter selling seasons, respectively. Working Capital At December 29, 2007, we had working capital of $312.1 million, a $4.0 million decrease from December 30, 2006. This decrease was primarily attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities (in millions): 2007 2006 Variance Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 13.7 $ 26.4 $ (12.7 ) Inventories 636.0 594.9 41.1 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 41.9 37.0 4.9 Deferred income taxes 0.3 11.3 (11.0 ) 691.9 669.6 22.3 Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 258.3 $ 229.2 $ 29.1 Accrued expenses 115.6 111.7 3.9 Income taxes payable 5.1 11.5 (6.4 ) Other, net 0.8 1.1 (0.3 ) 379.8 353.5 26.3 Working capital $ 312.1 $ 316.1 $ (4.0 ) The increase in inventories and related increase in accounts payable resulted primarily from the purchase of inventory for new stores. Trade credit arises from our vendors granting extended payment terms for inventory purchases. Payment terms generally vary from 30 days to 180 days depending on the inventory product. We experienced an increase in our financed inventory from approximately 37.3% to 38.3%. (The calculated financed inventory assumes average inventory, excludes in-transit inventories and includes only unopened stores with significant inventory). While we experienced a seven basis point decrease in inventory turns (approximately 2.60 times per year), we improved our per-store inventory levels through targeted inventory level improvement initiatives. These initiatives included better exit strategies on one-time, special buys; a focused approach on new store inventory levels and less productive inventory; and a more rigorous training program on our E3 inventory management software. 26 Table of Contents The decrease in the deferred tax assets is a result of changes in temporary differences associated with the accounting for income taxes. Certain items of income and expense such as gift card receipts, inventory costing and depreciation expense may not be recognized in the same accounting period for income tax purposes as they are for financial reporting purposes. Borrowings and Credit Facilities In August 2002, we entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as agent for a lender group (the Credit Agreement ), whereby we were permitted to borrow up to $155 million. The Credit Agreement was subsequently amended on January 28, 2004 and September 30, 2004 (primarily with respect to financial covenants) and replaced on February 22, 2007. On February 22, 2007 we entered into a new Senior Credit Facility with Bank of America, N.A, as agent for a lender group (the Credit Agreement ), allowing us to borrow up to $250 million (with sublimits of $75 million and $10 million for letters of credit and swingline loans, respectively). This agreement is unsecured and has a five year term, with proceeds expected to be used for working capital, capital expenditures and share repurchases. At December 29, 2007, there were $55 million in borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement and there were no outstanding borrowings at December 30, 2006. There were an additional $25.0 million and $24.9 million outstanding letters of credit as of December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, respectively. Borrowings bear interest at either the bank base rate (7.25% at December 29, 2007) or the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate ( LIBOR ) (4.86% at December 29, 2007) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.35% to 0.90% per annum, adjusted quarterly based on our performance (0.50% at December 29, 2007). We are also required to pay, quarterly in arrears, a commitment fee ranging from 0.06% to 0.18% per annum and adjusted quarterly based on our performance, for unused capacity (0.10% at December 29, 2007). There are no compensating balance requirements associated with the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains certain restrictions regarding additional indebtedness, capital expenditures, business operations, guarantees, investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates, and liens. The new agreement eliminated the capital expenditures, net worth and current ratio requirements from the previous agreement and requires quarterly compliance with respect to fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 29, 2007. In February 2008, we exercised the increase option on our Senior Credit Facility increasing the overall capacity from $250 million to $350 million. Each of the nine lenders within our credit facility bank group participated in the increase. Simultaneously, definitions within the existing credit facility were modified as follows: (1) added an additional Increase Option for $150 million; (2) modified the definition of swingline committed amount from $10 million to $20 million; and (3) revised the definition of the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant to remove certain defined fixed charges. All pricing terms and the term of the facility remained the same. Sources and Uses of Cash Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations. Principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures and financing activities are payments on debt and repurchase of the Company common stock. The following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years (in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 155.0 $ 87.5 $ 104.5 Net cash used in investing activities (82.6 ) (80.8 ) (90.7 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (85.1 ) 10.1 (16.2 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (12.7 ) $ 16.8 $ (2.4 ) 27 Table of Contents Operating Activities The $67.5 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions): 2007 2006 Variance Net income $ 96.2 $ 91.0 $ 5.2 Depreciation and amortization 51.1 42.3 8.8 Stock compensation expense 10.6 9.7 0.9 Deferred income taxes 7.0 (3.5 ) 10.5 Inventories and accounts payable (11.9 ) (78.7 ) 66.8 Accrued expenses 4.3 8.8 (4.5 ) Income taxes currently payable (6.5 ) 10.1 (16.6 ) Other, net 4.2 7.8 (3.6 ) Net cash provided by operations $ 155.0 $ 87.5 $ 67.5 We reclassified cash balances in our bank concentration account against the book overdraft included in accounts payable, resulting in a change in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 net cash provided by operations. The improvement in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 was primarily due to changes in inventory levels and the timing of payments. Inventory levels increased less in 2007 compared to 2006, due to the timing of imports and a focus on inventory management in 2007. Additionally, we achieved a slight increase in financed inventory, resulting in a higher increase in accounts payable relative to inventory. The change in cash used for income taxes relates to the timing of quarterly payments caused by annualized proration requirements. The $17.0 million decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions): 2006 2005 Variance Net income $ 91.0 $ 85.7 $ 5.3 Tax benefit of stock options exercised 12.5 (12.5 ) Depreciation and amortization 42.3 34.0 8.3 Stock compensation expense 9.7 9.7 Deferred income taxes (3.5 ) (12.7 ) 9.2 Inventories and accounts payable (78.7 ) (29.6 ) (49.1 ) Accrued expenses 8.8 12.8 (4.0 ) Income taxes currently payable 10.1 1.4 8.7 Other, net 7.8 0.4 7.4 Net cash provided by operations. $ 87.5 $ 104.5 $ (17.0 ) The decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 is primarily due to the net increase in inventory and accounts payable (as discussed in the Working Capital section), partially offset by an increase in net income adjusted for non-cash items. Investing Activities Investing activities used $82.6 million, $80.8 million, and $90.7 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The majority of this cash requirement relates to our capital expenditures and, in fiscal 2005, the acquisition of the assets of Del s. Our significant store expansion, coupled with required investment in infrastructure, required the following capital expenditures, including capital leases (in thousands): 2007 2006 2005 New and relocated stores and stores not yet opened $ 38,119 $ 54,111 $ 40,525 Existing store properties acquired from lessor 6,790 Existing stores 18,276 20,214 11,424 Distribution center capacity and improvements 3,280 2,302 19,585 Information technology 17,377 13,336 6,612 Corporate and other 144 602 689 $ 83,986 $ 90,565 $ 78,835 28 Table of Contents Our long-term growth strategy anticipates continued geographic market expansion and further concentration within existing markets. This growth will also require continuing investment in information technology and people. The costs reflected above are typically building improvements, as we lease the majority of our facilities. We currently estimate that capital expenditures will range between $100 million and $105 million in fiscal 2008. Financing Activities Financing activities used $85.1 million, provided $10.1 million, and used $16.2 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2007 is mainly the result of share repurchase activity partially offset by borrowings and share issuances. In February 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program which provides for repurchase of up to $200 million (excluding commissions) of our outstanding common stock over an approximate three-year period. The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions. The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. For fiscal 2007, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares at a total cost of $150.0 million. Repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance. We believe that our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under the Credit Agreement, and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs, including store openings, relocations and renovations, over the next several years. Significant Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of December 29, 2007 (in thousands): Payment Due by Period Total Contractual Less than More than Obligations 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years 5 years Long-term debt (1) $ 55,000 $ $ $ 55,000 $ Operating leases 1,205,020 126,419 239,516 217,675 621,410 Capital leases (2) 5,242 1,040 1,222 336 2,644 Purchase obligations (3) 13,226 10,712 2,514 $ 1,278,488 $ 138,171 $ 243,252 $ 273,011 $ 624,054 (1) Long-term debt balances represent principal maturities, excluding interest. At December 29, 2007, this entire amount relates to the Company Credit Agreement. (2) Capital lease obligations include related interest. (3) The amounts for purchase obligations include commitments for construction of stores expected to be opened in fiscal 2008 and for acquisition of a store property previously under lease. The Company had outstanding standby letters of credit of $25.0 million as of December 29, 2007. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements consist of operating leases and outstanding letters of credit. The balances for these arrangements are discussed above. We typically lease buildings for retail stores and offices rather than acquiring these assets which allows us to utilize financial capital to operate the business rather than invest in fixed assets. Letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory, primarily sourced overseas, and support certain risk management programs in a timely manner. 29 Table of Contents Known Trends, Events, Demands, Commitments and Uncertainties Litigation We are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. After consultation with legal counsel, we expect these matters will be resolved without material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Any estimated loss related to such matters has been adequately provided in accrued liabilities to the extent probable and reasonably estimable. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in circumstances relating to these proceedings. Recent Accounting Pronouncements How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement In March 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ) reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 06-3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross Versus Net Presentation) , which allows companies to adopt a policy of presenting taxes in the income statement on either a gross or net basis. Taxes within the scope of this EITF would include taxes that are imposed on a revenue transaction between a seller and a customer, for example, sales taxes, use taxes, value-added taxes, and some types of excise taxes. EITF 06-3 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning in fiscal 2007. The adoption of EITF 06-3 did not impact the method for recording and reporting these sales taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements as our policy is to exclude all such taxes from revenue. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 ( FIN 48 ) to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. This Interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This Interpretation prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. Tax positions that meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be measured in order to determine the tax benefit to be recognized. We adopted FIN 48 in fiscal 2007, as required. (See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.) Fair Value Measurements In September 2006, the FASB issued statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements , ( SFAS 157 ). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. On December 14, 2007, the FASB issued proposed FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-b, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 (the proposed FSP). The proposed FSP would amend FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (Statement 157), to delay the effective date of Statement 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (that is, at least annually). The proposed FSP defers the effective date of Statement 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of the proposed FSP. The Company is subject to the remaining provisions of SFAS 157 beginning December 30, 2007. The adoption of SFAS 157 did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow. The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities In February 2007, the FASB issued statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( SFAS 159 ). SFAS 159 allows entities the option to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value as of specified dates. Such election, which may be applied on an instrument by instrument basis, is typically irrevocable once elected. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The adoption of SFAS 159 did not result in a material impact to our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow. 30 Table of Contents I tem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement bears interest at either the bank base rate (7.25% and 8.25% at December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, respectively) or LIBOR (4.86% and 5.32% at December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, respectively) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.35% to 0.90% per annum, adjusted quarterly, based on our performance (0.50% at both December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006). We are also required to pay (quarterly in arrears) a commitment fee ranging from 0.06% to 0.18% based on the daily average unused portion of the credit line (0.10% at December 29, 2007). A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move (increase) in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would result in approximately $900,000 of additional annual interest expense and would not impact the fair market value of the long-term debt. 31 Table of Contents
