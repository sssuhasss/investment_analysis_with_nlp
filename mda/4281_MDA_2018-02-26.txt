Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (dollars in millions, except per-share amounts and aluminum prices; shipments in thousands of metric tons [kmt]) Overview Our Business Arconic ( Arconic or the Company ) is a global leader in lightweight metals engineering and manufacturing. Arconic innovative, multi-material products, which include aluminum, titanium, and nickel, are used worldwide in aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation, packaging, building and construction, oil and gas, defense, consumer electronics, and industrial applications. Arconic is a global company operating in 18 countries. Based upon the country where the point of sale occurred, the United States and Europe generated 63% and 26%, respectively, of Arconic sales in 2017 . In addition, Arconic has operating activities in Brazil, Canada, China, Japan, and Russia, among others. Governmental policies, laws and regulations, and other economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, affect the results of operations in these countries. Management Review of 2017 and Outlook for the Future In 2017, Arconic revenues increased 5% over 2016 as a result of higher volumes across all segments including strong volume growth in our aerospace, automotive, and commercial transportation markets, and higher aluminum pricing primarily impacting the Global Rolled Products segment, partially offset by the planned ramp down and Toll Processing and Services Agreement (the Toll Processing Agreement ) relating to the Company North America packaging business in Tennessee, and unfavorable product pricing and mix. In the segments, Adjusted EBITDA increased over 2016 as a result of the aforementioned higher volumes and continued focus on net cost savings that more than offset negative factors including product pricing pressures, ramp up costs associated with new aerospace engine parts, aerospace customer inventory destocking and reduced build rates, and higher aluminum prices. Loss from continuing operations after income taxes was $74 in 2017 compared to $1,062 in 2016. There were several significant items that impacted the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company recorded a charge of $719 ($719 pre-tax) associated with the impairment of goodwill in the forgings and extrusions business and a charge of $41 ($41 pre-tax) for the impairment of assets in the Latin America extrusions business in conjunction with an agreement to sell the business. Also in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded income of $97 ($106 pre-tax) associated with the reversal of liabilities for a contingent earn-out and a separation-related guarantee. The Company was also impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 ( the 2017 Act ), and recorded a provisional charge of $272 associated with the revaluation of U.S. net deferred tax assets due to a decrease in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, as well as a one-time transition tax on the non-previously taxed earnings and profits of certain U.S.-owned foreign corporations as of December 31, 2017. The impact of the 2017 Act provisions will be updated over the course of 2018, in accordance with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission which has provided a one-year measurement period to finalize the accounting impacts of the new legislation, and as additional guidance is issued and the new law is further analyzed. Additionally during 2017, the Company disposed of its retained interest in Alcoa Corporation common stock and recorded gains of $405 ($518 pre-tax), and the Company redeemed debt of $1,250, recording charges of $49 ($76 pre-tax) primarily for the premium paid for the early redemption of the debt. See discussion that follows under Results of Operations below for further information on 2017 results. Management continued its focus on liquidity and cash flows as well as improving its operating performance through cost reductions, streamlined organizational structures, margin enhancement, and profitable revenue generation. Management has also intensified its focus on capital efficiency. This focus and the related results enabled Arconic to end 2017 with a solid financial position. 34 Table of Contents The following financial information reflects certain key measures of Arconic 2017 results: Sales of $12,960 and Net loss of $74 , or 0.28 per diluted share; Consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $1,761 , an increase of 17% from 2016 1 ; Cash from operations of $701 ; Capital expenditures of $596 ; Cash on hand at the end of the year of $2,150 ; and Total debt of $6,844 , a decrease in total debt of $1,240 from 2016 . (1) For the reconciliation of Net loss attributable to Arconic to Consolidated adjusted EBITDA and related information, see page 45. In 2018, management projects that sales will be up 3% to 6% based on volume and share gains, as well as higher aluminum prices. In aerospace, it is anticipated that the favorable impact of share gains on new platforms and engines will be somewhat offset by lower pricing and the mix of wide-body and narrow-body aircraft produced. Management also expects strong growth in automotive sheet and commercial transportation markets, particularly due to North American and European heavy-duty truck production increases, while the industrial gas turbine market will continue declining throughout 2018. Looking ahead over the next year, management will continue to focus on improving operating performance through cost reductions, margin enhancement, and profitable revenue generation. As part of this effort, the Company made the decision to freeze its U.S. defined benefit pension plans for all U.S.-based salaried and non-bargained hourly employees effective April 1, 2018, and the Company intends to relocate its global headquarters by the end of 2018 out of New York City to a more cost-effective location. Management has initiated a review of the Company strategy and portfolio. Additionally, each of the segments are projected to achieve net cost savings in 2018. As a result, adjusted earnings per share is anticipated to increase and free cash flow is also expected to improve in 2018 through increased focus on driving operational improvements and working capital efficiency. To further enhance the Company financial position and return capital to shareholders, Arconic Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $500 of its outstanding common stock and a $500 early debt reduction. Under the share repurchase program, the Company may repurchase shares from time to time, in amounts, at prices, and at such times as the Company deems appropriate. Repurchases will be subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other considerations. The Company is not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares or to do so at any particular time, and the share repurchase program may be suspended, modified or terminated at any time without prior notice. For the early debt reduction, Arconic intends to redeem in March 2018 all of its outstanding 5.72% Notes due in 2019. Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, the Company's primary measure of segment performance will change from Adjusted EBITDA to Operating income, which more closely aligns segment performance with Operating income as presented in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. As part of this change, LIFO and metal price lag will be included in the Operating income of the segments. In conjunction with the implementation of the new accounting guidance on changes to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments within the statement of cash flows (effective January 1, 2018 and to be applied retrospectively), specifically as it relates to the requirement to reclassify cash received from net sales of beneficial interest in sold receivables from Cash from operations to Cash provided from investing activities, the Company has changed the calculation of its measure of free cash flow to Cash from operations plus cash received from net sales of beneficial interest in sold receivables, less Capital expenditures. This change to our measure of free cash flow is being implemented to ensure consistent presentation of this measure across all historical periods, once the required accounting guidance reclassification is reflected in our financial results beginning in the first quarter of 2018. The adoption of this accounting change does not reflect a change in our underlying business or activities. 2016 Separation Transaction. On November 1, 2016, the Company completed the separation of its business into two standalone, publicly-traded companies, Arconic Inc. and Alcoa Corporation. Following the Separation Transaction, Arconic comprises the Global Rolled Products (other than the rolling mill in Warrick, Indiana, and the 25.1% equity ownership stake in the Ma aden Rolling Company), the Engineered Products and Solutions, and the Transportation and Construction Solutions segments. Alcoa Corporation comprises the Alumina and Primary Metals segments, the rolling mill in Warrick, Indiana, and the 25.1% equity ownership stake in the Ma aden Rolling Company in Saudi Arabia. 35 Table of Contents The Separation Transaction was effected by the distribution of 80.1% of the outstanding shares of Alcoa Corporation common stock to the Company shareholders (the Distribution ). The Company shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 20, 2016 (the Record Date ) received one share of Alcoa Corporation common stock for every three shares of the Company common stock held as of the Record Date. The Company distributed 146,159,428 shares of common stock of Alcoa Corporation in the Distribution and retained 36,311,767 shares, or approximately 19.9% (see disposition of retained shares under Results of Operations below), of the common stock of Alcoa Corporation immediately following the Distribution. As a result of the Distribution, Alcoa Corporation is now an independent public company trading under the symbol AA on the New York Stock Exchange, and the Company trades under the symbol ARNC on the New York Stock Exchange. On October 31, 2016, Arconic entered into several agreements with Alcoa Corporation that govern the relationship of the parties following the completion of the Separation Transaction. These agreements include the following: Separation and Distribution Agreement, Transition Services Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, Alcoa Corporation to Arconic Inc. Patent, Know-How, and Trade Secret License Agreement, Arconic Inc. to Alcoa Corporation Patent, Know-How, and Trade Secret License Agreement, Alcoa Corporation to Arconic Inc. Trademark License Agreement, Toll Processing and Services Agreement, Master Agreement for the Supply of Primary Aluminum, Massena Lease and Operations Agreement, Fusina Lease and Operations Agreement, and Stockholder and Registration Rights Agreement. Results of Operations Earnings Summary Sales Sales for 2017 were $12,960 compared with sales of $12,394 in 2016 , an increase of $566 , or 5% . The increase was the result of strong volume growth in all segments and higher aluminum pricing, partially offset by the planned ramp down and Toll Processing Agreement relating to the Company North America packaging business in Tennessee in the Global Rolled Products segment, as well as unfavorable product pricing in both the Engineered Products and Solutions and Global Rolled Products segments. Pursuant to the Toll Processing Agreement that Arconic entered into with Alcoa Corporation on October 31, 2016 in connection with the Separation Transaction, Arconic provides can body stock to Alcoa Corporation using aluminum supplied by Alcoa Corporation, resulting in the absence of metal sales in 2017 compared to 2016. Sales for 2016 were $12,394 compared with sales of $12,413 in 2015, a decline of $19, or less than 1%. The relatively flat performance was the result of a full-year effect of two 2015 acquisitions in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment and automotive volume increases in the Global Rolled Products segment, which were more than offset by the ramp-down of the Tennessee packaging business and the impact of aluminum prices in the Global Rolled Products segment and unfavorable product price and mix across all segments. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) COGS as a percentage of Sales was 79.9% in 2017 compared with 79.2% in 2016 . The increase was primarily attributable to cost increases, including net higher aluminum prices of $84 and ramp-up costs related to new commercial aerospace engines, and a lower margin product mix, partially offset by net cost savings. COGS as a percentage of Sales was 79.2% in 2016 compared with 81.4% in 2015. The primary drivers in the improvement in COGS as a percentage of sales were productivity gains across all segments and higher volume in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment due to the benefit of a full-year effect of two 2015 acquisitions. This benefit was somewhat offset by overall cost increases across all segments and unfavorable product pricing and mix impacts primarily in the Engineered Products and Solutions and Global Rolled Products segments. Selling, General Administrative, and Other Expenses (SG&A) SG&A expenses were $731 , or 5.6% of Sales, in 2017 compared with $942 , or 7.6% of Sales, in 2016 . The decrease in SG&A was the result of expenses related to the Separation Transaction of $193 in 2016 compared to $18 in 2017, as well as ongoing overhead cost reduction efforts (see Restructuring and Other Charges below), partially offset by proxy, advisory and governance-related costs of $58, external legal and other advisory costs related to Grenfell Tower of $14 and costs associated with the Company Delaware reincorporation of $3 in 2017. , SG&A expenses were $942, or 7.6% of Sales, in 2016 compared with $765, or 6.2% of Sales, in 2015. The increase in SG&A was primarily due to costs related to the Separation Transaction of $193 in 2016, an increase of $169 from 2015 separation costs. Research and Development Expenses (R&D) R&D expenses were $111 in 2017 compared with $132 in 2016 and $169 in 2015. The decrease in 2017 as compared to 2016 was driven by lower spending. The decrease in 2016 as compared to 2015 was driven by the decrease in spending for the Micromill in San Antonio, TX which was completed in 2015 and began production of automotive sheet, on a limited basis, for the Global Rolled Products segment. 36 Table of Contents Provision for Depreciation and Amortization (D&A) The provision for D&A was $551 in 2017 compared with $535 in 2016 . The increase of $16 , or 3% , was primarily due to capital projects placed into service. The provision for D&A was $535 in 2016 compared with $508 in 2015. The increase of $27 related to a full year of D&A related to two acquisitions which occurred during 2015 (see Engineered Products and Solutions under Segment Information below). Impairment of Goodwill In 2017, the Company recognized an impairment of goodwill of $719, related to the annual impairment review of the Arconic Forgings and Extrusions business. In 2015, the Company recognized an impairment of goodwill of $25 related to the annual impairment review of the soft alloy extrusion business in Brazil. See Goodwill under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below. Restructuring and Other Charges Restructuring and other charges for each year in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017 were comprised of the following: 2017 2016 2015 Asset impairments $ 58 $ 80 $ Layoff costs 64 70 97 Net loss on divestitures of businesses 57 3 136 Other (3 ) 27 (11 ) Reversals of previously recorded layoff costs (11 ) (25 ) (8 ) Restructuring and other charges $ 165 $ 155 $ 214 Layoff costs were recorded based on approved detailed action plans submitted by the operating locations that specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans, union contracts or statutory requirements, and the expected timetable for completion of the plans. 2017 Actions . In 2017, Arconic recorded Restructuring and other charges of $165 ($143 after-tax), which were comprised of the following components: $69 ($47 after-tax) for layoff costs related to cost reduction initiatives including the separation of approximately 880 employees (400 in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, 245 in the Global Rolled Products segment, 135 in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment and 100 in Corporate), a charge of $60 ($60 after-tax) related to the sale of the Fusina, Italy rolling mill; a charge of $41 ($41 after-tax) for the impairment of assets associated with the agreement to sell the Latin America Extrusions business (see Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K); a net benefit of $6 ($4 after-tax), for the reversal of forfeited executive stock compensation of $13, partially offset by a charge of $7 for the related severance; a net charge of $12 ($7 after-tax) for other miscellaneous items; and a favorable benefit of $11 ($8 after-tax) for the reversal of a number of small layoff reserves related to prior periods. As of December 31, 2017 , approximately 300 of the 880 employees were separated. The remaining separations for 2017 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2018 . In 2017 , cash payments of $28 were made against layoff reserves related to 2017 restructuring programs. 2016 Actions. In 2016, Arconic recorded Restructuring and other charges of $155 ($114 after-tax), which were comprised of the following components: $57 ($46 after-tax) for costs related to the exit of certain legacy Firth Rixson operations in the U.K.; $37 ($24 after-tax) for exit costs related to the decision to permanently shut down a can sheet facility; $20 ($14 after-tax) for costs related to the closures of five facilities, primarily in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment and Engineered Products and Solutions segment, including the separation of approximately 280 employees; $53 ($33 after-tax) for other layoff costs, including the separation of approximately 1,315 employees (1,045 in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, 210 in Corporate, 30 in the Global Rolled Products segment and 30 in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment); $11 ($8 after-tax) for other miscellaneous items, including $3 ($2 after-tax) for the sale of Remmele Medical; $2 ($1 after-tax) for a pension settlement; and $25 ($12 after-tax) for the reversal of a number of small layoff reserves related to prior periods. In 2016, management made the decision to exit certain legacy Firth Rixson facilities in the U.K. Costs related to these actions included asset impairments and accelerated depreciation of $51; other exit costs of $4; and $2 for the separation of 60 employees. Also in 2016, management approved the shutdown and demolition of the can sheet facility in Tennessee upon completion of the Toll Processing Agreement with Alcoa Corporation (see Global Rolled Products under Segment Information below). Costs related to this action included $21 in asset impairments; $9 in other exit costs; and $7 for the separation of 145 employees. The other exit costs of $9 represent $4 in asset retirement obligations and $3 in environmental remediation, both of which were triggered by the decision to permanently shut down and demolish the can sheet facility in Tennessee, and $2 in other exit costs. 37 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2017 , approximately 1,280 of the 1,700 (previously 1,750 ) employees were separated. The total number of employees associated with 2016 restructuring programs was updated to reflect employees, who were initially identified for separation, accepting other positions within Arconic and natural attrition. The remaining separations for 2016 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2018. In 2017 and 2016 , cash payments of $26 and $16 were made against layoff reserves related to 2016 restructuring programs. 2015 Actions. In 2015, Arconic recorded Restructuring and other charges of $214 ($192 after-tax), which were comprised of the following components: a $136 ($134 after-tax) net loss related to the March 2015 divestiture of a rolling mill in Russia and post-closing adjustments associated with the December 2014 divestitures of three rolling mills located in Spain and France; $97 ($70 after-tax) for layoff costs, including the separation of approximately 1,505 employees (590 in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, 425 in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment, 400 in Corporate, and 90 in the Global Rolled Products segment); an $18 ($13 after-tax) gain on the sale of land related to one of the rolling mills in Australia that was permanently closed in December 2014; a net charge of $7 ($4 after-tax) for other miscellaneous items; and $8 ($3 after-tax) for the reversal of a number of small layoff reserves related to prior periods. As of December 31, 2017 , the separations associated with the 2015 restructuring programs were essentially complete. In 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , cash payments of $5 , $55 and $18 , respectively, were made against layoff reserves related to 2015 restructuring programs. Arconic does not include Restructuring and other charges in the results of its reportable segments. The pre-tax impact of allocating such charges to segment results would have been as follows: 2017 2016 2015 Engineered Products and Solutions $ 30 $ 78 $ 46 Global Rolled Products 72 40 121 Transportation and Construction Solutions 52 14 8 Segment total 154 132 175 Corporate 11 23 39 Total restructuring and other charges $ 165 $ 155 $ 214 Interest Expense Interest expense was $496 in 2017 compared with $499 in 2016 . The decrease of $3 , or 1% , was primarily due to lower interest expense resulting from lower outstanding debt, mostly offset by $73 primarily in higher premiums paid in 2017 related to the early redemption of $1,250 in debt. In the second quarter of 2017, Arconic redeemed all of the Company 6.50% Bonds due 2018 and 6.75% Notes due 2018, and a portion of the Company 5.72% Notes due 2019 in advance of the respective maturity dates. Interest expense was $499 in 2016 compared with $473 in 2015. The increase of $26, or 5%, was primarily due to debt issuance costs of $9 that were expensed in connection with the Separation Transaction and costs associated with the early redemption of $750 of 5.55% Notes due February 2017, completed on December 30, 2016, which included a $3 purchase premium, and a full-year of interest related to RTI International Metals, Inc. (RTI) debt of $6. Other Income, Net Other income, net was $640 in 2017 compared with $94 in 2016 . The increase of $546 was primarily due to the gain on the sale of a portion of Arconic investment in Alcoa Corporation common stock of $351 (in February 2017, the Company sold 23,353,000 shares of Alcoa Corporation stock at $38.03 per share, which resulted in cash proceeds of $888 and a gain of $351) and the gain of $167 on the Debt-for-Equity Exchange (in April and May 2017, the Company acquired a portion of its outstanding notes held by two investment banks (the Investment Banks ) in exchange for cash and the Company remaining 12,958,767 shares (valued at $35.91 per share) in Alcoa Corporation stock and recorded a gain of $167), income of $25 associated with a higher reversal of a contingent earn-out liability related to the Firth Rixson acquisition (see Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information), and income of $25 due to the reversal of a liability associated with a separation-related guarantee. The Company was required to provide a guarantee for an Alcoa Corporation electricity contract in the event of an Alcoa Corporation payment default. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Alcoa Corporation announced that it had terminated the electricity contract at its Rockdale Operations and, as a result, Arconic reversed its associated guarantee liability. Other income, net was $94 in 2016 compared with $28 in 2015. The increase of $66 was mainly the result of a favorable adjustment to the contingent earn-out liability and a post-closing adjustment, both of which related to the acquisition of Firth Rixson of $76, and favorable foreign currency movements of $55. These items were partially offset by the absence of gains on the sales of land in the United States and an equity investment in a China rolling mill of $38 in 2015. 38 Table of Contents Income Taxes Arconic effective tax rate was 115.7% in 2017 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%. The effective tax rate primarily differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate as a result of a $719 impairment of goodwill, a $41 impairment of assets in the Latin America extrusions business, and a $60 charge related to the sale of a rolling mill in Italy that are nondeductible for income tax purposes, a $272 tax charge as a provisional impact of the 2017 Act, and a $23 tax charge for an increase in an uncertain tax position in Germany, partially offset by a $73 tax benefit related to the sale and Debt-for-Equity Exchange of the Alcoa Corporation stock, a $69 tax benefit for the release of U.S. state valuation allowances net of the federal tax benefit, a $27 favorable tax impact associated with a non-taxable earn-out liability adjustment in connection with the Firth Rixson acquisition, and by foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions. Arconic effective tax rate was 356.5% in 2016 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to a $1,267 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances related to the Separation Transaction (see Income Taxes under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below), a $95 tax charge associated with the redemption of company-owned life insurance policies whose tax basis was less than the redemption amount resulting in a taxable gain, a $51 net charge for the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities due to tax rate and tax law changes, and a $34 unfavorable tax impact related to certain separation costs which are nondeductible for income tax purposes, somewhat offset by a $39 discrete income tax benefit for the release of valuation allowances in Canada and Russia, a $38 tax benefit related to currency impacts of a distribution of previously taxed income, and a $26 favorable tax impact associated with non-taxable settlement proceeds and earn-out liability adjustments in connection with the Firth Rixson acquisition. Arconic effective tax rate was 185.2% in 2015 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate principally due to a $190 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in the U.S. and Iceland (see Income Taxes under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below), a $25 impairment of goodwill that is nondeductible for income tax purposes, a loss on the sale of a rolling mill in Russia for which no tax benefit was recognized, and a $34 net discrete income tax charge as described below. In 2015, Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC), the former joint venture owned 60% by Arconic and 40% by Alumina Limited, recognized an $85 discrete income tax charge for a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets in Suriname (see Income Taxes under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below), which were related mostly to employee benefits and tax loss carryforwards. Arconic also had a $51 deferred tax liability related to its 60%-share of these deferred tax assets that was written off as a result of the valuation allowance recognized by AWAC. Management anticipates that the effective tax rate in 2018 will be between 27% and 29%. However, business portfolio actions, changes in the current economic environment, tax legislation or rate changes, currency fluctuations, ability to realize deferred tax assets, movements in stock price impacting tax benefits or deficiencies on stock-based payment awards, and the results of operations in certain taxing jurisdictions may cause this estimated rate to fluctuate. It is also expected that continuing analysis of the 2017 Act, as well as additional guidance as it is issued, will have an impact on the estimated rate. Loss from continuing operations after income taxes and noncontrolling interests Loss from continuing operations after income taxes and noncontrolling interests was $74 for 2017 , or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to $1,062 for 2016 , or $2.58 per share. The increase in results of $988 was primarily attributable to charges for tax valuation allowances and costs related to the Separation Transaction in 2016; a gain of $238 ($351 pre-tax) on the sale of a portion of Arconic investment in Alcoa Corporation common stock and a gain of $167 ($167 pre-tax) on the Debt-for-Equity Exchange in 2017; income of $25 ($25 pre-tax) associated with a higher reversal of a contingent earn-out liability related to the Firth Rixson acquisition and income of $16 ($25 pre-tax) due to the reversal of a liability associated with a separation-related guarantee; net cost savings; and higher sales volumes across all segments; partially offset by a charge for goodwill impairment of $719 ($719 pre-tax); a charge related to the 2017 Act of $272; $47 ($73 pre-tax) of higher premiums paid for the early redemption of debt in 2017; higher LIFO inventory expense associated with higher aluminum prices; charges for asset impairments of the Fusina, Italy rolling mill of $60 ($60 pre-tax) and Latin America extrusions business of $41 ($41 pre-tax) based on the sale of these businesses; unfavorable product pricing, primarily in aerospace; and lower-margin product mix. Loss from continuing operations after income taxes and noncontrolling interests was $1,062 for 2016, or $2.58 per diluted share, compared to $157 for 2015, or $0.54 per share. The decrease in results of $905 was primarily due to charges for tax valuation allowances and costs related to the Separation Transaction, primarily offset by a full-year effect of 2015 acquisitions (see Engineered Products and Solutions under Segment Information below) and net cost savings across all segments. Segment Information Arconic operations consist of three worldwide reportable segments: Engineered Products and Solutions, Global Rolled Products and Transportation and Construction Solutions (see below). In the first quarter of 2017, the Company changed its primary measure of segment performance from After-tax operating income (ATOI) to Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, 39 Table of Contents depreciation, and amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA ). Segment performance under Arconic management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors; however, the primary measure of performance in 2017 was Adjusted EBITDA. Arconic definition of Adjusted EBITDA is net margin plus an add-back for depreciation and amortization. Net margin is equivalent to Sales minus the following items: Cost of goods sold; Selling, general administrative, and other expenses; Research and development expenses; and Provision for depreciation and amortization. Prior period information has been recast to conform to current year presentation. The Adjusted EBITDA presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Certain items are excluded from segment Adjusted EBITDA such as: Impairment of goodwill; Restructuring and other charges; the impact of LIFO inventory accounting; metal price lag (the timing difference created when the average price of metal sold differs from the average cost of the metal when purchased by the respective segment - generally, when the price of metal increases, metal price lag is favorable, and when the price of metal decreases, metal price lag is unfavorable); corporate expense (general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities and corporate research and development expenses); and other items, including intersegment profit eliminations. Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, the Company's primary measure of segment performance will change from Adjusted EBITDA to Operating income, which more closely aligns segment performance with Operating income as presented in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. As part of this change, LIFO and metal price lag will be included in the Operating income of the segments. Adjusted EBITDA for all reportable segments totaled $2,144 in 2017 , $2,063 in 2016 , and $1,894 in 2015 . The following information provides sales and Adjusted EBITDA for each reportable segment, as well as certain shipment and realized price data for Global Rolled Products, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 . See Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. Engineered Products and Solutions 2017 2016 2015 Third-party sales $ 5,935 $ 5,728 $ 5,342 Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,224 $ 1,195 $ 1,111 The Engineered Products and Solutions segment produces products that are used primarily in the aerospace (commercial and defense), industrial, commercial transportation, and power generation end markets. Such products include fastening systems (titanium, steel, and nickel superalloys) and seamless rolled rings (mostly nickel superalloys); investment castings (nickel superalloys, titanium, and aluminum), including airfoils and forged jet engine components (e.g., jet engine disks), and extruded, machined and formed aircraft parts (titanium and aluminum), all of which are sold directly to customers and through distributors. More than 75% of the third-party sales in this segment are from the aerospace end market. A small part of this segment also produces various forged, extruded, and machined metal products (titanium, aluminum and steel) for the oil and gas, automotive, and land and sea defense end markets. Seasonal decreases in sales are generally experienced in the third quarter of the year due to the European summer slowdown across all end markets. Generally, the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are mostly the U.S. dollar, British pound and the euro. In April 2016, Arconic completed the sale of the Remmele Medical business that was part of the RTI acquisition (see below) and manufactured precision-machined metal products for customers in the minimally invasive surgical device and implantable device markets. Remmele Medical generated third-party sales of $23 from January 1, 2016 through the divestiture date, and, at the time of the divestiture, had approximately 330 employees. In July 2015, Arconic completed the acquisition of RTI, a global supplier of titanium and specialty metal products and services for the commercial aerospace, defense, energy, and medical device end markets. The purpose of the acquisition was to expand Arconic range of titanium offerings and add advanced technologies and materials, primarily related to the aerospace end market. In 2014, RTI generated net sales of $794 and had approximately 2,600 employees. The operating results and assets and liabilities of RTI have been included within the Engineered Products and Solutions segment since the date of acquisition. In March 2015, Arconic completed the acquisition of TITAL, a privately held aerospace castings company with approximately 650 employees (at the time of the acquisition) based in Germany. TITAL produces aluminum and titanium investment casting products for the aerospace and defense end markets. In 2014, TITAL generated sales of approximately $100. The purpose of the acquisition was to capture increasing demand for advanced jet engine components made of titanium, establish titanium-casting capabilities in Europe, and expand existing aluminum casting capacity. The operating results and assets and liabilities of TITAL have been included within the Engineered Products and Solutions segment since the date of acquisition. 40 Table of Contents Third-party sales for the Engineered Products and Solutions segment increase d $207 , or 4% , in 2017 compared with 2016 , primarily attributable to volume growth in both aerospace engines and airframes, partially offset by lower product pricing, primarily in the aerospace end market, and the absence of sales of $23 related to the Remmele Medical business, which was sold in April 2016. Third-party sales for this segment increase d $386 , or 7% , in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily attributable to higher third-party sales of the two acquired businesses of $457, primarily related to the aerospace end market, and increased demand from the industrial gas turbine end market, partially offset by lower volumes in the oil and gas end market and commercial transportation end market as well as pricing pressures in aerospace. Adjusted EBITDA for the Engineered Products and Solutions segment increase d $29, or 2%, in 2017 compared with 2016 , primarily on higher volumes and net cost savings, partially offset by product pricing pressures, ramp up costs associated with increasing production volumes of new aerospace engine parts, and a lower margin product mix. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment increase d $84, or 8% , in 2016 compared with 2015 , primarily on net cost savings across all businesses as well as the volume increase from both the RTI acquisition and organic revenue growth, partially offset by a lower margin product mix and pricing pressures in the aerospace end market. In 2018, demand in the commercial aerospace end market is expected to remain strong, driven by the ramp-up of new aerospace engine platforms. Demand in the defense end market is expected to grow due to the continuing ramp-up of certain aerospace programs. Additionally, net cost savings are anticipated while declines in the industrial gas turbine market and pricing pressure across all markets is likely to continue. Global Rolled Products (1) 2017 2016 2015 Third-party sales $ 4,992 $ 4,864 $ 5,253 Intersegment sales 148 118 125 Total sales $ 5,140 $ 4,982 $ 5,378 Adjusted EBITDA $ 599 $ 577 $ 512 Third-party aluminum shipments (kmt) 1,197 1,339 1,375 Average realized price per metric ton of aluminum (2) $ 4,171 $ 3,633 $ 3,820 (1) Excludes the Warrick, IN rolling operations and the equity interest in the rolling mill at the joint venture in Saudi Arabia, both of which were previously part of the Global Rolled Products segment but became part of Alcoa Corporation effective November 1, 2016. (2) Generally, average realized price per metric ton of aluminum includes two elements: a) the price of metal (the underlying base metal component based on quoted prices from the LME, plus a regional premium which represents the incremental price over the base LME component that is associated with physical delivery of metal to a particular region), and b) the conversion price, which represents the incremental price over the metal price component that is associated with converting primary aluminum into sheet and plate. In this circumstance, the metal price component is a pass-through to this segment customers with limited exception (e.g., fixed-priced contracts, certain regional premiums). The Global Rolled Products segment produces aluminum sheet and plate for a variety of end markets. Sheet and plate is sold directly to customers and through distributors related to the aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation, packaging, building and construction, and industrial products (mainly used in the production of machinery and equipment and consumer durables) end markets. A small portion of this segment also produces aseptic foil for the packaging end market. While the customer base for flat-rolled products is large, a significant amount of sales of sheet and plate is to a relatively small number of customers. Generally, the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are mostly the U.S. dollar, Chinese yuan, the euro, the Russian ruble, the Brazilian real, and the British pound. In March 2017, Arconic completed the sale of its Fusina, Italy rolling mill. While owned by Arconic, the operating results and assets and liabilities of the Fusina, Italy rolling mill were included in the Global Rolled Products segment. The rolling mill generated third-party sales of approximately $54 and $165 for 2017 and 2016, respectively. At the time of the divestiture, the rolling mill had approximately 312 employees. See Restructuring and Other Charges under Results of Operations above. On November 1, 2016, Arconic entered into a Toll Processing Agreement with Alcoa Corporation for the tolling of metal for the Warrick, IN rolling mill which became a part of Alcoa Corporation upon the completion of the Separation Transaction. As 41 Table of Contents part of this arrangement, Arconic provides a toll processing service to Alcoa Corporation to produce can sheet products at its facility in Tennessee through the expected end date of the contract, December 31, 2018. Alcoa Corporation supplies all required raw materials to Arconic and Arconic processes the raw materials into finished can sheet coils ready for shipment to the end customer. Tolling revenue for 2017 and the two months ended December 31, 2016 was $190 and $37, respectively. In March 2015, Arconic completed the sale of a rolling mill located in Belaya Kalitva, Russia. While owned by Arconic, the operating results and assets and liabilities of the rolling mill were included in the Global Rolled Products segment. The rolling mill generated sales of approximately $20 and $130 in 2015 and 2014 and, at the time of divestiture, had approximately 1,870 employees. See Restructuring and Other Charges under Results of Operations above. Third-party sales for the Global Rolled Products segment increase d $128, or 3%, in 2017 compared with 2016 , primarily attributable to volume growth in the automotive end market and higher aluminum pricing, partially offset by the impact of $362 associated with the ramp-down and Toll Processing Agreement with Alcoa Corporation at the Company North America packaging business in Tennessee, the absence of sales of $111 from the rolling mill in Fusina, Italy, aerospace customer inventory destocking and reduced build rates, and pricing pressures in the global packaging market. Third-party sales for this segment decrease d $389 , or 7% , in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to the ramp-down of Tennessee packaging of $251; lower aluminum prices; and lower demand in the industrial products, packaging, commercial aerospace, commercial transportation, and North American heavy duty truck markets. These decreases were partially offset by higher volume in the automotive market. Adjusted EBITDA for the Global Rolled Products segment increase d $22, or 4%, in 2017 compared with 2016 , primarily driven by net cost savings and increased automotive volumes, partially offset by lower aerospace volume from customer destocking and reduced build rates, continued pricing pressure on global packaging products and higher aluminum prices. The higher aluminum prices negatively impacted the Global Rolled Products Adjusted EBITDA margin by $18, or 140 basis points, in 2017 compared with 2016. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment increase d $65, or 13%, in 2016 compared with 2015 , primarily driven by strong productivity improvements, which significantly exceeded cost increases, partially offset by lower pricing, primarily due to overall pricing pressure in the global can sheet market, unfavorable product mix and lower volumes as detailed above. In 2018, demand in the automotive end market is expected to continue to grow due to the growing demand for innovative products and aluminum-intensive vehicles. Demand from the commercial airframe end market is expected to be flat in 2018 as the ramp-up of new programs is offset by lower build rates for aluminum intensive wide-body programs. The ramp-down of the North American packaging operations is expected to continue in 2018. Net productivity improvements are anticipated to continue. Transportation and Construction Solutions 2017 2016 2015 Third-party sales $ 1,985 $ 1,802 $ 1,882 Adjusted EBITDA $ 321 $ 291 $ 271 The Transportation and Construction Solutions segment produces products that are used mostly in the commercial transportation and nonresidential building and construction end markets. Such products include integrated aluminum structural systems, architectural extrusions, and forged aluminum commercial vehicle wheels, which are sold both directly to customers and through distributors. A small part of this segment also produces aluminum products for the industrial products end market. Generally, the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are primarily the U.S. dollar, the euro, and the Brazilian real. In December 2017, Arconic reached an agreement to sell its Latin America extrusions business that operates primarily in Brazil (see Restructuring and Other Charges under Results of Operations above). The sale is expected to close in the first half of 2018 following customary regulatory and anti-trust reviews. The operating results and assets and liabilities of the extrusions business are included in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment. Third-party sales for the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment increase d $183 , or 10% , in 2017 compared with 2016 , primarily driven by increased volumes in the commercial transportation and building and construction end markets, higher aluminum pricing, and favorable foreign currency movements, partially offset by lower product pricing. 42 Table of Contents Third-party sales for this segment decrease d $80 , or 4% , in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily driven by lower demand from the North American commercial transportation end market, which was partially offset by rising demand from the building and construction end market. Adjusted EBITDA for the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment increase d $30, or 10%, in 2017 compared with 2016 , principally driven by net cost savings and higher volumes, partially offset by lower product pricing in the heavy-duty truck market, unfavorable product mix, and higher aluminum prices. The higher aluminum prices negatively impacted the Transportation and Construction Solutions Adjusted EBITDA margin by $19, or 120 basis points, in 2017 compared with 2016. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment increase d $20, or 7% , in 2016 compared with 2015 , principally driven by net cost savings across all businesses and growth in the building and construction segment, partially offset by lower demand in the North American heavy duty truck and Brazilian markets. In 2018, we expect continued growth in the North American and European commercial transportation and building and construction markets and continued demand for innovative products. Additionally, net cost savings are anticipated. Reconciliation of Combined segment adjusted EBITDA to Net loss attributable to Arconic Items required to reconcile Combined segment adjusted EBITDA to Net loss attributable to Arconic include: the Provision for depreciation and amortization; Impairment of goodwill; Restructuring and other charges; the impact of LIFO inventory accounting; metal price lag (the timing difference created when the average price of metal sold differs from the average cost of the metal when purchased by the respective segment generally, when the price of metal increases, metal price lag is favorable, and when the price of metal decreases, metal price lag is unfavorable); corporate expense (general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities and corporate research and development expenses); other items, including intersegment profit eliminations; Other income, net; Interest expense; Income tax expense; and the results of discontinued operations. The following table reconciles Combined segment adjusted EBITDA to Net loss attributable to Arconic: 2017 2016 2015 Combined segment adjusted EBITDA $ 2,144 $ 2,063 $ 1,894 Unallocated amounts: Depreciation and amortization (551 ) (535 ) (508 ) Impairment of goodwill (719 ) (25 ) Restructuring and other charges (165 ) (155 ) (214 ) Impact of LIFO (110 ) (18 ) 101 Metal price lag 72 27 (175 ) Corporate expense (274 ) (454 ) (371 ) Other (71 ) (109 ) (74 ) Operating income $ 326 $ 819 $ 628 Interest expense (496 ) (499 ) (473 ) Other income, net 640 94 28 Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 470 $ 414 $ 183 Provision for income taxes (544 ) (1,476 ) (339 ) Discontinued operations 121 (165 ) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest (1 ) Net loss attributable to Arconic $ (74 ) $ (941 ) $ (322 ) The significant changes in the reconciling items between Combined segment adjusted EBITDA and Net loss attributable to Arconic for 2017 compared with 2016 consisted of: an impairment of goodwill related to the annual impairment review of the Arconic Forgings and Extrusions business in 2017; 43 Table of Contents a change in the Impact of LIFO, mostly due to a greater increase in the price of aluminum, driven by higher base metal prices (LME) and regional premiums (increase in price at December 31, 2017 indexed to December 31, 2016 compared to the increase in price at December 31, 2016 indexed to December 31, 2015); a favorable change in Metal price lag due to higher prices for aluminum; a decrease in Corporate expense primarily attributable to costs incurred in 2016 related to the Separation Transaction, partially offset by proxy, advisory and governance-related costs and legal and other advisory costs related to Grenfell Tower incurred in 2017; an increase in Other income, net, largely the result of the $351 gain on the sale of a portion of Arconic investment in Alcoa Corporation common stock and a $167 gain on the Debt-for-Equity Exchange, income of $25 associated with a higher reversal of a contingent earn-out liability related to the Firth Rixson acquisition, and income of $25 due to the reversal of a liability associated with a separation-related guarantee; a decrease in Interest expense due to lower outstanding debt, mostly offset by premiums paid for the early redemption of $1,250 of the Company long-term debt; and a decrease in Provision for income taxes attributable to a charge for tax valuation allowances related to the Separation Transaction of $1,267 in 2016, partially offset by a charge of $272 resulting from the 2017 Act that principally relates to the revaluation of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities from 35% to 21%. The significant changes in the reconciling items between Combined segment adjusted EBITDA and Net loss attributable to Arconic for 2016 compared with 2015 consisted of: an increase in Depreciation and amortization related to a full year of D&A related to two acquisitions which occurred during 2015 (see Engineered Products and Solutions under Segment Information above) a decrease in Restructuring and other charges, due to fewer portfolio actions; a change in the impact of LIFO, mostly due to higher aluminum prices, driven by higher base metal prices (LME) (increase in price at December 31, 2016 indexed to December 31, 2015 compared to a decrease in price at December 31, 2015 indexed to December 31, 2014); a favorable change in Metal price lag, the result of higher prices for aluminum; an increase in Corporate expense, largely attributable to an increase in costs related to the Separation Transaction of $193, partially offset by decreases in corporate research and development expenses and other various expenses; an increase in Other income, net, as a result of income of $76 associated with the reversal of a contingent earn-out liability and a post-closing adjustment, both of which related to the November 2014 acquisition of Firth Rixson; an increase in Interest expense, due to debt issuance costs expensed associated with the Separation Transaction, a full year of interest related to the RTI debt and costs associated with the early redemption of $750 of 5.55% Notes due February 2017, completed on December 30, 2016, which included a purchase premium; and an increase in Provision for income taxes attributable to a charge for tax valuation allowances related to the Separation Transaction of $1,267. Reconciliation of Net loss attributable to Arconic to Consolidated adjusted EBITDA Items required to reconcile Net loss attributable to Arconic to Consolidated adjusted EBITDA include: Depreciation and amortization; Impairment of goodwill; Restructuring and other charges; Other income, net; Interest expense; Income tax expense; and Discontinued operations. 44 Table of Contents The following table reconciles Net loss attributable to Arconic to Consolidated adjusted EBITDA: 2017 2016 2015 Net loss attributable to Arconic $ (74 ) $ (941 ) $ (322 ) Depreciation and amortization 551 535 508 Impairment of goodwill 719 25 Restructuring and other charges 165 155 214 Other income, net (640 ) (94 ) (28 ) Interest expense 496 499 473 Income taxes 544 1,476 339 Discontinued operations (121 ) 165 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 1,761 $ 1,509 $ 1,374 (1) Consolidated adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because Consolidated adjusted EBITDA provides additional information with respect to Arconic operating performance. Additionally, presenting Consolidated adjusted EBITDA pursuant to our debt agreements is appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate Arconic ability to comply with its financial debt covenants. The Consolidated adjusted EBITDA presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Environmental Matters See the Environmental Matters section of Note K to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Liquidity and Capital Resources Arconic maintains a disciplined approach to cash management and strengthening of its balance sheet. Management continued to focus on actions to improve Arconic cost structure and liquidity, providing the Company with the ability to operate effectively. Such actions included procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs, working capital initiatives, and maintaining a sustainable level of capital expenditures. Cash provided from operations and financing activities is expected to be adequate to cover Arconic operational and business needs over the next 12 months. For an analysis of long-term liquidity, see Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements below. At December 31, 2017 , cash and cash equivalents of Arconic were $2,150 , of which $402 was held by Arconic's non-U.S. subsidiaries. The cash held by non-U.S. subsidiaries is generally used for operational activities of Arconic international businesses. As such, management does not have a current expectation of repatriating cash held in foreign jurisdictions. The Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows has not been restated for discontinued operations, therefore the discussion below concerning Cash from Operations, Financing Activities, and Investing Activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 includes the results of both Arconic and Alcoa Corporation up through the completion of the Separation Transaction on November 1, 2016. Cash from Operations Cash provided from operations in 2017 was $701 compared with $870 in 2016 . The decrease of $169 , or 19% , was primarily due to lower operating results (net loss plus net add-back for noncash transactions in earnings) of $345 and higher pension contributions of $20, partially offset by a favorable change in noncurrent assets of $111 due to the prepayment of $200 made in April 2016 related to a gas supply agreement for the Australia alumina refineries (Alcoa Corporation), a favorable change in noncurrent liabilities of $55, and lower cash used for working capital of $30. The components of the change in working capital included favorable changes of $114 in receivables; $87 in prepaid expenses and other current assets; and $278 in accrued expenses; mostly offset by unfavorable changes in working capital, including $163 in inventories; $170 in accounts payable, trade; and $116 in taxes, including income taxes. Cash provided from operations in 2016 was $870 compared with $1,582 in 2015. The decrease of $712, or 45%, was primarily due to lower operating results (net loss plus net add-back for noncash transactions in earnings) of $985 and unfavorable changes in working capital of $104 and noncurrent liabilities of $21, partially offset by a favorable change associated with noncurrent assets of $218 and a decrease in pension contributions of $180. The components of the unfavorable change in working capital included $450 in receivables and $122 in prepaid expenses and other current assets; partially offset by 45 Table of Contents favorable changes in working capital including $322 in accounts payable, trade, principally the result of the impact of purchasing metal from Alcoa Corporation and the timing of payments; $68 in taxes, including income taxes; $43 in accrued expenses; and $35 in inventories. Financing Activities Cash used for financing activities was $963 in 2017 compared with $754 in 2016 and $441 in 2015 . The use of cash of $963 in 2017 was principally the result of $1,634 in repayments on borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below) and repayments on debt, primarily related to the early redemption of the Company 6.50% Bonds due 2018, 6.75% Notes due 2018, and a portion of the 5.72% Notes due 2019 (see Note I to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information); and $162 in dividends to shareholders. These items were partially offset by $816 in additions to debt, primarily from borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities, and $50 of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. The use of cash of $754 in 2016 was principally the result of $2,734 in payments on debt, mostly related to the repayment of borrowings under certain revolving credit facilitates (see below) and the repayment in December 2016 of $750 of outstanding principal of 5.55% Notes due February 2017; $228 in dividends to shareholders; and $175 in net cash paid to noncontrolling interests. These items were mostly offset by $1,962 in additions to debt, virtually all of which was the result of borrowing under certain revolving credit facilities, and $421 in net cash transferred from Alcoa Corporation at the completion of the Separation Transaction. The use of cash in 2015 of $441 was principally the result of $2,030 in payments on debt, mostly related to the repayment of borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below) and the repayment of convertible notes assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of RTI (see below); $223 in dividends paid to shareholders; and $104 in net cash paid to noncontrolling interests. These items were mostly offset by $1,901 in additions to debt, virtually all of which was the result of borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below). In July 2015, through the acquisition of RTI (see Engineered Products and Solutions under Segment Information above), Arconic assumed the obligation to repay two tranches of convertible debt; one tranche was due and settled in cash on December 1, 2015 (principal amount of $115) and the other tranche is due on October 15, 2019 (principal amount of $403), unless earlier converted or purchased by Arconic at the holder option under specific conditions. Upon conversion of the 2019 convertible notes, holders will receive, at Arconic election, cash, shares of common stock (approximately 14,294,000 shares using the December 31, 2017 conversion rate of 35.5119 shares per $1,000 (not in millions) bond or per-share conversion price of $28.1596), or a combination of cash and shares. On the maturity date, each holder of outstanding notes will be entitled to receive $1,000 (not in millions) in cash for each $1,000 (not in millions) bond, together with accrued and unpaid interest. On July 25, 2014, Arconic entered into a Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ) with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein which provides for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ). The proceeds are to be used to provide working capital or for other general corporate purposes of Arconic. By an Extension Request and Amendment Letter dated as of June 5, 2015, the maturity date of the Credit Facility was extended to July 25, 2020. In September 2016, Arconic entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement to permit the Separation Transaction and to amend certain terms of the Credit Facility including the replacement of the existing financial covenant with a leverage ratio and reduction of total commitments available from $4,000 to $3,000. The amendment became effective on the separation date of November 1, 2016. The previous financial covenant, based upon Consolidated Net Worth (as defined in the Credit Agreement) was replaced. Arconic is required to maintain a ratio of Indebtedness (as defined in the Credit Agreement), to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 4.50 to 1.00 for the period of the four fiscal quarters most recently ended, declining to 3.50 to 1.00 on December 31, 2019 and thereafter. The Credit Agreement includes additional covenants, including, among others, (a) limitations on Arconic ability to incur liens securing indebtedness for borrowed money, (b) limitations on Arconic ability to consummate a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, and (c) limitations on Arconic ability to change the nature of its business. As of December 31, 2017, Arconic was in compliance with all such covenants. The Credit Agreement matures on July 25, 2020, unless extended or earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement. Arconic may make one additional one-year extension request during the remaining term of the Credit Agreement, subject to the lender consent requirements set forth in the Credit Agreement. Under the provisions of the Credit Agreement, Arconic will pay a fee of 0.30% (based on Arconic long-term debt ratings as of December 31, 2017) of the total commitment per annum to maintain the Credit Facility. 46 Table of Contents The Credit Facility is unsecured and amounts payable under it will rank pari passu with all other unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness of Arconic. Borrowings under the Credit Facility may be denominated in U.S. dollars or euros. Loans will bear interest at a base rate or a rate equal to LIBOR, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of Arconic outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt. The applicable margin on base rate loans and LIBOR loans will be 0.70% and 1.70% per annum, respectively, based on Arconic long-term debt ratings as of December 31, 2017. Loans may be prepaid without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs. The obligation of Arconic to pay amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an Event of Default as defined in the Credit Agreement. Such Events of Default include, among others, (a) Arconic failure to pay the principal of, or interest on, borrowings under the Credit Facility, (b) any representation or warranty of Arconic in the Credit Agreement proving to be materially false or misleading, (c) Arconic breach of any of its covenants contained in the Credit Agreement, and (d) the bankruptcy or insolvency of Arconic. There were no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016 and no amounts were borrowed during 2017 , 2016 or 2015 under the Credit Facility. In addition to the Credit Facility, Arconic has a number of other credit facilities that provide a combined borrowing capacity of $715 as of December 31, 2017 , of which $640 is due to expire in 2018 and $75 is due to expire in 2019 . The purpose of any borrowings under these credit arrangements is to provide for working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. The covenants contained in all these arrangements are the same as the Credit Agreement (see above). In 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , Arconic borrowed and repaid $810 , $1,950 , and $1,890 , respectively, under the respective credit arrangements. The weighted-average interest rate and weighted-average days outstanding of the respective borrowings during 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 were 2.6% , 1.9% , and 1.6% , respectively, and 46 days, 49 days, and 69 days, respectively. In September 2014, Arconic completed two public securities offerings under its shelf registration statement for (i) $1,250 of 25 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/10th interest in a share of Arconic 5.375% Class B Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series 1, par value $1 per share, liquidation preference $500 per share, and (ii) $1,250 of 5.125% Notes due 2024. The net proceeds of the offerings were used to finance the cash portion of the acquisition of Firth Rixson. On October 2, 2017, all outstanding 24,975,978 depositary shares were converted at a rate of 1.56996 into 39,211,286 common shares; 24,022 depositary shares were previously tendered for early conversion into 31,420 shares of Arconic common stock. No gain or loss was recognized associated with this noncash equity transaction. Arconic cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short- and long-term debt ratings assigned to Arconic debt by the major credit rating agencies. On May 1, 2017, Standard and Poor Ratings Services affirmed Arconic long-term debt at BBB-, an investment grade rating, with a stable outlook, and its short-term debt at A-3. On November 1, 2016, Moody Investor Service (Moody s) downgraded Arconic long-term debt rating from Ba1, a non-investment grade, to Ba2 and its short-term debt rating from Speculative Grade Liquidity-1 to Speculative Grade Liquidity-2. Additionally, Moody changed the outlook from negative to stable (ratings and outlook were affirmed on November 2, 2017). On April 21, 2016, Fitch affirmed Arconic long-term debt rating at BB+, a non-investment grade, and short-term debt at B. Additionally, Fitch changed the current outlook from positive to evolving. On July 7, 2016, Fitch changed the current outlook from evolving to stable (ratings and outlook were affirmed on July 3, 2017). Investing Activities Cash provided from investing activities was $540 in 2017 compared with cash used for investing activities of $165 in 2016 and $1,060 in 2015 . The source of cash in 2017 included proceeds of $888 from the sale of a portion of Arconic investment in Alcoa Corporation common stock and the receipt of proceeds from the sale of the Yadkin Hydroelectric Project of $243, somewhat offset by cash used for capital expenditures of $596, including the aerospace expansion (very thick plate stretcher and horizontal heat treat furnace) at the Davenport, IA plant and a titanium aluminide furnace at the Niles, Ohio facility, and the injection of $10 into the Fusina rolling business prior to its sale. The use of cash in 2016 was mainly due to $1,125 in capital expenditures ($298 Alcoa Corporation), 29% of which related to growth projects, including the aerospace expansion (very thick plate stretcher) at the Davenport, IA plant and a titanium aluminide furnace at the Niles, Ohio facility. This use of cash was primarily offset by $692 in proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses, including $457 from the redemption of company-owned life insurance policies, $120 in proceeds related to the sale of the Intalco smelter wharf property (Alcoa Corporation), and $102 in proceeds ($99 net of transaction costs) from the sale of the Remmele Medical business, which was part of Arconic acquisition of RTI in July 2015; and $280 in sales of 47 Table of Contents investments, composed primarily of $145 for an equity interest in a natural gas pipeline in Australia (Alcoa Corporation) and $130 for securities held by Arconic captive insurance company. The use of cash in 2015 was mainly due to $1,180 in capital expenditures ($391 Alcoa Corporation) (includes costs related to environmental control in new and expanded facilities of $141), 38% of which related to growth projects, including the aerospace expansion at the La Porte, IN plant, the automotive expansion at the Alcoa, TN plant, the aerospace expansion (very thick plate stretcher) at the Davenport, IA plant, the aerospace expansion (isothermal press) at the Savannah, GA plant (Firth Rixson), and the specialty foil expansion at the Itapissuma plant in Brazil; $205 (net of cash acquired) for the acquisition of TITAL (see Engineered Products and Solutions under Segment Information above); and $134 in additions to investments, including the purchase of $70 in securities held by Arconic captive insurance company and equity contributions of $29 related to the aluminum complex joint venture in Saudi Arabia (Alcoa Corporation). These items were somewhat offset by $302 in cash acquired from RTI (see Engineered Products and Solutions under Segment Information above); $112 in proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses, composed of three land sales in Australia and the United States combined and post-closing adjustments related to an ownership stake in a smelter (Alcoa Corporation), four rolling mills, and an ownership stake in a bauxite mine/alumina refinery (Alcoa Corporation) divested from December 2014 through March 2015; and $40 in sales of investments, related to the sale of $21 in securities held by Arconic captive insurance company and $19 in proceeds from the sale of the remaining portion of an equity investment in a China rolling mill. Noncash Financing and Investing Activities. On October 2, 2017, all outstanding 24,975,978 depositary shares (each depositary share representing a 1/10th interest in a share of the mandatory convertible preferred stock) were converted at a rate of 1.56996 into 39,211,286 common shares; 24,022 depositary shares were previously tendered for early conversion into 31,420 shares of Arconic common stock. No gain or loss was recognized associated with this equity transaction. (See Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.) In the second quarter of 2017, the Company completed a Debt-for-Equity Exchange with the Investment Banks of a portion of Arconic retained interest in Alcoa Corporation common stock for a portion of the Company outstanding notes held by the Investment Banks for $465 including accrued and unpaid interest. On October 5, 2016, Arconic completed a 1-for-3 reverse stock split of its outstanding and authorized shares of common stock, pursuant to the authorization provided at a special meeting of Arconic common shareholders (the Reverse Stock Split ). The Reverse Stock Split reduced the number of shares of common stock outstanding from approximately 1.3 billion shares to approximately 0.4 billion shares. The par value of the common stock remained at $1.00 per share. Accordingly, Common stock and Additional capital in the Company Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016 reflect a decrease and increase of $877, respectively. In August 2016, Arconic retired its outstanding treasury stock consisting of approximately 76 million shares. As a result, Common stock and Additional capital were decreased by $76 and $2,563, respectively, to reflect the retirement of the treasury shares. In July 2015, Arconic purchased all outstanding shares of RTI common stock in a stock-for-stock transaction valued at $870. As a result, Arconic issued 29 million shares (87 million shares pre-Reverse Stock Split) of its common stock to consummate this transaction. 48 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Contractual Obligations. Arconic is required to make future payments under various contracts, including long-term purchase obligations, financing arrangements, and lease agreements. Arconic also has commitments to fund its pension plans, provide payments for other postretirement benefit plans, and fund capital projects. As of December 31, 2017 , a summary of Arconic outstanding contractual obligations is as follows (these contractual obligations are grouped in the same manner as they are classified in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in order to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information): Total 2018 2019-2020 2021-2022 Thereafter Operating activities: Energy-related purchase obligations $ 71 $ 40 $ 26 $ 5 $ Raw material purchase obligations 1,013 801 210 2 Other purchase obligations 51 20 14 12 5 Operating leases 442 108 150 84 100 Interest related to total debt 2,675 371 693 429 1,182 Estimated minimum required pension funding 1,600 350 675 575 Other postretirement benefit payments 785 90 180 180 335 Layoff and other restructuring payments 58 58 Deferred revenue arrangements 30 12 18 Uncertain tax positions 75 75 Financing activities: Total debt 6,844 29 1,883 1,870 3,062 Dividends to shareholders Investing activities: Capital projects 426 340 86 Totals $ 14,070 $ 2,219 $ 3,935 $ 3,157 $ 4,759 Obligations for Operating Activities Energy-related purchase obligations consist primarily of electricity and natural gas contracts with expiration dates ranging from one year to six years. Raw material purchase obligations consist mostly of aluminum, titanium sponge, and various other metals with expiration dates ranging from less than one year to four years. Many of these purchase obligations contain variable pricing components, and, as a result, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table. Operating leases represent multi-year obligations for certain land and buildings, plant equipment, vehicles, and computer equipment. Interest related to total debt is based on interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2017 and is calculated on debt with maturities that extend to 2042. Estimated minimum required pension funding and postretirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates, long-term rate of return on plan assets, rate of compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates, among others. It is Arconic policy to fund amounts for pension plans sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable country benefits laws and tax laws. Arconic has determined that it is not practicable to present pension funding and other postretirement benefit payments beyond 2022 and 2027, respectively. Layoff and other restructuring payments to be paid within one year primarily relate to severance costs and special layoff benefit payments. Deferred revenue arrangements require Arconic to deliver product to a customer over the specified contract period through 2020 for a sheet and plate contract. While these obligations are not expected to result in cash payments, they represent contractual obligations for which the Company would be obligated if the specified product deliveries could not be made. Uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return may result in additional payments to tax authorities. The amount in the preceding table includes interest and penalties accrued related to such positions as of December 31, 2017. The total amount of uncertain tax positions is included in the Thereafter column as the Company is not 49 Table of Contents able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments. If a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires, then additional payments will not be necessary. Obligations for Financing Activities Arconic has historically paid quarterly dividends on its preferred and common stock. Including dividends on preferred stock, Arconic paid $162 in dividends to shareholders during 2017. This amount includes dividends related to a class of preferred stock issued in September 2014, which converted to common stock on October 2, 2017 (see Financing Activities under Liquidity and Capital Resources above). Because all dividends are subject to approval by Arconic Board of Directors, amounts are not included in the preceding table unless such authorization has occurred. As of December 31, 2017, there were 481,416,537 shares of outstanding common stock and 546,024 shares of outstanding Class A preferred stock. The annual preferred stock dividend is at a rate of $3.75 per share and the annual common stock dividend expected to be paid is $0.24 per share for 2018. Obligations for Investing Activities Capital projects in the preceding table only include amounts approved by management as of December 31, 2017 . Funding levels may vary in future years based on anticipated construction schedules of the projects. It is expected that significant expansion projects will be funded through various sources, including cash provided from operations. Total capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately $700 in 2018 . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. At December 31, 2017 , Arconic has outstanding bank guarantees related to tax matters, outstanding debt, workers compensation, environmental obligations, energy contracts, and customs duties, among others. The total amount committed under these guarantees, which expire at various dates between 2018 and 2026 was $29 at December 31, 2017 . Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Arconic was required to provide certain guarantees for Alcoa Corporation, which had a combined fair value of $8 and $35 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and were included in Other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. Arconic was required to provide payment guarantees for Alcoa Corporation issued on behalf of a third party, and amounts outstanding under these payment guarantees were $197 and $354 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These guarantees expire at various times between 2018 and 2024, and relate to project financing for Alcoa Corporation aluminum complex in Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, Arconic was required to provide guarantees related to two long-term supply agreements for energy for Alcoa Corporation facilities in the event of an Alcoa Corporation payment default. In October 2017, Alcoa Corporation announced that it had terminated one of the two agreements, the electricity contract with Luminant Generation Company LLC that was tied to its Rockdale Operations, effective as of October 1, 2017. As a result of the termination of the Rockdale electricity contract, Arconic recorded income of $25 in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with reversing the fair value of the electricity contract guarantee. For the remaining long-term supply agreement, Arconic is required to provide a guarantee up to an estimated present value amount of approximately $1,297. Arconic was also required to provide guarantees of $50 related to two Alcoa Corporation energy supply contracts. These guarantees expired in March 2017. Additionally, Arconic was required to provide guarantees of $53 related to certain Alcoa Corporation environmental liabilities. Notification of a change in guarantor to Alcoa Corporation was made to the appropriate environmental agencies and as such, Arconic no longer provides these guarantees. In December 2016, Arconic entered into a one-year claims purchase agreement with a bank covering claims up to $245 related to the Saudi Arabian joint venture and two long-term energy supply agreements. The majority of the premium was paid by Alcoa Corporation. The agreement matured in December 2017 and was not renewed in 2018 due to the decline in exposure to guarantee claims including a substantial reduction in the guarantees related to the Saudi Arabian joint venture and also the elimination of the guarantee related to the Rockdale energy contract. The decision to enter into a claims purchase agreement will be made on an annual basis going forward. Arconic has outstanding letters of credit primarily related to workers compensation, energy contracts and leasing obligations. The total amount committed under these letters of credit, which automatically renew or expire at various dates, mostly in 2018, was $120 at December 31, 2017 . Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Arconic was required to retain letters of credit of $62 that had previously been provided related to both Arconic and Alcoa Corporation workers compensation claims which occurred prior to November 1, 2016. Alcoa Corporation workers compensation claims and letter of credit fees paid by Arconic are being 50 Table of Contents proportionally billed to and are being fully reimbursed by Alcoa Corporation. Additionally, Arconic was required to provide letters of credit for certain Alcoa Corporation equipment leases and energy contracts and, as a result, Arconic had $103 of outstanding letters of credit relating to these liabilities. The entire $103 of outstanding letters of credit were canceled in 2017 when Alcoa Corporation issued its own letters of credit to cover these obligations. Arconic also has outstanding surety bonds primarily related to tax matters, contract performance, workers compensation, environmental-related matters, and customs duties. The total amount committed under these bonds, which automatically renew or expire at various dates, mostly in 2018, was $54 at December 31, 2017 . As part of the Separation Transaction, Arconic was required to provide surety bonds related to Alcoa Corporation workers compensation claims which occurred prior to November 1, 2016 and, as a result, Arconic has $25 in outstanding surety bonds relating to these liabilities. Alcoa Corporation workers compensation claims and surety bond fees paid by Arconic are being proportionally billed to and are being fully reimbursed by Alcoa Corporation. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosed in the accompanying Notes. Areas that require significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions include accounting for environmental and litigation matters; the testing of goodwill, other intangible assets, and properties, plants, and equipment for impairment; estimating fair value of businesses acquired or divested; pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations; stock-based compensation; and income taxes. Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments, estimates, and assumptions, and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the Company Consolidated Financial Statements at any given time. Despite these inherent limitations, management believes that Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the Company. A summary of the Company significant accounting policies is included in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the Company to provide the users of the Consolidated Financial Statements with useful and reliable information about the Company operating results and financial condition. Environmental Matters. Expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate. Expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations, which will not contribute to future revenues, are expensed. Liabilities are recorded when remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The liability may include costs such as site investigations, consultant fees, feasibility studies, outside contractors, and monitoring expenses. Estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery. Claims for recovery are recognized when probable and as agreements are reached with third parties. The estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that Arconic has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share. The liability is continuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress, prospective estimates of required activity, and other factors that may be relevant, including changes in technology or regulations. Litigation Matters. For asserted claims and assessments, liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. Management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter, available defenses and case strategy, progress of the matter, views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors, applicability and success of appeals processes, and the outcome of similar historical matters, among others. Once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable, management weighs the probability of estimated losses, and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded. If an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible, then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded. With respect to unasserted claims or assessments, management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely, then, a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made. Legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss. Goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is reviewed for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or realign a business. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions, negative developments in equity and credit markets, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity 51 Table of Contents operates, increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. The fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill. Goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Arconic has eight reporting units, of which four are included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, three are included in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment, and the remaining reporting unit is the Global Rolled Products segment. More than 85% of Arconic total goodwill at December 31, 2017 is allocated to two reporting units as follows: Arconic Fastening Systems and Rings (AFSR) ( $2,221 ) and Arconic Power and Propulsion (APP) ( $1,686 ) businesses, both of which are included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment. These amounts include an allocation of Corporate goodwill. In January 2018, management announced a change in the organizational structure of the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, from four business units to three business units, with a focus on aligning its internal structure to core markets and customers and reducing cost. As a result of this change, goodwill will be reallocated to the three new reporting units and evaluated for impairment during the first quarter of 2018. The Company does not expect any goodwill impairment as a result of this realignment. In reviewing goodwill for impairment, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not, the entity is then required to perform the quantitative impairment test (described below), otherwise no further analysis is required. An entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. The ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the quantitative impairment test. Arconic determines annually, based on facts and circumstances, which of its reporting units will be subject to the qualitative assessment. For those reporting units where a qualitative assessment is either not performed or for which the conclusion is that an impairment is more likely than not, a quantitative impairment test will be performed. Arconic policy is that a quantitative impairment test be performed for each reporting unit at least once during every three-year period. Under the qualitative assessment, various events and circumstances (or factors) that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified (similar to impairment indicators above). These factors are then classified by the type of impact they would have on the estimated fair value using positive, neutral, and adverse categories based on current business conditions. Additionally, an assessment of the level of impact that a particular factor would have on the estimated fair value is determined using high, medium, and low weighting. Furthermore, management considers the results of the most recent quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) between the current and prior years for each reporting unit. During the 2017 annual review of goodwill, management performed the qualitative assessment for one reporting unit, Arconic Wheel and Transportation Products (within the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment). Management concluded that it was not more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value. As such, no further analysis was required. Under the quantitative impairment test, the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Arconic uses a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment, as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows, including markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, production costs, tax rates, capital spending, discount rate, and working capital changes. Most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units. Cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years. The WACC rate for the individual reporting units is estimated with the assistance of valuation experts. Arconic would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit fair value without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. During the 2017 annual review of goodwill, management proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test for six reporting units as follows: AFSR, APP, Arconic Titanium and Engineered Products (ATEP), and Arconic Forgings and Extrusions (AFE), which are all included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, Global Rolled Products, and Building and Construction Systems, which is included in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment. The estimated fair value for five of the six reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value, resulting in no impairment. However, the 52 Table of Contents estimated fair value of AFE was lower than its carrying value. As such, in the fourth quarter of 2017, Arconic recorded an impairment for the full amount of goodwill in the AFE reporting unit of $719. The decrease in the AFE fair value was primarily due to unfavorable performance that is impacting operating margins and a higher discount rate due to an increase in the risk-free rate of return, while the carrying value increased compared to prior year. Goodwill impairment tests in 2016 and 2015 indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any of the Company reporting units, except for the soft alloy extrusion business in Brazil which is included in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment. In the fourth quarter of 2015, for the soft alloy extrusion business in Brazil, the estimated fair value as determined by the DCF model was lower than the associated carrying value of its reporting unit goodwill. As a result, management determined that the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill was zero . Arconic recorded a goodwill impairment of $25 in 2015. The impairment of goodwill resulted from headwinds from the downturn in the Brazilian economy and the continued erosion of gross margin despite the execution of cost reduction strategies. As a result of the goodwill impairment, there is no goodwill remaining for the reporting unit. Properties, Plants, and Equipment and Other Intangible Assets. Properties, plants, and equipment and Other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets (asset group) may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets (asset group) to their carrying amount. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets (asset group) exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets (asset group) over their fair value, with fair value determined using the best information available, which generally is a DCF model. The determination of what constitutes an asset group, the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows, and the estimated useful lives of assets also require significant judgments. Discontinued Operations and Assets Held For Sale. The fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a DCF model, valuations performed by third parties, earnings multiples, or indicative bids, when available. A number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques, including the forecasting of markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs and expenses, and multiple other factors. Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made; however, the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits. Liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions, including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (salary increases, health care cost trend rates, retirement age, and mortality). The interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined using a Company-specific yield curve model (above-median) developed with the assistance of an external actuary. The cash flows of the plans projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds, which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors, including finance and banking, industrials, transportation, and utilities, among others. The yield curve model parallels the plans projected cash flows, which have an average duration of 11 years. The underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the Company plans obligations multiple times. In 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations for U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 3.75% , 4.20% , and 4.29% , respectively. The impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 1/4 of 1% would be approximately $225 and either a charge or credit of approximately $3 to after-tax earnings in the following year. In conjunction with the annual measurement of the funded status of Arconic pension and other postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2015, management elected to change the manner in which the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost will be determined in 2016 and beyond. Previously, the interest cost component was determined by multiplying the single equivalent rate described above and the aggregate discounted cash flows of the plans projected benefit obligations. Under the new methodology, the interest cost component will be determined by aggregating the product of the discounted cash flows of the plans projected benefit obligations for each year and an individual spot rate (referred to as the spot rate approach). This change resulted in a lower interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost under the new methodology compared to the previous methodology in 2017 and 2016 of $34 and $84, respectively, for pension plans and $6 and $14, respectively, for other postretirement benefit plans. Management believes this new methodology, which represents a change in an accounting estimate, is a better measure of the interest cost as each year cash flows are specifically linked to the interest rates of bond payments in the same respective year. 53 Table of Contents The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a five-year market-related value of plan assets (a fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain non-U.S. plans). The process used by management to develop this assumption is one that relies on a combination of historical asset return information and forward-looking returns by asset class. As it relates to historical asset return information, management focuses on various historical moving averages when developing this assumption. While consideration is given to recent performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. Management also incorporates expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and consultants, as well as management own judgment. For 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , management used 7.75% as its expected long-term rate of return, which was based on the prevailing and planned strategic asset allocations, as well as estimates of future returns by asset class. These rates fell within the respective range of the 20-year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class. In 2015, the decrease of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return was due to a decrease in the 20-year moving average of actual performance. For 2018 , management anticipates that 7.00% will be the expected long-term rate of return. The decrease of 75 basis points in the expected long-term rate is due to a decrease in the expected return by asset class and the 20-year moving average. A change in the assumption for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 1/4 of 1% would impact after-tax earnings by approximately $9 for 2018 . In 2017, a net loss of $220 (after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate of 45 basis points and asset performance less than expected, which was partially offset by the amortization of actuarial losses. In 2016, a net benefit of $1,601 (after-tax and noncontrolling interest) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to the transfer of $2,080 to Alcoa Corporation which was partially offset by a net charge of $479. The charge was due to the unfavorable performance of the plan assets and a 9 basis point decrease in the discount rate, which was partially offset by the amortization of actuarial losses. In 2015, a net charge of $10 (after-tax and noncontrolling interest) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to the unfavorable performance of the plan assets, which was mostly offset by the amortization of actuarial losses and a 29 basis point increase in the discount rate. In January 2018, the Company announced the freeze of its U.S. defined benefit pension plans for salaried and non-bargained hourly employees, effective April 1, 2018. Benefit accruals for future service and compensation under all of the Company qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for U.S. salaried and non-bargained hourly employees (the Pension Plans ) will cease. In connection with this change, effective April 1, 2018, impacted employees will commence receiving an employer contribution of 3% of eligible compensation under the Arconic Salaried Retirement Savings Plan, and, for the period from April 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, an additional transition employer contribution of 3% of eligible compensation. As a result of this change to the Pension Plans, in the first quarter of 2018, the Company expects to record a liability decrease of approximately $140 related to the reduction of future benefits and a curtailment charge of approximately $5 pre-tax. For the full year 2018, the Company expects pension-related expense to be lower by approximately $50 pre-tax compared to 2017 full year expenses. The lower pension expense expectation is based on preliminary year-end December 31, 2017 results and is inclusive of the change to the Pension Plans described above as well as expected changes in other pension-related assumptions. Additionally, in accordance with accounting guidance effective January 1, 2018 that requires the other components of net periodic benefit cost to be presented separately from the service cost component, approximately $110 of pension-related expense in 2018 is expected to be recorded in the Other income, net line item in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. Stock-based Compensation. Arconic recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the non-substantive vesting period approach, in which the expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. The fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-pricing model. The fair value of performance awards containing a market condition is valued using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Determining the fair value at the grant date requires judgment, including estimates for the average risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility, and exercise behavior. These assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time. As part of Arconic stock-based compensation plan design, individuals who are retirement-eligible have a six-month requisite service period in the year of grant. As a result, a larger portion of expense will be recognized in the first half of each year for these retirement-eligible employees. Compensation expense recorded in 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 was $54 ( $36 after-tax), $76 ( $51 after-tax), and $77 ( $51 after-tax), respectively. Of these amounts, $15 , $19 , and $15 in 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively, pertains to the acceleration of expense related to retirement-eligible employees. 54 Table of Contents Most plan participants can choose whether to receive their award in the form of stock options, stock awards, or a combination of both. This choice is made before the grant is issued and is irrevocable. Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable (or received or receivable) for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid, and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of Arconic assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in carryback periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future profitability within the carryforward period, including from tax planning strategies, and Arconic experience with similar operations. Existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence. Negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses, projections of future losses, or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income. Deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances, resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance. Existing valuation allowances are re-examined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance, if any, is released. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are also re-measured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays. In 2017, Arconic released $98 of certain U.S. state valuation allowances. After weighing all available positive and negative evidence, management determined that the underlying net deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable based on projected taxable income estimates taking into account expected post-separation apportionment data. Valuation allowances of $750 remain against other net state deferred tax assets expected to expire before utilization. The need for valuation allowances against net state deferred tax assets will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods and, as a result, the allowance may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances. Arconic also recorded an additional valuation allowance of $675 which offsets additional losses reported on the Spanish tax return filed in 2017 related to the Separation Transaction that are not more likely than not to be realized. There is no net impact to the provision for income taxes, as the additional valuation allowance fully offsets the current year tax benefit in Spain . Arconic foreign tax credits in the United States have a 10-year carryforward period with expirations ranging from 2018 to 2027 (as of December 31, 2017). Valuation allowances were initially established in prior years on a portion of the foreign tax credit carryforwards, primarily due to insufficient foreign source income to allow for full utilization of the credits within the expiration period. After consideration of all available evidence including potential tax planning strategies and earnings of foreign subsidiaries projected to be distributable as taxable foreign dividends, incremental valuation allowances of $302 and $134 were recognized in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Foreign tax credits of $57, $128, and $15 expired at the end of 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, resulting in a corresponding decrease to the valuation allowance. During 2017, an additional valuation allowance of $23 was recorded for current year excess foreign tax credits, offset by a net $14 reduction for other adjustments. At December 31, 2017, the cumulative amount of the valuation allowance was $379 . The need for this valuation allowance will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods and, as a result, the allowance may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances, including the impact of the 2017 Act. Arconic will continue its analysis of the 2017 Act, including any additional guidance that may be issued. Further analysis could result in changes to assumptions related to the realizability of certain deferred tax assets including, but not limited to, foreign tax credits, alternative minimum tax credits, and state tax loss carryforwards. Provisional estimates of the impact of the 2017 Act on the realizability of certain deferred tax assets have been made based on information and computations that were available, prepared, and analyzed as of February 2, 2018. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Arconic will reassess the need for valuation allowances on these deferred tax assets as necessary during 2018. In 2016, Arconic recognized a $1,267 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances related to the Separation Transaction, including $925 with respect to Alcoa Corporation net deferred tax assets in the United States, $302 with respect to Arconic foreign tax credits in the United States, $42 with respect to certain deferred tax assets in Luxembourg, and $(2) related to the net impact of other smaller items. After weighing all positive and negative evidence, as described above, 55 Table of Contents management determined that the net deferred tax assets of Alcoa Corporation were not more likely than not to be realized due to lack of historical and projected domestic source taxable income. As such, a valuation allowance was recorded immediately prior to separation. In addition, Arconic recognized a $42 discrete income tax charge in 2016 for a valuation allowance on the full value of certain net deferred tax assets in Luxembourg. Sources of taxable income which previously supported the net deferred tax asset are no longer available as a result of the Separation Transaction. The need for this valuation allowance will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods and, as a result, the allowance may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances. In 2016, Arconic also recognized discrete income tax benefits related to the release of valuation allowances on certain net deferred tax assets in Russia and Canada of $19 and $20, respectively. After weighing all available evidence, management determined that it was more likely than not that the net income tax benefits associated with the underlying deferred tax assets would be realizable based on historical cumulative income and projected taxable income. Arconic also recorded additional valuation allowances in Australia of $93 related to the Separation Transaction, in Spain of $163 related to a tax law change and in Luxembourg of $280 related to the Separation Transaction as well as a tax law change. These valuation allowances fully offset current year changes in deferred tax asset balances of each respective jurisdiction, resulting in no net impact to tax expense. The need for a valuation allowance will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods by each jurisdiction and, as a result, the allowances may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances. In 2015, Arconic recognized an additional $141 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in Iceland and Suriname. Of this amount, an $85 valuation allowance was established on the full value of the deferred tax assets in Suriname, which were related mostly to employee benefits and tax loss carryforwards. These deferred tax assets have an expiration period ranging from 2016 to 2022 (as of December 31, 2015). The remaining $56 charge relates to a valuation allowance established on a portion of the deferred tax assets recorded in Iceland. These deferred tax assets have an expiration period ranging from 2017 to 2023. After weighing all available positive and negative evidence, as described above, management determined that it was no longer more likely than not that Arconic will realize the tax benefit of either of these deferred tax assets. This was mainly driven by a decline in the outlook of the Primary Metals business, combined with prior year cumulative losses and a short expiration period. Tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold. Otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized. Related Party Transactions Arconic buys products from and provides services to Alcoa Corporation following the separation at negotiated prices between the parties. These transactions were not material to the financial position or results of operations of Arconic for all periods presented. Effective May 2017, upon disposition of the remaining common stock that Arconic held in Alcoa Corporation, they are no longer deemed a related party.
