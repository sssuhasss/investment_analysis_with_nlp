See "Forward Looking Statements" and "ITEM 7A. - QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS." Our Business Overview We develop, market, sell and distribute, in the main, a wide range of branded beverages. The majority of our beverages fall within the growing "alternative" beverage category. The principal brand names under which our beverages are marketed are Hansen's(r), Monster Energy(tm), Blue Sky(r), Junior Juice(r), Lost(r) and Rumba(tm). We own all of our above-listed brand names other than Lost(r) which we produce, market, sell and distribute under an exclusive licensing arrangement with Lost International LLC. Our company principally generates revenues, income and cash flows by developing, producing, marketing, selling and distributing finished beverage products. We generally sell these products to retailers as well as distributors. We incur significant marketing expenditures to support our brands including advertising costs, sponsorship fees and special promotional events. We focus on developing brand awareness and trial through sampling both in stores and at events. Retailers and distributors receive rebates, promotions, point of sale materials, merchandise displays and coolers. We also use in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials and racks, prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, and sponsorship of, and endorsements from. selected public and extreme sports teams and figures and causes. Consumers receive coupons, discounts and promotional incentives. These marketing expenditures help to enhance distribution and availability of our products as well as awareness and increase consumer preference for our brands. Greater distribution and availability, awareness and preference promotes long term growth. 18 <PAGE> During 2004, we continued to expand our existing product lines and further develop our markets. In particular, we continue to focus on developing and marketing beverages that fall within the category generally described as the "alternative" beverage category, with particular emphasis on energy type drinks. We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation; such as making Hansen's(r) products visually distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different, better and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores and we will continue to reevaluate the same from time to time. We again achieved record sales in 2004. The increase in gross and net sales in 2004 was primarily attributable to increased sales of our Monster Energy(r) drink, which was introduced in April 2002, including our low carbohydrate ("lo-carb") Monster Energy(r) drink which was introduced in 2003 and sales of Lost(r) energy drinks which were introduced at the beginning of 2004, as well as increased sales of apple juice and apple grape juice, private label beverages and our Energade(r) energy sports drinks. The increase in gross and net sales was partially offset by decreased sales primarily of energy drinks in 8.3-ounce cans, children's multi-vitamin juice drinks, and teas, lemonades and cocktails. During 2004, sales outside of California represented 56 % of our aggregate sales, as compared to approximately 47 % of our aggregate sales in 2003. Sales to distributors outside the United States during 2004 amounted to $2,282,000 compared to $1,612,000 in 2003. Our customers are typically retail and specialty chains, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, full service beverage distributors and health food distributors. In 2004, sales to retailers represented 35% of our revenues, sales to full service distributors represented 52% of our revenues and sales to health food distributors represented 6 % of our revenues. In 2004, we introduced a carbonated Lost(r) Energy drink in 16-ounce cans, a carbonated Monster Energy "Assault"(tm) drink in 16-ounce cans, a new line of Blue Sky natural tea sodas in 12-ounce cans, Hansen's Energy Drinks in 16-ounce cans, Rumba(tm) Energy Juice in 15.5-once cans and also introduced a new line of lo-carb smoothies in 11.5-ounce cans. Sales of our dual-branded 100% juice line named "Juice Blast(r)", which was launched in conjunction with Costco and is sold through Costco stores, were $2.0 million in 2004 as compared to $6.0 million in 2003, primarily due to lost distribution in certain regions. We have since managed to resecure distribution of such juice line in certain of those regions. We have, in conjunction with Costco, introduced new flavors in place of certain existing flavors and will continue to introduce new flavors in an effort to ensure that the variety pack remains fresh and different for consumers and retain and if possible increase current distribution levels. In September 2000, HBC, through its wholly owned subsidiary Blue Sky, acquired the Blue Sky(r) Natural Soda business. The Blue Sky(r) Natural Soda brand is the leading natural soda in the health food trade. Blue Sky offers natural sodas, premium natural sodas with added ingredients such as Ginseng and anti-oxidant vitamins, organic sodas and seltzer waters in 12-ounce cans and a Blue Energy drink in 8.3-ounce cans and in 2004 introduced a new line of Blue Sky natural tea sodas in 12-ounce cans. We plan to introduce a new line of Blue Sky Lite natural sodas in 2005. 19 <PAGE> In May 2001, HBC, through its wholly owned subsidiary Junior Juice, acquired the Junior Juice(r) beverage business. The Junior Juice(r) product line is comprised of a line of 100% juices packed in 4.23-ounce aseptic packages and is targeted at toddlers. During 2004, we entered into several new distribution agreements for the sale of our products both within and outside the United States and substantially expanded our national sales force and marketing and support staff. As discussed under "ITEM 1 BUSINESS - MANUFACTURE and DISTRIBUTION", we anticipate that we will continue building our national sales force in 2005 as well as our marketing and support staff to support and grow the sales of our products. A chain grocery store strike in Southern California, which commenced during the last quarter of 2003 and terminated in the first quarter of 2004, adversely affected sales of those of our products that were carried by the stores concerned. However, the drop in sales of such products was partially offset by increased sales of certain of those products that are carried by other retailers in Southern California. In 2002, we introduced a Sparkling Cider 100% juice drink in a 1.5-liter Magnum glass bottle. However, due to limited reports of some bottles breaking in 2003, we promptly recalled the product. We are pursuing a claim for the costs and losses incurred by us. We will reevaluate relaunching this product once certain production issues are resolved to our satisfaction and a suitable co-packer has been identified. During 2004, we concluded exclusive contracts with the State of California, Department of Health Services Women, Infant and Children Supplemental Nutrition Branch, to supply 100% Apple juice and 100% blended juice in 64-ounce PET plastic bottles. The contracts commenced on July 12, 2004. See "ITEM 1 BUSINESS - - MANUFACTURE and DISTRIBUTION." We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors. Value Drivers of our Business We believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following: * Profitable Growth - We believe natural, better for you brands properly supported by marketing and innovation, targeted to a broad consumer base-drive profitable growth. We continue to broaden our family of brands. In particular, we are expanding and growing our specialty beverages and energy drinks to provide more alternatives to consumers. We are focused on maintaining or increasing profit margins. We believe that tailored brand, package, price and channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to accelerating profitable growth. * Cost Management - The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on supplies and cost reduction. One key area of focus, for example, is to decrease raw material costs, co-packing fees and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net operating revenues. Another key area of focus is the reduction in inventory levels. However, due to the expansion in the number of our products as well as increased sales levels in 2004, overall inventory levels increased. Additionally, the costs of aluminum cans and PET plastic bottles which represent a large portion of our ingredient costs, increased in 2004 and could continue to rise during 2005. * Efficient Capital Structure - Our capital structure is intended to optimize our costs of capital. We believe our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds at low effective cost and overall low costs of borrowing provide a competitive advantage. 20 <PAGE> We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when properly implemented, will result in (1) maintaining and improving our gross profit margin; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) optimizing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations. Gross and net operating revenues, gross profits, operating income, and net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. In 2004, gross operating revenues totaled $227.0 million, a 63.9% increase over 2003. Net operating revenues totaled $180.3 million, an increase of 63.4% over 2003. Gross profit totaled $83.5 million in 2004, a 90.7% increase from 2003. Operating income was $33.9 million compared to $9.8 million for 2003. Net income was $20.4 million as compared to $5.9 million for 2003. Net income per share (diluted) was $1.73 from $0.55 per diluted share in 2003. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2005 and beyond. See also "Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2003." In 2004, the Company had working capital of $41.6 million compared to $17.2 million as of December 31, 2003. In 2004, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $20.1 million, a 265.6% increase from 2003. Principal uses of cash flows are purchases of inventory, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment and trademark licenses and trademarks. Repayment of our debt and accounts payable are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds. See also "--LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES. " Opportunities, Challenges and Risks Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the beverage industry and our company. Increase in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles represents a challenge. We recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and lo-carb beverages, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and waters and energy drinks. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality, health, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect companies that misjudge such preferences. In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our company's future financial results include, but are not limited to: * maintenance of our brand images and product quality; * profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See also Item 1 "BUSINESS - COMPETITION and "SALES AND MARKETING"); * restrictions on imports and sources of supply; duties or tariffs; changes in government regulations; 21 <PAGE> * protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademark licenses and trademarks and the continuous pursuit of new and innovative trademarks for our expanding product lines; and * limitations on available quantities of sucralose, a non-caloric sweetener that is used in many of our beverage products, during 2005, due to demand for such sweetener exceeding the supplier's production capacity * the imposition of additional restrictions. We believe that the following opportunities exist for us: * growth potential for non-alcoholic beverage categories including energy drinks, carbonated soft drinks, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and water; * new product introductions intended to contribute to higher gross profits; * premium packages intended to generate strong revenue growth; * significant package, pricing and channel opportunities to maximize profitable growth; and * proper positioning to capture industry growth. 22 <PAGE> Results of Operations <TABLE> <S> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C> Percentage Change ------------------------- 2004 2003 2002 04 vs. 03 03 vs. 02 ------------------- -------------------- ------------------ ------------ ------------ Gross sales $226,984,231 $138,454,345 $115,490,019 63.9% 19.9% Less: Discounts, allowances and promotional payments 46,643,096 28,102,149 23,443,657 66.0% 19.9% ------------------- -------------------- ------------------ ------------ ------------ Net sales 180,341,135 110,352,196 92,046,362 63.4% 19.9% Cost of sales 96,874,750 66,577,168 58,802,669 45.5% 13.2% ------------------- -------------------- ------------------ ------------ ------------ Gross profit 83,466,385 43,775,028 33,243,693 90.7% 31.7% Gross profit margin 46.3% 39.7% 36.1% Selling, general and 49,507,137 33,887,045 27,896,202 46.1% 21.5% administrative expenses Amortization of trademark license and trademarks 73,046 61,888 54,558 18.0% 13.4% ------------------- -------------------- ------------------ ------------ ------------ Operating income 33,886,202 9,826,095 5,292,933 244.9% 85.6% Operating income as a percent of net sales 18.8% 8.9% 5.8% Net nonoperating (income) expense (51,995) 67,013 227,758 (177.6%) (70.6%) ------------------- -------------------- ------------------ ------------ ------------ Income before provision for income taxes 33,938,197 9,759,082 5,065,175 247.8% 92.7% Provision for income taxes 13,551,393 3,828,678 2,035,980 253.9% 88.1% ------------------- -------------------- ------------------ ------------ ------------ Effective tax rate 39.9% 39.2% 40.2% Net income $ 20,386,804 $ 5,930,404 $ 3,029,195 243.8% 95.8% =================== ==================== ================== ============ ============ Net income as a percent of net sales 11.3% 5.4% 3.3% Net income per common share: Basic $ 1.91 $ 0.58 $ 0.30 229.3% 93.3% Diluted $ 1.73 $ 0.55 $ 0.29 214.5% 89.7% </TABLE> Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2003 Gross Sales. For the year ended December 31, 2004, gross sales were $227.0 million, an increase of $88.5 million or 63.9% higher than gross sales of $138.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in gross sales is primarily attributable to increased sales of certain of our existing products and the introduction of new products as discussed below in "Net Sales." Net Sales. For the year ended December 31, 2004, net sales were $180.3 million, an increase of $70.0 million or 63.4% higher than net sales of $110.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. We again achieved record sales in 2004. The increase in gross and net sales in 2004 was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy(r) drink, which was introduced in April 2002, including our low carbohydrate ("lo-carb") Monster Energy(r) drink which was introduced in 2003 and sales by volume of Lost(r) energy drinks which were introduced at the beginning of 2004, as well as increased sales by volume of apple juice and apple grape juice, private label beverages and our Energade(r) energy sports drinks. Additionally, the increase in gross and net sales was attributable to the increased sales prices and reduced allowances of smoothies in cans and natural sodas. The increase in gross and net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of Hansens energy drinks in 8.3-ounce cans, children's multi-vitamin juice drinks, and teas, lemonades and cocktails. 23 <PAGE> Gross Profit. Gross profit was $83.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $39.7 million or 90.7% over the $43.8 million gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2003. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 46.3% for the year ended December 31, 2004 which was higher than gross profit as a percentage of net sales of 39.7 % for the year ended December 31, 2003, due primarily to higher gross profit margins achieved on the increased sales of Monster Energy(r) and Lost(r) energy drinks. Although a greater percentage of our sales comprised products having higher gross margins than the prior year, the increase in profit margins was partially reduced by higher promotional payments and allowances to promote our products. Total Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $15.6 million or 46.0% over total operating expenses of $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly to 27.5% for the year ended December 31, 2004, from 30.8% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in total operating expenses was primarily attributable to increased selling, general and administrative expenses. The decrease in total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the comparatively lower increase in selling, general and administrative expenses than the increase in net sales. Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $49.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $15.6 million or 46.1% over selling, general and administrative expenses of $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 27.5% for the year ended December 31, 2004 from 30.7% for the year ended December 31, 2003. Selling expenses were $29.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $9.1 million or 45.5% over selling expenses of $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 16.2% for the year ended December 31, 2004 from 18.2% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in selling expenses was primarily attributable to increased distribution (freight) and storage expenses which increased by $4.1 million, increased expenditures for trade development activities and cooperative arrangements with our customers and distributors, and royalties which increased by $2.4 million, and increased expenditures for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials, and premiums, which increased by $2.0 million. General and administrative expenses were $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $6.5 million or 47.0% over general and administrative expenses of $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2004 from 12.5% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to payroll expenses which increased by $3.3 million, professional services, consisting of legal, consulting and accounting services primarily related to the implementation and testing required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and legal services related to protecting trademarks which increased by $1.5 million, and travel and entertainment expenses which increased by $622,000. Amortization of Trademark License and Trademarks. Amortization of trademark license and trademarks was $73,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $11,000 over amortization of trademark license and trademarks of $62,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in amortization of trademark license and trademarks was due to the acquisition of trademarks during the year ended December 31, 2004. Operating Income. Operating income was $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The $24.1 million increase in operating income was primarily attributable to increased gross profits, which was partially offset by increased operating expenses. 24 <PAGE> Net Nonoperating Income/Expense. Net nonoperating income was $52,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to net nonoperating expense of $67,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net nonoperating income/expense consists of interest income and interest and financing expense. Interest and financing expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $42,000 as compared to $73,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease in interest and financing expense was primarily attributable to the decrease in outstanding loan balances and lower interest rates. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $94,000, as compared to interest income of $6,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in interest income was primarily attributable to an increase in the cash investment in interest bearing accounts during the year ended December 31, 2004. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $13.6 million which was an increase of $9.7 million as compared to the provision for income taxes of $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in provision for income taxes was primarily attributable to the increase in operating income. The effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2004 was 39.9%, which was higher than the effective tax rate of 39.2% for 2003 due to the increase in the statutory federal income tax rate applicable to the Company's pre-tax income. Net Income. Net income was $20.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, which was an increase of $14.5 million as compared to net income of $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to the $39.7 million increase in gross profit and decrease in nonoperating expense and increase in nonoperating income of $119,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004 which was partially offset by increased operating expenses of $15.6 million and an increase in the provision for income taxes of $9.7 million. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2002 Gross Sales. For the year ended December 31, 2003, gross sales were $138.5 million, an increase of $23.0 million or 19.9% higher than gross sales of $115.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in gross sales is primarily attributable to the introduction of new products and increased sales of certain of our existing products as discussed below in "Net Sales." Net Sales. For the year ended December 31, 2003, net sales were $110.4 million, an increase of $18.3 million or 19.9% higher than net sales of $92.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to sales of our Monster EnergyTM drink, which was introduced in April 2002, as well as increased sales of Natural Sodas, Junior Juice and, to a lesser extent, sparkling beverages. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales of functional drinks, smoothies, E2O Energy Water, Energade(r) energy sports drinks, and children's multi-vitamin juice drinks as well as an increase in discounts, allowances and promotional payments. Gross Profit. Gross profit was $43.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $10.5 million or 31.7% over the $33.2 million gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2002. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 39.7% for the year ended December 31, 2003 which was slightly higher than gross profit as a percentage of net sales of 36.1% for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to increased net sales. Although a greater percentage of our sales comprised products having higher gross margins than the prior year, the increase in profit margins was partially reduced by higher promotional payments and allowances to promote our products. Total Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $6.0 million or 21.5% over total operating expenses of $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales slightly increased to 30.8% for the year ended December 31, 2003, from 30.4% for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in total operating expenses was primarily attributable to increased selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the comparatively larger increase in selling, general and administrative expenses than the increase in net sales. 25 <PAGE> Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $6.0 million or 21.5% over selling, general and administrative expenses of $27.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 30.7% for the year ended December 31, 2003, from 30.3% for the year ended December 31, 2002. Selling expenses were $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $4.0 million or 25.1% over selling expenses of $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 18.2% for the year ended December 31, 2003, from 17.4% for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in selling expenses was primarily attributable to increased distribution (freight) and storage expenses, trade development activities including cooperative arrangements with our distributors, sponsorships and promotions, in-store demonstrations and merchandise displays which was partially offset by decreased expenditures for graphic design. In addition, we incurred expenses of approximately $267,000 during 2003 in connection with our sponsorship of the Las Vegas Monorail as part of our efforts to promote our Monster product line. General and administrative expenses were $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $2.0 million or 16.6% over general and administrative expenses of $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.5% for the year ended December 31, 2003 which was slightly lower than general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales of 12.9% for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in payroll costs as we expanded our headcount, as well as fees paid for legal and accounting services and increased travel and insurance expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales and the comparatively lower increase in payroll costs. Amortization of Trademark License and Trademarks. Amortization of trademark license and trademarks was $62,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $7,000 from amortization of trademark license and trademarks of $55,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in amortization of trademark license and trademarks was due to the acquisition of trademarks during the year ended December 31, 2003. Operating Income. Operating income was $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The $4.5 million increase in operating income was primarily attributable to increased gross profits, which was partially offset by increased operating expenses. Net Nonoperating Expense. Net nonoperating expense was $67,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, which was $161,000 lower than net nonoperating expense of $228,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. Net nonoperating expense consists of interest and financing expense and interest income. Interest and financing expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $73,000, as compared to $231,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease in interest and financing expense was primarily attributable to decreased interest expense incurred on our borrowings which was primarily attributable to the decrease in outstanding loan balances and lower interest rates. Interest and royalty income for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $6,000, as compared to interest income of $3,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in interest income was primarily attributable to an increase in the cash available for investment during the year ended December 31, 2003. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $3.8 million which was an increase of $1.8 million as compared to the provision for income taxes of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in provision for income taxes was primarily attributable to the increase in operating income. The effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2003 was 39.2%, which was lower than the effective tax rate of 40.2% for 2002 due to the increase in the apportionment of sales and related state taxes to various states outside of California. 26 <PAGE> Net Income. Net income was $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, which was an increase of $2.9 million as compared to net income of $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to the $10.5 million increase in gross profit and decrease in nonoperating expense of $161,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003 which was partially offset by increased operating expenses of $6.0 million and an increase in the provision of income taxes of $1.8 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2004, the Company had working capital of $41,639,000, compared to working capital of $17,196,000 as of December 31, 2003. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $20,051,000, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $5,484,000 during 2003. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net income as well as, accounts payable, income taxes payable, accrued compensation and accrued liabilities which was partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories as well as prepaid expenses. Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment, acquisition of trademark licenses and trademarks, and repayment of our line of credit and accounts payable are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $1,471,000 as compared to net cash used in investment activities of $2,438,000 in 2003. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to decreased purchases of property and equipment and a decrease in expenditures for trademarks which was partially offset by an increase in deposits and other assets as well as decreased proceeds from the sale of property and equipment. Management, from time to time, considers the acquisition of capital equipment, particularly, specific items of production equipment required to produce certain of our products, merchandise display racks, vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other promotional equipment and businesses compatible with the image of the Hansen's(r) brand, as well as the introduction of new product lines. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1,298,000 for the year ending December 31, 2004, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $2,486,000 in 2003. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities as compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to increased proceeds from the issuance of common stock during 2004, which was partially offset by principal payments of long-term debt. HBC has a credit facility from Comerica Bank-California ("Comerica"), consisting of a revolving line of credit and a term loan. The utilization of the revolving line of credit by HBC is dependent upon certain levels of eligible accounts receivable and inventory from time to time. Such revolving line of credit and term loan are secured by substantially all of HBC's assets, including accounts receivable, inventory, trademarks, trademark licenses and certain equipment. In accordance with the provisions of the credit facility, HBC can borrow up to 6.0 million under its line of credit. The revolving line of credit remains in full force and effect through September 2005. Interest on borrowings under the line of credit is based on bank's base (prime) rate, plus an additional percentage of up to 0.5% or the LIBOR rate, plus an additional percentage of up to 2.5%, depending upon certain financial ratios of HBC from time to time. At December 31, 2004, HBC had no balances outstanding under the credit facility. 27 <PAGE> On March 1, 2005, the Company entered into an amendment of its credit facility with Comerica in terms of which HBC can borrow up to $7.8 million under its revolving line of credit. Under the amendment, the revolving line of credit remains in full force and effect through June 1, 2006. Interest on borrowings under the line of credit varies depending on a predetermined ratio of the Company's funded senior debt to Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization. The current rate of interest is prime minus 1.5% or the 30 day LIBOR rate plus 1.25%. The terms of the Company's line of credit contain certain financial covenants including certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with its covenants at December 31, 2004 If any event of default shall occur for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary, Comerica may declare all or any portion outstanding on the line of credit immediately due and payable, exercise rights and remedies available to secured parties under the Uniform Commercial Code, institute legal proceedings to foreclose upon the lien and security interest granted or for the sale of any or all collateral. Purchase obligations represent commitments made by the Company and its subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the manufacturing and packaging of our products. These obligations vary in terms. Other commitments represent our obligations under our agreement with the Las Vegas Monorail Company. See also "ITEM 1 - SALES AND MARKETING."

Accounting Policies and Pronouncements Critical Accounting Policies The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP".) GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements including various allowances and reserves for accounts receivable and inventories, the estimated lives of long-lived assets and trademarks and trademark licenses as well as claims and contingencies arising out of litigation or other transactions that occur in the normal course of business. The following summarize the most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices of the Company: 28 <PAGE> Trademark License and Trademarks - Trademark license and trademarks primarily represent the Company's exclusive ownership of the Hansen's(r) trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages and water and non-beverage products. The Company also owns in its own right, a number of other trademarks in the United States as well as in a number of countries around the world. The Company also owns the Blue Sky(r) trademark, which was acquired in September 2000, and the Junior Juice(r) trademark, which was acquired in May 2001. During 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under the provisions on SFAS No. 142, the Company discontinued amortization on indefinite-lived trademark licenses and trademarks while continuing to amortize remaining trademark licenses and trademarks over one to 25 years. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we evaluate our trademark license and trademarks annually for impairment or earlier if there is an indication of impairment. If there is an indication of impairment of identified intangible assets not subject to amortization, management compares the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized to write down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is less than the carrying amount. The fair value is calculated using the income approach. However, preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management's best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. Based on management's annual impairment analysis performed for the fourth quarter of 2004, the estimated fair values of trademark license and trademarks exceeded the carrying value. Long-Lived Assets - Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment of property and equipment or amortizable intangible assets, then management prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated at the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management's estimates of the business risks. During 2004, management recognized an impairment to property and equipment as discussed in Note 3 of the attached financial statements. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of its long lived assets, including its trademark license and trademarks, is a "critical accounting estimate" because: (1) it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to make assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as net income, could be material. Management's assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgment because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so. In estimating future revenues, we use internal budgets. Internal budgets are developed based on recent revenue data and future marketing plans for existing product lines and planned timing of future introductions of new products and their impact on our future cash flows. Revenue Recognition - The Company records revenue at the time the related products are shipped and the risk of ownership and title has passed. Management believes an adequate provision against net sales has been made for estimated returns, allowances and cash discounts based on the Company's historical experience. Advertising and Promotional Allowances - The Company accounts for advertising production costs by expensing such production costs the first time the related advertising takes place. In addition, the Company supports its customers with promotional allowances, a portion of which is utilized for marketing and indirect advertising by them. In certain instances, a portion of the promotional allowances payable to customers based on the levels of sales to such customers, promotion requirements or expected use of the allowances, are estimated by the Company. If the level of sales, promotion requirements or use of the allowances are different from such estimates, the promotional allowances could, to the extent based on estimates, require adjustments. During 2002, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") No. 01-9 which requires certain sales promotions and customer allowances previously classified as selling, general and administrative expenses to be classified as a reduction of sales or as cost of goods sold. The Company presents advertising and promotional allowances in accordance with the provisions of EITF No. 01-9. 29 <PAGE> Accounts Receivable - The Company evaluates the collectibility of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware of a specific customer's inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on the Company's recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. The Company regularly reviews its inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the Company's estimated forecast of product demand and/or its ability to sell the product(s) concerned and production requirements. Demand for the Company's products can fluctuate significantly. Factors which could affect demand for the Company's products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences, general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction in the rate of reorders placed by customers and/or continued weakening of economic conditions. Additionally, management's estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate, which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. Income Taxes - Current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year. A deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The Company considers future taxable income and ongoing, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of its deferred tax assets. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized, the Company will reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value, thereby decreasing net income. Evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on the Company's judgment. If the Company subsequently determined that the deferred tax assets, which had been written down, would be realized in the future, the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased, thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made. See Note 7 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Newly Issued Accounting Pronouncements Information regarding newly issued accounting pronouncements is contained in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2004, which note is incorporated herein by this reference. Sales The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A "unit case" means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings) or concentrate sold that will yield 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage. Unit case volume of the Company means number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of beverages directly or indirectly sold by the Company. Sales of food bars and cereals are expressed in actual cases. A case of food bars and cereals is defined as follows: 30 <PAGE> * A fruit and grain bar and functional nutrition bar case equals ninety 1.76-ounce bars. * A natural cereal case equals ten 13-ounce boxes measured by volume. * An active nutrition bar case equals thirty-two 1.4-ounce bars. The Company's quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. Because the primary historical market for Hansen's products is California, which has a year-long temperate climate, the effect of seasonal fluctuations on quarterly results may have been mitigated; however, such fluctuations may be more pronounced as the distribution of Hansen's products expands outside of California. The Company has not had sufficient experience with many of its newer product introductions and consequently has no knowledge of the trends which may occur with such products. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of the sales of its finished products and soda concentrates and increased advertising and promotional expenses.
