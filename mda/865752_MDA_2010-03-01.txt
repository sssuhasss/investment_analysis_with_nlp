(See Forward Looking Statements and Part II, Item 7A Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risks ). Our Business Overview We develop, market, sell and distribute alternative beverage category natural sodas, fruit juices, juice blends, juice drinks, energy drinks and energy sports drinks, fruit juice smoothies and functional drinks, non-carbonated ready-to-drink iced teas, children multi-vitamin juice drinks, Junior Juice juices, Junior Juice Water and flavored sparkling beverages under the Hansen brand name. We develop, market, sell and distribute energy drinks under the following brand names: Monster Energy , Monster Hitman Energy Shooter TM and Lost Energy TM brand names as well as Rumba , Samba and Tango brand energy juices. We market, sell and distribute the Java Monster TM line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee + energy drinks. We market, sell and distribute natural sodas, premium natural sodas with supplements, organic natural sodas, seltzer waters, sports drinks and energy drinks under the Blue Sky brand name. We market, sell and distribute enhanced water beverages under the Vidration TM brand name. In 2009 we introduced the following products: Monster Energy Import energy drink, which is packaged in 550 ml BRE aluminum cans manufactured in Europe and imported into the United States (May 2009). X-Presso Monster TM -Hammer, a non-carbonated espresso energy drink packaged in 6.75-ounce aluminum cans manufactured in Europe and imported into the United States (June 2009). 34 Nitrous TM Monster Energy , a line of energy drinks which is carbonated and contains nitrous oxide, and is packaged in re-sealable 12-ounce sleek aluminum cap-cans, in three variants (July 2009). Monster Energy Dub Edition energy drink, which is packaged in 32-ounce aluminum cans (October 2009). Hansen Natural Lo-Cal, a new line of all natural, low calorie 64-ounce juice cocktails in four flavors (September 2009). The Lo-Cal juice cocktails are sweetened with Truvia TM brand stevia extract, an all natural sweetener. SELF Beauty Elixir TM by Hansen , a new line of a low-calorie, functional, ready-to-drink beauty beverages infused with an essential blend of vitamins, minerals, natural fruit & botanical extracts with antioxidants (August 2009). Blue Sky Free Sodas, a new line of all natural, zero calorie sodas sweetened with Truvia TM brand stevia extract, an all natural sweetener (September 2009). Peace Tea TM , a new line of ready-to-drink iced teas in 23-ounce aluminum cans (December 2009). We have two reportable segments, namely DSD, whose principal products comprise energy drinks, and Warehouse, whose principal products comprise juice based and soda beverages. The DSD segment develops, markets and sells products primarily through an exclusive distributor network, whereas the Warehouse segment develops, markets and sells products primarily direct to retailers. Corporate and unallocated amounts that do not relate to the DSD or Warehouse segments specifically have been allocated to Corporate & Unallocated. Our Monster Energy brand energy drinks include Monster Energy energy drinks, lo-carb Monster Energy energy drinks, Monster Energy Assault energy drinks, Monster Energy Khaos TM energy drinks, Monster Energy M-80 TM energy drinks (named RIPPER in certain countries), Monster Energy Heavy Metal TM energy drinks, Monster Energy MIXXD TM energy drinks, Monster Energy Import energy drinks and Monster Energy Dub Edition energy drinks. Our Java Monster TM line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee + energy drinks include Java Monster TM Originale TM , Java Monster TM Loca Moca , Java Monster TM Mean Bean , Java Monster TM Russian, Java Monster TM Irish Blend TM , Java Monster TM Chai Hai TM , Java Monster TM Nut Up TM and Java Monster TM Lo-Ball as well as our X-Presso Monster TM -Hammer energy drink. A substantial portion of our gross sales are derived from our Monster Energy brand energy drinks and our Java Monster TM product line. Any decrease in sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks and/or Java Monster TM product line could cause a significant adverse effect on our future revenues and net income. Our DSD segment represented 91.9%, 90.7% and 89.5% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our Warehouse segment represented 8.1%, 9.3% and 10.5% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Competitive pressure in the energy drink category could adversely affect our operating results (See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors ). Our sales and marketing strategy for all our beverages is to focus our efforts on developing brand awareness through image enhancing programs and product sampling. We use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events where we offer samples of our products to consumers. We utilize push-pull methods to achieve maximum shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets and maximum demand from consumers for our products, including advertising, in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials, racks, coolers and barrel coolers. We also utilize prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected public and extreme sports figures, personality endorsements, including from television and other well known sports personalities, coupons, sampling and sponsorship of selected causes, events, athletes and teams. In-store posters, 35 outdoor posters, print, radio and television advertising, together with price promotions and coupons, may also be used to promote our brands. We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation, such as making Hansen products visually distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different, better and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, and we will continue to reevaluate the same from time to time. During 2009, we continued to expand our existing product lines and further develop our distribution markets, both domestically and internationally. In particular, we continued to focus on developing and marketing beverages that fall within the category generally described as the alternative beverage category, with particular emphasis on energy type drinks. All of our beverage products are manufactured by various third party bottlers and co-packers situated throughout the United States and abroad, under separate arrangements with each party. During the second quarter of 2006, we entered into the Off-Premise Agreements with AB. Under the Off-Premise Agreements, select AB Distributors distribute and sell, in markets designated by HBC, HBC Monster Energy and Lost Energy TM brands non-alcoholic energy drinks and Rumba , Samba and Tango brand energy juice, as well as additional products that may be agreed between the parties. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into the TCCC North American Coordination Agreement with TCCC. Pursuant to the TCCC North American Coordination Agreement, we have designated, and in the future may designate, territories in which the TCCC North American Bottlers will distribute and sell primarily our Monster Energy beverages (the Products ) in the United States and Canada. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into the Monster Energy Distribution Agreement with CCE pursuant to which CCE was appointed to distribute, directly and through certain sub-distributors, the Products in the U.S. Territories. We may designate additional territories within reasonable proximity to the U.S. Territories and CCE will use reasonable good faith efforts to add the additional territories. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into the Monster Energy Canadian Distribution Agreement with CCBC, pursuant to which CCBC has been appointed to distribute, directly and through certain sub-distributors, the Products in Canada, with performance commencing on January 1, 2009. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into distribution agreements with Consolidated, United and other TCCC North American Bottlers for the distribution of Products in various territories within the United States. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into the TCCC International Coordination Agreement with TCCC. Pursuant to the TCCC International Coordination Agreement, we have designated, and in the future may designate, countries in which we wish to appoint TCCC distributors to distribute and sell the Products. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into the Monster Energy International Distribution Agreement and the Monster Energy Belgium Distribution Agreement with CCE pursuant to which CCE has been appointed to distribute directly and through certain sub-distributors the Products in Great Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Monaco. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into a distribution agreement with Comercializadora Eloro, S.A., a subsidiary of Grupo Jumex, for exclusive distribution throughout Mexico, excluding the Baja and Sonora regions, of our Monster Energy and Monster Energy 36 Khaos TM energy drinks as well as select Java Monster TM product line drinks. Distribution under this agreement commenced January 26, 2009. During the second quarter of 2009, we entered into a distribution agreement with Schweppes Australia Pty Ltd. for exclusive distribution throughout Australia of certain of our Monster Energy energy drinks. Distribution under this agreement commenced in July 2009. Pursuant to the new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors, net amounts of $5.7 million and $113.0 million from such distributors, relating to the cost of terminating certain of our prior distributors, were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Such amounts have been accounted for as deferred revenue and will be recognized as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreements, generally 20 years. Distributor receivables related to these new and/or amended distribution agreements totaled $5.2 million and $90.7 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Revenue recognized was $7.5 million, $14.3 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Included in the $14.3 million of revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2008, is $11.6 million related to the acceleration of deferred revenue balances associated with certain of our prior distributors who were terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. We incurred termination costs to certain of our prior distributors amounting to $1.9 million, $118.1 million and $15.3 million in aggregate for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Such termination costs have been expensed in full and are included in operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Accrued distributor terminations as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $3.0 million and $102.3 million, respectively. In addition, inventory returned to us by certain of our terminated distributors resulted in a reduction of gross sales of approximately $9.7 million in the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2008. We again achieved record gross sales of $1,309.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in gross sales in 2009 was primarily attributable to increased sales of certain of our existing products, particularly our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. Gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 were positively impacted by advance purchases made by our customers in the 2009 fourth quarter due to our announcement of a new per case marketing contribution program for our Monster Energy distributors commencing January 1, 2010, as well as to avoid potential interruptions in product supply due to our announcement to transition our North American operations to the SAP enterprise resource planning system commencing January 2010. We estimate that approximately 1% of gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, were attributable to such advance purchases. We did not limit the amount of our customers purchases during the fourth quarter of 2009. Gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were impacted by a price increase announced during the fourth quarter of 2007 for all of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and our Java Monster TM product line, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were reduced by approximately 2% as a result of purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. We did not limit the amount of purchases our customers could execute at our then existing 2007 fourth quarter prices. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, our percentage increase in gross sales was 10.7%, 15.3% and 47.3%, respectively. We believe the decrease in the year on year percentage growth rate was in part attributable to the decrease in the overall growth rates of the markets in which we operate, in particular of the energy drink category, to general economic conditions as well as higher overall comparable sales levels. Consumer spending habits, including spending for the merchandise that we sell, are affected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, inflation, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, prevailing interest rates, housing costs, energy and gas costs, income tax rates and policies, consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions. In 37 addition, consumer purchasing patterns may be influenced by consumers disposable income, credit availability and debt levels. A continued or incremental slowdown in both the U.S. and international economies where we market and distribute our products, an uncertain economic outlook or prolonged credit crisis could continue to adversely affect consumer spending habits, which may result in lower than expected net sales and profits on a quarterly or annual basis. During 2009 and 2008, there was significant deterioration in the global and local financial markets and economic environments, real estate markets and construction industries, which we believe negatively impacted consumer spending at many retailers for our products. In response to this, we have taken steps to increase opportunities to profitably drive sales and to operate our business more efficiently. If these adverse economic trends worsen, or if our efforts to counteract the impacts of these trends are not sufficiently effective, there could be a negative impact on our financial performance and position in future fiscal periods. For further discussion of the risks to our Company posed by general economic conditions (See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors ). Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. Gross sales to customers outside the United States amounted to $168.0 million, $94.2 million and $53.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Such sales were approximately 12.8%, 8.0% and 5.2% of gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The reclassification of a portion of our gross sales to certain military customers to gross sales to customers within the United States from gross sales to customers outside the United States, resulted in a decrease in gross sales outside the United States of $2.1 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, over amounts previously reported. Our customers are primarily full service beverage distributors, retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, drug chains, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, health food distributors and food service customers. Gross sales to our various customer types for 2009, 2008 and 2007 are reflected below. Such information reflects sales made by us directly to the customer types concerned, which include our full service beverage distributors. Such full service beverage distributors in turn sell certain of our products to the customer types listed below. We do not have complete details of such full service distributors sales of our products to their respective customers and therefore limit our description of our customer types to include our sales to such full service distributors without reference to their sales to their own customers. The allocations below reflect changes made by us to the categories historically reported. 2009 2008 2007 Full service distributors 66% 68% 69% Club stores, drug chains & mass merchandisers 12% 14% 14% Outside the U.S. 13% 8% 5% Retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers 6% 8% 9% Other 3% 2% 3% Our customers include CCE, CCBC, Consolidated, United and other TCCC North American Bottlers, Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam Club), AB Distributors, Kalil Bottling Group, Trader Joe s, John Lenore & Company, Pepsi Canada (terminated by us effective December 31, 2008), Swire Coca-Cola, Costco, The Kroger Co., Safeway, Inc. and SUPERVALU Inc. A decision by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from the Company or to cease carrying our products could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. CCE, a customer of the DSD segment with sales within specific markets in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and certain countries in Europe, accounted for approximately 27% of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009. The DPS Group, a former customer of the DSD division, accounted for approximately 13% and 16% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our distribution agreement with the DPS Group was terminated by us effective November 9, 2008. The related terminated distributor territories are now serviced by a combination of 38 TCCC North American Bottlers and AB Distributors. Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam Club), a customer of both the DSD and Warehouse divisions, accounted for approximately 9%, 11% and 12% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors. Value Drivers of our Business We believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following: Profitable Growth We believe functional , image based or better for you brands properly supported by marketing and innovation, targeted to a broad consumer base, drive profitable growth. We continue to broaden our family of brands. In particular, we are expanding our specialty beverages and energy drinks to provide more alternatives to consumers. We are focused on maintaining profit margins. We believe that tailored branding, packaging, pricing and channeling strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to accelerating profitable growth. Cost Management The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on supply and production costs. One key area of focus is to decrease raw material costs, co-packing fees and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net operating revenues. Another key area of focus is the reduction of inventory days on hand. Efficient Capital Structure Our capital structure is intended to optimize our working capital to finance expansion, both domestically and internationally. We believe our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds if necessary at low effective cost and low overall costs of borrowing provide a competitive advantage. We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when properly implemented, will result in: (1) maintaining our gross profit margin; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) optimizing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations. Gross and net sales, gross profits, operating income, net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2010 and beyond ( See Part II, Item 7 Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2008 ). As of December 31, 2009, the Company had working capital of $501.8 million compared to $374.0 million as of December 31, 2008. The increase in working capital was primarily attributable to an increase in trade accounts receivable, an increase in cash and cash equivalents and a decrease in accrued distributor terminations. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $156.2 million as compared to $199.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Principal uses of cash flows in 2009 were distributor termination fees, repurchases of our common stock, purchases of inventory, acquisition of property and equipment and acquisition of trademarks. Purchases of our common stock, purchases of inventory, payments of accounts payable and income taxes are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds in the future (See Part II, Item 7 Liquidity and Capital Resources ). 39 Opportunities, Challenges and Risks Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the beverage industry and our Company. Uncertainty and volatility in domestic and international economic markets could negatively affect both the stability of our industry and our Company. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting international operations (See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors ). Decreased consumer discretionary spending represents a challenge to the successful marketing and purchase of our products. Increases in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles continue to represent a challenge. We recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and lo-carb beverages, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and waters and energy drinks. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality, health, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences that may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences. In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our Company future financial results include, but are not limited to: changes in consumer preferences and demand for our products; the impact of the slowing economy in the United States and other countries in which we operate; the potential impact of the consummation of the transactions between CCE and TCCC; the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; maintenance of our brand image and product quality; profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See Part I, Item 1 Business - Competition and Sales and Marketing ); costs of establishing and promoting our brands internationally; restrictions on imports and sources of supply; duties or tariffs; changes in government regulations; protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and copyrights and the continuous pursuit to develop and protect new and innovative trademarks and copyrights for our expanding product lines; limitations on available quantities of certain package containers such as the 12-ounce and 24-ounce cap can, the 32-ounce can, and co-packing availability; and 40 the imposition of additional regulatory restrictions, increasing concern over obesity and changes in regulation and consumer preferences. See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. We believe that the following opportunities exist for us: growth potential for the alternative beverage category including energy drinks, sparkling beverages, carbonated soft drinks and teas, juices and juice drinks and enhanced waters; new product introductions intended to contribute to higher profitability; premium packages intended to generate strong revenue growth; significant package, pricing and channel opportunities to maximize profitable growth; proper positioning to capture industry growth; and broadening distribution/expansion opportunities in both domestic and international markets. 41 Results of Operations (In Thousands, Except Per Share Information) Percentage Change 2009 2008 2007 09 vs. 08 08 vs. 07 Gross sales, net of discounts & returns* $ 1,309,335 $ 1,182,876 $ 1,025,795 10.7% 15.3% Less: Promotional and other allowances** 166,036 149,096 121,330 11.4% 22.9% Net sales 1,143,299 1,033,780 904,465 10.6% 14.3% Cost of sales 530,983 494,986 436,452 7.3% 13.4% Gross profit*** 612,316 538,794 468,013 13.6% 15.1% Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales 53.6% 52.1% 51.7% Operating expenses 2 275,007 375,203 237,027 (26.7% ) 58.3% Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 24.1% 36.3% 26.2% Operating income 1,2 337,309 163,591 230,986 106.2% (29.2% ) Operating income as a percentage of net sales 29.5% 15.8% 25.5% Other income (expense): Interest and other income, net 2,273 10,413 8,770 (78.2% ) 18.7% Other-than-temporary impairment of investments (3,887 ) (527 ) - 637.6% 100.0% Total other income (expense) (1,614 ) 9,886 8,770 Income before provision for income taxes 335,695 173,477 239,756 93.5% (27.6% ) Provision for income taxes 126,979 65,445 90,350 94.0% (27.6% ) Net income $ 208,716 $ 108,032 $ 149,406 93.2% (27.7% ) Net income as a percentage of net sales 18.3% 10.5% 16.5% Net income per common share: Basic $2.32 $1.17 $1.64 98.7% (28.7% ) Diluted $2.21 $1.11 $1.51 99.1% (26.7% ) Case sales (in thousands) (in 192-ounce case equivalents) 109,985 102,659 98,453 7.1% 4.3% Includes $8.2 million, $14.3 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, related to the recognition of deferred revenue.

Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies as gross sales has been defined by our internal 42 reporting requirements. However, gross sales is used by management to monitor operating performance including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and our overall performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. Management believes the presentation of gross sales allows a more comprehensive presentation of our operating performance. Gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from customers. (See Part II, Item 6 Selected Financial Data ). ** Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the disclosure thereof does not conform with GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, the presentation of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of the impact thereof on the determination of net sales and illustrates the spending levels incurred to secure such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. ***Gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within another line item such as operating expenses. We include out-bound freight and warehouse costs in operating expenses. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Gross Sales.* Gross sales were $1,309.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately $126.5 million, or 10.7% higher than gross sales of $1,182.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in gross sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in gross sales was attributable to sales of certain new products such as our Monster Energy Import energy drink, our Nitrous Monster Energy product line and our X-Presso Monster -Hammer energy drink, as well as increased sales by volume of our Monster Hitman Energy Shooter product line and our Hansen Natural Sodas . The increase in gross sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of our Java Monster product line, our Lost Energy brand energy drinks, apple juice and juice blends. Gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 were positively impacted by advance purchases made by our customers in the 2009 fourth quarter due to our announcement of a new per case marketing contribution program for our Monster Energy distributors commencing January 1, 2010, as well as to avoid potential interruptions in product supply due to our announcement to transition our North American operations to the SAP enterprise resource planning system commencing January 2010. We estimate that approximately 1% of gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, were attributable to such advance purchases. We did not limit the amount of our customers purchases during the fourth quarter of 2009. Our gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were impacted by a price increase announced during the fourth quarter of 2007 for our Monster Energy brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and our Java Monster product line, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were reduced by approximately 2% as a result of purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. We did not limit the amount of purchases our customers could execute at our then existing 2007 fourth quarter prices. Included in gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, were $8.2 million and $14.3 million, respectively, related to the recognition of deferred revenue. Promotional and other allowances were $166.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $16.9 million, or 11.4% higher than promotional and other allowances of $149.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales increased to 12.7% from 12.6% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As a result, the percentage increase in gross sales for year ended December 31, 2009 was slightly higher than the percentage increase in net sales. *Gross sales see definition above. 43 Net Sales. Net sales were $1,143.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately $109.5 million, or 10.6% higher than net sales of $1,033.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in net sales was attributable to sales of certain new products such as our Monster Energy Import energy drink, our Nitrous Monster Energy product line and our X-Presso Monster -Hammer energy drink as well as increased sales by volume of our Hansen Natural Sodas . The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of our Java Monster product line, our Lost Energy brand energy drinks and apple juice. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 were positively impacted by advance purchases made by our customers in the 2009 fourth quarter due to our announcement of a new per case marketing contribution program for our Monster Energy distributors commencing January 1, 2010, as well as to avoid potential interruptions in product supply due to our announcement to transition our North American operations to the SAP enterprise resource planning system commencing January 2010. We estimate that approximately 1% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, were attributable to such advance purchases. We did not limit the amount of our customers purchases during the fourth quarter of 2009. Our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were impacted by a price increase announced during the fourth quarter of 2007 for our Monster Energy brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and our Java Monster product line, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were reduced by approximately 2% as a result of purchases made by our then customers in advance of such price increases. We did not limit the amount of purchases our customers could execute at our then existing 2007 fourth quarter prices. Net sales for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, included $8.2 million and $14.3 million, respectively, related to the recognition of deferred revenue. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 110.0 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately 7.3 million cases or 7.1% higher than case sales of 102.7 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2008. The overall average net sales price per case increased to $10.40 for the year ended December 31, 2009 or 3.2% higher than the average net sales price per case of $10.07 for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in the average net sales price per case was attributable to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products. Net sales for the DSD segment were $1,051.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately $113.3 million, or 12.1% higher than net sales of $937.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in net sales for the DSD segment was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in net sales for the DSD segment was attributable to sales of certain new products such as our Monster Energy Import energy drink, our Nitrous Monster Energy product line and our X-Presso Monster -Hammer energy drink. The increase in net sales for the DSD segment was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of our Java Monster product line and our Lost Energy brand energy drinks. Net sales for the DSD segment for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, included $8.2 million and $14.3 million, respectively, related to the recognition of deferred revenue. Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $92.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of approximately $3.8 million, or 4.0% lower than net sales of $95.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in net sales for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to decreased sales by volume of apple juice, juice blends, sports drinks and Junior Juice aseptic juices. The decrease in net sales for the Warehouse segment was partially offset by increased sales by volume of Hansen Natural Sodas and aseptic juice drinks as well as a decrease in promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales. Gross Profit.** * Gross profit was $612.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately $73.5 million, or 13.6% higher than the gross profit of $538.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 53.6% for the year 44 ended December 31, 2009 from 52.1% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in net sales contributed to the increase in gross profit dollars. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially attributable to increased sales of DSD segment products, which have higher gross profit margins than those in the Warehouse segment, as well as a decrease in the percentage of sales within the DSD segment of the Java Monster product line, which have lower gross profit margins than our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. In addition, the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was attributable to a decrease in the cost of certain raw materials including certain containers and packaging materials and certain juice concentrates, particularly apple juice concentrate. ***Gross profit see definition above. Operating Expenses . Total operating expenses were $275.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of approximately $100.2 million, or 26.7% lower than total operating expenses of $375.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was 24.1% for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to 36.3% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in operating expenses in dollars was primarily attributable to decreased expenditures of $116.2 million related to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors. To a lesser extent, the decrease in operating expenses was partially attributable to decreased expenditures of $5.4 million for out-bound freight, decreased expenditures of $3.6 million for merchandise displays, decreased expenditures of $2.5 million for professional service fees, including accounting and legal costs, decreased expenditures of $2.4 million for allocated trade development, decreased expenditures of $2.1 million for samples, decreased expenditures of $2.2 million for demos and decreased expenditures of $1.6 million for storage and warehouse costs. The decrease in operating expenses in dollars was partially offset by increased expenditures of $12.7 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased payroll expenses of $9.6 million, increased expenditures of $3.5 million for commissions and royalties, increased expenditures of $2.8 million for travel expenses, $2.8 million of increased depreciation costs, and increased expenditures of $2.1 million for advertising. Total operating expenses include costs of $24.1 million, or 2.1% of net sales, and $10.7 million, or 1.0% of net sales, relating to the launch of the Monster Energy brand in Europe for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Included in professional service fees are legal and accounting fees, net of insurance proceeds, of ($4.7) million and ($0.2) million, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters. Total operating expenses, exclusive of expenditures of: (i) $1.9 million and $118.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors; and (ii) professional service fees, net of insurance proceeds, of ($4.7) million and ($0.2) million, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters, as a percentage of net sales, were 24.3% and 24.9% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $389.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately $173.2 million, or 80.1% higher than contribution margin of $216.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in the contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily due to increased sales of Monster Energy brand energy drinks and to decreased expenditures of $116.2 million related to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors. To a lesser extent, the increase in contribution margin for the DSD segment was attributable to sales of certain new products such as our Monster Energy Import energy drink, our Nitrous Monster Energy product line and our X-Presso Monster -Hammer energy drink. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, approximately $5.5 million higher than contribution margin of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to an increase in gross margin as a result of decreases in the costs of certain raw materials, particularly apple juice concentrate, and by a reduction in sales rebates within our juice product line as a result of the 45 termination of our exclusive contracts with the State of California Department of Health Services, Women, Infant and Children ( WIC ) Supplemental Nutrition Branch in April 2008. The WIC program continues on a non-exclusive basis in which we participate with certain of our 64-ounce juice products. Operating Income. Operating income was $337.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately $173.7 million, or 106.2% higher than operating income of $163.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to 29.5% for the year ended December 31, 2009 from 15.8% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increases in operating income and operating income as a percentage of net sales were primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses of $100.2 million and an increase in gross profit of $73.5 million. Operating income exclusive of: (i) recognition of deferred revenue of $8.2 million and $14.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively; (ii) expenditures of $1.9 million and $118.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors; and (iii) expenditures for professional service fees, net of insurance proceeds, in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters, of ($4.7) million and ($0.2) million, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, as a percentage of net sales, was 28.5% and 25.8% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Operating income included operating losses of $6.9 million and $10.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in relation to the operations of MEL, MEEL and MEAU. Operating income included operating losses of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, in relation to the operations of X-Truck and EMF. Other Income (Expense) . Other income (expense) was ($1.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $11.5 million from $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. This decrease was primarily attributable to decreased interest revenue earned on our cash balances and short- and long-term investments as well as a $3.9 million other-than temporary impairment of long-term investments. Provision for Income Taxes . Provision for income taxes was $127.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $61.5 million or 94.0% higher than the provision for income taxes of $65.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2008. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to increased operating income of $173.7 million. The effective combined federal and state tax rate was 37.8% and 37.7% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Net Income . Net income was $208.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $100.7 million or 93.2% higher than net income of $108.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to a decrease in operating expenses of $100.2 million and an increase in gross profit of $73.5 million. This was partially offset by an increase in provision for income taxes of $61.5 million and a decrease in other income (expense) of $11.5 million. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Gross Sales.* Gross sales were $1,182.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately $157.1 million, or 15.3% higher than gross sales of $1,025.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in gross sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume and increased sales price per case for certain of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks and our Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks (introduced in April 2007), as well as sales of certain new products such as Monster Hitman Energy Shooter (introduced in September 2008), Monster Energy MIXXD energy drinks (introduced in December 2007) and Monster Energy Heavy Metal energy drinks (introduced in November 2007). To a lesser extent, the increase in gross sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice, aseptic juices and sales of Vidration vitamin enhanced water (introduced in July 2008). In addition, the increase in gross 46 sales was partially attributable to the recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related to the acceleration of the deferred revenue balance associated with certain of our prior distributors terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in gross sales was partially offset by inventory returned to us by certain of our terminated distributors of approximately $9.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, decreased sales by volume of juice blends, Lost Energy brand energy drinks (introduced in January 2004), iced teas, Unbound Energy brand energy drinks (introduced in October 2006), Rumba brand energy juice (introduced in December 2004), Hansen energy drinks and smoothies in cans. Gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were impacted by a price increase announced during the fourth quarter of 2007 for all of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and our Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were reduced by approximately 2% as a result of purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. Promotional and other allowances were $149.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $27.8 million, or 22.9% higher than promotional and other allowances of $121.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales increased to 12.6% from 11.8% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As a result, the percentage increase in gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 was higher than the percentage increase in net sales. *Gross sales see definition above. Net Sales. Net sales were $1,033.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately $129.3 million, or 14.3% higher than net sales of $904.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume and increased sales price per case for certain of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks and our Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, as well as sales of certain new products such as Monster Hitman Energy Shooter TM , Monster Energy MIXXD energy drinks and Monster Energy Heavy Metal energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in net sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice, aseptic juices and sales of Vidration vitamin enhanced water. In addition, the increase in net sales was partially attributable to the recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related to the acceleration of the deferred revenue balance associated with certain of our prior distributors terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of Lost Energy brand energy drinks, juice blends, iced teas, Unbound Energy brand energy drinks, Hansen energy drinks and Rumba brand energy juice. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were impacted by a price increase announced during the fourth quarter of 2007 for our Monster Energy brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and our Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were reduced by approximately 2% as a result of purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 102.7 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of 4.2 million cases or 4.3% higher than case sales of 98.5 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2007. The overall average net sales price per case increased to $10.07 for the year ended December 31, 2008 or 9.6% higher than the average net sales price per case of $9.19 for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the average net sales prices per case was attributable to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products as well as the price increases for our Monster Energy brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans effective January 1, 2008, price increases for our Monster Energy brand energy drinks in 24-ounce cans effective July 1, 2007 and price increases in our Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. In addition, the increase in the average net sales price per case was partially attributable to the recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related to the acceleration of the deferred revenue balance associated with certain of our prior distributors who were terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. Net sales for the DSD segment were $937.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately $128.1 million, or 15.8% higher than net sales of $809.8 million for the year 47 ended December 31, 2007. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume and increased sales price per case for certain of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks and our Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, as well as sales of certain new products such as Monster Hitman Energy Shooter , Monster Energy MIXXD energy drinks, Monster Energy Heavy Metal energy drinks and Vidration vitamin enhanced water. In addition, the increase in net sales for the DSD segment was partially attributable to the recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related to the acceleration of the deferred revenue balance associated with certain of our prior distributors terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of Lost Energy brand energy drinks, Unbound Energy brand energy drinks and Rumba brand energy juice. Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $95.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately $1.2 million, or 1.3% higher than net sales of $94.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice and aseptic juices. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of juice blends, iced teas and Hansen energy drinks. Changes in pricing within the Warehouse segment did not have a material impact on net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008. Gross Profit.** * Gross profit was $538.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately $70.8 million, or 15.1% higher than the gross profit of $468.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased slightly to 52.1% for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 51.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in net sales contributed to the increase in gross profit dollars. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially attributable to the recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related to the acceleration of the deferred revenue balance associated with certain of our prior distributors terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was also attributable to increased sales of DSD segment products which have higher gross profit margins than those in the Warehouse segment. Such increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by an increase in the percentage of sales within the DSD segment of the Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks that have lower gross profit margins than our Monster Energy brand energy drinks and to an increase in the cost of certain raw materials including certain sweeteners, certain containers and packaging materials and certain juice concentrates, particularly apple juice concentrate as well as increased trade marketing agreement costs. ***Gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within another line item such as operating expenses. Operating Expenses . Total operating expenses were $375.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately $138.2 million, or 58.3% higher than total operating expenses of $237.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was 36.3% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 26.2% for year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in operating expenses in dollars was primarily due to increased expenditures of $102.9 million relating to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors. To a lesser extent, the increase in operating expenses was attributable to increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $5.9 million primarily due to increased volume of shipments and increased freight rates, increased expenditures of $17.9 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased expenditures of $4.1 million for sampling programs, increased expenditures of $3.1 million for commissions and royalties, increased expenditures of $1.5 million for in-store demos and increased payroll expenses of $7.3 million (including a $3.7 million increase in stock-based compensation). The increase in operating expenses in dollars was partially offset by decreased expenditures of $6.3 million for professional services costs, including legal and accounting fees and decreased expenditures of $3.8 million for merchandise displays. The individual increases above include costs of $10.7 million, or 1.0% of net 48 sales, relating to the launch of the Monster Energy brand in Europe for the year ended December 31, 2008. Included in legal and accounting fees are professional service fees, net of insurance proceeds, of ($0.2) million and $9.8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters. Total operating expenses, exclusive of expenditures of: (i) $118.1 million and $15.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors; and (ii) exclusive of professional service fees, net of insurance proceeds, of ($0.2) million and $9.8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters, as a percentage of net sales, were 24.9% and 23.4% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $216.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of approximately $65.5 million, or 23.3% lower than contribution margin of $281.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in the contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily due to increased expenditures of $102.9 million relating to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors. The decrease in the contribution margin for the DSD segment was offset by increased sales of our Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, the increase in net sales of Monster Energy brand energy drinks as well as sales of certain new products such as the Monster Hitman Energy Shooter , Monster MIXXD TM energy drinks and Monster Heavy Metal TM energy drinks. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately $3.4 million lower than contribution margin of $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to a reduction in gross margin as a result of increases in the costs of certain raw materials, particularly apple juice concentrate, as well as a change from high fructose corn syrup to higher priced sugar, which additionally increased in price, for our soda lines. The decrease in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was partially offset by a reduction in sales rebates within our juice product line as a result of the termination of our exclusive contracts with the State of California Department of Health Services, Women, Infant and Children ( WIC ) Supplemental Nutrition Branch in April 2008. The WIC program continues on a non-exclusive basis in which we participate with our apple, grape, white grape and pineapple 64-ounce juice products. Juice blends are not eligible under the new program. Operating Income. Operating income was $163.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of approximately $67.4 million, or 29.2% lower than operating income of $231.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 15.8% for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 25.5% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in operating income and operating income as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses of $138.2 million. Operating income exclusive of: (i) recognition of deferred revenue of $14.3 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, attributable to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors; (ii) exclusive of expenditures of $118.1 million and $15.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors; and (iii) exclusive of professional service fees, net of insurance proceeds, in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters, of ($0.2) million and $9.8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, as a percentage of net sales, was 25.8% and 28.1% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 49 Other Income (expense) . Other income (expense) was $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $1.1 million from $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to increased interest revenue earned on our cash balances and short- and long-term investments, which have increased significantly over the prior year. This increase was partially offset by foreign currency transaction losses. Provision for Income Taxes . Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $65.4 million, as compared to $90.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The effective combined federal and state tax rate was 37.7% for both the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. Net Income . Net income was $108.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of $41.4 million or 27.7% lower than net income of $149.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in operating expenses of $138.2 million due to the items identified above. This was partially offset by an increase in gross profit of $70.8 million and a decrease in provision for income taxes of $24.9 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows provided by operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $156.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $199.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $208.7 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses consisting of $14.0 million of stock-based compensation, $5.8 million of depreciation and other amortization, a $3.9 million impairment on investments and a $0.7 million provision for doubtful accounts. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash provided by operations also increased due to an $86.0 million decrease in distributor receivables, a $9.3 million increase in accrued liabilities, an $8.5 million decrease in inventory, a $5.0 million decrease in prepaid income taxes, a $3.9 million increase in income taxes payable and a $0.8 million increase in accrued compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash provided by operating activities was reduced due to a $99.3 million decrease in accrued distributor terminations, a $59.4 million increase in accounts receivable, a $15.8 million decrease in accounts payable, a $6.8 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $2.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a $3.1 million increase in tax benefit from exercise of stock options. Cash flows (used in) provided by investing activities Net cash used in investing activities was $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $144.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of held-to-maturity investments and property and equipment. For the year ended December 31, 2008, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of short- and long-term investments, particularly available-for-sale investments. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to sales and maturities of held-to-maturity investments and available-for-sale investments. For both periods, cash used in investing activities included the acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other equipment to support our marketing and promotional activities, production equipment, furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, computer software, and equipment used for sales and administrative activities, as well as certain leasehold improvements. Management expects that the Company will continue to use a portion of its cash in excess of its requirements for operations for purchasing short- and long-term investments and for other corporate purposes. From time to time, management considers the acquisition of capital equipment, specifically items of production equipment required to produce certain of our products, storage racks, vans, trucks and promotional vehicles, coolers and other promotional equipment as well as the introduction of new product lines and businesses compatible with the image of our brands. 50 At December 31, 2009, we had $328.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $99.3 million in short- and long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. Treasury bills, government agencies and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds meeting certain criteria. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by the U.S. sub-prime mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. These market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Our long-term investments are comprised of auction rate securities. The majority of these notes carry an investment grade or better credit rating and are additionally backed by various federal agencies and/or monoline insurance companies. The applicable interest rate is reset at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7 to 35 days. Liquidity for these auction rate securities was typically provided by an auction process which allowed holders to sell their notes at periodic auctions. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the auctions for these auction rate securities failed, and there is no assurance that future auctions will succeed. The auction failures have been attributable to inadequate buyers and/or buying demand and/or the lack of support from financial advisors and sponsors. In the event that there is a failed auction, the indenture governing the security in some cases requires the issuer to pay interest at a default rate that may be above market rates for similar instruments. The securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue and/or pay interest at their pre-determined default rates and be auctioned every 7 to 35 days until their respective auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities, they mature or we are able to sell the securities to third parties. As a result, our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities in the near term may be limited. At December 31, 2009, the Company held auction rate securities with a face value of $96.4 million (amortized cost basis of $92.0 million). A Level 3 valuation was performed on the Company auction rate securities as of December 31, 2009, which indicated an impairment of $12.1 million, a decrease of $2.8 million from $14.9 million as of December 31, 2008, resulting in a fair value of $84.3 million, which is included in short- and long-term investments. This valuation utilized a mark to model approach which included estimates for interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, credit and liquidity premiums, and expected holding periods for the auction rate securities. These assumptions are typically volatile and subject to change as the underlying data sources and market conditions evolve. On April 1, 2009, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) ASC 320-10-65, which modifies the requirements for recognizing other-than-temporary impairment on debt securities and significantly changes the impairment model for such securities. Under ASC 320-10-65, a security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the security amortized cost basis (the difference being defined as the Credit Loss ) or if the fair value of the security is less than the security amortized cost basis and the investor intends, or more likely than not will be required, to sell the security before recovery of the security amortized cost basis. If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the charge to earnings is limited to the amount of Credit Loss if the investor does not intend to sell the security, and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell the security, before recovery of the security amortized cost basis. Any remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Otherwise, the entire difference between fair value and amortized cost is charged to earnings. Under ASC 320-10-65, an other-than-temporary impairment must be recognized through earnings if an investor has the intent to sell the debt security or if it is more likely than not that the investor will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. However, even if an investor does not expect to sell a debt security, it must evaluate expected cash flows to be received and determine if a Credit Loss has occurred. In the event of a Credit Loss and absent the intent 51 or requirement to sell a debt security before recovery of its amortized cost, only the amount associated with the Credit Loss is recognized as loss in the income statement. The amount of loss relating to other factors is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company determined that of the $12.1 million impairment of its auction rate securities at December 31, 2009, $7.7 million was temporary and $4.4 million was other-than-temporary. The other-than-temporary impairment was deemed Credit Loss related. The Company recorded $3.9 million of other-than-temporary impairment that was deemed Credit Loss related through earnings during the year ended December 31, 2009 ($0.5 million had been previously deemed other-than-temporary and was charged to interest and other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2008). At December 31, 2009, $7.7 million of temporary impairment has been recorded, less a tax benefit of $3.1 million, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Based on our ability to access cash and other short-term investments and based on our expected operating cash flows, we do not anticipate that the current lack of liquidity of these investments will have a material effect on our liquidity or working capital. If uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue or there are ratings downgrades on the auction rate securities held by us, we may be required to recognize additional impairments on these investments. Cash flows used in financing activities Net cash used in financing activities was $82.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $98.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of common stock held in treasury of $86.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to a $3.1 million tax benefit in connection with the exercise of certain stock options and proceeds of $2.5 million received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of certain stock options. Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment, acquisition and maintenance of trademarks, payments of accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash. On April 25, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of our common stock. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we purchased 2.6 million and 3.9 million shares, respectively, of common stock at an average purchase price of $33.10 per share and $26.77 per share, respectively, which we hold in treasury. No shares were purchased during the year ended December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2009, approximately $10.2 million remained available under the plan for the repurchase of the Company common stock. Debt and other obligations We have a credit facility with Comerica Bank ( Comerica ) consisting of a revolving line of credit, which was amended in May 2007. In accordance with the amended provisions of the credit facility, we increased our available borrowings under the revolving line of credit to $10.0 million of non-collateralized debt. The revolving line of credit is effective through June 1, 2010. Interest on borrowings under the line of credit is based on Comerica base (prime) rate minus up to 1.5%, or varying London Interbank Offered Rates up to 180 days, plus an additional percentage of up to 1.75%, depending upon certain financial ratios maintained by us. We had no outstanding borrowings on this line of credit at December 31, 2009. Letters of credit issued on our behalf, totaling $0.2 million under this credit facility, were outstanding as of December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with the terms of our line of credit, which contain certain financial covenants, including certain financial ratios. If any event of default shall occur for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary, Comerica may declare all or any portion outstanding on the 52 line of credit immediately due and payable, exercise rights and remedies available to them, including instituting legal proceedings. We believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources and the revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as any purchases of capital assets or equipment, through at least the next 12 months. Based on our current plans, at this time we estimate that capital expenditures are likely to be less than $20.0 million through December 2010. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate. The following represents a summary of the Company contractual obligations and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2009: Payments due by period (in thousands) Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Noncancelable Contracts $ 51,176 $ 31,800 $ 19,376 $ - $ - Capital Leases 206 206 - - - Operating Leases 19,338 3,276 7,548 5,092 3,422 Purchase Commitments 42,216 42,216 - - - $ 112,936 $ 77,498 $ 26,924 $ 5,092 $ 3,422 Noncancelable contractual obligations include our obligations related to sponsorships and other commitments. Purchase commitments include obligations made by us and our subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the manufacturing and packaging of our products. These obligations vary in terms. In addition to the above purchase obligations, pursuant to a can supply agreement between the Company and Rexam Beverage Can Company ( Rexam ), the Company has undertaken to purchase a minimum volume of 24-ounce re-sealable aluminum beverage cans through December 31, 2010. The Company minimum purchase obligation under this agreement is approximately $27.3 million, subject to compliance by Rexam with certain conditions. In addition to the above purchase obligations, approximately $0.4 million of recognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2009, and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. Related to the unrecognized tax benefits not included in the table above, we have also recorded a liability for potential penalties of $0.02 million and interest of $0.01 million as of December 31, 2009. In 2008, we entered into licensing and programming agreements with SAP America, Inc. to use its global enterprise resource planning software initiative to replace our existing legacy software in North America. The Company also entered into agreements with Axon Solutions, Inc. and Vistex Inc. for the implementation and configuration of the SAP software. As of January 2010, we had completed our North American transition to the SAP enterprise resource planning system. It is our intention to complete the transition for our international operations within fiscal 2010. We estimate the remaining costs for implementation of the initiative will be approximately $0.8 million. 53 In October 2006, we entered into a lease agreement pursuant to which we leased 346,495 square feet of warehouse and distribution space located in Corona, California. This lease commitment provides for minimum rental payments for 120 months, commencing March 2007, excluding renewal options. The monthly rental payments are $167,586 at the commencement of the lease and increase over the lease term by 7.5% at the end of each 30 month period. This warehouse and distribution space replaced our previous warehouse and distribution space also located in Corona, California. In September 2007, we relocated our corporate offices to newly leased offices in Corona, California In August 2008, we completed the purchase of 1.09 acres of land for a purchase price of $1.4 million. In December 2009, we completed the purchase of an additional 2.12 acres of adjacent vacant land for a purchase price of $1.7 million. The properties are located adjacent to our leased warehouse and distribution space. We are reviewing the feasibility of constructing a new office building and parking lot on these combined parcels of land to replace our existing office space. We have sublet a small portion of our previous office, warehouse and distribution space on a month to month basis. In addition, we continue to utilize the remaining portion of this space as additional warehousing to supplement our main warehouse. This lease expires in October 2010. Accounting Policies and Pronouncements Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. The following summarizes our most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices: Investments Our investments in debt securities are classified as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale, in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) ASC 320. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. All other securities not included in the held-to-maturity category are classified as available-for-sale. No securities are held for speculative or trading purposes. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair market value. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders equity. Under ASC 320-10-65, a security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the security amortized cost basis (the difference being defined as the Credit Loss ) or if the fair value of the security is less than the security amortized cost basis and the investor intends, or will be required, to sell the security before recovery of the security amortized cost basis. If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the charge to earnings is limited to the amount of Credit Loss if the investor does not intend to sell the security, and will not be required to sell the security, before recovery of the security amortized cost basis. Any remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized in other comprehensive loss, net of applicable taxes. We evaluate whether the decline in fair value of its investments is other-than temporary at each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by management, and includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held, market and economic trends in the industry and information on the investee company financial condition and, if applicable, information on the guarantors financial condition. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which the investment fair value has been less than its cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and guarantors, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the 54 issuer and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value. Accounts Receivable We evaluate the collectability of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where we become aware of a specific customer inability to meet its financial obligations to us, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. We regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand, production availability and/or our ability to sell the product(s) concerned. Demand for our products can fluctuate significantly. Factors that could affect demand for our products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences, general market and economic conditions or other factors that may result in cancellations of advance orders or reductions in the rate of reorders placed by customers and/or continued weakening of economic conditions. Additionally, management estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate, which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. Long-Lived Assets Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain definite-lived identifiable intangible assets, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment of property and equipment or amortizable intangible assets, then management prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated at the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management estimates of the business risks. No impairments were identified as of December 31, 2009 or 2008. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of its long lived assets, including its trademarks (as discussed below), is a critical accounting estimate because: (1) the estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to make assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as net income, could be material. Management assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgment because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so. Intangibles Intangibles are comprised primarily of trademarks that represent our exclusive ownership of the Hansen trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages, water, non-beverage products and the Monster Energy trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of supplements and beverages. We also own in our own right, a number of other trademarks in the United States, as well as in a number of countries around the world. We also own the Blue Sky trademark, which was acquired in September 2000, and the Junior Juice trademark, which was acquired in May 2001. During 2002, we adopted ASC 350. Under the provisions of ASC 350, we discontinued amortization on indefinite- 55 lived trademarks while continuing to amortize remaining definite-lived trademarks over one to 25 years. In accordance with ASC 350, we evaluate our trademarks annually for impairment or earlier if there is an indication of impairment. If there is an indication of impairment of identified intangible assets not subject to amortization, management compares the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized to write down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is less than the carrying amount. The fair value is calculated using the income approach. However, preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. Based on management impairment analysis performed for the year ended December 31, 2009, the estimated fair values of trademarks exceeded the carrying values. In estimating future revenues, we use internal budgets. Internal budgets are developed based on recent revenue data and future marketing plans for existing product lines and planned timing of future introductions of new products and their impact on our future cash flows. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Generally, ownership of and title to our products pass to customers upon delivery of the products to customers. Certain of our distributors may also perform a separate function as a co-packer on our behalf. In such cases, ownership of and title to our products that are co-packed on our behalf by those co-packers who are also distributors, passes to such distributors when we are notified by them that they have taken transfer or possession of the relevant portion of our finished goods. Net sales have been determined after deduction of promotional and other allowances in accordance with ASC 605-50. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on our historical experience. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of our finished products and certain quality control costs. Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, ingredients and packaging materials. Operating Expenses Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, commissions, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees including legal fees, termination payments made to certain of our prior distributors, entertainment, insurance, postage, depreciation and other general and administrative costs. Stock-Based Compensation We account for share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of our stock options at the date of grant. The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Our employee stock options, however, have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options. For example, employee stock options are 56 generally subject to vesting restrictions and are generally not transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected life of an option and the number of awards ultimately expected to vest. Changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option. Furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee. We use historical data to estimate the expected price volatility, the expected option life and the expected forfeiture rate. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions, we may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense or income tax expense, which could be material to our results of operations. Income Taxes The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in ASC 740. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances the Company considers projected future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies. If in the future the Company determines that it would not be able to realize its recorded deferred tax assets, an increase in the valuation allowance would be recorded, decreasing earnings in the period in which such determination is made. The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the Company evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on the Company consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Sales The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A unit case means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings) or concentrate sold that will yield 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage. The Company defines unit case volume as the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of beverages directly or indirectly sold by us. Our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. Because the primary historical market for our products is California, which has a year-long temperate climate, the effect of seasonal 57 fluctuations on quarterly results may have been mitigated; however, such fluctuations may be more pronounced as the distribution of our products expands outside of California. Our experience with our energy drink products suggests they are less seasonal than traditional beverages. As the percentage of our sales that are represented by such products continues to increase, seasonal fluctuations will be further mitigated. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of the sales of our finished products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses.

Average price per case exclusive of this recognition was $10.26 and $9.96 for the three-months and year ended December 31, 2008, respectively. Inflation We do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented.

The foregoing list of important factors and other risks detailed from time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is not exhaustive. See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors, for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and uncertainties. Those factors and the other risk factors described therein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. Consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. 60
