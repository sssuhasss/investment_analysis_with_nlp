ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements and other disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (including the disclosures under Item 1A. Risk Factors ). Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in U.S. dollars. Executive Summary This past year marked the 20 th anniversary of the founding of Gilead and the achievement of many important milestones as we continued to discover, develop and commercialize innovative therapeutics in areas of unmet medical need. We grew our product sales significantly, we executed on several product approvals and launches in multiple territories, in-licensed new compounds into our research pipeline as well as made progress on product candidates already in the clinic, integrated multiple sites that were acquired in 2006 and continued to strengthen our worldwide organization and infrastructure. Our operating results for 2007 were led by product sales of $3.73 billion. HIV product sales (Truvada, Atripla, Viread and Emtriva) of $3.14 billion, which increased by 48% in 2007 over 2006, were the key driver for total product sales growth of 44% in 2007 compared to 2006. Total product sales of Truvada increased by $394.9 million (or 33%) in 2007 when compared to the prior year, despite the availability of Atripla in the United States since July 2006. Atripla product sales in 2007 increased by $697.7 million from 2006. Together, Truvada and Atripla sales comprised 67% of our total product sales in 2007. In addition to the commercial progress and success of Atripla in the United States, we and our partner, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS), expanded our Atripla collaboration to include the 27 countries that comprise the European Union, as well as Norway and Iceland. In December 2007, we received approval from the European Commission to market and sell Atripla in these European territories. We have already begun shipping Atripla to Germany, the United Kingdom and Austria, and expect to launch the product throughout the remainder of the European Union, as pricing and other sales and marketing matters are finalized and approved. If Atripla continues to comprise a larger proportion of our total product sales, we expect our product gross margin will continue to decrease. This decrease results from the inclusion of BMS Sustiva (efavirenz), which carries zero gross margin, in product sales and cost of goods for Atripla. Our 2007 product gross margin decreased to 79% due to the higher percentage of Atripla in our mix of product sales as compared to 2006. Hepsera product sales for 2007 increased 31% from 2006 driven primarily by sales volume growth across most major geographical regions as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange environment. AmBisome product sales for 2007 increased 18% from 2006 driven primarily by sales volume growth in Europe as well as the impact of a favorable foreign currency exchange environment. Due to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against major European currencies in 2007, foreign currency denominated product sales experienced a net benefit from the foreign currency fluctuations after considering the impact of our hedging activities. This resulted in foreign currency having a favorable impact of approximately $71.2 million on pre-tax income in 2007 compared to 2006. In addition to the growth in our product sales, royalty revenues increased by 12% in 2007 compared to 2006. Of the $468.2 million in royalty revenues that we recognized, $414.5 million were recorded from royalties on the sales of Tamiflu by F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (together with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Roche). Strong sales of Tamiflu by Roche, including sales of Tamiflu related to worldwide pandemic planning initiatives, contributed to the increase in our royalty revenues. Despite the higher royalties recognized in 2007, Roche recently announced that they expect to see a marked decline in Tamiflu sales related to pandemic planning. We expect this decline to significantly reduce the royalties we receive from the sale of Tamiflu which will adversely impact our 2008 financial results. 45 Table of Contents In June 2007, Letairis (ambrisentan), a product acquired in our 2006 acquisition of Myogen Inc. (Myogen), was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). In October 2007, we filed a supplemental new drug application (NDA) with the FDA, as well as a Type II variation with the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA), for the marketing approval of Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults. Additionally, in November 2007, we submitted an NDA with the FDA for marketing approval of aztreonam lysine for inhalation for the treatment of pulmonary Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( P. aeruginosa ) infection in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Along with the regulatory filings made in relation to Viread for hepatitis B and aztreonam lysine for inhalation for CF, we progressed the development of other compounds and drug candidates in-licensed from our collaboration partners, including: In the HIV area, we completed a Phase 2 clinical trial of elvitegravir (GS 9137), our novel integrase inhibitor for HIV which we licensed from Japan Tobacco Inc. in 2005. Integrase inhibitors represent a new way of attacking HIV and a potential treatment alternative for patients who have developed resistance to existing classes of therapy. Pending a positive outcome of our discussions with the FDA and the EMEA concerning the design of the Phase 3 program, we anticipate dosing patients in a Phase 3 clinical study for elvitegravir in 2008. In the hepatitis B area, we filed a supplemental NDA with the FDA, as well as a Type II variation with the EMEA, for the marketing approval of Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults. These applications were based on data we obtained from two key pivotal Phase 3 studies completed during the year. We anticipate decisions from the EMEA and the FDA in the second and third quarters of 2008, respectively. In the hepatitis C area, we presented preliminary data in November 2007 on our lead compound against the hepatitis C virus, GS 9190, a non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor. After investigating QT prolongations at certain doses, pending the FDA consent, we plan to reinitiate our Phase 1a/b study of GS 9190 to further define the efficacy and safety of the compound. During the year, we also entered into an exclusive license agreement with LG Life Sciences, Ltd. (LGLS) to develop and commercialize certain caspase inhibitors for the treatment of fibrotic diseases. Caspase inhibitors are showing potential as treatments for chronic hepatitis C and other diseases characterized by tissue scarring (fibrosis). The agreement granted us commercialization rights to LGLS investigational caspase inhibitors, including GS 9450 which is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 2a clinical trial as a potential treatment for chronic hepatitis C and for which we anticipate data by the end of 2008. Related to this collaboration, we paid a $20.0 million up-front license fee that we recorded in research and development (R&D) expenses. In the cardiovascular area, we plan to continue to enroll our two Phase 3 clinical studies for darusentan for the treatment of resistant hypertension and we expect to complete enrollment in 2009. In addition, Letairis for PAH was approved in the United States in June, and our partner GlaxoSmithKline Inc. (GSK), who has rights to ambrisentan in territories outside of the United States, received a positive opinion from the European Committee for Human Medicinal Products for the treatment of PAH in February 2008. If approved, GSK will market ambrisentan under the name Volibris. In the respiratory area, we presented data from the second of the two pivotal studies of aztreonam lysine for inhalation, our inhaled antibiotic for the treatment of patients with CF who have pulmonary infection with P. aeruginosa. Along with the NDA we filed with the FDA in November 2007, we plan to submit a marketing authorization application to the EMEA in the second quarter of 2008. Also in the respiratory area, we completed a Phase 1a study in healthy volunteers for GS 9310/11, a proprietary formulation of the combination of tobramycin and fosfomycin for inhalation, and have begun enrolling patients in two Phase 1b clinical studies. Additionally, in August 2007, we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with Parion Sciences, Inc. (Parion) to research, develop and commercialize certain epithelial sodium channel inhibitors for the treatment of pulmonary diseases. In connection with this collaboration, we paid a $5.0 million up-front license fee which we recorded as R&D expense and made a $5.0 million investment in Parion. 46 Table of Contents Taken together, these programs contributed to the increase in R&D expenses in 2007 as compared to 2006, and we expect research and clinical activity in these areas will continue to increase R&D expenses in 2008. In addition to our commercial and clinical efforts, we continued to expand our worldwide organization and infrastructure. In 2007, we integrated the sites acquired in our 2006 acquisitions of Corus Pharma, Inc. (Corus), Myogen and Raylo Chemicals Inc. In September 2007, we acquired and integrated Nycomed Limited, a Cork, Ireland based manufacturing and tableting operation. We transferred certain of our existing Dublin operations to this Nycomed facility in Cork and utilize this Cork facility for solid dose tablet manufacturing of certain of our antiviral products and product packaging activities. As part of our strategy to better build, manage and expand our presence in new and existing markets internationally, we established new subsidiaries in Turkey, Austria and Switzerland in 2007, and are in the process of establishing marketing subsidiaries in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. These initiatives, which we believe will help reduce our reliance on third-party distributors, have also contributed to the increase in our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 2007 as we continue to increase headcount and expand our marketing and promotional activities in these countries. We will continue to see an increase in SG&A expenses in 2008 as we continue to expand internationally and launch products in new territories, including Atripla in the European territories. Our strong operating results which contributed to operating cash flows of $1.77 billion for 2007, helped fund our R&D activities, our corporate development opportunities, our worldwide infrastructure and capital requirements as well as our daily operating needs. Additionally, our strong cash position allowed us to repurchase $487.5 million of our common stock in 2007. These repurchases completed the $1 billion stock repurchase program initiated in 2006 and allowed us to initiate a $3 billion stock repurchase program in October 2007. In addition, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement under which our credit facility was increased to $1.25 billion, thereby providing greater access to funds as future requirements arise. In 2008, we plan to further expand our international footprint, advance additional drug candidates into the clinic and launch Viread for hepatitis B and aztreonam lysine for inhalation for CF, if they are approved. Strengthening our relationships with our corporate partners continues to be a priority, especially as we and BMS continue to launch Atripla in the European territories. Finally, we plan to continue to strengthen our worldwide infrastructure to better support our growing employee and customer base, as well as to better facilitate our expanding manufacturing, research and development and commercial activities. Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories, prepaid royalties, clinical trial accruals, our tax provision and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market-specific assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, however, may differ significantly from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 47 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Product Sales We recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence an arrangement exists, delivery to the customer has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. We record estimated reductions to revenues for government rebates such as Medicaid reimbursements, customer incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and expected returns of expired products. These estimates are deducted from gross product sales at the time such revenues are recognized. Of these reductions from gross product sales, government rebates significantly impact our reported net product sales and are based upon certain estimates that require complex and significant judgment of management. Government Rebates We estimate amounts payable by us to government-managed Medicaid programs as well as to certain other qualifying federal, state and foreign government programs for the reimbursement of portions of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by these programs. Government rebates that are invoiced directly to us are recorded in other accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers at a lower contractual government price, the wholesalers charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower price, which we record as allowances against accounts receivable. We estimate these sales allowances based on contractual terms, historical utilization rates, any new information regarding changes in these programs regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates, our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs and, for U.S. product sales, the channel inventory data as obtained from our major U.S. wholesalers in accordance with our inventory management agreements. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, government rebates of $464.4 million, $272.2 million and $184.8 million, respectively, representing 12%, 9% and 9% of total gross product sales, respectively, were deducted from gross product sales. Based on the current information available to us, actual government rebates claimed for these periods have varied by less than 3% from our estimates recorded in those periods. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had accrued government rebates of $115.5 million and $65.7 million, respectively, in other accrued liabilities and an allowance of $25.3 million and $10.6 million, respectively, recorded against accounts receivable. The following table summarizes the aggregate activity in these accrued government rebates allowance and accrued liabilities accounts: Balance at Beginning of Year Charged to Expense Deducted from Accruals Balance at End of Year Year ended December 31, 2007: Government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities Activity related to 2007 sales $ $ 439,562 $ 310,272 $ 129,290 Activity related to sales prior to 2007 76,362 (2,753 ) 62,134 11,475 Total $ 76,362 $ 436,809 $ 372,406 $ 140,765 Year ended December 31, 2006: Government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities Activity related to 2006 sales $ $ 246,274 $ 190,258 $ 56,016 Activity related to sales prior to 2006 71,220 (4,681 ) 46,193 20,346 Total $ 71,220 $ 241,593 $ 236,451 $ 76,362 48 Table of Contents Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including, but not limited to, contractual payment terms, historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days sales outstanding by customer and geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Our allowance for doubtful accounts balance as a percentage of total accounts receivable did not materially change from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions; however, significant deterioration in any of the above factors, especially with respect to the government funding and reimbursement practices in the European market could materially change these expectations and result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts. Inventories We record write-downs in the value of our inventory based on our review of bad batches experienced during the manufacturing process as well as quality control reviews of our inventory. We generally do not record inventory write-downs relating to estimated obsolescence or risk of competition primarily because the shelf life of our products is long. However, if our current assumptions about future production or inventory levels, demand or competition were to change or if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could negatively impact our product gross margins and results of operations. Prepaid Royalties We capitalize royalties that we have prepaid at cost, specifically those related to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to Emory University (Emory) for the HIV indication, based on the present value of the future royalty obligation that we would expect to pay to Emory assuming certain expected future levels of our product sales incorporating emtricitabine. The present value of our future royalty obligation was derived using our weighted average cost of capital. We review quarterly the expected future sales levels of our products and any indicators that might require a write-down in the net recoverable value of our asset or a change in the estimated life of the prepaid royalty. Some potential indicators of impairment include the launch of a significant product by a competitor, significant deviations in recognized product sales compared to forecast and product safety issues and recalls. We amortize our prepaid royalties based on an effective royalty rate that we derive from forecasted HIV product sales incorporating emtricitabine. Our product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity upon considering such factors as historical and expected future patient usage or uptake of our products, the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products and future product launch plans. If a previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts, including the introduction of a competing product by us or one of our competitors into the same HIV market as emtricitabine, we would prospectively update the royalty rate used to amortize our prepaid royalties which may increase future royalty expense. As of December 31, 2007, we had a prepaid royalty asset relating to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to Emory of $306.7 million. Amortization expense relating to this prepaid royalty asset was $14.3 million, $15.1 million and $6.2 million, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Clinical Trial Accruals We record accruals for estimated clinical study costs. Most of our clinical studies are performed by third-party contract research organizations (CROs). These costs are a significant component of R&D expenses. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we incurred CRO costs of $65.6 million, $30.2 million and $21.1 million, respectively. We 49 Table of Contents accrue costs for clinical studies performed by CROs on a straight-line basis over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjust our estimates, if required, based upon our on-going review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CRO. We validate our accruals quarterly with our vendors and perform detailed reviews of the activities related to our significant contracts. Based upon the results of these validation processes, we assess the appropriateness of our accruals and make any adjustments we deem necessary to ensure that our expenses reflect the actual effort incurred by the CROs. Generally, a significant portion of the total clinical trial costs are associated with start up activities for the trial and patient enrollment. We extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start-up activities in-house. As a result, CROs typically perform most of the total start-up activities for our trials, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training and program management. In general, these costs are typically 10% to 30% of the total CRO contract value. On an actual basis, this percentage range is significantly wider as many of our contracts are either expanded or reduced in scope compared to the original budget. Start-up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are milestone or event-driven in nature. The remaining activities and related costs, such as patient monitoring and administration, generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study. Most contracts are negotiated as fixed per unit prices and can vary in length between three months for a single dose Phase 1 study and up to two years or more for a more complex Phase 3 clinical study. The average length of contracts in 2007, 2006 and 2005 has been at the upper end of this range in order to provide long-term safety and efficacy data to support the commercial launches of Truvada, Viread, Atripla, Emtriva, Hepsera and Letairis. All of our material CRO contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and we are generally only liable for actual effort expended by the CRO and certain non-cancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination. Amounts paid in advance relating to uncompleted services will be refunded if a contract is terminated. Some contracts may include additional termination payments that become due and payable if we terminate the contract. Such additional termination payments are only recorded if it becomes probable that a contract will be terminated. Through December 31, 2007, differences between actual and estimated activity levels for any particular study have not been material. However, if management does not receive complete and accurate information from our vendors or underestimates activity levels associated with a study at a given point in time, we would have to record additional and potentially significant R&D expenses in future periods. Tax Provision We estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we would reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. Such an adjustment was made in 2007 and 2005 when we determined that it was more likely than not that certain of our deferred tax assets would be realized, and therefore, we released the related valuation allowance. This resulted in an income tax benefit of approximately $1.5 million and $8.2 million for 2007 and 2005, respectively. Our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, regulations or rates, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation, changes in our international organization and changes in overall levels of income before tax. In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), an interpretation of Statement of Financial Accounting 50 Table of Contents Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109 by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. On January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48 and increased our liability for unrecognized tax benefits by $14.1 million with a corresponding charge to the opening balance of accumulated deficit, as permitted under FIN 48. In addition, we reclassified $68.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits from short-term income taxes payable and noncurrent deferred tax assets to long-term income taxes payable. As of the date of adoption, we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $86.2 million recorded primarily in long-term income taxes payable on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, including accrued liabilities related to interest of $4.0 million. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits as of January 1, 2007, $78.0 million, if recognized, would have reduced our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. As permitted under the provisions of FIN 48, we will continue to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of our income tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. At December 31, 2007, we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $111.7 million, including interest of $8.3 million. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $103.5 million, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. With respect to the unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. For U.S. federal and California income tax purposes, the statute of limitations remains open for all years from inception due to our utilization of net operating losses relating to prior years. Our income tax returns are audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the 2003 and 2004 tax years, by the Franchise Tax Board of California for the 2004 and 2005 tax years and by various other state and foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. While we believe our positions comply with applicable laws, we periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions. We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions based upon FIN 48. We do not believe any such items currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, although an adverse resolution of one or more of these items in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. Prior to the adoption of FIN 48, we recorded liabilities related to uncertain tax positions based upon SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies . Stock-based Compensation In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which requires that all share-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of stock options, be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. SFAS 123R supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25) and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows . On January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method of adoption as permitted under SFAS 123R, which requires that compensation expense be recorded for all nonvested stock options and other stock-based awards as of the beginning of the first quarter of adoption. In accordance with the modified prospective method, no prior period amounts were restated to reflect the provisions of SFAS 123R. 51 Table of Contents Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123, we elected to follow APB 25, and FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25 , in accounting for our employee stock-based plans. Under APB 25, if the exercise price of our employee and director stock options was equal to or greater than the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense was recognized. However, as required by SFAS 123, the pro forma impact of expensing the fair value of our stock options and employee stock purchase plan was disclosed in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with our adoption of SFAS 123R, we refined our valuation assumptions and the methodologies used to derive those assumptions; however, we elected to continue using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The fair value of stock options granted prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R was calculated using the multiple option approach while the fair value of stock options granted beginning January 1, 2006 was calculated using the single option approach. Concurrent with our adoption of SFAS 123R, we determined that a blend of historical volatility along with implied volatility for traded options on our stock would be a better measure of market conditions and expected volatility. Previously, we used historical stock price volatility as it was the most reliable source of volatility data. We estimate the weighted-average expected life of our stock options based on historical cancellation and exercise data related to our stock options as well as the contractual term and vesting terms of the awards. We record stock-based compensation expense using a graded vesting expense attribution approach for nonvested stock options granted prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R consistent with the expense attribution approach used in our historical SFAS 123 disclosures and using a straight-line expense attribution approach for stock options granted after the adoption of SFAS 123R. We currently believe that the straight-line expense attribution approach better reflects the level of service to be provided over the vesting period of our awards. Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options is recognized net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures based on our historical experience. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R, we will only recognize a tax benefit from stock-based compensation in additional paid-in-capital (APIC) if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit and the extraterritorial income deduction through the Consolidated Statements of Operations rather than through APIC. During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we recognized stock-based compensation expense of $184.6 million and $133.8 million, respectively, in operating expenses, and we capitalized $9.8 million and $10.2 million, respectively, into inventory. As of December 31, 2007, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation of $389.2 million related to nonvested stock options, which we expect to expense over an estimated weighted-average period of 2.8 years. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented above relating to them. Results of Operations Total Revenues We had total revenues of $4.23 billion in 2007, $3.03 billion in 2006 and $2.03 billion in 2005. Included in total revenues were product sales, royalty revenues and contract and other revenues. 52 Table of Contents Product Sales Product sales for the last three years consisted of the following (in thousands): 2007 Change 2006 Change 2005 HIV products: Truvada $ 1,589,229 33 % $ 1,194,292 110 % $ 567,829 Atripla 903,381 339 % 205,729 % Viread 613,169 (11 )% 689,356 (11 )% 778,783 Emtriva 31,493 (13 )% 36,393 (23 )% 47,486 Total HIV products 3,137,272 48 % 2,125,770 52 % 1,394,098 Hepsera 302,722 31 % 230,531 24 % 186,532 AmBisome 262,571 18 % 223,031 1 % 220,753 Other 30,544 245 % 8,865 12 % 7,916 Total product sales $ 3,733,109 44 % $ 2,588,197 43 % $ 1,809,299 Total product sales increased by 44% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to an increase in our total product sales volume of $1.04 billion and a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of $97.9 million. Total product sales increased by 43% in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to an increase in our total product sales volume of $760.5 million. A significant percentage of our product sales continued to be denominated in foreign currencies. We used forward and option contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in Euro. This reduced, but did not eliminate, fluctuations in sales due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. HIV Products HIV product sales in 2007 increased by 48% compared to 2006 and by 52% in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily driven by product sales volume growth. During 2006, the average selling prices of our HIV products increased compared to 2005, primarily driven by higher overall selling prices of our HIV products as well as the transition of some patients in the United States from coverage under Medicaid to Medicare Part D which generally reimbursed at higher rates. We estimated the benefit to net product sales resulting from these transitions was approximately $38 million for 2006. Truvada Truvada sales increased by 33% in 2007 compared to 2006 and by 110% in 2006 compared to 2005, in each case, primarily driven by strong sales volume growth in Europe as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange environment in 2007. Truvada sales accounted for 51%, 56% and 41% of our total HIV product sales for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Atripla Atripla sales increased by 339% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to the first full year of Atripla sales in 2007 as well as the continued strong uptake of Atripla in the United States. We consolidate 100% of Atripla product sales because we are the primary beneficiary of our joint venture with BMS in the United States. The efavirenz portion of these Atripla sales was approximately $334.3 million and $76.0 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Atripla was approved for sale in the United States in July 2006 and in the European Union in December 2007. Atripla sales accounted for 29% of our total HIV product sales in 2007. Sales of Atripla in the European Union were not significant in 2007. Viread Viread sales decreased by 11% in 2007 compared to 2006 and by 11% in 2006 compared to 2005, in each case, primarily due to lower sales volume in the United States and Europe driven by the impact of 53 Table of Contents patients switching from a Viread-containing regimen to one containing Truvada and/or Atripla in countries where Truvada and/or Atripla is available, partially offset by sales volume increases in Latin America as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange environment in 2007. The Viread sales decrease in 2007 compared to 2006 was also partially offset by a favorable foreign currency exchange environment. Emtriva Emtriva sales decreased by 13% in 2007 compared to 2006 and 23% in 2006 compared to 2005. The decreases in both years were primarily due to overall sales volume decreases driven by the impact of patients switching from an Emtriva-containing regimen to one containing Truvada and/or Atripla in countries where these products are available. Hepsera Hepsera sales increased by 31% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily driven by sales volume growth across all major geographical regions where the product is sold, as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange environment. Hepsera sales increased by 24% in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily driven by sales volume growth in the United States and Europe. In 2006, Hepsera sales volume also increased with respect to our sales of Hepsera to GSK. We sell Hepsera to GSK at our manufacturing cost in connection with GSK distribution activities in Asia and collect a royalty from GSK upon the sale of Hepsera to customers which we record as royalty revenues. AmBisome Sales of AmBisome increased 18% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to sales volume growth in Europe as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange impact. Sales of AmBisome increased one percent in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to sales volume growth in some regions, partially offset by lower pricing in most regions. AmBisome product sales in the United States relate solely to our sales of AmBisome to Astellas Pharma Inc. which are recorded at our manufacturing cost. In 2008, we expect total product sales to continue to grow as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts. Royalty Revenues The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty revenues (in thousands): 2007 Change 2006 Change 2005 Royalty revenues $ 468,155 12 % $ 416,526 112 % $ 196,873 Our most significant source of royalty revenues for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was from sales of Tamiflu by Roche. Royalty revenues for 2007 were $468.2 million, an increase of 12% compared to 2006, and were $416.5 million for 2006, an increase of 112% compared to 2005. The increases in both comparative periods were primarily driven by the recognition of Tamiflu royalties from Roche of $414.5 million and $364.6 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increases in Tamiflu royalties for both comparative periods were due to the higher Tamiflu sales recorded by Roche, including sales related to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. The increase in Tamiflu royalties for 2006 compared to 2005 was also due to the elimination of a contractual cost of goods adjustment resulting from the dispute resolution in November 2005 that had historically reduced the amount of Tamiflu royalties recognized by us prior to November 2005. We recognize royalties on Tamiflu sales by Roche in the quarter following the quarter in which it is sold. 54 Table of Contents In November 2005, we resolved our dispute with Roche relating to our 1996 development and license agreement and agreed to terminate the related arbitration pending between Roche and us. Related to the dispute resolution, Roche paid us $80.7 million. We recognized this payment as royalty revenue in 2005. The payment consisted of $18.2 million relating to disputed royalties from 2001 to 2003, $11.8 million relating to the reimbursement of the 2004 contractual cost of goods adjustment that had previously reduced our earned royalties and $50.7 million relating to the updating of royalties payable to us for the first nine months of 2005 based on the 2005 then-current royalty rates instead of the prior year effective royalty rate. Roche reported in January 2008 that it expects a significant decrease in Tamiflu sales in 2008 compared to 2007; therefore, we expect our royalty revenues for 2008 to be significantly lower compared to 2007. Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross Margin The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales (in thousands), cost of goods sold (in thousands) and product gross margin: 2007 Change 2006 Change 2005 Total product sales $ 3,733,109 44% $ 2,588,197 43% $ 1,809,299 Cost of goods sold $ 768,771 77% $ 433,320 66% $ 260,326 Product gross margin 79% 83% 86% Our product gross margin for 2007 was 79%, compared to 83% for 2006, primarily due to product mix changes, especially as Atripla, which has a lower product gross margin, comprised a larger proportion of our product sales in 2007. Our product gross margin for 2006 was 83%, compared to 86% for 2005. The lower gross margin in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to the launch of Atripla in the United States, $15.8 million in write-downs of inventory for our Gilead Access Program to its estimated net realizable value, as well as product mix changes as patients continued to switch from Viread, a higher margin product, to Truvada and/or Atripla. The lower gross margin in 2006 compared to 2005 was partially offset by the lower effective royalty rate resulting from our July 2005 emtricitabine royalty buyout discussed below, lower active pharmaceutical ingredients costs and the higher average selling prices of our HIV products in the United States. Atripla product sales decreased our product gross margin, without a corresponding impact to our product gross profit. As the primary beneficiary of our joint venture with BMS in the United States, we consolidate 100% of Atripla product sales but only benefit from the product gross margin on the Truvada portion of Atripla. The efavirenz portion of Atripla product sales carries a zero product gross profit and gross margin since the joint venture purchases efavirenz from BMS at BMS average net selling price of efavirenz in the United States. Prior to July 2005, we paid royalties to Emory on worldwide net sales of product containing emtricitabine. In July 2005, we and Royalty Pharma purchased 65% and 35%, respectively, of the royalty interest owned by Emory in exchange for the elimination of the royalty obligation. As a result of the purchase, we capitalized $341.3 million in prepaid royalties, representing our 65% share of the $525.0 million purchase price. In the third quarter of 2005, we began to amortize this prepaid royalty to cost of goods sold over the remaining life of the underlying patent based on an effective royalty rate derived from our forecasted sales of products containing emtricitabine. We record royalties to Royalty Pharma based on actual emtricitabine net sales relative to Royalty Pharma 35% ownership interest in the underlying Emory royalty interest. We expect our product gross margin in 2008 to be lower compared to 2007, primarily due to a higher mix of Atripla product sales, which include the efavirenz portion of Atripla product sales at zero product gross profit, partially offset by product gross margin improvements driven by lower active pharmaceutical ingredients costs. 55 Table of Contents Research and Development Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in the major components of our R&D expenses over the last three years (in thousands): 2007 Change 2006 Change 2005 Research $ 131,019 54 % $ 85,202 52 % $ 55,918 Clinical development 361,091 52 % 238,270 34 % 178,015 Pharmaceutical development 98,916 64 % 60,389 38 % 43,791 Total research and development $ 591,026 54 % $ 383,861 38 % $ 277,724 R&D expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by CROs, materials and supplies, licenses and fees and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs. Our R&D activities are separated into three main categories: research, clinical development and pharmaceutical development. Research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology costs. Clinical development costs include costs for Phase 1, 2, 3 and 4 clinical trials. Pharmaceutical development expenses consist of costs for product formulation and chemical analysis. R&D expenses in 2007 increased by $207.2 million compared to 2006, primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expenses of $65.2 million due largely to higher headcount, increased clinical study expenses of $58.6 million and increased contract service expenses of $19.6 million relating to clinical, product development and research activities in our cardiovascular programs. In addition, we paid a $20.0 million up-front license fee to LGLS and a $13.5 million license-related fee to PARI GmbH (PARI) in 2007, both of which we expensed as there was no future alternative uses for these technologies. R&D expenses in 2006 increased by $106.1 million compared to 2005, primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expenses of $73.9 million due largely to higher headcount, which included stock-based compensation expense of $52.2 million from our adoption of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006, as well as increased contract service and clinical study expenses of $50.1 million relating to clinical, product development and research activities in our HIV and hepatitis programs and the respiratory and cardiovascular programs assumed in our acquisitions of Myogen and Corus. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower milestone payments made to Japan Tobacco, Inc. (Japan Tobacco) in 2006 compared to 2005 related to the licensing and development of elvitegravir, our lead integrase inhibitor candidate also known as GS 9137, as well as a $15.0 million payment to Emory in 2005 in connection with the amendment of our license agreement with Emory related to our obligation to develop emtricitabine for the hepatitis B indication. In general, significant collaboration payments, like those made to LGLS, PARI, Japan Tobacco and Emory, can cause our R&D expenses to fluctuate period over period. In 2008, we expect R&D expenses to increase over 2007 levels due to increased spending on our internal and collaborative R&D efforts relating to the progress of our product candidates into more advanced clinical studies as well as continuation of our clinical trials related to elvitegravir for HIV, darusentan for resistant hypertension and Viread for HBV, and the initiation of the Phase 4 program for Letairis. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our SG&A expenses over the last three years (in thousands): 2007 Change 2006 Change 2005 Selling, general and administrative $ 705,741 23 % $ 573,660 50 % $ 381,283 56 Table of Contents SG&A expenses for 2007 increased by $132.1 million compared to 2006. The increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expenses of $79.6 million due largely to higher headcount, as well as an increase in marketing and promotional expenses of $20.0 million in the antiviral and cardiovascular areas, including those related to our launch of Letairis for the treatment of PAH. SG&A expenses for 2006 increased by $192.4 million compared to 2005. Higher expenses were primarily driven by higher headcount which increased compensation and benefits by $92.0 million, including stock-based compensation expense of $70.8 million from our adoption of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006, increased expenses of $54.3 million in contract services and promotional programs relating to our business growth, business development activities, preparation for the launch of Atripla in the United States and a $7.9 million write-off of certain capital assets related to renovations at our corporate headquarter campus. In 2008, we expect SG&A expenses to increase primarily due to higher costs to be incurred on administrative activities and sales and marketing efforts to support our business growth, as well as costs associated with anticipated launches of Atripla in the European Union, Viread for HBV in both the United States and European Union, and aztreonam lysine for inhalation for CF in the United States. Purchased In-process Research and Development Expenses In connection with our acquisitions of Myogen and Corus in 2006, we recorded purchased in-process research and development (IPR&D) expenses of $2.06 billion and $335.6 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2006. The purchased IPR&D expense for Myogen represented the estimated fair value of Myogen incomplete R&D programs that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date and, therefore, was expensed upon acquisition. A summary of these programs at the acquisition date, updated for subsequent changes in status of development, is as follows: Program Description Status of Development Estimated Acquisition Date Fair Value (in millions) Ambrisentan An orally active, non-sulfonamide, propanoic acid-class, endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) for the treatment of PAH. Phase 3 clinical trials were completed prior to the acquisition date. We filed an NDA with the FDA in December 2006 and, in June 2007, the FDA approved Letairis (ambrisentan) for the treatment of PAH in the United States. Additionally, in March 2007, the EMEA validated the marketing authorization application for ambrisentan for the treatment of PAH, filed by our collaboration partner, GSK. In February 2008, ambrisentan received a positive opinion from the European Committee for Human Medicinal Products for the treatment of PAH and will be marketed under the name Volibris by GSK upon approval. $ 1,413.7 Darusentan An orally active ETA-selective ERA for the treatment of resistant hypertension. In Phase 3 clinical development as of the acquisition date and the date of this filing. $ 644.5 57 Table of Contents The estimated fair value of the purchased IPR&D was determined using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. We estimated the fair value of the purchased IPR&D using a present value discount rate of 14%, which is based on the estimated internal rate of return for Myogen operations, is comparable to the estimated weighted average cost of capital for companies with Myogen profile, and represents the rate that market participants would use to value the purchased IPR&D. We compensated for the differing phases of development of ambrisentan and darusentan by probability-adjusting our estimation of the expected future cash flows associated with each program. We then determined at that time the present value of the expected future cash flows using the discount rate of 14%. The projected cash flows from the ambrisentan and darusentan programs were based on key assumptions such as estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the programs considering their stages of development; the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of the related product candidates; the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a drug compound such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. For the purpose of estimating the fair value of the ambrisentan program, we estimated that the program was approximately 78% complete as of the acquisition date, based on estimated time and cost to complete, as Phase 3 clinical trials had been completed. As of the acquisition date, we estimated that we would incur future R&D costs of approximately $35 million to $45 million from the date of acquisition through and including the year when commercialization was expected to occur. Material net cash inflows were estimated to begin in 2009 for ambrisentan, assuming the necessary regulatory approvals would be received and the product would be successfully commercialized by that date. For the purpose of estimating the fair value of the darusentan program, we estimated that the program was approximately 35% complete as of the acquisition date, based on estimated time and cost to complete, and remaining efforts would include the completion of Phase 3 clinical development as well as preparing for and filing an NDA with the FDA. As of the acquisition date, we estimated that we would incur future R&D costs of approximately $130 million to $140 million from the date of acquisition through and including the year when commercialization was expected to occur. Material net cash inflows were estimated to begin in 2012 for darusentan, assuming the necessary regulatory approvals would be received and the product would be successfully commercialized by that date. The remaining efforts for completing the darusentan IPR&D program primarily consist of clinical trials, the cost, length and success of which are extremely difficult to predict, and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals. Numerous risks and uncertainties exist that could prevent completion of development, including the ability to enroll patients in clinical trials, the possibility of unfavorable results of our clinical trials and the risk of failing to obtain FDA and other regulatory body approvals. Feedback from regulatory authorities or results from clinical trials might require modifications to or delays in later stage clinical trials or additional trials to be performed. We cannot be certain that darusentan for the treatment of resistant hypertension will be approved in the United States or in countries outside of the United States or whether marketing approvals will have significant limitations on its use. Future discussions with regulatory agencies will determine the amount of data needed and timelines for review, which may differ materially from current projections. Darusentan may never be successfully commercialized. As a result, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of darusentan if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline. If this program cannot be completed on a timely basis or at all, then our prospects for future revenue growth may be adversely impacted. No assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the above cash flows or the timely and successful completion of this project will materialize as estimated. For these reasons, among others, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results. 58 Table of Contents The purchased IPR&D expense for Corus represented the estimated fair value of Corus incomplete inhaled aztreonam lysine for CF R&D program that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date and, therefore, was expensed upon acquisition. A description of this program at the acquisition date, updated for subsequent changes in status of development, is as follows: Program Description Status of Development Estimated Acquisition Date Fair Value (in millions) Inhaled aztreonam lysine for CF Aztreonam formulation for inhalation to be used against Gram-negative bacteria that cause lung infections in patients with CF. In Phase 3 clinical trials as of the acquisition date. We filed an NDA with the FDA in November 2007 and have been granted a target review date of September 2008. $ 335.6 The estimated fair value of the purchased IPR&D was determined using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. We estimated the fair value of the purchased IPR&D using a present value discount rate of 16%, which is based on the estimated internal rate of return for Corus operations, is comparable to the estimated weighted average cost of capital for companies with Corus profile, and represents the rate that market participants would use to value the purchased IPR&D. The projected cash flows from the aztreonam lysine for inhalation program were based on key assumptions such as estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the program considering its stage of development; the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of the related product candidate; the life of the potential commercialized product and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a drug compound such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. Corus two other early-stage candidates were not included in the valuation of purchased IPR&D because they were early-stage projects that did not have identifiable revenues and expenses associated with them. For the purpose of estimating the fair value of the aztreonam program, we estimated that the program was approximately 71% complete as of the acquisition date, based on estimated time and cost to complete, and remaining efforts would include the completion of Phase 3 clinical development as well as preparing for and filing an NDA with the FDA. As of the acquisition date, we estimated that we would incur future R&D costs of approximately $30 million to $35 million from the date of acquisition through and including the year when commercialization was expected to occur. Material net cash inflows were estimated to begin in 2009 for the aztreonam program, assuming the necessary regulatory approvals would be received and the product would be successfully commercialized by that date. The remaining efforts for completing Corus IPR&D program primarily consist of obtaining necessary regulatory approvals. Failing to obtain FDA and other regulatory body approvals is a risk that could prevent completion of development. Feedback from regulatory authorities might require modifications to or delays in later stage clinical trials or additional trials to be performed. We cannot be certain that aztreonam lysine for inhalation for the treatment of CF will be approved in the United States or in countries outside of the United States or whether marketing approvals will have significant limitations on its use. Aztreonam lysine for inhalation may never be successfully commercialized. As a result, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of aztreonam lysine for inhalation if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline. If this program cannot be completed on a timely basis or at all, then our prospects for future revenue growth may be adversely impacted. No assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the above cash flows or the timely and successful completion of the project will materialize as estimated. For these reasons, among others, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results. 59 Table of Contents Interest and Other Income, Net We recorded interest and other income, net, of $109.8 million, $134.6 million and $49.2 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to the lower average cash and investment balances over 2006, as well as the write-down of $7.0 million and $1.8 million relating to the other-than-temporary impairment of our investment in Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the asset-backed commercial paper of a structured investment vehicle, respectively. The increase in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to the higher average cash and investment balances over 2005. Interest Expense In April 2006, we issued $650.0 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2011 (2011 Notes) and $650.0 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2013 (2013 Notes) (collectively, the Notes) in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes were issued at par and bear interest rates of 0.50% and 0.625%, respectively. Debt issuance costs of $23.8 million in connection with the issuance of the Notes were recorded in other noncurrent assets and are being amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the Notes. We incurred interest expense of $13.1 million, $20.4 million and $0.4 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in interest expense in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to our repayment during the first quarter of 2007 of all remaining amounts due under our term loan which we entered into in December 2005. The increase in interest expense in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to interest on the term loan and the interest on our 2011 and 2013 Notes. Minority Interest The minority interest on our Consolidated Financial Statements primarily reflects BMS interest in the operating results of our joint venture with BMS in the United States The joint venture was formed to develop and commercialize Atripla in the United States. As the primary beneficiary of the joint venture as determined under FASB Interpretation No. 46R (As Amended), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities , we consolidate the operations of the joint venture in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes was $655.0 million, $551.8 million and $347.9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The 2007 effective tax rate of 28.9% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to state taxes, offset by tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States. Included in our operating income in 2006 were pre-tax charges of $335.6 million and $2.06 billion for the IPR&D expenses associated with our Corus and Myogen acquisitions, respectively. We did not record any income tax benefit related to the purchased IPR&D expenses as such amounts are non-deductible. The 2006 effective tax rate of (86.5)% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to our federal tax non-deductible purchased IPR&D expenses and state taxes, offset by tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States. The 2005 effective tax rate of 29.9% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due generally to state taxes offset by the recognition of previously unbenefitted net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, and the one-time benefit for qualifying dividends under the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA). On October 22, 2004, the AJCA was signed into law. The AJCA allowed for a deduction of 85% of certain qualified foreign earnings that were repatriated, as defined in the AJCA. We elected to apply this provision to qualifying earnings that were repatriated in 2005. The earnings repatriation resulted in a one-time tax provision benefit of approximately $25.1 million which we recognized in 2005. 60 Table of Contents In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109 by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. On January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48 and increased our liability for unrecognized tax benefits by $14.1 million with a corresponding charge to the opening balance of accumulated deficit, as permitted under FIN 48. In addition, we reclassified $68.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits from short-term income taxes payable and noncurrent deferred tax assets to long-term income taxes payable. As of the date of adoption, we had total federal, state, and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $86.2 million recorded primarily in long-term income taxes payable on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, including accrued liabilities related to interest of $4.0 million. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $78.0 million, if recognized, would have reduced our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. As permitted under the provisions of FIN 48, we will continue to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of our income tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2007, we had total federal, state, and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $111.7 million, including interest of $8.3 million. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $103.5 million, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. With respect to the unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, our working capital, and our cash flow activity as of the end of, and for each of, the last three years (in thousands): 2007 2006 2005 As of December 31: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 2,722,422 $ 1,389,566 $ 2,311,033 Working capital $ 2,292,017 $ 1,664,930 $ 2,627,045 Year Ended December 31: Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,765,490 $ 1,218,059 $ 705,642 Investing activities $ (1,302,467 ) $ (1,739,334 ) $ (682,478 ) Financing activities $ (267,386 ) $ 649,261 $ 441,896 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.72 billion at December 31, 2007, an increase of $1.33 billion or 96% from December 31, 2006. The increase of $1.33 billion was primarily attributable to: net cash provided by operations of $1.77 billion in 2007; and proceeds from issuance of stock under employee stock plans of $243.3 million in 2007. These increases were partially offset by: our repurchase of $487.5 million of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs; our repayment of all remaining amounts due under our term loan of $99.0 million; and capital expenditures of $76.5 million relating to the expansion of our facilities to accommodate our growth. 61 Table of Contents Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.39 billion at December 31, 2006, a decrease of 40% from December 31, 2005. The decrease of $921.5 million in 2006 was primarily due to: net cash paid of $2.74 billion for the acquisitions of Myogen, Raylo and Corus; and $201.0 million paid toward the principal outstanding under our term loan which we entered into in 2005. These decreases were partially offset by: net cash provided by operations of $1.22 billion in 2006; net proceeds of $587.6 million from the issuance of the Notes and related transactions in 2006; and proceeds from the issuance of stock under employee stock plans of $167.9 million in 2006. Working Capital Working capital at December 31, 2007 was $2.29 billion compared to $1.66 billion at December 31, 2006. Significant factors that resulted in an increase in 2007 working capital were: $235.1 million increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities due primarily to cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from issuances of stock under our employee stock plans, which were partially offset by our repurchase of our common stock and our repayment of the term loan and capital spending; $215.1 million increase in prepaid taxes related to intercompany profits between Gilead and our joint venture; and $185.8 million increase in accounts receivable primarily due to increased sales in 2007. Working capital at December 31, 2006 was $1.66 billion compared to $2.63 billion at December 31, 2005. Significant factors that resulted in the decrease in 2006 working capital were: $1.37 billion decrease in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities, primarily due to our funding of significant acquisition activities in 2006, as well as a decrease in our marketable securities portfolio and a decrease resulting from the classification of certain of our marketable securities to long-term securities; and $296.1 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to the launch of Atripla in July 2006 and the related purchases of efavirenz from BMS at BMS approximate market value of efavirenz in order for the joint venture to build inventory levels to supply increasing Atripla demand. These working capital decreases were partially offset by: $347.2 million increase in inventories, primarily due to the increase in Atripla inventory which included efavirenz purchased from BMS at BMS approximate market value of efavirenz; and $213.2 million increase in accounts receivable, primarily due to increased sales in 2006 and the lower collections of receivables in certain European countries where collections traditionally have been slower. Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities of $1.77 billion in 2007 was comprised primarily of $1.62 billion in net income which was adjusted for non-cash items such as $184.6 million of stock-based compensation expense, $133.1 million of deferred income taxes and $110.7 million of tax benefits related to employee stock plans and $76.3 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises. This was partially offset by a $236.0 million net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. 62 Table of Contents Cash provided by operating activities of $1.22 billion in 2006 was comprised primarily of $1.19 billion in net loss which was adjusted for non-cash items such as our $2.39 billion purchased IPR&D expense, stock-based compensation expense of $133.8 million and $127.6 million of tax benefits related to employee stock plans and $95.3 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises. This was partially offset by a $225.1 million net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities of $705.6 million in 2005 was comprised primarily of $813.9 million of net income which was adjusted for non-cash items such as $168.5 million of tax benefits from employee stock plans. This was partially offset by a $251.1 million net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities, which included $341.3 million of prepaid royalties that we made to Emory related to emtricitabine. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities in 2007 primarily related to purchases, sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities, capital expenditures and our acquisition of Nycomed Limited. Cash used in investing activities in 2006 primarily related to purchases, sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities, our acquisitions of Myogen, Raylo Chemicals Inc. (Raylo) and Corus, as well as capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities in 2005 primarily related to purchases, sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities. We used $1.30 billion of cash for investing activities in 2007 compared to $1.74 billion in 2006, a decrease of $436.9 million. The decrease was primarily due to our acquisitions of Myogen, Raylo and Corus for a total of $2.74 billion in 2006, as well as more cash used in the purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities activities during 2007 compared to 2006. We used $1.74 billion of cash for investing activities during 2006, compared to $682.5 million in 2005, an increase of $1.06 billion. The increase was primarily due to our acquisitions of Myogen, Raylo and Corus for a total of $2.74 billion in 2006 as discussed above, as well as more cash provided from the purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities activities during 2006 compared to 2005. Capital expenditures made in 2007, 2006 and 2005 related primarily to the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities, upgrades to our facilities, as well as spending on computer and laboratory equipment to accommodate our business growth. In 2007, capital expenditures also included the construction of a new building at our Foster City, California headquarters. In 2006, capital expenditures also included the purchase of two buildings that we previously leased as well as construction costs of the new building at our Foster City, California headquarters. As of December 31, 2007, we had capital expenditure commitments of $17.7 million, and we expect to fulfill such commitments from funds generated from our operating cash flows. Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities in 2007 was $267.4 million, primarily resulting from the $487.5 million used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, $99.0 million used to pay off all remaining amounts due on our term loan, partially offset by the proceeds from issuance of stock under employee stock plans of $243.3 million, as well as $76.3 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was $649.3 million, primarily resulting from the $587.6 million of net proceeds generated from the issuance of our Notes and related transactions. In addition, we received proceeds from the issuance of stock under employee stock plans of $167.9 million, as well as $95.3 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock option exercises. These cash inflows were partially offset by $201.0 million paid towards principal on our term loan during 2006. Cash provided by financing activities in 2005 primarily related to proceeds from our $300.0 million term loan and proceeds from the issuance of stock under employee stock plans of $143.3 million. 63 Table of Contents Other Information In December 2007, we, along with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Gilead Biopharmaceutics Ireland Corporation (GBIC), entered into an amended and restated credit agreement, which superseded the existing revolving credit agreement, with a syndicate of banks to increase the credit facility to $1.25 billion. The amended and restated credit agreement also includes a sub-facility for swing-line loans and letters of credit. Under the terms of the amended and restated credit agreement, we may borrow initially up to an aggregate of $1.25 billion in revolving credit loans. Loans under the amended and restated credit agreement bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 20 basis points to 32 basis points or (ii) the base rate, as defined in the amended and restated credit agreement. We can prepay any outstanding borrowings at any time in whole or in part without penalty or premium, and any outstanding interest or principal would be due and payable in December 2012. In connection with the amended and restated credit agreement, we entered into a parent guaranty agreement under which we guaranteed the obligations of GBIC under the amended and restated credit agreement. We expect to use the proceeds of any loans under the amended and restated credit agreement for working capital requirements and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2007, we had a $1.5 million letter of credit outstanding under the amended and restated credit agreement. In August 2007, as a result of a review of the terms under our existing corporate aircraft leases and upon consideration of the various alternatives available to us upon their expiration, we entered into agreements to purchase three aircraft to be constructed for delivery in 2010 and 2013. The aggregate purchase price under the purchase agreements was $94.2 million. As of December 31, 2007, we had made deposits totaling $4.7 million which has been recorded in other noncurrent assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Future deposits due under the terms of the purchase agreements are as follows: $2.6 million in 2008, $21.2 million in 2009, $28.5 million in 2010, $4.1 million in 2011, $20.7 million in 2012, and $12.4 million in 2013. We have the option to terminate the purchase agreements, subject to a maximum payment of 7.5% of the fully-equipped price of the aircraft. We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following: the commercial performance of our current and future products; the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials; the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews; the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities; administrative expenses; the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities; the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products; the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of litigation and government investigations. We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. If such funding is required, we cannot assure that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 64 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations consist of debt obligations, capital and operating leases, as well as purchase obligations primarily in the form of capital commitments, purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory-related items and clinical trials contracts. The following table summarizes our significant enforceable and legally binding obligations, future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that they are cancelable as of December 31, 2007 (in thousands): Payments due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than one year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Convertible senior notes (1) $ 1,300,000 $ $ $ 650,000 $ 650,000 Capital lease obligations 621 286 259 76 Operating lease obligations 121,037 26,080 40,394 23,767 30,796 Capital commitments (2) 17,702 17,106 596 Purchase obligations (3)(5) 715,207 274,396 259,581 139,648 41,582 Clinical trials (4) 268,002 130,272 122,924 14,806 Total $ 2,422,569 $ 448,140 $ 423,754 $ 828,297 $ 722,378 (1) At December 31, 2007, we had outstanding principal of $1.30 billion on the Notes that we issued in April 2006. (2) At December 31, 2007, we had firm capital project commitments of approximately $17.7 million primarily relating to the expansion of certain aspects of our manufacturing capabilities and the upgrading of our facilities. (3) At December 31, 2007, we had firm purchase commitments related to active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain inventory-related activities. The amounts related to active pharmaceutical ingredients only represent minimum purchase requirements. Actual purchases are expected to significantly exceed these amounts. (4) At December 31, 2007, we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. Although most of our contracts with CROs are cancelable, we generally have not cancelled such contracts. These amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or termination of, existing contracts and anticipated or potential new contracts. (5) In addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing and development programs. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and have not been included in the table above. (6) With respect to our total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of $115.1 million as of December 31, 2007, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. Such amounts were included in long-term income taxes payable on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, and have not been included in the table above. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree in a business combination. SFAS 141R also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in a business combination, and requires the acquirer to disclose information it needs to evaluate and understand the financial effect of the business combination. As SFAS 141R is effective for business combination transactions for which the acquisition date is on or after December 15, 2008, we do not know whether SFAS 141R will have a material impact to our prospective Consolidated Financial Statements. 65 Table of Contents In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income (loss) attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS 160 also establishes reporting requirements that identify and distinguish between the interest of the parent and the interest of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the effect the adoption of SFAS 160 will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
