Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW The following discussion and analysis is intended to help you understand us, our operations and our financial performance. It should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, which are included elsewhere in this report. We are one of the largest branded apparel companies in the world, with a history going back over 135 years. Our brand portfolio consists of nationally and internationally recognized brand names, including CALVIN KLEIN , TOMMY HILFIGER , Van Heusen , IZOD , ARROW , Speedo (licensed in perpetuity for North America and the Caribbean from Speedo International Limited), Warner , Olga and True&Co. Our brand portfolio also consists of various other owned, licensed and private label brands. Our business strategy is to position our brands to sell globally at various price points and in multiple channels of distribution. This enables us to offer products to a broad range of consumers, while minimizing competition among our brands and reducing our reliance on any one demographic group, product category, price point, distribution channel or region. We also license our brands to third parties and joint ventures for product categories and in regions where we believe our licensees expertise can better serve our brands. Our revenue was $8.915 billion in 2017, of which approximately 50% was generated outside of the United States. Our global designer lifestyle brands, TOMMY HILFIGER and CALVIN KLEIN , together generated over 80% of our revenue. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operations Overview We generate net sales from (i) the wholesale distribution to retailers, franchisees, licensees and distributors of dress shirts, neckwear, sportswear, jeanswear, performance apparel, intimate apparel, underwear, swim products, handbags, accessories, footwear and other related products under owned and licensed trademarks, including through digital commerce sites operated by our wholesale partners and pure play digital commerce retailers, and (ii) the sale of certain of these products through (a) over 1,650 Company-operated free-standing retail store locations worldwide under our CALVIN KLEIN , TOMMY HILFIGER and certain of our heritage brands, (b) over 1,400 Company-operated shop-in-shop/concession locations worldwide under our CALVIN KLEIN and TOMMY HILFIGER trademarks, and (c) digital commerce sites in certain countries under our CALVIN KLEIN and TOMMY HILFIGER trademarks and in the United States through our SpeedoUSA .com and TrueandCo .com digital commerce sites. Additionally, we generate royalty, advertising and other revenue from fees for licensing the use of our trademarks. We manage our operations through our operating divisions, which are presented as six reportable segments: (i) Calvin Klein North America; (ii) Calvin Klein International; (iii) Tommy Hilfiger North America; (iv) Tommy Hilfiger International; (v) Heritage Brands Wholesale; and (vi) Heritage Brands Retail. The United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Legislation ) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Legislation is comprehensive and significantly revises the United States tax code. The revisions expected to significantly impact us are (i) the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, including the resulting remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and the recognition of a valuation allowance on our foreign tax credits, (ii) the imposition of a one-time transition tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries deemed to be repatriated and (iii) the implementation of a modified territorial tax system. The Tax Legislation resulted in a one-time net tax benefit of $53 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, consisting of a $265 million benefit primarily from the remeasurement of our net United States deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by a $38 million valuation allowance on our foreign tax credits and a $174 million transition tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries deemed to be repatriated. Our effective income tax rate for 2017 reflects provisional estimates for the Tax Legislation. As we complete our analysis of the Tax Legislation, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance issued by the United States Department of the Treasury, the Internal Revenue Service, and other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments in 2018 to the provisional amounts recorded in 2017 under the measurement period allowed by the SEC. 30 During the last three years, we have entered into the following transactions, which have impacted our results of operations and comparability among years: We issued on December 21, 2017 600 million euro-denominated principal amount of 3 1/8% senior notes due December 15, 2027. We redeemed on January 5, 2018 our $700 million principal amount of 4 1/2% senior notes due December 15, 2022 (using the proceeds of the senior notes due December 15, 2027) and recorded pre-tax debt extinguishment charges of $24 million. Please see the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for further discussion. We amended on December 20, 2017 Mr. Tommy Hilfiger employment agreement, pursuant to which we made a cash buyout of a portion of the future payment obligation (the Mr. Hilfiger amendment ). We recorded pre-tax charges of $83 million in 2017 in connection with the Mr. Hilfiger amendment. We acquired on September 1, 2017 the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein wholesale and concessions businesses in Belgium and Luxembourg from a former agent (the Belgian acquisition ). As a result of this acquisition, we now operate directly our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses in this region. The total consideration for the acquisition was $14 million, consisting of $12 million paid in cash and $2 million included in accrued expenses in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of February 4, 2018, which is expected to be paid in the first quarter of 2018. We acquired on March 30, 2017 True & Co., a direct-to-consumer intimate apparel digital commerce retailer. This acquisition enables us to participate further in the fast-growing online channel and provides a platform to increase innovation, data-driven decisions and speed in the way we serve our consumers across our channels of distribution. The total consideration for the acquisition was $28 million, net of $400,000 of cash acquired. We restructured our supply chain relationship with Li & Fung in a transaction that closed on September 30, 2017. Our non-exclusive buying agency agreement with Li & Fung was terminated in connection with this transaction. We recorded pre-tax charges of $54 million in 2017 in connection with the Li & Fung termination. We completed the relocation of our Tommy Hilfiger office in New York in 2017 and recorded related pre-tax charges of $19 million, including noncash depreciation expense. We purchased a group annuity in 2017 for certain participants of our retirement plans under which certain of our benefit obligations were transferred to an insurer. We recorded a pre-tax loss of $9 million in connection with the noncash settlement of such benefit obligations. We consolidated our warehouse and distribution network in North America in 2017 and recorded related net pre-tax charges of $8 million, which included a $3 million gain on the sale of a warehouse and distribution center in the fourth quarter of 2017. We entered into an agreement on January 24, 2017 to terminate the license for the Tommy Hilfiger men tailored clothing business in North America held by Marcraft Clothes, Inc. effective December 31, 2017 (the TH men tailored license termination ). Peerless Clothing International, Inc. became the licensee for the business effective January 1, 2018. These transactions were undertaken in order to consolidate with Peerless Clothing International, Inc. our men tailored businesses for all of our brands in North America. We recorded a pre-tax charge of $11 million in 2016 in connection with the TH men tailored license termination. We formed on November 30, 2016 a joint venture in Mexico, PVH Mexico, in which we own a 49% economic interest. The joint venture was formed by merging our wholly owned subsidiary that principally operated and managed our Calvin Klein business in Mexico with a wholly owned subsidiary of Grupo Axo, S.A.P.I. de C.V. ( Grupo Axo ) that distributes certain TOMMY HILFIGER brand products in Mexico. In connection with the formation of PVH Mexico, we deconsolidated our wholly owned subsidiary. We recorded a pre-tax noncash loss of $82 million in 2016 in connection with the Mexico deconsolidation. We, along with Arvind, formed PVH Ethiopia on June 29, 2016, in which we own a 75% interest. We have consolidated the joint venture in our consolidated financial statements. PVH Ethiopia was formed to operate a manufacturing facility that produces finished products for us for distribution primarily in the United States. The manufacturing facility began operations in the first half of 2017. 31 We issued on June 20, 2016 350 million euro-denominated principal amount of 3 5/8% senior notes due July 15, 2024. Please see the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for further discussion. We amended on May 19, 2016 our senior secured credit facilities and recorded pre-tax debt modification and extinguishment charges of $16 million. Please see the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for further discussion. We acquired on April 13, 2016 the 55% of the ownership interests in TH China, our former joint venture for TOMMY HILFIGER in China, that we did not already own. As a result of the TH China acquisition, we now operate directly our Tommy Hilfiger business in this high-growth market. The total consideration for the acquisition was $161 million (including the elimination of a $3 million pre-acquisition receivable owed to us by TH China), net of cash acquired of $105 million. We recorded a net pre-tax gain of $70 million in 2016, including a noncash gain of $153 million to write-up our equity investment to fair value prior to the acquisition closing and costs of $83 million, which primarily consisted of noncash valuation adjustments and amortization of short-lived assets. We recorded pre-tax charges of $27 million in 2017, primarily consisting of noncash amortization of short-lived assets. We expect to incur additional pre-tax charges of approximately $25 million during 2018 in connection with the TH China acquisition, consisting of noncash amortization of short-lived assets. We exited a TOMMY HILFIGER flagship store in Europe in 2016 and recorded a pre-tax gain of $18 million in connection with a payment made to us. In connection with the integration of Warnaco and the related restructuring, we recorded pre-tax charges of $10 million and $73 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. We implemented initiatives to rationalize the Heritage Brands business, including the exit from our Izod retail business (completed in the third quarter of 2015) and the discontinuation of several licensed product lines in the dress furnishings business. We recorded pre-tax charges of $3 million and $17 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, principally in connection with the discontinuation of several licensed product lines in the dress furnishings business. We recorded pre-tax charges of $10 million in 2015 in connection with the operation of and exit from our Izod retail business. Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses each have substantial international components that expose us to significant foreign exchange risk. Amounts recorded in local foreign currencies are translated back to United States dollars using an average exchange rate over the representative period. Our international revenue and earnings are unfavorably impacted during times of a strengthening United States dollar against the foreign currencies in which we generate significant revenue and earnings and favorably impacted during times of a weakening United States dollar against those currencies. Approximately 50% of our 2017 revenue was subject to foreign currency translation. The United States dollar began to strengthen against most major currencies in the latter part of 2014, resulting in a negative impact on our results of operations for 2015 and 2016. The United States dollar began to weaken against most major currencies during 2017 and we currently expect that this will result in a favorable impact on our 2018 revenues and earnings as compared to 2017. Additionally, there is a transaction impact on our financial results because inventory typically is purchased in United States dollars by our foreign subsidiaries. As with translation, our earnings will be impacted as fluctuations of the United States dollar change the local currency value of inventory, which results in a change in the cost of goods in local currency when the goods are sold. We use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge against a portion of the exposure related to this transaction impact. The contracts cover at least 70% of the projected inventory purchases in United States dollars by our foreign subsidiaries. These contracts are generally entered into 12 months in advance of the related inventory purchases. Therefore, the impact of fluctuations of the United States dollar on the cost of inventory purchases covered by these contracts may be realized in our earnings in the year following their inception, as the underlying inventory hedged by the contracts is sold. As such, the unfavorable impact of a strengthening United States dollar against most major currencies in the latter part of 2014 and through 2016, particularly the euro, negatively impacted our gross margin during 2016, and, to a much lesser extent, during 2017. There is also a transaction impact related to changes in SG&A expenses as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Additionally, we have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our 950 million aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated senior notes, as the weakening of the United States dollar against the euro would require us to use a greater amount of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and make long-term debt repayments. We designated the carrying amount of these euro-denominated senior notes that we issued in the United States as net investment hedges of our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency. As a result, the remeasurement of these foreign currency borrowings at the end of each period is recorded in equity. 32 Retail comparable store sales discussed below refer to sales for retail stores that have been open for at least 12 months. Sales for retail stores that are closed during the year are excluded from the calculation of retail comparable store sales. Sales for retail stores that are either relocated, materially altered in size or closed for a certain number of consecutive days are also excluded from the calculation of retail comparable store sales until such stores have been in their new location or in their newly renovated state for at least 12 months. Sales from our Company-operated digital commerce sites are included within retail comparable store sales for those businesses and regions that have operated the related digital commerce site for at least 12 months. Retail comparable store sales are based on local currencies and comparable weeks and, therefore, exclude an extra week in 2017, as our 2017 fiscal year included 53 weeks of operations. The following table summarizes our income statements in 2017, 2016 and 2015: 2017 2016 2015 (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 8,439 $ 7,791 $ 7,605 Royalty revenue 366 321 325 Advertising and other revenue 109 91 90 Total revenue 8,915 8,203 8,020 Gross profit 4,894 4,370 4,162 % of total revenue 54.9 % 53.3 % 51.9 % SG&A 4,248 3,637 3,418 % of total revenue 47.7 % 44.3 % 42.6 % Debt modification and extinguishment costs 24 16 Other noncash gain, net 71 Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates 10 0 17 Income before interest and taxes 632 789 761 Interest expense 128 121 117 Interest income 6 6 4 Income before taxes 510 674 647 Income tax (benefit) expense (26 ) 125 75 Net income 536 549 572 Less: Net loss attributable to redeemable non-controlling interest (2 ) 0 Net income attributable to PVH Corp. $ 538 $ 549 $ 572 Total Revenue Total revenue was $8.915 billion in 2017, $8.203 billion in 2016 and $8.020 billion in 2015. The increase in revenue of $712 million in 2017 as compared to 2016 was due principally to the effect of the following items, inclusive of a 53rd week in 2017: The addition of an aggregate $326 million of revenue attributable to our Calvin Klein International and Calvin Klein North America segments, which included an addition of approximately $49 million related to the impact of foreign currency translation. Calvin Klein International segment revenue increased 21% (including a 3% positive foreign currency impact), driven by continued strength in Europe and China. Calvin Klein International comparable store sales increased 6%. Revenue in the Calvin Klein North America segment increased 1%, principally due to growth in the wholesale business and an increase in royalty revenue, partially offset by a reduction of approximately $60 million resulting from the Mexico deconsolidation and a 1% decline in comparable store sales. The addition of an aggregate $382 million of revenue attributable to our Tommy Hilfiger International and Tommy Hilfiger North America segments, which included an addition of approximately $73 million related to the impact of foreign currency translation. Tommy Hilfiger International segment revenue increased 19% (including a 4% positive foreign currency impact), driven principally by outstanding performance in Europe and Asia, as well as the inclusion of a full first quarter of revenue from the China business as a result of the TH China acquisition in April 2016. Tommy Hilfiger International comparable store sales increased 8%. Revenue in the Tommy Hilfiger North America segment was flat, as a reduction of approximately $75 million resulting from the discontinuation of our directly operated womenswear wholesale business in the United States and Canada during the fourth quarter of 2016 in connection with 33 the licensing of this business to G-III, offset growth in the retail business. Tommy Hilfiger North America comparable store sales increased 3%. The addition of an aggregate $3 million of revenue attributable to our Heritage Brands Retail and Heritage Brands Wholesale segments. Comparable store sales increased 2%. The increase in revenue of $183 million in 2016 as compared to 2015 was due principally to the net effect of the following items: The addition of an aggregate $213 million of revenue attributable to our Calvin Klein International and Calvin Klein North America segments, which included a reduction of approximately $53 million related to the impact of foreign currency translation. Calvin Klein International segment revenue increased 12% (including a 3% negative foreign currency impact) due principally to significant growth in Europe and China. Calvin Klein International comparable store sales increased 6%. Revenue in the Calvin Klein North America segment increased 3% (including a 1% negative foreign currency impact), driven principally by strong growth in the wholesale business, partially offset by a revenue decrease due to the Mexico deconsolidation and a 4% decrease in comparable store sales, primarily driven by declines in traffic and consumer spending in Calvin Klein United States stores located in international tourist locations. The net addition of $141 million of revenue attributable to our Tommy Hilfiger International and Tommy Hilfiger North America segments, which included a reduction of approximately $43 million related to the impact of foreign currency translation. Tommy Hilfiger International segment revenue increased 11% (including a 2% negative foreign currency impact), driven principally by strong growth across Europe, including a 9% increase in comparable store sales, and the inclusion of the revenue of the China business after completion of the TH China acquisition. Revenue in the Tommy Hilfiger North America segment decreased 4% principally due to a 9% decline in comparable store sales, driven by weak traffic and consumer spending in Tommy Hilfiger United States stores located in international tourist locations. The reduction of an aggregate $171 million of revenue attributable to our Heritage Brands Retail and Heritage Brands Wholesale segments. The decrease was primarily due to the business rationalization initiatives discussed in the section entitled Operations Overview above, partially offset by a 7% increase in comparable store sales. We currently expect that revenue will increase 7% in 2018 compared to 2017, inclusive of a positive impact of approximately 3% related to foreign currency translation. Revenue for the Calvin Klein business is expected to increase approximately 9% compared to 2017, inclusive of a positive impact of approximately 2% related to foreign currency translation. Revenue for the Tommy Hilfiger business is expected to increase approximately 8% compared to 2017, inclusive of a positive impact of approximately 4% related to foreign currency translation. Revenue for our Heritage Brands business is expected to be flat compared to 2017. Gross Profit Gross profit is calculated as total revenue less cost of goods sold and gross margin is calculated as gross profit divided by total revenue. Included as cost of goods sold are costs associated with the production and procurement of product, such as inbound freight costs, purchasing and receiving costs and inspection costs. Also included as cost of goods sold are the amounts recognized on foreign currency forward exchange contracts as the underlying inventory hedged by such forward exchange contracts is sold. Warehousing and distribution expenses are included in SG&A expenses. All of our royalty, advertising and other revenue is included in gross profit because there is no cost of goods sold associated with such revenue. As a result, our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities. 34 The following table shows our revenue mix between net sales and royalty, advertising and other revenue, as well as our gross margin for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 : 2017 2016 2015 Components of revenue: Net sales 94.7 % 95.0 % 94.8 % Royalty, advertising and other revenue 5.3 5.0 5.2 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Gross margin 54.9 % 53.3 % 51.9 % Gross profit in 2017 was $4.894 billion, or 54.9% of total revenue, as compared to $4.370 billion, or 53.3% of total revenue, in 2016. The 160 basis point increase in gross margin was principally driven by (i) a favorable mix of business due to faster growth in our Calvin Klein International and Tommy Hilfiger International segments than in our North America segments, as our International segments generally carry higher gross margins, (ii) gross margin improvements in our North America segments due to less promotional selling, and (iii) gross margin improvements related to the Mexico deconsolidation and the G-III license, as the directly operated businesses in Mexico and the directly operated Tommy Hilfiger wholesale womenswear business in the United States and Canada were replaced by royalty revenues from PVH Mexico and G-III, which carry no cost of goods sold. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger United States dollar on our international businesses that purchase inventory in United States dollars, particularly our European businesses, as the increased local currency value of inventory resulted in higher cost of goods in local currency when the goods were sold. Gross profit in 2016 was $4.370 billion, or 53.3% of total revenue, as compared to $4.162 billion, or 51.9% of total revenue, in 2015. The 140 basis point increase in gross margin was principally driven by (i) a favorable mix of business due to revenue growth in our higher-margin Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses and revenue contraction in our lower-margin Heritage Brands business, (ii) the addition of TH China, which achieved a significantly higher gross margin than the average gross margin for our overall business, and (iii) gross margin improvements in our North America segments, principally in the second half of the year, due to decreased promotional selling resulting from lower inventory levels as compared to the prior year. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger United States dollar on our international businesses that purchase inventory in United States dollars, particularly our European businesses, as the increased local currency value of inventory resulted in higher cost of goods in local currency when the goods were sold. We currently expect that gross margin in 2018 will increase as compared to 2017 due to (i) the impact of expected faster growth in our Calvin Klein International and Tommy Hilfiger International segments than in our North America segments, as our International segments generally carry higher gross margins and (ii) the favorable impact of the expected weaker United States dollar on our international businesses that purchase inventory in United States dollars, particularly our European businesses, as the decreased local currency value of inventory results in lower cost of goods in local currency when the goods are sold. SG&A Expenses Our SG&A expenses were as follows: 2017 2016 2015 (Dollars in millions) SG&A expenses $ 4,248 $ 3,637 $ 3,418 % of total revenue 47.7 % 44.3 % 42.6 % SG&A expenses in 2017 were $4.248 billion, or 47.7% of total revenue, as compared to $3.637 billion, or 44.3% of total revenue in 2016. The 340 basis point increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue was principally attributable to (i) a change in the mix of business due to faster growth in our Calvin Klein International and Tommy Hilfiger International segments than in our North America segments, as our International segments generally carry higher SG&A expenses as percentages of revenue, (ii) the costs incurred in connection with the Mr. Hilfiger amendment, (iii) the costs incurred in connection with the Li & Fung termination, (iv) an increase in marketing expenditures, particularly in the Calvin Klein business, (v) an increase in corporate expenses due, in part, to investments in digital and sourcing initiatives, including start-up costs associated with PVH Ethiopia, (vi) the costs incurred in connection with the relocation of our Tommy Hilfiger office in New York, including noncash depreciation expense, (vii) the absence of the gain recorded in 2016 in connection with a payment made to us to exit a TOMMY HILFIGER flagship store in Europe, (viii) the costs incurred in connection with the 35 consolidation within our warehouse and distribution network in North America and (ix) an increase in retirement plan expense resulting from actuarial losses recorded in 2017 compared to the actuarial gain in 2016 (please see Note 12 , Retirement and Benefit Plans , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion). These increases were partially offset by (i) a reduction of costs incurred in connection with the TH China acquisition, primarily consisting of noncash valuation adjustments and amortization of short-lived assets, (ii) the absence of the costs incurred in connection with the TH men tailored license termination and (iii) the absence of costs incurred in connection with the Warnaco integration and related restructuring. SG&A expenses in 2016 were $3.637 billion, or 44.3% of total revenue, as compared to $3.418 billion, or 42.6% of total revenue in 2015. The 170 basis point increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue was principally attributable to (i) the costs incurred in connection with the TH China acquisition, primarily consisting of noncash valuation adjustments and amortization of short-lived assets, (ii) a change in the mix of business due to the revenue growth in our higher-expense Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses and revenue contraction in our lower-expense Heritage Brands business and (iii) an increase in marketing expenditures and investments associated with the CALVIN KLEIN creative team leadership changes. These increases were partially offset by (i) a reduction of costs incurred in connection with the Warnaco integration and related restructuring and (ii) a decrease in retirement plan expense resulting from an increase in the actuarial gain recorded in 2016 compared to 2015 (please see Note 12 , Retirement and Benefit Plans , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion). We currently expect that SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2018 will decrease as compared to 2017 due to the absence of costs incurred in 2017 in connection with (i) the Mr. Hilfiger amendment, (ii) the Li & Fung termination, (iii) the relocation of our Tommy Hilfiger office in New York, including noncash depreciation expense, and (iv) the consolidation within our warehouse and distribution network in North America. Additionally, our expectation of 2018 SG&A expenses does not include the impact of an actuarial gain or loss associated with our retirement plans, while our 2017 SG&A expenses included a $9 million loss recorded in connection with the noncash settlement of certain of our benefit obligations related to our retirement plans as a result of a group annuity purchased for certain participants. These decreases will be partially offset by a change in the mix of business due to faster growth in our Calvin Klein International and Tommy Hilfiger International segments than in our North America segments, as our International segments generally carry higher SG&A expenses as percentages of total revenue. Our actual 2018 SG&A expenses may be significantly different than our projections because of expenses associated with our retirement plans. Retirement plan expenses recorded throughout the year are calculated using actuarial valuations that incorporate assumptions and estimates about financial market, economic and demographic conditions. Differences between estimated and actual results give rise to gains and losses that are recorded immediately in earnings, generally in the fourth quarter of the year, which can create volatility in our operating results. Debt Modification and Extinguishment Costs We incurred costs totaling $24 million in 2017 in connection with the early redemption of our $700 million 4 1/2% senior notes due December 15, 2022. Please see the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for further discussion. We incurred costs totaling $16 million in 2016 in connection with the amendment of our senior secured credit facilities. Please see the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for further discussion. Other Noncash Gain, Net We recorded a pre-tax noncash gain of $153 million in 2016 to write-up our equity investment in TH China to fair value in connection with the TH China acquisition. Please see Note 2 , Acquisitions , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. We recorded a pre-tax noncash loss of $82 million in 2016 in connection with the Mexico deconsolidation. Please see Note 5 , Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliates The equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates was $10 million in 2017 as compared to $100,000 during 2016 and $17 million during 2015. These amounts relate to our share of income (loss) from our joint ventures for the TOMMY HILFIGER brand in China (prior to the TH China acquisition on April 13, 2016), India and Brazil, for the CALVIN KLEIN 36 brand in India, for the TOMMY HILFIGER , CALVIN KLEIN and Van Heusen brands in Australia, and for the CALVIN KLEIN , TOMMY HILFIGER , Warner , Olga and Speedo brands in Mexico (since the formation of PVH Mexico on November 30, 2016). Also included is our share of income (loss) from our investments in the parent company of the Karl Lagerfeld brand ( Karl Lagerfeld ) and, beginning in the third quarter of 2016, in Gazal Corporation Limited ( Gazal ), our joint venture partner in Australia. Our investments in the continuing joint ventures, Karl Lagerfeld and Gazal are being accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Please see the section entitled Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates within Liquidity and Capital Resources below for further discussion. The equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates in 2016 included a one-time expense of $6 million recorded on our equity investment in TH China prior to the acquisition closing. The equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates in 2015 included a one-time gain of $2 million on our equity investment in Karl Lagerfeld. Interest Expense, Net Net interest expense increased to $122 million in 2017 from $115 million in 2016 primarily due to the net impact of the issuance of 350 million euro-denominated 3 5/8% senior notes in June 2016 and increases in short-term borrowings and interest rates as compared to 2016, partially offset by long-term debt repayments made during 2017 and 2016. Please see the section entitled Financing Arrangements within Liquidity and Capital Resources below for further discussion. Net interest expense increased to $115 million in 2016 from $113 million in 2015 as the positive impacts from long-term debt repayments made during 2016 and 2015 and the amendment of our senior secured credit facilities in the second quarter of 2016 were more than offset by the negative impacts of the interest rate swap that commenced in February 2016 to convert a portion of our variable rate debt under our term loans to fixed rate debt and the issuance of 350 million euro-denominated 3 5/8% senior notes in June 2016. Please see the section entitled Financing Arrangements within Liquidity and Capital Resources below for further discussion. Net interest expense in 2018 is currently expected to be approximately $120 million compared to $122 million in 2017. Income Taxes Income tax expense was as follows: 2017 2016 2015 (Dollars in millions) Income tax (benefit) expense $ (26 ) $ 125 $ 75 Income tax (benefit) expense as a % of pre-tax income (5.1 )% 18.6 % 11.6 % We file income tax returns in more than 40 international jurisdictions each year. All of the international jurisdictions in which we file tax returns, with the exception of Japan, had lower statutory tax rates than the United States statutory tax rate during 2015, 2016 and in 2017 prior to enactment of the Tax Legislation. A substantial amount of our earnings come from our international operations, particularly in the Netherlands, Hong Kong, China and Canada. The lower statutory income tax rates in these jurisdictions, as compared to the United States statutory rate prior to the Tax Legislation, coupled with special rates levied on income from certain of our jurisdictional activities, significantly reduced our consolidated effective income tax rate during 2017, 2016 and 2015. As a result of the Tax Legislation, the United States statutory income tax rate was reduced from 35.0% to 21.0%, effective January 1, 2018. Therefore, our United States statutory income tax rate for 2017 was a blended rate of 33.7%. Our effective income tax rate for 2017 was lower than the United States statutory rate primarily due to (i) the provisional net one-time benefit of $53 million recorded in connection with the Tax Legislation, which resulted in a benefit to our 2017 effective income tax rate of 10.4%, consisting of a $265 million benefit primarily from the remeasurement of our net United States deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by a $38 million valuation allowance on our foreign tax credits and a $174 million transition tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries deemed to be repatriated, (ii) the benefit of overall lower tax rates in certain international jurisdictions where we file tax returns and (iii) the overall benefit of certain discrete items, including the favorable impact on certain liabilities for uncertain tax positions and an excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options by our Chief Executive Officer, which resulted in benefits to our effective income tax rate of 7.5% and 3.0%, respectively. The effective income tax rate for 2017 was (5.1)% compared with 18.6% in 2016. The 2017 effective income tax rate was significantly lower than the effective income tax rate for 2016 primarily due to (i) the impact of the Tax Legislation in 37 2017, which resulted in a benefit to our 2017 effective income tax rate of 10.4%, (ii) a favorable change in our uncertain tax positions activity of 3.8%, (iii) an excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options by our Chief Executive Officer, which resulted in a benefit to our 2017 effective income tax rate of 3.0%, and (iv) faster growth in our international pre-tax earnings as compared to our domestic pre-tax earnings. These favorable impacts to our effective income tax rate for 2017 were partially offset by the absence of a 5.7% benefit to our 2016 effective income tax rate related to the pre-tax gain recorded to write-up our equity investment in TH China to fair value. The effective income tax rate for 2016 was lower than the United States statutory rate due to the benefit of overall lower tax rates in certain international jurisdictions where we file tax returns. Also contributing to the lower effective income tax rate for 2016 was the benefit of discrete items, including the lower tax rate applicable to the pre-tax gain recorded to write-up our equity investment in TH China to fair value that resulted in a 5.7% benefit to our effective income tax rate. The effective income tax rate for 2015 was lower than the United States statutory rate principally due to the benefit of lower tax rates in certain international jurisdictions where we file tax returns and the benefits primarily related to the favorable resolution of uncertain tax positions, as well as the expiration of the statute of limitations related to other uncertain tax positions. We currently expect that our effective income tax rate in 2018 will be in a range of 14.5% to 15.5% . This projection includes our provisional estimates for the Tax Legislation. These estimates are subject to adjustment in 2018, including as a result of changes in the provisional amounts recorded in 2017 during the measurement period allowed by the SEC, as regulatory guidance needs to be issued related to the Tax Legislation and as we complete our final analysis of the impacts of the Tax Legislation. Further, at this time it is unknown whether the states in which we operate will conform to the Tax Legislation or adopt an alternative regime. In 2018, the United States statutory income tax rate will be 21.0% for the full year, whereas in 2017, our United States statutory income tax rate was a blended rate of 33.7%, which reflected a partial year rate reduction from 35.0% to 21.0%. Our expectation that our effective income tax rate in 2018 will be lower than the United States statutory income tax rate is principally due to the benefit of overall lower tax rates in certain international jurisdictions where we file tax returns. Our current expectation that the effective income tax rate in 2018 will increase compared to 2017 is primarily due to (i) the absence of a 10.4% benefit to our 2017 effective income tax rate related to the Tax Legislation, (ii) the absence of a 3.0% benefit to our 2017 effective income tax rate resulting from an excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options by our Chief Executive Officer and (iii) an anticipated unfavorable change in our uncertain tax positions activity, partially offset by (i) the full year benefit of the 21.0% United States statutory income tax rate and (ii) faster growth in our international pre-tax earnings as compared to our domestic pre-tax earnings. Despite the change in the United States statutory income tax rate, we currently expect that statutory income tax rates in certain international jurisdictions where we file tax returns will continue to be lower than the United States statutory income tax rate as a result of lower statutory rates and the benefit of special rates levied on income from certain jurisdictional activities. We expect to benefit from these special rates until 2023. Our tax rate is affected by many factors, including the mix of international and domestic pre-tax earnings, discrete events arising from specific transactions, and audits by tax authorities or the receipt of new information, any of which can cause us to change our estimate for uncertain tax positions. Please refer to Note 9, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest We have consolidated the results of PVH Ethiopia, in which we own a 75% interest, in our consolidated financial statements. The net loss attributable to the redeemable non-controlling interest was $2 million in 2017 compared to an immaterial amount in 2016. We currently expect that the net loss attributable to the redeemable non-controlling interest for 2018 will be immaterial. Please refer to Note 6 , Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. 38 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow Summary Cash and cash equivalents at February 4, 2018 was $494 million, a decrease of $236 million from the amount at January 29, 2017 of $730 million. The change in cash and cash equivalents included the impact of (i) $250 million of long-term debt repayments, (ii) $249 million of common stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program, (iii) a $28 million payment made in connection with the acquisition of True & Co., net of $400,000 of cash acquired, and (iv) a $12 million payment made in connection with the Belgian acquisition. Cash flow in 2018 will be impacted by various factors in addition to those noted below in this Liquidity and Capital Resources section, including expected debt repayments of approximately $250 million and common stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program of $200 million to $250 million in 2018. As of February 4, 2018, approximately $371 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by international subsidiaries. Prior to the enactment of the Tax Legislation, our undistributed foreign earnings were considered permanently reinvested and, as such, United States federal and state income taxes were not previously recorded on these earnings. As a result of the Tax Legislation, we recorded a provisional charge in 2017 related to the one-time transition tax on our earnings of foreign subsidiaries deemed to be repatriated in the amount of $174 million. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of the Tax Legislation on our permanent reinvestment assertion under the measurement period allowed by the SEC. Operations Cash provided by operating activities was $700 million in 2017 compared to $956 million in 2016. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by changes in working capital, including an increase in inventories principally driven by our expected sales growth in the first quarter of 2018 and the timing of inventory receipts as compared to the prior year period due to the inclusion of a 53rd week of operations in 2017, as well as an increase in prepaid expenses due to the inclusion of the 53rd week. Capital Expenditures Our capital expenditures in 2017 were $358 million compared to $247 million in 2016. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily driven by expenditures related to (i) upgrading and enhancing our operating, supply chain and logistics systems and our digital commerce platforms and (ii) the relocation of our Tommy Hilfiger office in New York. We currently expect that capital expenditures for 2018 will increase to approximately $450 million, including a shift in the timing of capital expenditures into 2018 from 2017, and will primarily include expenditures related to (i) upgrading and enhancing our operating, supply chain and logistics systems and our digital commerce platforms and (ii) the renovation and expansion of our administrative offices in New York and Amsterdam.

PVH Mexico licenses from certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries the rights to distribute and sell certain CALVIN KLEIN , TOMMY HILFIGER , Warner , Olga and Speedo brand products in Mexico. PVH Mexico was formed by merging our wholly owned subsidiary that principally operated and managed the Calvin Klein business in Mexico (the Mexico business ) with a wholly owned subsidiary of Grupo Axo that distributes certain TOMMY HILFIGER brand products in Mexico. In connection with the formation of PVH Mexico, we deconsolidated the Mexico business and began accounting for our 49% interest under the equity method of accounting in 2016. We made payments of $ 7 million to PVH Mexico during 2016 to contribute our share of the joint venture funding.

Tommy Hilfiger India Contingent Purchase Price Payments We reacquired in 2011 the rights in India to the TOMMY HILFIGER trademarks that had been subject to a perpetual license previously granted to GVM International Limited. We were required to make annual contingent purchase price 40 payments based on a percentage of sales of TOMMY HILFIGER products in India in excess of an agreed upon threshold during each of six consecutive 12-month periods immediately following the acquisition, with the final payment made in 2017. We made contingent purchase price payments of approximately $1 million in each of 2017, 2016 and 2015.

One of our European subsidiaries sold a building in Amsterdam, the Netherlands in 2016 for 15 million (approximately $17 million based on the exchange rate in effect on the date of the sale). Dividends Our common stock currently pays annual dividends totaling $0.15 per share. Dividends on common stock totaled $12 million in each of 2017, 2016 and 2015. We currently project that cash dividends on our common stock in 2018 will be approximately $12 million based on our current dividend rate, the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of February 4, 2018 , our estimate of stock to be issued during 2018 under our stock incentive plans and our estimate of stock repurchases during 2018. Acquisition of Treasury Shares Our Board of Directors authorized a $500 million three-year stock repurchase program effective June 3, 2015. On March 21, 2017, the Board of Directors authorized a $750 million increase to the program and extended it to June 3, 2020. Repurchases under the program may be made from time to time over the period through open market purchases, accelerated share repurchase programs, privately negotiated transactions or other methods, as we deem appropriate. Purchases are made based on a variety of factors, such as price, corporate requirements and overall market conditions, applicable legal requirements and limitations, restrictions under our debt arrangements, trading restrictions under our insider trading policy and other relevant factors. The program may be modified by the Board of Directors, including to increase or decrease the repurchase limitation or extend, suspend, or terminate the program, at any time, without prior notice. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we purchased 2.2 million, 3.2 million and 1.3 million shares, respectively, of our common stock under the program in open market transactions for $250 million, $315 million and $126 million, respectively.

Short-Term Borrowings We have the ability to draw revolving borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, as discussed in the section entitled 2016 Senior Secured Credit Facilities below. There were no borrowings outstanding under these facilities as of February 4, 2018 and January 29, 2017 . Additionally, we have the availability to borrow under short-term lines of credit, overdraft facilities and short-term revolving credit facilities denominated in various foreign currencies. These facilities provided for borrowings of up to $91 million based on exchange rates in effect on February 4, 2018 and are utilized primarily to fund working capital needs. As of February 4, 2018 and January 29, 2017, we had $20 million and $19 million outstanding under these facilities, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on funds borrowed as of February 4, 2018 and January 29, 2017 was approximately 1.19% and 1.40%, respectively. Capital Lease Obligations Our cash payments for capital lease obligations totaled $5 million, $7 million and $8 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 2016 Senior Secured Credit Facilities We have senior secured credit facilities due May 19, 2021 (the 2016 facilities ) that consist of a $2.347 billion United States dollar-denominated Term Loan A facility and senior secured revolving credit facilities consisting of (a) a $475 million United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility, (b) a $25 million United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility available in United States dollars or Canadian dollars and (c) a 186 million euro-denominated revolving credit facility available in euro, British pound sterling, Japanese yen or Swiss francs. Borrowings under the 2016 facilities bear interest at variable rates calculated in a manner as described below. The senior secured revolving credit facilities also include amounts available for letters of credit. A portion of each of the United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facilities is also available for the making of swingline loans. The issuance of such letters of credit and the making of any swingline loan reduces the amount available under the applicable revolving credit facility. We had prior senior secured credit facilities outstanding through May 19, 2016 (the 2014 facilities ), which were amended by the 2016 facilities in the second quarter of 2016. Among other things, this amendment provided for (i) us to borrow an additional $582 million principal amount of loans under the Term Loan A facility, (ii) the repayment of all outstanding loans under the previously outstanding Term Loan B facility with the proceeds of the additional loans under the Term Loan A facility, and (iii) the termination of the Term Loan B facility. We paid debt issuance costs of $11 million (of which $5 million was expensed as debt modification costs and $6 million is being amortized over the term of the related debt agreement) and recorded debt extinguishment costs of $11 million to write-off previously capitalized debt issuance costs. We had loans outstanding of $1.792 billion, net of original issue discounts and debt issuance costs, under the Term Loan A facility, no borrowings outstanding under the senior secured revolving credit facilities and $23 million of outstanding letters of credit as of February 4, 2018. 42 We made payments of $250 million, $350 million and $350 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, on our term loans under the 2016 facilities and 2014 facilities. As a result of the voluntary repayments we made, as of February 4, 2018, we are not required to make a long-term debt repayment until December 2019. The United States dollar-denominated borrowings under the 2016 facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, as determined at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the greater of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the United States federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1.00% and (iii) a one-month adjusted Eurocurrency rate plus 1.00% or (b) an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the 2016 facilities. The Canadian dollar-denominated borrowings under the 2016 facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, as determined at our option, either (a) a Canadian prime rate determined by reference to the greater of (i) the rate of interest per annum that Royal Bank of Canada establishes as the reference rate of interest in order to determine interest rates for loans in Canadian dollars to its Canadian borrowers and (ii) the sum of (x) the average of the rates per annum for Canadian dollar bankers acceptances having a term of one month and (y) 0.75%, or (b) an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the 2016 facilities. The borrowings under the 2016 facilities in currencies other than United States dollars or Canadian dollars bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the 2016 facilities. The current applicable margin with respect to the Term Loan A facility and each revolving credit facility is 1.50% for adjusted Eurocurrency rate loans and 0.50% for base rate loans, respectively. After the date of delivery of the compliance certificate and financial statements with respect to each of our fiscal quarters, the applicable margin for borrowings under the Term Loan A facility and the revolving credit facilities is subject to adjustment based upon our net leverage ratio. During the second quarter of 2017, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a two-year term commencing on February 20, 2018. The agreement was designed with the intended effect of converting an initial notional amount of $306 million of our variable rate debt obligation to fixed rate debt. Under the terms of the agreement for the then-outstanding notional amount, our exposure to fluctuations in the one-month LIBOR is eliminated and we will pay a fixed rate of 1.566%, plus the current applicable margin. During the second quarter of 2014, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a two-year term commencing on February 17, 2016. The agreement was designed with the intended effect of converting an initial notional amount of $683 million of our variable rate debt obligation to fixed rate debt. Such agreement remained outstanding with a notional amount of $549 million as of February 4, 2018. Under the terms of the agreement for the then-outstanding notional amount, our exposure to fluctuations in the one-month LIBOR was eliminated and we paid a weighted average fixed rate of 1.924%, plus the current applicable margin. The agreement expired in February 2018. The notional amount of any outstanding interest rate swap will be adjusted according to a pre-set schedule during the term of the applicable swap agreement such that, based on our projections for future debt repayments, our outstanding debt under the Term Loan A facility is expected to always equal or exceed the combined notional amount of the then-outstanding interest rate swaps. 4 1/2% Senior Notes Due 2022 We had outstanding $700 million principal amount of 4 1/2% senior notes due December 15, 2022. We redeemed these notes on January 5, 2018 in connection with the issuance of 600 million euro-denominated principal amount of 3 1/8% senior notes due December 15, 2027, as discussed below. We paid a premium of $16 million to the holders of these notes in connection with the redemption. We also recorded debt extinguishment costs of $8 million to write-off previously capitalized debt issuance costs associated with these notes. 7 3/4% Debentures Due 2023 We have outstanding $100 million of debentures due November 15, 2023 that accrue interest at the rate of 7 3/4%. 43 3 5/8% Euro Senior Notes Due 2024 We issued on June 20, 2016 350 million euro-denominated principal amount of 3 5/8% senior notes due July 15, 2024.

We paid 9 million (approximately $ 10 million based on exchange rates in effect on the payment date) of fees during the fourth quarter of 2017 in connection with the issuance of these notes, which are amortized over the term of the notes. We may redeem some or all of these notes at any time prior to September 15, 2027 by paying a make whole premium plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, we may redeem some or all of these notes on or after September 15, 2027 at their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Our financing arrangements contain financial and non-financial covenants and customary events of default. As of February 4, 2018, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. As of February 4, 2018 , our corporate credit was rated Ba1 by Moody with a stable outlook and our issuer credit was rated BB+ by Standard & Poor with a positive outlook. In assessing our credit strength, we believe that both Moody and Standard & Poor considered, among other things, our capital structure and financial policies, our consolidated balance sheet, our historical acquisition activity and other financial information, as well as industry and other qualitative factors. Please refer to Note 8, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of our debt. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes, as of February 4, 2018 , our contractual cash obligations by future period: Payments Due by Period Description Total Obligations 2018 2019-2020 2021-2022 Thereafter (In millions) Long-term debt (1) $ 3,086 $ $ 273 $ 1,526 $ 1,287 Interest payments on long-term debt 564 103 201 111 149 Short-term borrowings 20 20 Operating and capital leases (2) 2,560 487 792 539 742 Inventory purchase commitments (3) 1,089 1,089 Minimum contractual royalty payments (4) 56 16 30 10 Non-qualified supplemental defined benefit plan (5) 11 1 2 2 6 Sponsorship and model payments (6) 55 26 20 9 Total contractual cash obligations $ 7,441 $ 1,742 $ 1,318 $ 2,197 $ 2,184 ______________________ (1) At February 4, 2018 , we had outstanding $1.799 billion under a senior secured Term Loan A facility, which requires mandatory payments through May 19, 2021 (according to the mandatory repayment schedules), $100 million of 7 3/4% debentures due November 15, 2023, $437 million of 3 5/8% senior unsecured euro notes due July 15, 2024 and $750 million of 3 1/8% senior unsecured euro notes due December 15, 2027. (2) Includes retail store, warehouse, showroom, office and equipment operating leases, as well as capital leases. Retail store operating leases generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts listed include future minimum lease payments and exclude such direct operating costs. Please see Note 16 , Leases , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information. 44 (3) Represents contractual commitments that are enforceable and legally binding for goods on order and not received or paid for as of February 4, 2018 . Inventory purchase commitments also include fabric commitments with our suppliers, which secure a portion of our material needs for future seasons.

This amount does not include foreign currency exchange forward contracts that we have entered into to manage our exposure to exchange rate changes with respect to certain of these purchases. Please see Note 10 , Derivative Financial Instruments , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information. (4) Our minimum contractual royalty payments arise under numerous license agreements we have with third parties, each of which has different terms. Agreements typically require us to make minimum payments to the licensors of the licensed trademarks based on expected or required minimum levels of sales of licensed products, as well as additional royalty payments based on a percentage of sales when our sales exceed such minimum sales. Certain of our license agreements require that we pay a specified percentage of net sales to the licensor for advertising and promotion of the licensed products, in some cases requiring a minimum amount to be paid. Any advertising payments, with the exception of minimum payments to licensors, are excluded from the minimum contractual royalty payments shown in the table. There is no guarantee that we will exceed the minimum payments under any of these license agreements. However, given our projected sales levels for products covered under these agreements, we currently anticipate that future payments required under our license agreements on an aggregate basis will exceed the contractual minimums shown in the table. (5) We have an unfunded, non-qualified supplemental defined benefit plan covering certain retired executives under which the participants will receive a predetermined amount during the 10 years following the attainment of age 65, provided that prior to the termination of employment with us, the participant has been in such plan for at least 10 years and has attained age 55. (6) Represents payment obligations for sponsorships. We have agreements relating to our sponsorship of the Barclays Center, the Brooklyn Nets and certain other professional sports teams and athletes and other similar sponsorships, as well as agreements with celebrities, models and stylists. Not included in the above table are contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans, or payments to employees and retirees in connection with our unfunded supplemental executive retirement, supplemental pension and postretirement health plans. Contractual cash obligations for these plans cannot be determined due to the number of assumptions required to estimate our future benefit obligations, including return on assets, discount rate and future compensation increases. The liabilities associated with these plans, together with the liability for the non-qualified supplemental defined benefit plans included in the above table, are presented in Note 12 , Retirement and Benefit Plans , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. Currently, we do not expect to make any material contributions to our pension plans in 2018. Our actual contributions may differ from our planned contributions due to many factors, including changes in tax and other benefit laws, or significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates. Not included in the above table are $212 million of net potential cash obligations associated with uncertain tax positions due to the uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows associated with such obligations. Please see Note 9 , Income Taxes , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information related to uncertain tax positions. Not included in the above table are $27 million of asset retirement obligations related to leased office and retail store locations due to the uncertainty of timing of future cash outflows associated with such obligations. Please see Note 21 , Other Comments , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information related to asset retirement obligations. Not included in the above table are contractual royalty obligations related to our perpetual license agreement with Speedo International Limited. Under the terms of the agreement, our contractual minimum payments each year are $1 million, which is subject to annual increases based on the Consumer Price Index. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect, or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect, on our financial position, changes in financial position, revenue, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 45 MARKET RISK Financial instruments held by us as of February 4, 2018 include cash and cash equivalents, short-term borrowings, long-term debt, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements. Note 11 , Fair Value Measurements , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report outlines the fair value of our financial instruments as of February 4, 2018 . Cash and cash equivalents held by us are affected by short-term interest rates, which are currently low. Due to the currently low rates of return we are receiving on our cash and cash equivalents, the potential for a significant decrease in short-term interest rates is low and, therefore, a further decrease would not have a material impact on our interest income. However, there is potential for a more significant increase in short-term interest rates, which could have a more material impact on our interest income. Given our balance of cash and cash equivalents at February 4, 2018 , the effect of a 10 basis point change in short-term interest rates on our interest income would be approximately $500,000 annually. Borrowings under our 2016 facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus a variable rate. As such, our 2016 facilities expose us to market risk for changes in interest rates. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements for the intended purpose of reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility. As of February 4, 2018 , after taking into account the effect of our interest rate swap agreement that was in effect as of such date, approximately 60% of our long-term debt was at a fixed interest rate, with the remainder at variable interest rates. Given our debt position at February 4, 2018 , the effect of a 10 basis point change in interest rates on our variable interest expense would be approximately $1 million annually. Please refer to the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources above for further discussion of our credit facilities and interest rate swap agreements. Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses each have substantial international components that expose us to significant foreign exchange risk. Our Heritage Brands business also has international components, but those components are not significant to the business. Changes in exchange rates between the United States dollar and other currencies can impact our financial results in two ways: a translation impact and a transaction impact. The translation impact refers to the impact that changes in exchange rates can have on our financial results, as our operating results in local foreign currencies are translated into United States dollars using an average exchange rate over the representative period. Accordingly, our reported results of operations will be unfavorably impacted during times of a strengthening United States dollar, particularly against the euro, the Brazilian real, the Japanese yen, the Korean won, the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the Indian rupee, the Russian ruble and the Chinese yuan renminbi, and favorably impacted during times of a weakening United States dollar against those currencies. A transaction impact on financial results is common for apparel companies operating outside the United States that purchase goods in United States dollars, as is the case with most of our foreign operations. As with translation, our results of operations will be impacted as fluctuations of the United States dollar change the local currency value of inventory, which results in a change in the cost of goods in local currency when the goods are sold. We also have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to certain intercompany transactions and SG&A expenses. We currently use and plan to continue to use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to mitigate the cash flow or market value risks associated with these inventory and intercompany transactions, but we are unable to entirely eliminate these risks. The foreign currency forward exchange contracts cover at least 70% of the projected inventory purchases in United States dollars by our foreign subsidiaries. Given our foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at February 4, 2018, the effect of a 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates against the United States dollar would result in a change in the fair value of these contracts of approximately $100 million. Any change in the fair value of these contracts would be substantially offset by a change in the fair value of the underlying hedged items. As a result of the weakening of the United States dollar during 2017 against certain foreign currencies, particularly the euro and the Chinese yuan renminbi, we expect an increase in revenue and net income in 2018 as compared to 2017 due to the foreign exchange impact of approximately $230 million and $40 million, respectively, based on current exchange rates. 46 We also have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to the value of our investments in foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the United States dollar. To hedge against a portion of this exposure, we designated the carrying amount of our 950 million aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated senior notes that we had issued in the United States as net investment hedges of our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency. The effect of a 10% change in the euro against the United States dollar would result in a change in the fair value of the net investment hedges of approximately $120 million. Any change in the fair value of the net investment hedges would be more than offset by a change in the value of our investments in certain of our European subsidiaries. Additionally, we also have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our 950 million aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated senior notes. During times of a weakening United States dollar against the euro, we would be required to use a greater amount of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and make long-term debt repayments. Included in the calculations of expense and liabilities for our pension plans are various assumptions, including return on assets, discount rates, mortality rates and future compensation increases. Actual results could differ from these assumptions, which would require adjustments to our balance sheet and could result in volatility in our future pension expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 1% change in the assumed rate of return on assets would result in a change to 2018 net benefit cost related to the pension plans of approximately $6 million. Likewise, a 0.25% change in the assumed discount rate would result in a change to 2018 net benefit cost of approximately $31 million. SEASONALITY Our business generally follows a seasonal pattern. Our wholesale businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the first and third quarters, while our retail businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the fourth quarter. Royalty, advertising and other revenue tends to be earned somewhat evenly throughout the year, although the third quarter has the highest level of royalty revenue due to higher sales by licensees in advance of the holiday selling season. We expect this seasonal pattern will generally continue. Working capital requirements vary throughout the year to support these seasonal patterns and business trends. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Please refer to Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of recently issued and adopted accounting standards. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are outlined in Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. We believe that the following are the more critical judgmental areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial position and results of operations: Sales allowances and returns We have arrangements with many of our department and specialty store customers to support their sales of our products. We establish accruals which, based on a review of the individual customer arrangements and the expected performance of our products in their stores, we believe will be required to satisfy our sales allowance obligations. We also establish accruals, which are based on historical data, current sales trends and authorized amounts, that we believe are necessary to provide for sales allowances and inventory returns. Our historical accrual estimates have not differed materially from actual results. It is possible that the accrual estimates could vary from actual results, which would require adjustment to the allowance and returns accruals. Inventories Inventories are comprised principally of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, except for certain retail inventories in North America that are stated at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method. Cost for substantially all wholesale inventories in North America and certain wholesale and retail inventories in Asia and Latin America is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Cost for all other inventories is determined using the weighted average cost method. We review current business trends, inventory aging and discontinued merchandise categories to determine adjustments which we estimate will be needed to liquidate existing clearance inventories and record inventories at either the lower of cost or net realizable value or the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method, as applicable. We believe that all inventory writedowns required at February 4, 2018 have been recorded. Our 47 historical estimates of inventory reserves have not differed materially from actual results. If market conditions were to change, it is possible that the required level of inventory reserves would need to be adjusted. Asset impairments During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we determined that the long-lived assets in certain of our retail stores were not recoverable, which resulted in us recording impairment charges. In order to calculate the impairment charges, we estimated the undiscounted future cash flows and the related fair value of each asset. The undiscounted future cash flows for each asset were estimated using current sales trends and other factors. If different assumptions had been used for future sales trends, the recorded impairment charges could have been significantly higher or lower. Note 11 , Fair Value Measurements , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report includes further discussion of the circumstances surrounding the impairments and the assumptions related to the impairment charges. Allowance for doubtful accounts Trade receivables, as presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, are net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable and assessments of collectibility based on historic trends, the financial condition of our customers and an evaluation of economic conditions. Because we cannot predict future changes in economic conditions and in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates and could impact our allowance for doubtful accounts. Income taxes Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors. The actual realization of deferred tax assets may differ significantly from the amounts we have recorded. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Accounting for income taxes requires a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the tax position will be fully sustained upon review by taxing authorities, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For tax positions that are 50 percent or less likely of being sustained upon audit, we do not recognize any portion of that benefit in the financial statements. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Our actual results have differed materially in the past and could differ materially in the future from our current estimates. The Tax Legislation was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Legislation is comprehensive and significantly revises the United States tax code. The revisions expected to significantly impact us are (i) the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, including the resulting remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and the recognition of a valuation allowance on our foreign tax credits, (ii) the imposition of a one-time transition tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries deemed to be repatriated and (iii) the implementation of a modified territorial tax system. The Tax Legislation resulted in a one-time net tax benefit of $53 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, consisting of a benefit primarily from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities due to the reduction in the United States corporate tax rate, partially offset by a valuation allowance on our foreign tax credits and a transition tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries deemed to be repatriated. As we complete our analysis of the Tax Legislation, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance issued by the United States Department of the Treasury, the Internal Revenue Service and other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments in 2018 to the provisional amounts recorded in 2017 under the measurement period allowed by the SEC. Refer to Note 9, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of the impacts of the Tax Legislation. Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, at the beginning of the third quarter of each fiscal year, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment, called a component. However, two or more components of an operating segment will be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. 48 We assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a more detailed quantitative impairment test for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. We may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative test for any reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets. Qualitative factors that we consider as part of our assessment include a change in our market capitalization and its implied impact on reporting unit fair value, a change in our weighted average cost of capital, industry and market conditions, macroeconomic conditions, trends in product costs and financial performance of our businesses. If we perform the quantitative test for any reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets, we generally use a discounted cash flow method to estimate fair value. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of projected cash flows. Assumptions used in these cash flow projections are generally consistent with our internal forecasts. The estimated cash flows are discounted using a rate that represents our weighted average cost of capital. The weighted average cost of capital is based on a number of variables, including the equity-risk premium and risk-free interest rate. Management believes the assumptions used for the impairment tests are consistent with those that would be utilized by a market participant performing similar analysis and valuations. Adverse changes in future market conditions or weaker operating results compared to our expectations may impact our projected cash flows and estimates of weighted average cost of capital, which could result in a potential impairment charge if we are unable to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. For goodwill, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. For the 2017 and 2016 annual goodwill impairment tests, we elected to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it was necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. In evaluating whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, we assessed relevant events and circumstances including the change in our market capitalization and its implied impact on reporting unit fair value, a change in our weighted average cost of capital, industry and market conditions, macroeconomic conditions, trends in product costs and financial performance of our businesses. After assessing these events and circumstances, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount and concluded that the quantitative goodwill impairment test was not required. No impairment of goodwill resulted from either of our annual impairment tests in 2017 and 2016. We formed a joint venture in Mexico during the fourth quarter of 2016, subsequent to conducting the 2016 annual goodwill impairment test. The joint venture was formed by merging our wholly owned subsidiary that principally operated and managed the Calvin Klein business in Mexico with a wholly owned subsidiary of the joint venture partner. This resulted in the deconsolidation of our wholly owned subsidiary, including goodwill assigned to the business. This transaction was a triggering event that indicated that the amount of remaining goodwill allocated to the Calvin Klein North America Wholesale, Calvin Klein North America Retail and Heritage Brands Wholesale reporting units could be impaired, prompting the need for us to perform a goodwill impairment test for these reporting units in 2016. No goodwill impairment resulted from this interim test in 2016. For the 2017 and 2016 annual impairment tests of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets, we elected to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of any asset was less than its carrying amount. In performing this evaluation, we assessed relevant events and circumstances including industry and market conditions, a change in our weighted average cost of capital, macroeconomic conditions, trends in product costs and financial performance of our businesses. After assessing these events and circumstances, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of these certain indefinite-lived intangible assets were less than their carrying amount and concluded that the quantitative impairment test was not required. For certain other indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test using a discounted cash flow method to estimate fair value. No impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted from either of our annual impairment tests in 2017 and 2016. If different assumptions for our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests had been applied, significantly different outcomes could have resulted. There can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing performed in 2017 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. For example, if general macroeconomic conditions deteriorate or otherwise vary from current assumptions (including those resulting in changes in the weighted average cost of capital), industry or market conditions deteriorate, business conditions or strategies for a specific reporting unit change from current assumptions, including cost increases or loss of major customers, our businesses do not perform as projected, or there is an extended period of a significant decline in our stock price, this could be an indicator that the excess fair value of our reporting units could be lessened and the chance of an impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets could be raised. 49 Pension and Benefit Plans Pension and benefit plan expenses are recorded throughout the year based on calculations using actuarial valuations that incorporate estimates and assumptions that depend in part on financial market, economic and demographic conditions, including expected long-term rate of return on assets, discount rate and mortality rates. These assumptions require significant judgment. Actuarial gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from our actuarial assumptions, are recognized in the year in which they occur and could have a material impact on our operating results. These gains and losses are measured at least annually at the end of our fiscal year and, as such, are generally recorded during the fourth quarter of each year. The expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on historical returns and the level of risk premium associated with the asset classes in which the portfolio is invested as well as expectations for the long-term future returns of each asset class. The expected long-term rate of return for each asset class is then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio. The expected return on plan assets is recognized quarterly and determined by applying the long-term expected rate of return on assets to the actual fair value of plan assets adjusted for expected benefit payments, contributions and plan expenses. At the end of the year, the fair value of the assets is remeasured and any difference between the actual return on assets and the expected return is recorded in earnings as part of the actuarial gain or loss. The discount rate is determined based on current market interest rates. It is selected by constructing a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that matches the cash flows from interest payments and principal maturities of the portfolio to the timing of benefit payments to participants. The yield on such a portfolio is the basis for the selected discount rate. Service and interest cost is measured using the discount rate as of the beginning of the year, while the projected benefit obligation is measured using the discount rate as of the end of the year. The impact of the change in the discount rate on our projected benefit obligation is recorded in earnings as part of the actuarial gain or loss. During 2017 and 2016, we revised the mortality assumptions used to determine our benefit obligations based on recently published actuarial mortality tables. These changes in life expectancy resulted in changes to the period for which we expect benefits to be paid. In 2017, the increase in life expectancy increased our benefit obligations and future expense, and in 2016, the decrease in life expectancy decreased our benefit obligations and future expense. We also periodically review and revise, as necessary, other plan assumptions such as rates of compensation increases, retirement, and termination based on historical experience and anticipated future management actions. We have not historically had significant adjustments to these assumptions. Actual results could differ from these assumptions, which would require adjustments to our balance sheet and could result in volatility in our future net benefit cost. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 1% change in the assumed rate of return on assets would result in a change to 2018 net benefit cost related to the pension plans of approximately $6 million. Likewise, a 0.25% change in the assumed discount rate would result in a change to 2018 net benefit cost of approximately $31 million. Note 12 , Retirement and Benefit Plans , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report sets forth certain significant rate assumptions and information regarding our target asset allocation, which are used in performing calculations related to our pension plans. Stock-based compensation Accounting for stock-based compensation requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation cost over the service period for awards expected to vest. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock options. This model uses assumptions that include the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of the options. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of our stock options and restricted stock units is recognized as expense over the service period, net of actual forfeitures. The fair value of contingently issuable performance shares that are subject to market conditions is established using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Certain contingently issuable performance shares that are subject to market conditions are also subject to a holding period of one year after the vesting date. For such awards, the grant date fair value is discounted for the restriction of liquidity, which is calculated using the Chaffe model. We record expense for the awards that are subject to market conditions ratably over the vesting period, net of actual forfeitures, regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied. 50
