ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Company consolidated financial statements. OVERVIEW The Company develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of consumer and specialty products. It recognizes revenues and profits from selling its products under a variety of brands to supermarkets, drug stores and mass merchandisers that sell the products to consumers. The Company also sells its products to industrial customers and distributors. The Company focuses its marketing efforts principally on its eight power brands. These well-recognized brand names include ARM & HAMMER, (used in multiple product categories such as baking soda, carpet deodorization and laundry detergent), TROJAN condoms, XTRA laundry detergent, OXICLEAN pre-wash laundry additive, NAIR depilatories, FIRST RESPONSE home pregnancy and ovulation test kits, ORAJEL oral analgesics and SPINBRUSH battery-operated toothbrushes. The Company business is divided into three primary segments, Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and Specialty Products. The Consumer Domestic segment includes the eight power brands and other household and personal care products such as SCRUB FREE, KABOOM, ORANGE GLO and BRILLO cleaning products, ANSWER home pregnancy and ovulation test kits, ARRID antiperspirant, CLOSE-UP and AIM toothpastes. The Consumer International segment primarily sells a variety of personal care products, some of which use the same brand names as our domestic product lines, in international markets, including France, the United Kingdom, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Brazil and China. The Specialty Products segment is the largest U.S. producer of sodium bicarbonate, which it sells together with other specialty inorganic chemicals for a variety of industrial, institutional, medical and food applications. This segment also sells a range of animal nutrition and specialty cleaning products. In 2009, the Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and Specialty Products segments represented approximately 74%, 16% and 10%, respectively, of the Company net sales. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company completed construction of its integrated laundry detergent manufacturing plant and distribution center in York, Pennsylvania. In conjunction with the opening of the new facility, the Company closed its existing laundry detergent manufacturing plant and distribution facility in North Brunswick, New Jersey. The North Brunswick facility was comprised of five separate buildings, which had resulted in significant inefficiencies and could not accommodate expansion to address expected future growth. In September 2009, the Company and Abbott Laboratories, Inc. ( Abbott ) agreed to settle patent infringement litigation. As part of the settlement, Abbott paid $27 million to the Company. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain, net of legal expenses, of $20.0 million as of September 2009, which is reflected in the results of the Consumer Domestic segment. In June 2009, the Company sold certain non-core personal care product lines acquired in the Orajel Acquisition for approximately $30 million, net of fees, which approximated book value. The results of these product lines were included in both the Consumer Domestic and Consumer International Segments during the period from July 2008 until the completion of the sale in June 2009. Continuing a trend that began in 2005, the cost of raw materials in 2009 began at historical highs, although by the end of 2009 the cost of many of these raw materials retreated from these highs. As a result the cost of surfactants, diesel fuel, corrugated paper and oil-based raw and packaging materials used in the household and specialty products businesses were all lower at the end of 2009 than the 2008 average. Moreover, the price of palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD), which generally fluctuates with the price of global vegetable oil, was on average at the same level as 2008 but had fallen by the end of 2009. The Company also benefitted in 2009 from savings realized in cost improvement programs. Despite a second half reduction in the cost of most commodities, some commodities continued to rise in price, such as soda ash. Additional increases in the prices of certain raw materials could further materially impact the Company costs and financial results if the Company is unable to pass such costs along in the form of price increases to its customers. 22 Table of Contents The Company operates in highly competitive consumer product markets, in which cost efficiency, new product offerings and innovation are critical to success. The consumer products markets are particularly mature in North America and are characterized by high household penetration, particularly with respect to the Company most significant product categories such as laundry detergents and oral care. Furthermore, because of ongoing retail sector consolidation and the competitive environment facing retailers, the Company faces pricing pressure from these customers, particularly the high-volume retail store customers, which increasingly have sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms. To protect its existing market share or to capture additional market share, the Company increased expenditures for promotions and advertising and introduced new products and line extensions. In order to fund the additional marketing expenses, the Company has and continues to pursue ongoing cost cutting initiatives. As a result of its acquisitions and cost improvement initiatives, the Company has been able to lower its overall unit costs and increase the productivity of its various manufacturing facilities. Uncertainty about current global economic conditions has affected demand for many products. Factors that can affect demand include rates of unemployment, consumer confidence, health care costs, fuel and other energy costs and other economic factors affecting consumer spending behavior. While the Company products generally are consumer staples that should be less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products, they may become subject to increasing price competition as recessionary conditions continue. Moreover, some of our products, such as laundry additives and battery-operated toothbrushes, are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending. Some of our customers, including mass merchandisers, supermarkets, drugstores, convenience stores, wholesale clubs, pet specialty stores and dollar stores have experienced declining financial performance, which could affect their ability to pay amounts due to us on a timely basis or at all. In response, we regularly conduct a review of the financial strength of our key customers. As appropriate, we modify customer credit limits, which may have an adverse impact on future sales. We also regularly conduct a similar review of our suppliers to assess both their financial viability and the importance of their products to our operations. Where appropriate, we intend to identify alternate sources of materials and services. To date, we have not experienced a material adverse impact from economic conditions affecting our customers or suppliers. However, a continued economic decline that adversely affects our suppliers and customers could adversely affect our operations and sales. In addition many of our trade customers sell products under their own private label brand that compete with products that we sell. As consumers look for opportunities to decrease discretionary spending during current difficult economic times, our trade customers may discontinue or reduce distribution of our products to encourage those consumers to purchase their less expensive private label products. To offset the adverse effect that results when some of our products are discontinued or are adversely affected by our trade customers actions to increase shelf space for their private label products, we focus our efforts on improving distribution with other customers. Our results could be adversely affected if these efforts are not effective. During 2009, one of the Company international facilities discharged chemicals into the environment. The Company currently is developing a formal remediation plan, and based on available information, accrued approximately $3 million for remediation and related costs. However, we cannot assure that additional costs will not be incurred in connection with this matter. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Company Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. By their nature, these judgments are subject to uncertainty. They are based on our historical experience, our observation of trends in industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. The Company significant accounting policies and estimates are described below. 23 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition and Promotional and Sales Return Reserves Virtually all of the Company revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when delivered or picked up by our customers. The reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date. Promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives, such as coupons to consumers, and sales incentives provided to customers (such as slotting, cooperative advertising, incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements made directly with customers). All such costs are netted against sales. Slotting costs are recorded when the product is delivered to the customer. Cooperative advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for the Company products. Discounts relating to price reduction arrangements are recorded when the related sale takes place. Costs associated with end-aisle or other in-store displays are recorded when product that is subject to the promotion is sold. The Company relies on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves. For example, the Company uses historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements. Based on the total face value of Consumer Domestic coupons redeemed over the past several years, if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by 0.1% from the rate for which reserves are accrued in the financial statements, an approximately $1.7 million difference in the reserve required for coupons would result. With regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns, the Company uses experience-based estimates, customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required. If the Company estimates for promotional activities and sales returns were to change by 10% the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately $5.5 million. While management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made, estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company reduced promotion liabilities by approximately $7.8 million, $4.0 million and $5.4 million, respectively, based on a change in estimate as a result of actual experience and updated information. Impairment of goodwill, trademarks and other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment Carrying values of goodwill, trademarks and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. The Company impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to unit volume, revenue and expense growth rates, and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions. With respect to goodwill, impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit. For trademarks and other intangible assets, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows, which represents the estimated fair value of the asset. The Company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations. Indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological change, distribution losses, or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired. The Company recognized tradename impairment charges within selling, general and administrative expenses for the three year period ended December 31, 2009 as follows: (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Segments: Consumer Domestic $ $ 1.9 $ Consumer International 3.8 4.2 Total $ $ 5.7 $ 4.2 24 Table of Contents The tradename impairment charges recorded in 2008 were a result of management decision to exit a business, a potential change of a brand name, lost distribution at key customer accounts and reduced profitability. The impairment charges in 2007 are also due to lost distribution at key customer accounts and reduced profitability. The amount of the impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying amount. Fair value was estimated based on a relief from royalty discounted cash flow method, which contains numerous variables that are subject to change as business conditions change, and therefore could impact fair values in the future. Under this method, the owner of an intangible asset must determine the arm length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license that asset from a third party. The Company determined that the remaining carrying value of all tradenames was recoverable based upon the forecasted cash flows and profitability of the brands. Property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment in accordance with ASC Subtopic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment. The Company impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the long-lived assets are largely independent of other groups of Company assets and liabilities. The analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology, the continued success of product lines, and future volume, revenue and expense growth rates. The Company conducts annual reviews to identify idle and underutilized equipment, and reviews business plans for possible impairment implications. Impairment occurs when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows. When an impairment is indicated, the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows. The Company recognized charges related to equipment obsolescence, which occurs in the ordinary course of business, and plant impairment charges during the three year period ended December 31, 2009 as follows: (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Segments: Consumer Domestic $ 3.2 $ 3.4 $ 2.8 Consumer International 0.1 0.4 Specialty Products 6.9 0.1 0.1 Total $ 10.1 $ 3.6 $ 3.3 In 2009, the Company recorded a plant asset impairment charge of approximately $6.9 million, representing the carrying value of the related assets, associated with one of its international subsidiaries. The Company measured the impairment charge using the discounted cash flow method. This subsidiary manufactures some products that compete with imports priced in U.S. dollars. As the dollar has weakened, it has been necessary to lower prices in the local currency to stay competitive, leading to negative cash flows, which is the key input under the discounted cash flow method. The charge is included in cost of sales in the Specialty Products Division segment income statement. The $3.2 million charge recorded in the Consumer Domestic Segment in 2009 is primarily a result of a lack of acceptance of certain products by our key customers that resulted in a decline of forecasted future cash flows and reduced profitability. The charges in 2008 and 2007 are due to the idling of certain equipment. The estimates and assumptions used in connection with impairment analyses are consistent with the business plans and estimates that the Company uses to manage its business operations. Nevertheless, future outcomes may differ materially from management estimates. If the Company products fail to achieve estimated volume and pricing targets, market conditions unfavorably change or other significant estimates are not realized, then the Company revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved, and the Company may be required to recognize additional impairment charges. 25 Table of Contents Inventory valuation When appropriate, the Company writes down the carrying value of its inventory to the lower of cost or market (net realizable value, which reflects any costs to sell or dispose). The Company identifies any slow moving, obsolete or excess inventory to determine whether an adjustment is needed. The determination of whether inventory items are slow moving, obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates and assumptions about the future demand for the Company products, technological changes, and new product introductions. In addition, the Company allowance for obsolescence may be impacted by the reduction of the number of stock keeping units ( SKUs ). The Company evaluates its inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis and records adjustments as required. Adjustments to inventory to reflect a reduction in net realizable value were $8.8 million at December 31, 2009, and $10.7 million at December 31, 2008. Valuation of pension and postretirement benefit costs The Company pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the Company to its actuaries, including the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Material changes in the Company pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets. The discount rate is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bond indices. Based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for the Company pension plans and postretirement plans, the Company refers to an applicable index and expected term of benefit payments to select a discount rate at which it believes the pension benefits could be effectively settled. Based on the published rate as of December 31, 2009 that matched estimated cash flows for the plans, the Company used a discount rate of 5.75% for its domestic plan. The Company weighted average discount rate for all pension plans as of December 31, 2009 is 5.76% as compared to 6.58% used at December 31, 2008. The expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account a historical trend, the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for the plans, the asset mix of the plans, and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation. Based on these factors, the Company weighted average expected long-term rate of return for 2009 was 6.72%, a decrease of almost 50 basis points from the 7.21% rate used in 2008. A 50 basis point change in the expected long-term rate of return would result in less than a $0.6 million change in pension expense for 2010. As noted above, changes in assumptions used by management may result in material changes in the Company pension and postretirement benefit costs. In 2009, other comprehensive income reflected a $5.7 million increase in pension plan obligations and a $0.5 million decrease for postretirement benefit plans. The changes are primarily related to the change in discount rates for all plans. The Company made cash contributions of approximately $7.4 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2009. The Company estimates it will be required to make cash contributions to its pension plans of approximately $1.8 million in 2010. On January 27, 2010, the Company Board of Directors approved the termination, effective April 15, 2010, of the domestic defined benefit pension plan, under which approximately 766 participants, including 46 active employees, have accrued benefits. The Company anticipates completing the termination of this plan in late 2010 or early 2011, once regulatory approvals are obtained. To effect the termination, the Company estimates, based on December 31, 2009 valuations, that it will be required to contribute approximately $11 million to $14 million to the plan, primarily to enable the plan to purchase annuities to provide for accrued benefits. The Company estimates that a one-time expense of approximately $20 million to $23 million will be incurred when the annuities are purchased. This expense is primarily attributable to pension settlement accounting rules that require accelerated recognition of actuarial losses that previously were to be amortized over the expected benefit lives of participants. The contributions and expense are subject to change based on the valuations at the actual date of settlement. 26 Table of Contents Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Management provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for amounts which are not considered more likely than not to be realized. The Company records liabilities for potential assessments in various tax jurisdictions under ASC Subtopic 740-10, Income Taxes. The liabilities relate to tax return positions that, although supportable by the Company, may be challenged by the tax authorities. The Company adjusts this liability as a result of changes in tax legislation, interpretations of laws by courts, rulings by tax authorities, changes in estimates and the expiration of the statute of limitations. Many of the judgments involved in adjusting the liability involve assumptions and estimates that are highly uncertain and subject to change. In this regard, settlement of any issue, or an adverse determination in litigation, with a taxing authority could require the use of cash and result in an increase in our annual tax rate. Conversely, favorable resolution of an issue with a taxing authority would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate. The Company policy for recording interest associated with income tax examinations is to record interest as a component of Income before Income Taxes. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles . Topic 105 establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (the ASC ) as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). ASC Topic 105 is effective for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The Company adopted ASC Topic 105 in the third quarter of 2009 and, accordingly, updated GAAP references are to the Codification. The Codification is not intended to change or alter existing GAAP and adoption of the Codification had no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In June 2009, the FASB amended ASC Subtopic 810-10, Consolidation. The amendments (1) require an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity (which would result in the enterprise being deemed the primary beneficiary of that entity and, therefore, obligated to consolidate the variable interest entity in its financial statements); (2) require ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity; (3) revise guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity; and (4) require enhanced disclosures that will provide more transparent information about an enterprise involvement with a variable interest entity. The Subtopic is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after November 15, 2009 and for interim periods within that first annual reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. In May 2009, the FASB issued ASC Subtopic 855-10, Subsequent Events , which provides general standards of accounting for and disclosure of subsequent events. ASC Subtopic 855-10 clarifies that public companies must evaluate, as of each reporting period (i.e. interim and annual), events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date through the date that the financial statements are issued. It also requires public companies to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated and whether that is the date on which the financial statements were issued. ASC Subtopic 855-10 became effective prospectively for interim or annual financial periods ending after June 15, 2009. The Company adopted ASC Subtopic 855-10 in the second quarter of 2009 (see Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report). 27 Table of Contents In April 2009, the FASB amended ASC Subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments , which requires quarterly disclosure of information about the fair value of financial instruments. The Company adopted ASC Subtopic 825-10 effective as of the second quarter of 2009. In December 2008, the FASB amended ASC Subtopic 715-20, Compensation Retirement Benefits: Defined Benefit . ASC Subtopic 715-20, as so amended, requires employers to disclose information about fair value measurements of plan assets that are similar to the disclosures about fair value measurements required by ASC Subtopic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures . The Company adopted ASC Subtopic 715-20 with respect to the Company annual financial statements for 2009. In March 2008, the FASB issued ASC Subtopic 815-10, Derivatives and Hedging . This subtopic requires enhanced disclosures about (i) how and why the Company uses derivative instruments, (ii) how the Company accounts for derivative instruments and related hedged items under Subtopic 815-20, Derivatives and Hedging: Hedging , and (iii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the Company financial results. The Company adopted this subtopic on January 1, 2009. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding the Company risk management activities, including use of derivative instruments and hedging activities. In December 2007, the FASB revised ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations . The revised Topic requires use of the acquisition method of accounting, defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination, establishes the acquisition date as the date the acquirer obtains control and broadens the scope of the Topic to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses. The Company adopted ASC Topic 805 on January 1, 2009 and the Topic did not have an impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 AND 2007 The discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level presented below is followed by a more detailed discussion of results of operations by segment. The discussion of the Company consolidated results of operations and segment operating results is presented on a historical basis for the years ending December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007. The segment discussion also addresses certain product line information. The Company reporting units are consistent with its reportable segments. Consolidated results 2009 compared to 2008 Net Sales Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $2,520.9 million, $98.5 million or approximately 4% above 2008 net sales. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations reduced sales in 2009 by 2%. Of the increase, approximately 2% is due to sales in the first half of 2009 of products acquired in connection with the July 2008 Orajel Acquisition. The balance of the increase in net sales is due primarily to higher prices and improved sales mix of approximately 3% and higher volumes of approximately 2%. These factors were offset in part by the reduction in sales resulting from the divestiture in the first quarter of 2008 of Brotherton Speciality Products Ltd. ( Brotherton ), a former United Kingdom subsidiary that was included in the Company Specialty Products Division, the third quarter 2009 divestiture of certain non-core product lines acquired in the Orajel Acquisition and the third quarter 2008 divestiture of the Company consumer products subsidiary in Spain. Operating Costs The Company gross profit was $1,101.0 million in 2009, a $129.3 million increase as compared to 2008. Gross margin increased 360 basis points to 43.7% as compared to 40.1% in 2008. The increase in gross margin reflects lower commodity costs, the impact of price increases instituted in 2008, the benefits of cost reduction 28 Table of Contents programs and the higher margins associated with sales of products related to the Orajel Acquisition. The gross profit increase was partially offset by increased costs related to the planned closing of the Company North Brunswick, New Jersey manufacturing and warehousing facility, a fixed asset impairment charge of $6.9 million at an international subsidiary in 2009, and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Marketing expenses for 2009 were $353.6 million, an increase of $59.5 million or 20% as compared to 2008. The increased marketing spending included expenditures in support of ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, OXICLEAN powder and liquid laundry additives, TROJAN condoms and vibrating products, SPINBRUSH battery-operated toothbrushes, ARM & HAMMER baking soda and ARM & HAMMER DENTAL CARE, and expenditures for products acquired in the Orajel Acquisition, partially offset by the effect of foreign exchange rates. Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A ) were $354.5 million in 2009, an increase of $17.3 million as compared to 2008. The increase in SG&A in 2009 reflects increases in compensation and information systems costs, as well as higher amortization and operating costs related to the Orajel Acquisition, partially offset by lower international costs due in part to favorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, 2008 SG&A reflected charges related to the divestiture of the Spain subsidiary and the associated asset impairment charges of $5.7 million, offset by the $3.0 million gain on the divestiture of Brotherton. The consolidated statement of income for 2009 reflects the $20.0 million pre-tax gain, net of legal expenses, recognized by the Company in connection with the settlement of its litigation against Abbott Laboratories (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information). Other Income and Expenses In 2009, equity in earnings of affiliates was $12.1 million as compared to $11.3 million in 2008. The changes primarily reflect improved profitability of Armand Products Company. Other income was approximately $1.5 million in 2009 as compared to other expense of $3.2 million in 2008. The changes in both years principally reflect foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Interest expense for 2009 decreased $11.4 million compared to 2008. The decline was due to lower interest rates compared to the prior year. Investment earnings of $1.3 million were lower due to a significant decline in interest rates. Taxation The 2009 tax rate was 37.9% as compared to 36.7% in 2008. The 2009 tax rate reflects higher U.S. taxable income, which carries a higher effective tax rate than our foreign entities. The 2008 tax rate reflects a tax benefit of $4.0 million related to the divestiture of the subsidiary in Spain, partially offset by non-deductible losses in Company owned life insurance. Consolidated results 2008 compared to 2007 Net Sales Net Sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $2,422.4 million, an increase of $201.5 million or 9.1% above 2007 net sales. Of the increase, 1.6% is due to sales of products acquired in the Orajel Acquisition, partially offset by the loss of sales due to the divestiture in the first quarter of 2008 of Brotherton Speciality Products, Ltd. ( Brotherton ), a United Kingdom Specialty Products subsidiary and the third quarter 2008 divestiture of the Company consumer products subsidiary in Spain. Foreign exchange did not have a material impact for the full 2008 year. The remainder of the increase is approximately equally attributable to higher volumes and higher selling prices. 29 Table of Contents Operating Costs The Company gross profit was $971.7 million during 2008, a $103.8 million increase as compared to 2007. Gross margin increased 100 basis points to 40.1% as compared to 39.1% in 2007. The increase in gross margin reflects price increases, cost reduction programs, the effect of the liquid laundry detergent concentration, the higher margins associated with the sales of products relating to the Orajel Acquisition, and the completion of the manufacturing synergies relating to the businesses acquired from Orange Glo International, Inc. ( OGI ) in 2006. These factors were partially offset by higher commodity costs and hedging losses due to declining diesel prices. In addition, the gross profit increase was partially offset by $10.2 million related to the decision to close an existing manufacturing facility (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report). Marketing expenses for 2008 were $294.1 million, an increase of $37.4 million as compared to 2007. The increase principally was directed to acquired businesses and certain household products. Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A ) for 2008 were $337.3 million, an increase of $31.1 million as compared to 2007, but unchanged as a percent of net sales. The primary reasons for the increase in SG&A were operating expenses related to the Orajel Acquisition, $5.7 million of tradename impairment charges, exit costs associated with selling the Company subsidiary in Spain, higher legal costs including litigation against Abbott Laboratories (see Note 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report), higher research and development costs in support of new products and higher selling expenses in support of higher sales. The current year increase was partially offset by the $3.0 million gain recorded on the divestiture of Brotherton. The prior year results include a $3.3 million gain on the sale of certain property owned by the Company Canadian subsidiary and intangible asset impairment charges of $4.2 million. Other Income and Expenses In 2008, equity in earnings of affiliates was $11.3 million as compared to $8.2 million in 2007, primarily associated with improved profitability of Armand Products. Other expense was approximately $3.2 million in 2008 as compared to other income of $2.5 million in 2007. The changes in both years principally reflect foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Interest expense in 2008 decreased by $11.9 million as compared to 2007. The decline was due to lower interest rates and lower average debt outstanding compared to the prior year. In July 2008, the Company incurred additional indebtedness as a result of the Orajel Acquisition; however, this indebtedness was offset by reductions in indebtedness resulting from the conversion of all but a nominal amount of the Company convertible debt into common stock in the third quarter of 2008, the reduction of most of the outstanding amounts under of the Company accounts receivable securitization facility and mandatory repayments under the Company term loan. Taxation The 2008 tax rate was 36.7% as compared to 36.2% in 2007. The 2008 tax rate reflects higher U.S. taxable income, a higher state tax rate and non-deductible losses in Company owned life insurance, partially offset by a tax benefit of $4.0 million related to the divestiture of the subsidiary in Spain. The 2007 tax rate reflects a charge of $3.2 million, relating to a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets for one of the Company foreign subsidiaries and also reflects a $1.8 million benefit due to the reduction of tax liabilities in the U.K. and Australia. 30 Table of Contents Segment results for 2009, 2008 and 2007 The Company operates three reportable segments: Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and Specialty Products Division ( SPD ). These segments are determined based on differences in the nature of products and organizational and ownership structures. The Company also has a Corporate segment. Segment Products Consumer Domestic Household and personal care products Consumer International Primarily personal care products SPD Specialty chemical products The Corporate segment income consists of equity in earnings of affiliates. The Company had 50% ownership interests in Armand Products Company ( Armand ) and The ArmaKleen Company ( ArmaKleen ) as of December 31, 2009. The Company 50% ownership interest in Esseco U.K. LLP ( Esseco ) was divested in the first quarter of 2008 as part of the sale of Brotherton. The Company equity in earnings of Armand and ArmaKleen for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, and Esseco for the two months ended February 29, 2008 (prior to the sale of Brotherton), is included in the Corporate segment. Some of the subsidiaries that are included in the Consumer International segment manufacture and sell personal care products to the Consumer Domestic segment. These sales are eliminated from the Consumer International segment results set forth below. The domestic results of operations for the OGI business and the businesses acquired in the Orajel Acquisition are included in the Consumer Domestic segment. The results of operations for the foreign operations of the OGI business and the businesses acquired in the Orajel Acquisition are included in the Consumer International segment. Segment sales and income before taxes and minority interest for each of the three years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: (In thousands) Consumer Domestic Consumer International (3) SPD Corporate Total Net Sales (1) 2009 $ 1,881,748 $ 393,696 $ 245,478 $ $ 2,520,922 2008 1,716,801 420,192 285,405 2,422,398 2007 1,563,895 398,521 258,524 2,220,940 Income Before Income Taxes (2) 2009 $ 325,633 $ 38,562 $ 15,991 $ 12,050 $ 392,236 2008 236,956 34,635 25,335 11,334 308,260 2007 205,688 34,656 16,351 8,236 264,931 (1) Intersegment sales from Consumer International to Consumer Domestic, which are not reflected in the table, were $3.0 million, $5.2 million and $5.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. (2) In determining Income before Income Taxes, interest expense, investment earnings, and other income (expense) were allocated among the segments based upon each segment relative operating profit. (3) As of January 1, 2008, the Company modified its organizational structure, resulting in a change in classification of certain Consumer Domestic export sales to Consumer International. Therefore, 2007 results have been restated to reflect a reclassification in sales of $10.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, from the Consumer Domestic segment to the Consumer International segment. In addition, Income before Income Taxes of $1.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, has been reclassified from the Consumer Domestic segment to the Consumer International segment. 31 Table of Contents Product line revenues for external customers for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: (In thousands) 2009 2008 2007 Household Products $ 1,196,474 $ 1,081,440 $ 991,141 Personal Care Products 685,274 635,361 572,754 Total Consumer Domestic 1,881,748 1,716,801 1,563,895 Total Consumer International 393,696 420,192 398,521 Total SPD 245,478 285,405 258,524 Total Consolidated Net Sales $ 2,520,922 $ 2,422,398 $ 2,220,940 Consumer Domestic 2009 compared to 2008 Consumer Domestic net sales in 2009 were $1,881.7 million, an increase of $164.9 million or 9.6% compared to net sales of $1,716.8 million in 2008. Of the increase, approximately 2% reflects first half of 2009 sales of products acquired in connection with the July 2008 Orajel Acquisition. The increase also is attributable to higher volumes and higher prices and improved sales mix. At a product line level, sales of XTRA liquid laundry detergent, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, OXICLEAN laundry additive, ARM & HAMMER SUPER SCOOP cat litter and ARM & HAMMER powder laundry detergent were all higher than in 2008. The higher prices are principally a result of the May 2008 price increase on ARM & HAMMER powder laundry detergent and the October 2008 price increase on liquid laundry detergents, toothpaste and battery-operated toothbrushes. Consumer Domestic Income before Income Taxes for 2009 was $325.6 million, an $88.6 million increase as compared to 2008. The 2009 increase is due to higher profits relating to higher net sales, lower commodity costs, the $20.0 million gain, net of legal expenses, recognized by the Company in connection with the settlement of its litigation against Abbott Laboratories (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report), and lower allocated interest expense, partially offset by accelerated depreciation and other expenses associated with the Company 2009 shutdown of its North Brunswick, New Jersey facility (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report), and increased marketing and SG&A costs. In addition, the results for 2009 also reflect the incremental effect of the Orajel acquisition, which occurred in July 2008. 2008 compared to 2007 Consumer Domestic net sales in 2008 were $1,716.8 million, an increase of $152.9 million or 9.8% as compared to 2007 sales of $1,563.9 million . Of the increase, approximately 3% relates to sales of products acquired in the Orajel Acquisition, with the remainder mostly attributable to higher unit volumes and the balance due to higher prices. At a product line level, sales of XTRA liquid laundry detergent, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, OXICLEAN laundry additive, ARM & HAMMER powder laundry detergent and ARM & HAMMER SUPER SCOOP cat litter were all higher than in 2007. Consumer Domestic net sales also benefited from February 2008 price increases on condoms and baking soda and the May 2008 price increases on ARM & HAMMER powder laundry detergent. The Company also implemented several price increases in the United States during the fourth quarter of 2008, including ARM & HAMMER Liquid Laundry Detergent, XTRA Liquid Laundry Detergent, OXICLEAN Powder, SPINBRUSH and ARM & HAMMER Dental Care. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of KABOOM household cleaner, certain toothpaste brands and antiperspirants. Consumer Domestic Income before Income Taxes for 2008 was $237.0 million, a $31.3 million increase as compared to 2007. The impact of higher net sales, synergies related to the manufacturing integration of the OGI business, the shift to concentrated liquid laundry detergent, the Orajel Acquisition and lower allocated interest 32 Table of Contents expense, was partially offset by accelerated depreciation and other expenses associated with the Company planned 2009 shutdown of its North Brunswick New Jersey facility (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report), higher commodity, marketing and SG&A costs and hedging losses due to declining diesel prices. Consumer International 2009 compared to 2008 Consumer International net sales in 2009 were $393.7 million, a decrease of $26.5 million or 6.3% as compared to 2008. This decrease reflects the approximately 10% impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and approximately 2% due to the divestiture of the Company subsidiary in Spain. This decline was partially offset by higher volumes, higher prices and improved sales mix in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Mexico and Brazil, and increased U.S. exports. Consumer International income before income taxes was $38.6 million in 2009, an increase of $3.9 million compared to 2008. This increase is due to higher income associated with higher unit volume and favorable sales mix partially offset by higher marketing and SG&A expenses and the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, 2008 income before income taxes reflected charges related to the sale of the subsidiary in Spain. 2008 compared to 2007 Consumer International net sales were $420.2 million in 2008, an increase of $21.7 million or approximately 5.4% as compared to 2007. The increase includes the impact of favorable foreign exchange rates of 1.5%, higher unit volumes in Canada, England, Australia and higher U.S. exports, partially offset by lower sales in France and the impact of divesting the subsidiary in Spain. Consumer International Income before Income Taxes was $34.6 million in 2008, unchanged as compared to 2007. Offsetting the favorable net sales performance and lower allocated interest expense were asset impairment charges of $5.9 million, severance and contract termination costs in one of the Company European subsidiaries, increased tradename amortization expense as a result of the recharacterization of certain indefinite lived assets to finite lived assets (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report) and the $3.5 million pre-tax loss on the sale of the Company Spanish subsidiary in 2008. In addition, 2007 reflects a gain of $3.3 million on the sale of certain property owned by the Company Canadian subsidiary. Specialty Products 2009 compared to 2008 Specialty Products net sales were $245.5 million for 2009, a decrease of $39.9 million, or 14.0% as compared to 2008. Volumes declined in the animal nutrition business primarily due to the continued lower U.S. milk prices which has depressed the dairy market, thus reducing the cash flow of dairy farmers. The decrease in net sales also reflects the approximately 2% impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the impact of the sale of Brotherton during the first quarter of 2008. These factors were partially offset by higher prices and favorable sales mix of approximately 7% primarily of certain specialty chemical products. Specialty Products Income before Income Taxes for 2009 was $16.0 million, a decrease of $9.3 million as compared to 2008. The decline in income in 2009 reflects the asset impairment charge and environmental remediation charge at one of the Company international subsidiaries totaling approximately $9.9 million, and lower income due to lower volumes. The results for 2008 included a $3.0 million gain associated with the sale of Brotherton. 33 Table of Contents 2008 compared to 2007 Specialty Products net sales were $285.4 million in 2008, an increase of $26.9 million or 10.4% as compared to 2007. This increase is principally due to higher prices. The animal nutrition sales increase also reflects a pricing surcharge on certain products first applied during 2007 to recover extraordinary cost increases for a key raw material. Partially offsetting the sales increase was the impact of divesting the Company Brotherton subsidiary. Specialty Products Income before Income Taxes was $25.3 million in the 2008, an increase of $9.0 million as compared to 2007. The increase is principally the result of profits on higher net sales and the $3.0 million gain on the sale of Brotherton, partially offset by higher raw material costs for certain animal nutrition and specialty chemical products and higher SG&A. Liquidity and capital resources As of December 31, 2009, the Company had $447.1 million in cash, $85.0 million available through its $115.0 million accounts receivable securitization facility, approximately $96 million available under its $100.0 million revolving credit facility and a $250.0 million accordion feature that enables the Company to increase the principal amount of its term loan. To enhance the safety of its cash resources, the Company invests its cash primarily in government agency money market funds. The Company renewed its accounts receivable securitization facility in February 2010. This facility has been renewed annually in the past, and the Company anticipates that this facility will be renewed in February 2011. The Company believes that its ability to access the sources of cash described above has not been adversely affected by recent economic events. Therefore, the Company currently does not anticipate that the credit environment will have a material adverse effect on its ability to address its current and forecasted liquidity requirements. The Company anticipates that its cash from operations, along with its current borrowing capacity, will be sufficient to meet its capital expenditure program costs, mandatory debt repayment schedule of $184.1 million in 2010, and minimum pension funding requirements, including funding for the anticipated termination of the domestic plan (discussed under Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates Valuation of Pension and Postretirement Benefit Costs ), over the next twelve months and pay its common stock dividend at its current rate. On July 29, 2009, the Company Board of Directors declared an increase in the regular quarterly dividend from $0.09 to $0.14 per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $0.56 per share. The higher dividend raised the Company annualized dividend payments from $25 million to $39 million. The current economic environment presents risks that could have adverse consequences on the Company liquidity. (See Economic conditions could adversely affect our business under Risk Factors in Item 1A.) However, the Company does not currently anticipate that the potential adverse developments addressed in those risk factors will occur. In addition, the Company does not anticipate that current economic conditions will adversely affect its ability to comply with the financial covenants in its principal credit facilities because the Company currently is, and anticipates that it will continue to be, in compliance with the minimum interest coverage ratio requirement and the maximum leverage ratio requirement. These ratios are discussed in more detail in this section under Adjusted EBITDA. Net Debt The Company had outstanding total debt of $816.3 million and cash of $447.1 million (of which approximately $75.9 million resides in foreign subsidiaries) at December 31, 2009. Total debt less cash ( net debt ) was $369.2 million at December 31, 2009. This compares to total debt of $856.1 million and cash of $198.0 million, resulting in net debt of $658.1 million at December 31, 2008. 34 Table of Contents Cash Flow Analysis (In thousands) Year Ending December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 400,949 $ 336,167 $ 248,677 Net cash (used in) investing activities $ (104,140 ) $ (466,161 ) $ (42,522 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ (58,315 ) $ 87,222 $ (73,619 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities The Company net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 increased $64.8 million to $401.0 million as compared to 2008. The increase was primarily due to higher net income, higher deferred income taxes, higher depreciation and non-cash compensation expense, and favorable changes in working capital (exclusive of cash), and higher equity earnings from affiliates. In addition, cash flow from operations in 2008 was reduced by the gain recorded on the sale of Brotherton (see Note 9). For the year ended December 31, 2009, the components of working capital that significantly affected operating cash flow are as follows: Accounts receivable decreased $6.2 million due to the timing of cash receipts. Inventories increased $10.6 million primarily to support higher anticipated sales and a temporary increase due to the start-up of the York, Pennsylvania plant. Accounts payable and other accrued expenses increased $12.7 million primarily due to higher accruals for marketing expenditures, incentive and profit sharing compensation, and exit costs associated with the North Brunswick facility. Income taxes payable increased $17.4 million due to higher tax expense associated with increased earnings and the timing of payments. Other liabilities increased $10.0 million due to additional deferred compensation and the appreciation in value of participant account balances relating to compensation previously deferred. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities during 2009 was $104.1 million, reflecting $135.4 million of property, plant and equipment expenditures (including approximately $85 million for the York, Pennsylvania facility, discussed in the following paragraph), partially offset by approximately $30.1 million of proceeds received from the sale of certain personal care product lines initially acquired in the Orajel Acquisition and a $1.3 million payment received on an outstanding note receivable. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company completed construction of its integrated laundry detergent manufacturing plant and distribution center in York, Pennsylvania. In conjunction with the opening of the new facility, the Company closed its existing laundry detergent manufacturing plant and distribution facility in North Brunswick, New Jersey. The North Brunswick facility was comprised of five separate buildings, which had resulted in significant inefficiencies and could not accommodate expansion to address expected future growth. Capital expenditures to build the York plant and distribution center, were $51 million in 2008 and $85 million in 2009. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities during 2009 was $58.3 million. This reflects a net decrease in debt of $40.6 million resulting from mandatory payments on the Term Loan of $71.5 million and payments of cash dividends of $32.3 million. These cash decreases were partially offset by an increase in short term borrowings of $29.0 million associated with the Company accounts receivable securitization facility, and proceeds of and tax benefits from stock option exercises aggregating $15.0 million. See Market Risk below for management discussion of interest rate risk. 35 Table of Contents The Company called for redemption on August 15, 2008 (the Redemption Date ) all of its outstanding 5.25% Senior Convertible Debentures due 2033 (the Debentures ) at 101.50% of the principal amount of the Debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date. In lieu of surrendering the Debentures for cash redemption, holders could elect to convert their Debentures into shares of the Company common stock at the conversion rate of 32.26 shares of the Company common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Debentures (equivalent to a conversion price of $31.00 per share). Holders of $99.9 million principal amount of the Debentures that were outstanding when the Debentures were called for redemption converted their Debentures into 3,222,293 shares of Company common stock, and on the Redemption Date, the Company redeemed the remaining nominal principal amount of Debentures for cash. On December 23, 2005, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the Credit Agreement ) with a number of banks and other financial institutions. The Credit Agreement initially provided for a five year term loan in a principal amount of $300.0 million, subject to an increase by up to an additional $250.0 million through an accordion feature upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, and continued, until May 2009, the existing multi-currency revolving credit and letter of credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million (the Revolving Credit .) On August 7, 2006, the Credit Agreement was amended and increased by $250.0 million, which the Company used to fund the acquisition of the OGI business while maintaining the $250 million accordion feature. On June 3, 2008, the Company again amended its Credit Agreement, increasing the principal amount by $250 million, which was used to fund the Orajel Acquisition, while maintaining the $250 million accordion feature. Other matters addressed in the June 2008 amendment included, among other things, an extension of the term of the Revolving Credit from May 28, 2009 to August 31, 2012, and addition of other capital expenditure related provisions associated with the new plant construction in York, Pennsylvania. Specifically, permitted annual capital expenditures were $100.0 million in 2008 and $200.0 million in 2009, and are $100.0 million, thereafter. The obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company. The term loan and the Revolving Credit bear interest under one of two rate options, selected by the Company, equal to (a) either (i) a eurocurrency rate (adjusted for any reserve requirements) ( Eurocurrency Rate ) or (ii) the greater of the prime rate, the secondary market rate for three-month certificates of deposit (adjusted for any reserve requirements) plus the applicable FDIC assessment rate plus 1.0%, or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% ( Alternate Base Rate ), plus (b) an applicable margin. On the closing date of the June 2008 amendment, and at December 31, 2009, the applicable margin was (a) 0.75% for the Eurocurrency rate and (b) 0% for the alternate rate. The Company Revolving Credit is available for general corporate purposes. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statement for additional information. Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is a component of the financial covenants contained in, and is defined in, the Credit Agreement. Financial covenants include a leverage ratio (total debt to Adjusted EBITDA) and an interest coverage ratio (Adjusted EBITDA to total interest expense), which if not met, could result in an event of default and trigger the early termination of the Credit Agreement. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, which is determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The leverage ratio during the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 was 1.6, which is below the maximum of 3.25 permitted under the Credit Agreement, and the interest coverage ratio for the twelve months ending December 31, 2009 was 14.3, which is above the minimum of 3.0 permitted under the Credit Agreement. The Company obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company. 36 Table of Contents The reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) to Adjusted EBITDA for 2009 is as follows: (In millions) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 400.9 Interest Expense 35.6 Current Income Tax Provision 125.6 Excess Tax Benefit on Stock Options Exercised 5.0 Change in Working Capital and Other Liabilities (35.4 ) Investment Income (1.3 ) Patent litigation settlement, net (20.0 ) Other (1.7 ) Adjusted EBITDA (per Credit Agreement) $ 508.6 Commitments as of December 31, 2009 The table below summarizes the Company material contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2009.

The Company did not include interest expense on its variable rate debt as it cannot predict future interest rates. (2) Represents the payments required on the Company interest rate swap and the floor of the Company interest rate collar. (3) Letters of credit with several banks guarantee payment for items such as insurance claims in the event of the Company insolvency and one year of rent on a warehouse. Performance Bonds are principally for required municipal property improvements. (4) Pension contributions are based on actuarial assessments of government regulated employer funding requirements per plan. These requirements are not projected beyond one year since they fluctuate with the change in plan assets, assumptions and demographics. The funding requirements for the planned termination of the domestic pension plan are not estimable at this time. (5) The Company has outstanding purchase obligations with suppliers at the end of 2009 for raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and do not represent total anticipated purchases. 37 Table of Contents The Company has excluded from the table above uncertain tax liabilities as defined in ASC Subtopic 740-10, Income Taxes due to the uncertainty of the amount per period of payment. As of December 31, 2009, the Company has gross uncertain tax liabilities, including interest, of $46.4 million (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report). Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities. OTHER ITEMS Market risk Concentration of Risk In each of the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, net sales to the Company largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates were 22% of the Company total consolidated net sales. Interest Rate Risk The Company had outstanding total debt at December 31, 2009 of $816.3 million, of which $250.0 million or 31% carries a fixed rate of interest. The remaining debt balance primarily is comprised of $531.4 million in term loans under the Company principal credit facilities, $30.0 million outstanding under a receivables purchase agreement and $4.9 million in international debt. The Company entered into two cash flow hedge zero cost collar agreements, each covering a notional amount of $100.0 million, to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on a portion of its term loan indebtedness. One agreement was effective as of September 29, 2006, and expires on September 31, 2011, and the other effective as of December 29, 2006, and expired on December 31, 2009. The hedge agreements each have a cap of 6.50% and a floor of 3.57%. The Company recorded a charge to interest expense of $5.5 million in 2009 with respect to the hedge agreements. The Company estimates it will recognize approximately $2.7 million in interest expense under the remaining hedge agreement in 2010. Changes in the fair value of the cash flow hedge agreement are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income on the balance sheet. The Company has no immediate plans to replace the interest rate collar that matured on December 31, 2009. In addition, the Company entered into interest rate swap hedge agreements covering a notional amount of $150.0 million, effective as of June 26, 2009, to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on a portion of its term loan indebtedness. The interest rate swap hedge agreements have terms of two years and a fixed rate of 1.38%. The Company estimates it will recognize approximately $0.7 million in interest expense under the interest rate swap hedge agreements in 2010. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swap hedge agreements are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income on the balance sheet. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding the Company cash flow hedge zero cost collar and interest rate swap hedge agreements. The weighted average interest rate on all Company borrowings at December 31, 2009, giving effect to the cash flow hedge zero cost collar and interest rate swap agreements and excluding deferred financing costs and commitment fees, was approximately 3.2%. If the variable rate on the Company floating rate debt outstanding on December 31, 2009 were to change by 100 basis points from the December 31, 2009 level, annual interest expense associated with the floating rate debt would change by approximately $3.2 million. 38 Table of Contents Diesel Fuel Hedge The Company uses independent freight carriers to deliver its products. These carriers charge the Company a basic rate per mile that is subject to a mileage surcharge for diesel fuel price increases. In July 2008 and April 2009, in response to increasing fuel prices and a concomitant increase in mileage surcharges, the Company entered into agreements with two financial counterparties to hedge approximately 13% of its notional diesel fuel requirements for 2010. The Company uses the hedge agreements to mitigate the volatility of diesel fuel prices and related fuel surcharges, and not to speculate in the future price of diesel fuel. The hedge agreements are designed to add stability to the Company product costs, enabling the Company to make pricing decisions and lessen the economic impact of abrupt changes in diesel fuel prices over the term of the contract. Because the diesel hedge agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting under ASC Subtopic 815-20, Derivatives and Hedging: Hedging General, the Company is required to mark the agreements to market throughout the life of the agreements and record changes in fair value in the consolidated statement of income. The loss recorded, net of deferred taxes, as a result of changes in the fair value of the diesel fuel hedge agreements, was immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2009. If future diesel prices were to change by $0.10 per gallon, the impact on the 2010 earnings due to the hedge agreements would be approximately $0.2 million. Foreign Currency The Company is subject to exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily U.S. Dollar/Euro, U.S. Dollar/British Pound, U.S. Dollar/Canadian Dollar, U.S. Dollar/Mexican Peso, U.S. Dollar/Australian Dollar, U.S. Dollar/Brazilian Real and U.S. Dollar/Chinese Yuan. The Company, from time to time, enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated but not yet committed sales or purchases denominated in the U.S. Dollar, Canadian dollar, British pound and Euro. During the fourth quarter of 2008 and the twelve months of 2009, the Company Canadian subsidiary entered into forward exchange contracts to protect the Company from the risk that, due to changes in currency exchange rates, it would be adversely affected by net cash outflows. The last of the contracts expire by the end of August 2010. The notional amount of the unexpired contracts as of December 31, 2009 totaled U.S. $20.0 million. The contracts qualified for hedge accounting in accordance with ASC Subtopic 815-20, and therefore, changes in the fair value were marked to market and recorded as Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). The other comprehensive loss recorded, net of deferred taxes, as a result of changes in fair value of the forward exchange contracts, was approximately $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Equity Derivatives The Company has entered into equity derivative contracts of its own stock in order to minimize the impact on earnings resulting from fluctuations in the liability to plan participants, as a result of changes in quoted fair values, with respect to contributions designated by the participants for notional investments in Company stock under the Company deferred compensation plan. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding the reported changes in fair values for derivative instruments.
