Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, principally, but not only, under the captions Business-Business and Growth Strategies, Risk Factors and Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We caution investors that any forward-looking statements in this report, or which management may make orally or in writing from time to time, are based on management beliefs and on assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. When used, the words anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, may, might, plan, project, result should, will, and similar expressions which do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance, which may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected by the forward-looking statements. We caution you that, while forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on past forward-looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends. Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: the impact of the current credit crisis and global economic slowdown, which is having and may continue to have a negative effect on the following, among other things: the fundamentals of our business, including overall market occupancy and rental rates; the financial condition of our tenants, many of which are financial, legal and other professional firms, our lenders, counterparties to our derivative financial instruments and institutions that hold our cash balances and short-term investments, which may expose us to increased risks of default by these parties; our ability to obtain debt financing on attractive terms or at all, which may adversely impact our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and refinance existing debt and our future interest expense; and the value of our real estate assets, which may limit our ability dispose of assets at attractive prices or obtain or maintain debt financing secured by our properties or on an unsecured basis; general risks affecting the real estate industry (including, without limitation, the inability to enter into or renew leases, dependence on tenants financial condition, and competition from other developers, owners and operators of real estate); failure to manage effectively our growth and expansion into new markets and sub-markets or to integrate acquisitions and developments successfully; the ability of our joint venture partners to satisfy their obligations; risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including, without limitation, construction delays, cost overruns, inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to such activities); 45 Table of Contents risks associated with the availability and terms of financing and the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including the risk associated with interest rates impacting the cost and/or availability of financing; risks associated with forward interest rate contracts and the effectiveness of such arrangements; risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies, increases in interest rates, and volatility in the securities markets; risks associated with actual or threatened terrorist attacks; costs of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar laws; potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination; risks associated with our potential failure to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; possible adverse changes in tax and environmental laws; the impact of newly adopted accounting principles on our accounting policies and on period-to-period comparisons of financial results; risks associated with possible state and local tax audits; and risks associated with our dependence on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed. The risks set forth above are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report, including Part I, Item 1A- Risk Factors, include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also refer to our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for future periods and current reports on Form 8-K as we file them with the SEC, and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through Forms 8-K or otherwise, for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, new information, future events, or otherwise, and you should not rely upon these forward-looking statements after the date of this report. Overview We are a fully integrated self-administered and self-managed REIT and one of the largest owners and developers of Class A office properties in the United States. Our properties are concentrated in five markets Boston, midtown Manhattan, Washington, DC, San Francisco and Princeton, NJ. We generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing our Class A office space to our tenants. Factors we consider when we lease space include the creditworthiness of the tenant, the length of the lease, the rental rate to be paid, the costs of tenant improvements, current and anticipated operating costs and real estate taxes, our current and anticipated vacancy, current and anticipated future demand for office space generally and general economic factors. We also generate cash through the sale of assets, which may be either non-core assets or core assets that command premiums from real estate investors. The impact of the current state of the economy, including rising unemployment, constrained capital and the deleveraging of the financial system, continues to have a dampening effect on the fundamentals of our business, including overall market occupancy and rental rates. Our core strategy has always been to operate in supply 46 Table of Contents constrained markets with high barriers to entry and to focus on executing long-term leases with financially strong tenants. Historically, this combination has tended to reduce our exposure to down cycles, but if major tenants in our markets come under financial pressure and do not utilize all of their space it will likely lead to increased supply through subletting or tenant defaults and a corresponding reduction in market rental rates. We are also not immune from the impact of the credit crisis and global economic slowdown on our own tenants and our investments. During the third quarter of 2008, Lehman Brothers, Inc., our tenth largest tenant, filed for bankruptcy protection and we established a reserve for its related accrued straight-line rent balance of $13.2 million. Lehman Brothers must continue to pay its rent while it occupies the space, but it may reject its lease at any time. There can be no assurance whether and for how long Lehman Brothers will continue to occupy this space. Lehman Brothers rent contributes approximately $43.0 million per year to our revenues. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2008, we recognized aggregate non-cash impairment charges which represented the other-than-temporary decline in the fair values below the carrying values of certain of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. The joint ventures include the entities that own 540 Madison Avenue, Two Grand Central Tower, 125 West 55 th Street, the Value-Added Fund and our Eighth Avenue and 46 th Street project located in New York City. More generally, we remain concerned about the financial stress that our current and prospective tenants face. We believe that tenant defaults will continue and that, in general, demand for office space will decrease due to significant job losses in the financial and professional services industries and that market rents will be under pressure for the foreseeable future. In part as a result of these market conditions, on February 6, 2009, we announced our intention to suspend construction on our development at 250 West 55 th Street in New York City because we were not able to conclude a lease transaction with a major law firm with which we had been negotiating over the last year. Agreement on financial terms had been reached with the firm within the last year, but recently the law firm informed us that it could not proceed on those terms thereby rendering the project economically infeasible in today environment. The project, a one million square foot office building, was originally scheduled for completion in 2011. As a result of the decision to suspend construction at 250 West 55 th Street, we expect to reduce our capital commitments on the project through 2011 by approximately $450 million. After suspension of the 250 West 55 th Street project, our development program will be approximately $1.4 billion and is 75% pre-leased to tenants. As of December 31, 2008, we had invested approximately $483.2 million in our current active developments (i.e., excluding 250 West 55 th Street) and, in addition to anticipated proceeds from existing construction loan facilities, we expect to make additional investments of approximately $822.9 million over the next four years. Recently we have witnessed a reduction in construction materials and labor pricing, which may reduce our total project costs, although there can be no assurance in this regard. As of December 31, 2008, we had $241.5 million in cash and $884.4 million in availability under our Unsecured Line of Credit and anticipate funding the development projects through a combination of this existing liquidity supplemented by new construction loan facilities and/or the incurrence of additional secured or unsecured debt. While we successfully utilized an accordion feature under our Unsecured Line of Credit to increase the lenders total commitment under the facility to $1.0 billion in July 2008, completed an offering of $747.5 million of exchangeable senior notes in August 2008 and completed a $375.0 million financing of Embarcadero Center Four in November 2008, many of the debt capital markets that real estate companies like us frequently access, such as the unsecured bond market and the convertible debt market, are not currently available to us on terms that we believe are economically attractive. In addition, other capital sources such as the traditional banks, pension funds and life insurance companies are lending fewer dollars, under stricter terms and at greater costs to the borrowers. Despite these challenges, we believe the quality of our assets and our strong balance sheet align ourselves well with the lenders current investment selectivity and should enable us to access the credit markets even in the current difficult environment. Because capital may continue to be constrained, however, we are also evaluating the appropriate amount and form of distributions for 2009. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources . 47 Table of Contents We believe the successful lease-up and completion of our development pipeline will enhance our long-term return on equity and earnings growth as these developments are placed in-service in 2009, 2010 and 2011. As with all aspects of our business, however, we continue to monitor the impact of the global economic slowdown and may further adjust our development plans accordingly. We do not anticipate undertaking any new development projects in the foreseeable future without significant pre-leasing commitments from creditworthy tenants. Our focus on acquisition activity has moderated, but we continue to actively monitor the market and seek opportunities to selectively acquire high-quality real estate at attractive returns. Finally, in recent years, we have been an active seller of real estate assets and, although we will consider additional asset sales, we do not expect our sales volume to be comparable to that of prior years. For descriptions of significant transactions that we entered into during 2008, see Item 1. Business Transactions During 2008 . Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Real Estate Upon acquisitions of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets, including land, buildings, tenant improvements, above- and below-market leases, origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 141, Business Combinations and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land at appraised value and buildings at replacement cost. We assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate, as well as available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. We also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. Based on our acquisitions to date, our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial. We record acquired above- and below-market leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (2) management estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of 48 Table of Contents lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. Real estate is stated at depreciated cost. The cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property, legal fees and other acquisition costs. Costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include interest, internal wages, property taxes, insurance, and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Management reviews its long-lived assets used in operations for impairment following the end of each quarter and when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. If such impairment is present, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Since cash flows on properties considered to be long-lived assets to be held and used as defined by SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, ( SFAS No. 144 ) are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired, our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. If our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. If we determine that impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value. SFAS No. 144, requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold, or otherwise qualify as held for sale, be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale. The components of the property net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain (or loss) upon the disposition of the property held for sale, operating results, depreciation and interest expense (if the property is subject to a secured loan). We generally consider assets to be held for sale when the transaction has been approved by our Board of Directors, or a committee thereof, and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale, such that the property sale within one year is considered probable. Following the classification of a property as held for sale, no further depreciation is recorded on the assets. A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. After the determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project commences and capitalization begins, and when a development project is substantially complete and held available for occupancy and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. Our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by SFAS No. 34 Capitalization of Interest Cost and SFAS No. 67 Accounting for Costs and the Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects. The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs necessary to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We begin the capitalization of costs during the pre-construction period which we define as activities that are necessary to the development of the property. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We cease capitalization on the portion (1) substantially completed and (2) occupied or held available for occupancy, and we capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Except for ownership interests in variable interest entities, we account for our investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting because we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these 49 Table of Contents entities. Our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity involves the consideration of various factors including the form of our ownership interest, our representation in the entity governance, the size of our investment (including loans), estimates of future cash flows, our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and to replace us as manager and/or liquidate the venture, if applicable. Our assessment of our influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated financial statements. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset. Under the equity method of accounting, our net equity is reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and our share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses, however, our recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint venture distribution priorities, which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds. For ownership interests in variable interest entities, we consolidate those in which we are the primary beneficiary. Our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are reviewed for impairment periodically and we record impairment charges when events or circumstances change indicating that a decline in the fair values below the carrying values has occurred and such decline is other-than-temporary. The ultimate realization of our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other than temporary. During December 2008, we recognized non-cash impairment charges which represented the other-than-temporary decline in the fair values below the carrying values of certain of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. In accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18 The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock (APB No. 18), a loss in value of an investment under the equity method of accounting, which is other than a temporary decline, must be recognized. Unlike SFAS No. 144, potential impairments under APB No. 18 result from fair values derived based on discounted cash flows and other valuation techniques which are more sensitive to current market conditions. As a result, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of approximately $31.9 million, $74.3 million, $45.1 million and $13.8 million on our investments in 540 Madison Avenue, Two Grand Central Tower, 125 West 55th Street and the Value-Added Fund, respectively. During December 2008, an unconsolidated joint venture in which we have a 50% interest suspended development activity on its Eighth Avenue and 46th Street project located in New York City. The proposed project was comprised of an assemblage of land parcels and air-rights, including contracts to acquire land parcels and air-rights, on which the joint venture was to construct a Class A office property. As a result, we recognized a charge totaling approximately $23.2 million (including $2.9 million of non-cash impairment charges in accordance with APB No. 18), which represented our share of land and air-rights impairment losses, forfeited contract deposits and previously incurred planning and pre-development costs. The combined summarized financial information of the unconsolidated joint ventures is disclosed in Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Contractual rental revenue is reported on a straight-line basis over the terms of our respective leases. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, we recognize rental revenue of acquired in-place above- and below-market leases at their fair values over the terms of the respective leases. Accrued rental income as reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets represents rental income recognized in excess of rent payments actually received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements. 50 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded $5.4 million of rental revenue representing the adjustments of rents from above and below market leases in accordance with SFAS No. 141. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the impact of the straight-line rent adjustment was approximately a $24.5 million increase in rental revenue. The straight-line adjustment for the year included an approximately $21.0 million decrease due to the establishment of reserves for the full amount of the accrued straight-line rent balances associated with our leases in New York City with Lehman Brothers, Inc. and the law firm of Heller Ehrman LLP. Amounts exclude SFAS No. 141 and straight-line income from unconsolidated joint ventures, which is disclosed in Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our leasing strategy is generally to secure creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting guidelines. Furthermore, following the initiation of a lease, we continue to actively monitor the tenant creditworthiness to ensure that all tenant related assets are recorded at their realizable value. When assessing tenant credit quality, we: review relevant financial information, including: financial ratios; net worth; revenue; cash flows; leverage: and liquidity; evaluate the depth and experience of the tenant management team; and assess the strength/growth of the tenant industry. As a result of the underwriting process, tenants are then categorized into one of three categories: (1) low risk tenants; (2) the tenant credit is such that we require collateral, in which case we: require a security deposit; and/or reduce upfront tenant improvement investments; or (3) the tenant credit is below our acceptable parameters. We consistently monitor the credit quality of our tenant base. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result from the tenant inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential losses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease. Tenant receivables are assigned a credit rating of 1 through 4. A rating of 1 represents the highest possible rating and no allowance is recorded. A rating of 4 represents the lowest credit rating, in which case we record a full reserve against the receivable balance. Among the factors considered in determining the credit rating include: payment history; credit status and change in status (credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric); change in tenant space needs (i.e., expansion/downsize); tenant financial performance; economic conditions in a specific geographic region; and industry specific credit considerations. 51 Table of Contents If our estimates of collectibility differ from the cash received, then the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted. The average remaining term of our in-place tenant leases, including unconsolidated joint ventures, was approximately 7.2 years as of December 31, 2008. The credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of our existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants risk profiles prior to lease execution and consistent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants. Recoveries from tenants, consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs, are recognized as revenue in the period during which the expenses are incurred. Tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue 99-19 Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, or ( Issue 99-19 ). Issue 99-19 requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis, as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third-party suppliers, have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk. We also receive reimbursement of payroll and payroll related costs from third parties which we reflect on a net basis in accordance with Issue 99-19. Our hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for long-distance telephone service, fax machine use, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services. Hotel revenues are recognized as earned. We receive management and development fees from third parties. Management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management, and not on a straight-line basis, because such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents. We review each development agreement and record development fees as earned depending on the risk associated with each project. Profit on development fees earned from joint venture projects is recognized as revenue to the extent of the third party partners ownership interest. Gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. The specific timing of a sale is measured against various criteria in SFAS No. 66 related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties. If the sales criteria are not met, we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met. Depreciation and Amortization We compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight-line method based on estimated useful asset lives. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, we allocate the acquisition cost of real estate to land, building, tenant improvements, acquired above- and below-market leases, origination costs and acquired in-place leases based on an assessment of their fair value and depreciate or amortize these assets over their useful lives. The amortization of acquired above- and below-market leases and acquired in-place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fair Value of Financial Instruments For purposes of disclosure, we calculate the fair value of our mortgage notes payable and unsecured senior notes. We discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and hypothetical future interest payments on our mortgage debt and unsecured notes based on a current market rate. In determining the current market rate, we add our estimate of a market spread to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to our own debt. Because our valuations of our financial instruments are based on these types of estimates, the actual fair value of our financial instruments may differ materially if our estimates do not prove to be accurate. 52 Table of Contents Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Derivative instruments and hedging activities require management to make judgments on the nature of its derivatives and their effectiveness as hedges. These judgments determine if the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component of net income or as a component of comprehensive income and as a component of equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. While management believes its judgments are reasonable, a change in a derivative effectiveness as a hedge could materially affect expenses, net income and equity. We recognized net derivative losses of approximately $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 (See Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements). Results of Operations The following discussion is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. At December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we owned or had interests in a portfolio of 147, 139 and 131 properties, respectively (the Total Property Portfolio ). As a result of changes within our Total Property Portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period-to-period. Accordingly, we do not believe that our period-to-period financial data with respect to the Total Property Portfolio are necessarily meaningful. Therefore, the comparisons of operating results for the years ended 2008, 2007 and 2006 show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us throughout each period compared (the Same Property Portfolio ) and the changes attributable to the properties included in Properties Acquired, Sold, Repositioned and Placed-in Service. In our analysis of operating results, particularly to make comparisons of net operating income between periods meaningful, it is important to provide information for properties that were in-service and owned by us throughout each period presented. We refer to properties acquired or placed in-service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us through the end of the latest period presented as our Same Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio therefore excludes properties placed in-service, acquired or repositioned after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented. Net operating income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income available to common shareholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus minority interest in Operating Partnership, losses from early extinguishments of debt, losses from investments in securities, net derivative losses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, general and administrative expense, less gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), income from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), gains on sales of real estate and other assets (net of minority interest), income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures, minority interests in property partnerships, interest and other income and development and management services revenue. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets. Our management also uses NOI to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. NOI excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property results of operations. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by 53 Table of Contents us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2007 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 115 properties, including properties acquired or placed in-service on or prior to January 1, 2007 and owned through December 31, 2008, totaling approximately 28.9 million net rentable square feet of space (excluding square feet of structured parking). The Total Property Portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either placed in-service, acquired or repositioned after January 1, 2007 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2008. Properties Placed In-Service includes our 505 9 th Street joint venture project. In connection with partially placing this property in-service, we consolidated the joint venture entity that owns the property as of October 1, 2007 due to the involvement we have in the venture once the property is operational. The Same Property Portfolio includes our Cambridge Center Marriott hotel property, but does not include the Long Wharf Marriott hotel property, which was sold on March 23, 2007. This table includes a reconciliation from the Same Property Portfolio to the Total Property Portfolio by also providing information for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 with respect to the properties which were acquired, placed in-service, repositioned or sold. 54 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio Properties Sold Properties Acquired Properties Placed In-Service Properties Repositioned Total Property Portfolio (dollars in thousands) 2008 2007 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change Rental Revenue: Rental Revenue $ 1,326,099 $ 1,288,085 $ 38,014 2.95 % $ 90 $ 23,177 $ 20,137 $ 12,138 $ 43,283 $ 3,837 $ $ $ 1,389,609 $ 1,327,237 $ 62,372 4.70 % Termination Income 12,443 6,882 5,561 80.80 % 100 12,443 6,982 5,461 78.22 % Total Rental Revenue 1,338,542 1,294,967 43,575 3.36 % 90 23,177 20,137 12,238 43,283 3,837 1,402,052 1,334,219 67,833 5.08 % Real Estate Operating Expenses 471,040 444,364 26,676 6.00 % 46 6,781 6,406 3,499 10,538 1,196 488,030 455,840 32,190 7.06 % Net Operating Income, excluding hotel 867,502 850,603 16,899 1.99 % 44 16,396 13,731 8,739 32,745 2,641 914,022 878,379 35,643 4.06 % Hotel Net Operating Income(1) 9,362 10,046 (684 ) (6.80 )% 9,362 10,046 (684 ) (6.80 )% Consolidated Net Operating Income(1) 876,864 860,649 16,215 1.88 % 44 16,396 13,731 8,739 32,745 2,641 923,384 888,425 34,959 3.93 % Other Revenue: Development and Management Services 30,518 20,553 9,965 48.48 % Interest and Other 18,958 89,706 (70,748 ) (78.87 )% Total Other Revenue 49,476 110,259 (60,783 ) (55.13 )% Other Expenses: General and administrative expense 72,365 69,882 2,483 3.55 % Interest Expense 271,972 285,887 (13,915 ) (4.87 )% Depreciation and amortization 284,452 274,268 10,184 3.71 % 2,767 10,527 8,357 9,168 638 304,147 286,030 18,117 6.33 % Losses from investments in securities 4,604 4,604 100.00 % Net derivative losses 17,021 17,021 100.00 % Loss from early extinguishments of debt 3,417 (3,417 ) (100.00 )% Total Other Expenses 284,452 274,268 10,184 3.71 % 2,767 10,527 8,357 9,168 638 670,109 645,216 24,893 3.86 % Income before minority interests $ 592,412 $ 586,381 $ 6,031 1.03 % $ 44 $ 13,629 $ 3,204 $ 382 $ 23,577 $ 2,003 $ $ $ 302,751 $ 353,468 $ (50,717 ) (14.35 )% Income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures $ (33,794 ) $ 20,428 $ (54,222 ) (265.43 )% $ $ $ (148,224 ) $ $ $ $ $ (182,018 ) 20,428 (202,446 ) (991.02 )% Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest $ $ $ $ $ $ $ 6,206 $ $ $ $ $ $ 6,206 (6,206 ) (100.00 )% Minority interests in property partnerships (1,997 ) (84 ) (1,913 ) (2,277.38 )% Minority interest in Operating Partnerships (22,006 ) (64,916 ) 42,910 66.10 % Gains on sales of real estate, net of minority interest 28,502 789,238 (760,736 ) (96.39 )% Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 220,350 (220,350 ) (100.00 )% Net Income available to common shareholders $ 125,232 $ 1,324,690 $ (1,199,458 ) (90.55 )% (1) For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see page 53. Hotel Net Operating Income for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 is comprised of Hotel Revenue of $36,872 and $37,811, respectively, less Hotel Expenses of $27,510 and $27,765, respectively, per the Consolidated Income Statement. 55 Table of Contents Rental Revenue The increase of approximately $62.4 million in the Total Property Portfolio Rental Revenue is comprised of increases and decreases within four categories that comprise our Total Property Portfolio. Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $38.0 million, Properties Sold decreased approximately $23.1 million, Properties Acquired increased approximately $8.0 million and Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $39.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. Included in the Same Property Portfolio rental revenue is an overall increase in contractual rental revenue of approximately $49.2 million, offset by a decrease of approximately $30.9 million in straight-line rents. An aggregate of $21.0 million of the decrease in straight-line rent is due to the establishment of reserves for the full amount of the accrued straight-line rent balances associated with our leases in New York City with Lehman Brothers, Inc. and the law firm of Heller Ehrman LLP. Approximately $17.3 million of the increase from the Same Property Portfolio was due to an increase in recoveries from tenants which relates to the increase in operating expenses. Approximately $2.4 million of the increase from the Same Property Portfolio was due to an increase in parking and other income. We expect the aggregate impact of straight-line rents for fiscal 2009 to be between $28 million and $30 million. Lehman Brothers, Inc. contributes approximately $43.0 million per year to our rental revenue. In the event that Lehman Brothers, Inc. rejects its lease and vacates its space, we will lose this revenue until we are able to lease this space to a new tenant. The increase in rental revenue from Properties Placed In-Service relates to fully placing in-service our 505 9 th Street development project in the first quarter of 2008 and our 77 CityPoint and South of Market development projects during the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, we partially placed in-service our One Preserve Parkway development project during the second quarter of 2008. Rental Revenue from Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $39.5 million, as detailed below: Property Date Placed In-Service Rental Revenue for the year ended December 31 2008 2007 Change (in thousands) 505 9 th Street First Quarter, 2008 $ 20,090 $ 3,837 $ 16,253 South of Market Fourth Quarter, 2008 20,010 20,010 77 CityPoint Fourth Quarter, 2008 2,098 2,098 One Preserve Parkway Second Quarter, 2008 1,085 1,085 Total $ 43,283 $ 3,837 $ 39,446 The acquisitions of Kingstowne Towne Center, North First Business Park, 103 Fourth Avenue, 6601 & 6605 Springfield Center Drive and Springfield Metro Center during 2007 and 635 Massachusetts Avenue during 2008, resulted in an increase of revenue from Properties Acquired.

These properties have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement as the property manager for each property and our continued ownership interest in Mountain View Research Park and Mountain View Technology Park.

This compared to termination income of $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Real Estate Operating Expenses The $32.2 million increase in property operating expenses (real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and other property-related expenses) in the Total Property Portfolio is comprised of increases and decreases within four categories that comprise our Total Property Portfolio. Operating expenses for the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $26.7 million, Properties Sold decreased approximately $6.7 million, Properties Acquired increased approximately $2.9 million and Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $9.3 million. Operating expenses from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. Included in Same Property Portfolio operating expenses is an increase in utility expenses of approximately $5.7 million, which represents an increase of approximately 7% over the prior year. In addition, real estate taxes increased approximately $14.2 million due to increased real estate tax assessments, which represents an increase of approximately 8%. The remaining increase of approximately $6.8 million is related to repairs and maintenance and other property-related expenses. The acquisitions of Kingstowne Towne Center, North First Business Park, 103 Fourth Avenue, 6601 & 6605 Springfield Center Drive and Springfield Metro Center during 2007, and 635 Massachusetts Avenue during 2008, increased operating expenses from Properties Acquired by approximately $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 as detailed below: Property Date Acquired Real Estate Operating Expense for the year ended December 31 2008 2007 Change Kingstowne Towne Center March 30, 2007 $ 3,808 $ 2,591 $ 1,217 North First Business Park December 13, 2007 1,138 46 1,092 103 Fourth Avenue January 29, 2007 759 606 153 635 Massachusetts Avenue September 26, 2008 274 274 6601 & 6605 Springfield Center Drive January 18, 2007 239 167 72 Springfield Metro Center April 11, 2007 188 89 99 Total $ 6,406 $ 3,499 $ 2,907 57 Table of Contents The increase in operating expenses from Properties Placed In-Service relates to fully placing in-service our 505 9 th Street development project in the first quarter of 2008 and our 77 CityPoint and South of Market development projects during the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, we partially placed in-service our One Preserve Parkway development project during the second quarter of 2008. Operating expenses from Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $9.3 million, as detailed below: Property Date Placed In-Service Real Estate Operating Expenses for the year ended December 31 2008 2007 Change (in thousands) 505 9 th Street First Quarter, 2008 $ 5,672 $ 1,196 $ 4,476 South of Market Fourth Quarter, 2008 3,466 3,466 77 CityPoint Fourth Quarter, 2008 883 883 One Preserve Parkway Second Quarter, 2008 517 517 Total $ 10,538 $ 1,196 $ 9,342 A decrease of approximately $6.7 million in the Total Property Portfolio operating expenses was due to the sales of Democracy Center in August 2007 and 5 Times Square in February 2007 and the transfer of Mountain View Research Park and Mountain View Technology Park to the Value-Added Fund in January 2008, as detailed below. These properties have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement as the property manager for each property and our continued ownership interest in Mountain View Research Park and Mountain View Technology Park.

Because some operating expenses are not recoverable from tenants, an increase in operating expenses due to one or more of the foregoing factors could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Hotel Net Operating Income Net operating income for our hotel property decreased approximately $0.7 million, a 6.80% decrease for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the operations of the Long Wharf Marriott have been included as part of discontinued operations due to its sale on March 23, 2007. The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for our Cambridge Center Marriott hotel property for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: 2008 2007 Percentage Change Occupancy 77.7 % 80.0 % (2.88 )% Average daily rate $ 217.70 $ 217.23 0.21 % Revenue per available room, REVPAR $ 169.08 $ 173.80 (2.72 )% 58 Table of Contents Development and Management Services Development and Management Services income increased approximately $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The increase is primarily attributed to $2 million of acquisition fees and approximately $3.8 million of ongoing management fees from our joint ventures that acquired the General Motors Building, 540 Madison Avenue, Two Grand Central Tower and 125 West 55 th Street in New York City, as well as development fees of approximately $2.5 million for our 20 F Street third-party development project. We expect third-party fee income for fiscal 2009 to be between $28 million and $30 million, a modest decrease due to the completion of much of our joint venture development activity in 2008 and an expected reduction in tenant services income. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income decreased by approximately $70.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of lower overall interest rates and decreased cash balances. The approximate average cash balances for the year ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 were $450.0 million and $1.7 billion, respectively. In addition, the average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007 decreased by approximately 2.80%. Other Expenses General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased approximately $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The increase is primarily due to compensation expense associated with the 2008 OPP Awards offset by a loss in our deferred compensation plan and a decrease in abandoned project costs. We anticipate our general & administrative expense to be between $76 million and $78 million for fiscal 2009. Our decision to suspend development of 250 West 55th Street in New York City may result in additional potential costs related to our one existing signed lease, possible write-offs of leasing commissions, arrangements in place with contractors and subcontractors for the project and other possible costs which we are currently evaluating. On January 24, 2008, our compensation committee approved outperformance awards under the 1997 Plan to our officers and employees. These 2008 OPP Awards are part of a new broad-based long-term incentive compensation program designed to provide our management team at several levels within the organization with the potential to earn equity awards subject to outperforming and creating shareholder value in a pay-for-performance structure. 2008 OPP Awards utilize total return to shareholders ( TRS ) over a three-year measurement period as the performance metric and include two years of time-based vesting after the end of the performance measurement period (subject to acceleration in certain events) as a retention tool. Recipients of 2008 OPP Awards will share in an outperformance pool if our TRS, including both share appreciation and dividends, exceeds absolute and relative hurdles over a three-year measurement period from February 5, 2008 to February 5, 2011, based on the average closing price of a share of our common stock of $92.8240 for the five trading days prior to and including February 5, 2008. Assuming no changes in the aggregate annual per share dividend through February 2011, our common stock price would have to exceed $104.15 per share for recipients of 2008 OPP Awards to be eligible to earn any rewards. The aggregate reward that recipients of all 2008 OPP Awards can earn, as measured by the outperformance pool, is subject to a maximum cap of $110 million, although OPP awards for an aggregate of up to approximately $104.8 million have been allocated to date and were granted on February 5, 2008. The balance remains available for future grants. Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) Share-Based Payment the 2008 OPP Awards have an aggregate value of approximately $19.7 million, which amount will generally be amortized into earnings over the five-year plan period (although awards for retirement-eligible employees will be amortized over a three-year period). Because the 2008 OPP Awards requires a sustained price target to achieve the threshold stock price, unless the target has 59 Table of Contents actually been met by the end of the applicable reporting period, we will exclude all contingently issueable shares from the diluted EPS calculation. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Commencing in 2003, we began issuing restricted stock and/or LTIP Units, as opposed to granting stock options and restricted stock, under the 1997 Plan as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of our restricted stock. Employees vest in restricted stock and LTIP Units over a four- or five-year term (for awards granted between 2003 and November 2006, vesting is over a five-year term with annual vesting of 0%, 0%, 25%, 35% and 40%; and for awards granted after November 2006, vesting occurs in equal annual installments over a four-year term). Restricted stock and LTIP Units are valued based on observable market prices for similar instruments. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. LTIP Units that were issued in January 2005 and any future LTIP Unit awards will be valued using an option pricing model in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. To the extent restricted stock or LTIP Units are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation associated with approximately $27.6 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in February 2008 and approximately $18.5 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in January 2007 will be incurred ratably over the four-year vesting period. Stock-based compensation associated with approximately $11.3 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in April 2006 will be incurred ratably over the five-year vesting period. Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio decreased approximately $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007 as detailed below Transaction Interest Expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 2007 Change (in thousands) Decreases to interest expense due to: Repayment of mortgages(1) $ 18,682 $ 48,603 $ (29,921 ) Increase in capitalized interest costs (41,883 ) (31,036 ) (10,847 ) Principal amortization of continuing debt and other 191,433 198,357 (6,924 ) Total decreases to interest expense $ 168,232 $ 215,924 $ (47,692 ) Increases to interest expense due to: Refinancing of 599 Lexington Avenue and other new debt $ 57,738 $ 40,863 $ 16,875 Issuance by our Operating Partnership of exchangeable senior notes 39,440 26,231 13,209 Borrowings under the Unsecured Line of Credit 6,562 2,869 3,693 Total increases to interest expense $ 103,740 $ 69,963 $ 33,777 Total interest expense $ 271,972 $ 285,887 $ (13,915 ) (1) Excludes refinancing of 599 Lexington Avenue. On May 9, 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1 Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) ( FSP No. APB 14-1 ). This pronouncement and the estimated effect that it will have on interest expense is discussed in Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Newly Issued Accounting Standards. We expect interest expense to increase for fiscal 2009 due to the estimated impact of FSP No. APB 14-1 and the suspension of construction at 250 West 55 th Street. We expect that our decision to suspend development of 250 West 55 th Street in New York City will result in a decrease in capitalized interest and a corresponding incremental increase in interest expense of approximately $5 million to $9 million for fiscal 2009. 60 Table of Contents At December 31, 2008, our variable rate debt consisted of our construction loans at South of Market, Democracy Tower (formerly South of Market Phase II) and Wisconsin Place Office construction projects, as well as our borrowings under our Unsecured Line of Credit. The following summarizes our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2008 compared with December 31, 2007: December 31, 2008 2007 (dollars in thousands) Debt Summary: Balance Fixed rate $ 5,886,424 $ 5,369,243 Variable rate 385,492 122,923 Total $ 6,271,916 $ 5,492,166 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 93.85 % 97.76 % Variable rate 6.15 % 2.24 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % GAAP Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 5.36 % 5.58 % Variable rate 3.62 % 6.11 % Total 5.25 % 5.60 % Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. Approximately $10.2 million related to an increase in the Same Property Portfolio and approximately $2.2 million related to acquisition activity. An increase of approximately $8.5 million was attributed to Properties Placed In-Service. These increases were offset by a decrease of approximately $2.8 million due to the sale of Democracy Center in August 2007 and 5 Times Square in February 2007. Capitalized Costs Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over their useful lives. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $12.2 million and $11.0 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $41.9 million and $31.0 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. Due to the suspension of construction at 250 West 55 th Street late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter of 2009, we expect our 2009 capitalized interest will decrease by approximately $5 million to $9 million and our 2009 capitalized wages will decrease by a modest amount. Net Derivative Losses On September 9, 2008, we executed an interest rate lock agreement with lenders at an all-in fixed rate, inclusive of the credit spread, of 6.10% per annum for an eight-year, $375.0 million loan collateralized by our Four Embarcadero Center property located in San Francisco, California. Our interest rate hedging program contemplated a financing with a ten-year term and, as a result, under SFAS No. 133, during the third quarter of 61 Table of Contents 2008 we recognized a net derivative loss of approximately $6.6 million representing the partial ineffectiveness of our interest rate contracts. On November 13, 2008, we closed on the Four Embarcadero Center mortgage. Under our interest rate hedging program, we will reclassify into earnings over the eight-year term of the loan as an increase in interest expense approximately $26.4 million (approximately $3.3 million per year) of the amounts recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, which amounts represent the effective portion of the applicable interest rate hedging contracts. Our interest rate hedging program also contemplated obtaining additional financing of at least $150.0 million by the end of 2008. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended and interpreted, we determined that we would be unable to complete the financing by the required date under our hedging program. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2008, we recognized a net derivative loss of approximately $7.2 million representing the ineffectiveness of our remaining interest rate hedging contracts. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, we modified the estimated dates with respect to our anticipated financings under our interest rate hedging program. As a result, we recognized a net derivative loss of approximately $3.3 million representing the partial ineffectiveness of the interest rate contracts. Losses from Investments in Securities We account for investments in trading securities at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings. The designation of trading securities is generally determined at acquisition. At December 31, 2008, investment in securities is comprised of an investment in an unregistered money market fund. The investment was previously included in Cash and Cash Equivalents. In December 2007, the fund suspended cash redemptions by investors; investors may elect in-kind redemptions of the underlying securities or maintain their investment in the fund and receive distributions as the underlying securities mature or are liquidated by the fund sponsor. As a result, we expect to retain this investment for a longer term than originally intended, and the valuation of our investment is subject to changes in market conditions. Because interests in this fund are now valued at less than their $1.00 par value, we recognized losses of approximately $1.4 million and $0.3 million on our investment during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We also maintain a deferred compensation plan that is designed to allow our officers to defer a portion of their current income on a pre-tax basis and receive a tax-deferred return on these deferrals. Our obligation under the plan is that of an unsecured promise to pay the deferred compensation to the plan participants in the future. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we have balances of approximately $6.6 million and $8.3 million, respectively, into a separate account, which is not restricted as to its use. We recognized income (losses) of approximately $(3.2) million and $0.3 million on the investments in the account associated with our deferred compensation plan during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Losses from Early Extinguishments of Debt On February 12, 2007, we refinanced our mortgage loan collateralized by 599 Lexington Avenue located in New York City. The new mortgage financing totaling $750.0 million bears interest at a fixed interest rate of 5.57% per annum and matures on March 1, 2017. The net proceeds of the new loan were used to refinance the $225.0 million mortgage loan on 599 Lexington Avenue and the $475.0 million mortgage loan on Times Square Tower. In connection with the refinancing, the lien of the Times Square Tower mortgage was spread to 599 Lexington Avenue and released from Times Square Tower so that Times Square Tower is no longer encumbered by any mortgage debt. There was no prepayment penalty associated with the repayment. In 2007, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.7 million consisting of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. In conjunction with the sale of Democracy Center in Bethesda, Maryland on August 7, 2007, we repaid the mortgage financing collateralized by the property totaling approximately $94.6 million. We paid a prepayment 62 Table of Contents fee of approximately $2.6 million associated with the repayment. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $2.7 million consisting of the prepayment fee and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. Income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures For the year ended December 31, 2008, income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased approximately $202.4 million compared to December 31, 2007. During December 2008, we recognized non-cash impairment charges which represented the other-than-temporary decline in the fair values below the carrying values of certain of the Company investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. In accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18 The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock (APB No. 18), a loss in value of an investment under the equity method of accounting, which is other than a temporary decline, must be recognized. As a result, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of approximately $31.9 million, $74.3 million, $45.1 million and $13.8 million on our investments in 540 Madison Avenue, Two Grand Central Tower, 125 West 55 th Street and the Value-Added Fund, respectively. If the fair value of our investments deteriorate further, we could recognize additional impairment charges which may be material. During December 2008, an unconsolidated joint venture in which we have a 50% interest suspended development activity on its Eighth Avenue and 46th Street project located in New York City. The proposed project was comprised of an assemblage of land parcels and air-rights, including contracts to acquire land parcels and air-rights, on which the joint venture was to construct a Class A office property. As a result, we recognized a charge totaling approximately $23.2 million (including $2.9 million of non-cash impairment charges in accordance with APB No. 18), which represented our share of land and air-rights impairment losses, forfeited contract deposits and previously incurred planning and pre-development costs. On June 9, 2008, we completed the acquisition of the General Motors Building for a purchase price of approximately $2.8 billion. On August 12, 2008, we completed the acquisitions of 540 Madison Avenue and Two Grand Central Tower located in New York City, New York for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $705.0 million. On August 13, 2008, we completed the acquisition of 125 West 55 th Street located in New York City, New York for an aggregate price of $444.0 million. Each acquisition was completed through a joint venture with US Real Estate Opportunities I, L.P. and Meraas Capital LLC. We have a 60% interest in each venture and provide customary property management and leasing services for each venture. 63 Table of Contents The following table presents actual financial information for the joint ventures for the period ended December 31, 2008 for the General Motors Building and 540 Madison Avenue, Two Grand Central Tower and 125 West 55 th Street, respectively.

We had previously entered into a development management agreement with the buyer to develop a Class A office property on the parcel totaling approximately 165,000 net rentable square feet. Due to our involvement in the construction of the project, the gain on sale estimated to total $23.4 million has been deferred and will be recognized over the project construction period generally, based on the percentage of total project costs incurred to estimated total project costs. As a result, we recognized a gain on sale during the year ended December 31, 2008 of approximately $8.5 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $1.4 million).

As of August 31, 2008, we no longer provide management services for this building. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement related to the sale of 280 Park Avenue, we entered into a master lease agreement with the buyer at closing. Under the master lease agreement, we guaranteed that the buyer will receive at least a minimum amount of base rent from approximately 74,340 square feet of space during the ten-year period following the expiration of the leases for this space. The leases for this space expired at various times between June 2006 and October 2007.

During the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we signed new qualifying leases for approximately 17,454 and 22,250 net rentable square feet of the remaining master lease obligation, resulting in the recognition of approximately $20.0 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $3.4 million) and $15.4 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $2.6 million) of additional gain on sale of real estate, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, the remaining master lease obligation totaled approximately $0.9 million.

The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for our Cambridge Center Marriott hotel property for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: 2007 2006 Percentage Change Occupancy 80.0 % 75.1 % 6.5 % Average daily rate $ 217.23 $ 194.52 11.7 % Revenue per available room, REVPAR $ 173.80 $ 146.15 18.9 % Development and Management Services Development and Management Services income increased approximately $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. We have maintained management contracts following the sales of Democracy Center and 5 Times Square in 2007, as well as the sale of 280 Park Avenue on June 6, 2006, which in the aggregate contributed to an increase of approximately $1.1 million in management fees. A decrease of approximately $0.4 million was attributed to reduced work order income. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income increased by approximately $53.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of higher overall interest rates and increased cash balances. In February 2007, our Operating Partnership issued $862.5 million of 2.875% unsecured exchangeable senior notes. On February 15, 2007, we completed the sale of our long-term leasehold interest in 5 Times Square in New York City for approximately $1.23 billion in cash. On March 23, 2007, we completed the sale of the Long Wharf Marriott for approximately $225.6 million in cash. On April 5, 2007, we completed the sale of Newport Office Park for approximately $33.7 million in cash. On August 7, 2007, we completed the sale of Democracy Center for approximately $184.5 million in cash and on November 20, 2007, we completed the sale of Orbital Sciences Campus and Broad Run Business Park Building E properties for an aggregate of approximately $125.4 million in cash. Other Expenses General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased approximately $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. An overall increase of approximately $2.6 million was attributed to bonuses and salaries for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006 as well as an increase in long-term compensation expense of approximately $3.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized additional expenses related to abandoned project costs of approximately $4.5 million. Commencing in 2003, we began issuing restricted stock and/or LTIP Units, as opposed to granting stock options and restricted stock, under the 1997 Plan as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of our restricted stock. Employees vest in restricted stock and LTIP Units over a four- or five-year term (for awards granted between 2003 and November 2006, vesting is over a five-year term with annual vesting of 0%, 0%, 25%, 35% and 40%; and for awards granted after 71 Table of Contents November 2006, vesting occurs in equal annual installments over a four-year term). Restricted stock and LTIP Units are valued based on observable market prices for similar instruments. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. LTIP Units that were issued in January 2005 and any future LTIP Unit awards will be valued using an option pricing model in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. To the extent restricted stock or LTIP Units are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation associated with approximately $27.6 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in February 2008 and approximately $18.5 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in January 2007 will be incurred ratably over the four-year vesting period. Stock-based compensation associated with approximately $11.3 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in April 2006 will be incurred ratably over the five-year vesting period. Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio decreased approximately $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The decrease is due to (1) the repayment of outstanding mortgage debt in connection with the sale of Democracy Center in August 2007 and 280 Park Avenue in June 2006, which decreased interest expense by $11.2 million, (2) the repayment of our mortgage loans collateralized by Capital Gallery, 191 Spring Street, 101 Carnegie Center, Seven Cambridge Center, Embarcadero Center Three and Embarcadero Center Four, and our 504, 506, 508 and 510 Carnegie Center properties, which decreased interest expense by approximately $15.9 million, and (3) an increase in capitalized interest costs which results in a decrease of interest expense of approximately $18.5 million. These decreases were offset by (1) an increase of approximately $4.4 million related to interest paid on the $450 million unsecured exchangeable senior notes issued in the second quarter of 2006 by our Operating Partnership at a per annum interest rate of 3.75%, (2) an increase of approximately $26.2 million related to interest paid on the $862.5 million unsecured exchangeable senior notes issued in the first quarter of 2007 by our Operating Partnership at an effective per annum interest rate of 3.438% and (3) an increase of approximately $4.3 million related to the acquisition of Kingstowne Towne Center on March 30, 2007 as well as the consolidation of our 505 9 th joint venture property due to the involvement we now have because the property is operational. The remaining decrease is attributed to scheduled loan amortization on our outstanding debt. At December 31, 2007, our variable rate debt consisted of our construction loan at South of Market. The following summarizes our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2007 compared with December 31, 2006: December 31, 2007 2006 (dollars in thousands) Debt Summary: Balance Fixed rate $ 5,369,243 $ 3,889,447 Variable rate 122,923 711,490 Total $ 5,492,166 $ 4,600,937 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 97.76 % 84.54 % Variable rate 2.24 % 15.46 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % GAAP Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 5.58 % 6.19 % Variable rate 6.11 % 5.80 % Total 5.60 % 6.13 % 72 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in depreciation and amortization consisted of approximately $20.6 million related to the 2007 acquisitions compared with the 2006 activity, approximately $0.7 million related to partially placing in-service 505 9th Street in the fourth quarter of 2007, approximately $1.3 million related to placing Capital Gallery into service during the third quarter of 2006, and approximately $0.7 million was due to the placing in-service of Seven Cambridge Center in the first quarter of 2006 and 12290 Sunrise Valley in the second quarter of 2006. The increase was offset by reductions in depreciation and amortization resulting from the sales of Democracy Center and 5 Times Square in 2007 compared with 280 Park Avenue in 2006, which resulted in an aggregate decrease of approximately $15.3 million. Depreciation and amortization in the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Capitalized Costs Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over their useful lives. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $11.0 million and $7.0 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $31.0 million and $5.9 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. Losses from Early Extinguishments of Debt On February 12, 2007, we refinanced our mortgage loan collateralized by 599 Lexington Avenue located in New York City. The new mortgage financing totaling $750.0 million bears interest at a fixed interest rate of 5.57% per annum and matures on March 1, 2017. The net proceeds of the new loan were used to refinance the $225.0 million mortgage loan on 599 Lexington Avenue and the $475.0 million mortgage loan on Times Square Tower. In connection with the refinancing, the lien of the Times Square Tower mortgage was spread to 599 Lexington Avenue and released from Times Square Tower so that Times Square Tower is no longer encumbered by any mortgage debt. There was no prepayment penalty associated with the repayment. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.7 million consisting of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. In conjunction with the sale of Democracy Center in Bethesda, Maryland on August 7, 2007, we repaid the mortgage financing collateralized by the property totaling approximately $94.6 million. We paid a prepayment fee of approximately $2.6 million associated with the repayment. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $2.7 million consisting of the prepayment fee and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. For the year ended December 31, 2006, in connection with the sale of 280 Park Avenue, we legally defeased the mortgage indebtedness collateralized by the property, totaling approximately $254.4 million. In connection with the legal defeasance of the mortgage indebtedness at 280 Park Avenue, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $31.4 million consisting of the difference between the value of the U.S. Treasuries and the principal balance of the mortgage loan totaling approximately $28.2 million and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs totaling approximately $3.2 million. In addition, we repaid construction financing collateralized by our Seven Cambridge Center property. The construction financing at Seven Cambridge Center totaling approximately $112.5 million was repaid using approximately $7.5 million of available cash and $105.0 million drawn under our Unsecured Line of Credit. There was no prepayment penalty 73 Table of Contents associated with the repayment for Seven Cambridge Center. We recognized losses from early extinguishments of debt totaling approximately $0.5 million consisting of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. We repaid the construction and permanent financing at Capital Gallery totaling approximately $34.0 million and $49.7 million using available cash. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.2 million comprised of a prepayment penalty and the write-off of unamortized deferred finance costs. Income from unconsolidated joint ventures For the year ended December 31, 2007, income from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased approximately $4.1 million. On June 1, 2007, our Value-Added Fund sold Worldgate Plaza located in Herndon, Virginia for approximately $109.0 million. Worldgate Plaza is an office complex consisting of approximately 322,000 net rentable square feet. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $50.5 million, of which our share was approximately $20.3 million, after the repayment of the mortgage indebtedness of $57.0 million. Our share of the gain, which is included as income from joint ventures, was approximately $15.5 million which amount reflects the achievement of certain return thresholds as provided for in the joint venture agreement. On October 1, 2007, our 505 9th Street joint venture project, a 323,000 net rentable square foot Class A office property located in Washington, D.C was partially placed in-service. In connection with partially placing this property in-service, we consolidated this entity as of October 1, 2007 due to the involvement we have in the venture once the property is operational. On September 15, 2006, a joint venture in which we had a 35% interest sold 265 Franklin Street located in Boston, Massachusetts, at a sale price of approximately $170.0 million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $108.3 million, of which our share was approximately $37.9 million, after the repayment of mortgage indebtedness of approximately $60.8 million and unfunded tenant obligations and other closing costs of approximately $0.9 million. The venture recognized a gain on sale of real estate of approximately $51.4 million, of which our share was approximately $18.0 million, and a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $0.2 million, of which our share was $0.1 million. Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, Orbital Sciences Campus and Broad Run Business Park, Building E, Newport Office Park and Long Wharf Marriott were included as part of income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest. Minority interests in property partnerships Minority interests in property partnerships for the year ended December 31, 2007 consist of the outside equity interests in the venture that owns our Wisconsin Place Office Property as well as our 505 9 th Street project. In connection with partially placing 505 9 th Street in-service, we consolidated this entity as of October 1, 2007 due to the involvement we have in the venture once the property is operational. For the year ended December 31, 2006, minority interest in property partnership includes our outside equity interest in Citigroup Center. This venture was consolidated with our financial results because we exercised control over the entity. Due to the redemption of the minority interest holder at Citigroup Center on May 31, 2006, minority interest in property partnership no longer reflects an allocation to the minority interest holder. Minority interest in Operating Partnership Minority interest in Operating Partnership decreased $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. In connection with the special dividend declared on December 17, 2007 payable on January 30, 2008, holders of Series Two Preferred Units participated on an as-converted basis in connection with 74 Table of Contents their regular May 2008 distribution payment as provided for in the Operating Partnership partnership agreement. As a result, we accrued approximately $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 related to the special cash distribution payable to holders of the Series Two Preferred Units and have allocated earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units of approximately $8.7 million, which amount has been reflected in minority interest in Operating Partnership for the year ended December 31, 2007. In connection with the special dividend declared on December 15, 2006 and paid on January 30, 2007, we recognized an adjustment of approximately $3.1 million in 2007 to the special cash distribution accrual and allocation of earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units, as a result of conversions of Series Two Preferred Units. This decrease was offset by an increase related to the minority interest in our Operating Partnership income allocation related to an underlying increase in allocable income. In connection with the special dividend declared on December 15, 2006 payable on January 30, 2007, holders of Series Two Preferred Units participated on an as-converted basis in connection with their regular May 2007 distribution payment as provided for in the Operating Partnership partnership agreement. As a result, we accrued approximately $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to the special cash distribution payable to holders of the Series Two Preferred Units and have allocated earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units of approximately $12.2 million, which amount has been reflected in minority interest in Operating Partnership for the year ended December 31, 2006. Gains on sales of real estate, net of minority interest On August 7, 2007, we sold Democracy Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for approximately $280.5 million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $184.5 million, after the repayment of the mortgage indebtedness of approximately $94.6 million and closing costs of approximately $1.4 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $168.3 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $29.9 million). Due to our continuing involvement through an agreement with the buyer to manage the property for a fee after the sale, this property has not been categorized as discontinued operations. On February 15, 2007, we sold the long-term leasehold interest in 5 Times Square in New York City and related credits, for approximately $1.28 billion in cash. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $1.23 billion, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $605.4 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $108.1 million). Due to our continuing involvement through an agreement with the buyer to manage the property for a fee after the sale, this property has not been categorized as discontinued operations. On June 6, 2006, we sold 280 Park Avenue, a 1,179,000 net rentable square foot Class A office property located in midtown Manhattan, New York, for approximately $1.2 billion. Net proceeds totaled approximately $875 million after legal defeasance of indebtedness secured by the property (consisting of approximately $254.4 million of principal indebtedness and approximately $28.2 million of related defeasance costs) and the payment of transfer taxes, brokers fees and other customary closing costs. We recognized at closing a gain on sale of approximately $583.3 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $109.2 million). Due to our continuing involvement through an agreement with the buyer to manage the property for a fee after the sale, this property has not been categorized as discontinued operations. In January 2006, we recognized a $4.8 million gain (net of minority interest share of approximately $0.9 million) on the sale of a parcel of land at the Prudential Center located in Boston, Massachusetts which had been accounted for previously as a financing transaction. During January 2006, the transaction qualified as a sale for financial reporting purposes. Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 in the Total Property Portfolio relate to the sales of Orbital Sciences Campus and Broad Run Business Park, Building E, Newport Office Park resulting in a gain of approximately $46.5 million and Long Wharf Marriott during 2007 resulting in a gain of approximately $162.4 million. 75 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond are to: fund normal recurring expenses; meet debt service and principal repayment obligations, including balloon payments on maturing debt; fund capital expenditures, including major renovations, tenant improvements and leasing costs; fund development costs; fund possible property acquisitions; and make the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following: construction loans; long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness (including unsecured exchangeable indebtedness); cash flow from operations; distribution of cash flows from joint ventures; cash and cash equivalent balances; sales of real estate; issuances of our equity securities and/or additional preferred or common units of partnership interest in our Operating Partnership; and our Unsecured Line of Credit or other short-term bridge facilities. We believe that our liquidity needs will be satisfied using our cash on hand, cash flows generated by operations, availability under our Unsecured Line of Credit and cash flows provided by other financing activities. We draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long-term capital needs. Our Unsecured Line of Credit is utilized primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities, to refinance outstanding indebtedness and to meet short-term development and working capital needs. We generally fund our development projects with construction loans, which may be partially guaranteed by our Operating Partnership, until project completion or lease-up thresholds are achieved. Contractual rental revenue, recovery income from tenants, other income from operations, available cash balances, draws on our Unsecured Line of Credit and refinancing of maturing indebtedness are our principal sources of capital used to pay operating expenses, debt service, recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification. We seek to increase income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. Our sources of revenue also include third-party fees generated by our office real estate management, leasing, development and construction businesses. Consequently, we believe our revenue, together with proceeds from financing activities, will continue to provide the necessary funds for our short-term liquidity needs. Material changes in these factors may adversely affect our net cash flows. Such changes, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to fund distributions, debt service payments and tenant improvements. In addition, a material adverse change in our cash provided by operations may affect our ability to comply with the financial performance covenants under our Unsecured Line of Credit and unsecured senior notes. 76 Table of Contents The credit markets continue to be extremely constrained in the real estate sector, as lenders are primarily focusing on refinancing or restructuring existing loans. Lenders are taking relatively little underwriting risk, the amount of capital they are willing to commit has decreased and the underwriting standards that they are employing have become increasingly conservative. We have approximately $251 million of debt maturities in 2009. The largest is approximately $183 million where we have two one-year extension options and expect to exercise the first extension option in 2009. The other two loans are with life insurance companies, at conservative loan to value ratios and we expect to refinance or replace them at maturity. In 2010, we have debt maturities totaling approximately $238 million and our unconsolidated joint ventures have debt maturities totaling approximately $670 million (of which our share is approximately $397 million). All of these loans are secured mortgages. The two largest maturities are loans on 125 West 55 th Street and Two Grand Central Tower, and we anticipate a reduced loan amount as part of the refinancing of these assets. The remaining loans are moderately leveraged mortgages on stabilized properties where we expect to be able to refinance the existing loan amounts. We intend to be proactive requesting financing bids on these and other stable assets and anticipate completing additional financings during 2009. The remainder of our capital commitments over the next few years are to fund our development program. In total our remaining capital requirements, net of interest and anticipated fundings from existing construction loans, to complete our ongoing developments is $822.9 million, through the end of 2012. With our cash, availability under our Unsecured Line of Credit, and the anticipated cash flow generated by the operating portfolio, we believe we have sufficient capacity to fund the entire program. In addition, we expect to arrange supplementary construction facilities on a number of these projects as we move through 2009 to create additional liquidity. For more details on properties under construction, see page 5. Finally, in recent years, we have been an active seller of real estate assets and, although we will consider additional asset sales, we do not expect our sales volume to be comparable to that of prior years. REIT Tax Distribution Considerations Dividend Because capital may continue to be constrained, we are also evaluating the appropriate amount and form of payment of distributions for 2009. A REIT is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its annual taxable income. Our policy is to distribute at least 100% of our taxable income to avoid paying federal tax. Our last four regular quarterly distributions (including distributions paid to third-party OP unitholders) totaled an aggregate of approximately $385 million. Under the applicable REIT regulations, we can apply the fourth quarter 2008 dividend (which was declared on December 31, 2008 and paid on January 31, 2009), in whole or in part, to satisfy our 2009 minimum REIT distribution requirements. If we choose to apply the entire amount, we could reduce our required 2009 distributions by approximately $97 million. In addition, as a result of a temporary Revenue Procedure recently issued by the Internal Revenue Service, we are, like many other REITs, also evaluating the financial, legal and tax implications (on both stockholders and holders of partnership interests in BPLP) of issuing equity in lieu of a portion of our regular cash dividend. We continue to consider the advantages and disadvantages of reducing our cash distributions and/or issuing equity in lieu of a portion of our cash distributions in light of the current state of the capital markets, our current stock price and other factors. Sales To the extent that we sell assets and cannot efficiently use the proceeds for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions, we would, at the appropriate time, decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend, adopt a stock repurchase program, reduce our indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities. Such a decision will depend on many factors including, among others, the timing, availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities, our then-current and anticipated leverage, the price of our common stock and REIT distribution requirements. At a minimum, we expect that we would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for us to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales. 77 Table of Contents On December 17, 2007, our Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $5.98 per common share that was paid on January 30, 2008 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2007. The decision to declare a special dividend was the result of the sales of assets in 2007, including 5 Times Square, Orbital Sciences Campus, Broad Run Business Park Building E, Worldgate Plaza and Newport Office Park. Cash Flow Summary The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below. Cash and cash equivalents were $0.2 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively, representing a decrease of $1.3 billion. The cash and cash equivalents balance as of February 23, 2009 was approximately $51 million. The decrease was a result of the following decreases in cash flows: Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 Increase (Decrease) (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 560,908 $ 629,378 $ (68,470 ) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (1,315,676 ) $ 576,931 $ (1,892,607 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (510,643 ) $ (425,176 ) $ (85,467 ) Our principal source of cash flow is related to the operation of our office properties. The average term of our tenant leases is approximately 7.2 years with portfolio occupancy rates historically in the range of 92% to 98%. Our properties provide a relatively consistent stream of cash flow that provides us with resources to pay operating expenses, debt service and fund quarterly dividend and distribution payment requirements. In addition, over the past three years, we have raised capital through the sale of some of our properties and raised capital from secured and unsecured borrowings. In 2008, our total dividends exceeded our cash flow from operating activities due to the special dividend which was declared in December 2007 and paid to common stockholders and common unitholders of BPLP in January 2008. The cash flows distributed were generated from sales of real estate assets and proceeds from the sales are included as part of cash flows from investment activities. Dividends will generally exceed cash flows from operating activities during periods in which we sell significant real estate assets and distribute gains on sale that would otherwise be taxable. Cash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development and recurring and nonrecurring capital expenditures. We selectively invest in new projects that enable us to take advantage of our development, leasing, financing and property management skills and invest in existing buildings that meet our investment criteria. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 consisted of the following: (in thousands) Net proceeds from the sales of real estate and other assets $ 127,307 Proceeds from note receivable 123,000 Proceeds from redemptions of investments in securities 14,697 Net proceeds from the sale/financing of real estate released from escrow 161,321 The cash provided by these investing activities is offset by: Net investments in unconsolidated joint ventures (896,027 ) Issuance of note receivable (270,000 ) Acquisitions/additions to real estate (575,974 ) Net cash used in investing activities $ (1,315,676 ) 78 Table of Contents Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 totaled approximately $510.6 million. This consisted primarily of the dividends and distribution to shareholders and the unitholders of our Operating Partnership, including the special cash dividend of $5.98 per share paid in January 2008, net repayment of mortgage notes payable, offset by the borrowings under our Unsecured Line of Credit and the offering of our 3.625% exchangeable senior notes due 2014. Future debt payments are discussed below under the heading Debt Financing. Capitalization At December 31, 2008, our total consolidated debt was approximately $6.3 billion. The GAAP weighted-average annual interest rate on our consolidated indebtedness was 5.25% and the weighted-average maturity was approximately 5.1 years. Consolidated debt to total consolidated market capitalization ratio, defined as total consolidated debt as a percentage of the market value of our outstanding equity securities plus our total consolidated debt, is a measure of leverage commonly used by analysts in the REIT sector. Our total consolidated market capitalization was approximately $14.2 billion at December 31, 2008. Total consolidated market capitalization was calculated using the December 31, 2008 closing stock price of $55.00 per common share and the following: (1) 121,180,655 shares of our common stock, (2) 19,909,070 outstanding common units of limited partnership interest in Boston Properties Limited Partnership (excluding common units held by Boston Properties, Inc.), (3) an aggregate of 1,460,688 common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding Series Two Preferred Units of partnership interest in Boston Properties Limited Partnership, (4) an aggregate of 946,509 common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding LTIP Units, assuming all conditions have been met for the conversion of the LTIP Units, and (5) our consolidated debt totaling approximately $6.3 billion. The calculation of total consolidated market capitalization does not include 1,080,938 2008 OPP Awards because, unlike other LTIP Units, they are not earned until certain return thresholds are achieved. Our total consolidated debt, which excludes debt collateralized by our unconsolidated joint ventures, at December 31, 2008 represented approximately 44.28% of our total consolidated market capitalization. This percentage will fluctuate with changes in the market price of our common stock and does not necessarily reflect our capacity to incur additional debt to finance our activities or our ability to manage our existing debt obligations. However, for a company like ours, whose assets are primarily income-producing real estate, the consolidated debt to total consolidated market capitalization ratio may provide investors with an alternate indication of leverage, so long as it is evaluated along with other financial ratios and the various components of our outstanding indebtedness. For a discussion of our unconsolidated joint venture indebtedness, see Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Joint Venture Indebtedness. 79 Table of Contents Debt Financing As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $6.3 billion of outstanding consolidated indebtedness, representing 44.28% of our total consolidated market capitalization as calculated above consisting of (1) $1.472 billion (net of discount) in publicly traded unsecured debt having a weighted-average interest rate of 6.03% per annum and maturities in 2013 and 2015; (2) $450 million of exchangeable senior notes having an interest rate of 3.75% per annum (an effective rate of 3.787% per annum), an initial optional redemption date in 2013 and maturity in 2036; (3) $848.4 million (net of discount) of exchangeable senior notes having an interest rate of 2.875% per annum (an effective rate of 3.462% per annum) having an initial optional redemption in 2012 and maturing in 2037; (4) $740.5 million (net of discount) of exchangeable senior notes having an interest rate of 3.625% per annum (an effective rate of 4.037%) having an initial optional redemption and maturity in 2014; (5) $2.7 billion of property-specific mortgage debt having a GAAP weighted-average interest rate of 6.33% per annum and weighted-average term of 5.1 years; and (6) $100.0 million drawn on our Unsecured Line of Credit. The table below summarizes our outstanding consolidated indebtedness at December 31, 2008 and 2007: December 31, 2008 2007 (dollars in thousands) DEBT SUMMARY: Balance Fixed rate $ 5,886,424 $ 5,369,243 Variable rate 385,492 122,923 Total $ 6,271,916 $ 5,492,166 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 93.85 % 97.76 % Variable rate 6.15 % 2.24 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % GAAP Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 5.36 % 5.58 % Variable rate 3.62 % 6.11 % Total 5.25 % 5.60 % The variable rate debt shown above bears interest based on various spreads over the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) or Eurodollar rates. As of December 31, 2008, the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt was LIBOR/Eurodollar plus 0.97% per annum. During 2007, we entered into an interest rate swap contract to fix the one-month LIBOR index rate at 4.57% per annum on a notional amount of $96.7 million. The swap contract went into effect on October 22, 2007 and expired on October 29, 2008. Unsecured Line of Credit On June 6, 2008, our Operating Partnership utilized an accordion feature under its Unsecured Line of Credit with a consortium of lenders to increase the total commitment under the Unsecured Line of Credit from $605.0 million to $923.3 million. On July 21, 2008, our Operating Partnership further increased the total commitment to $1.0 billion. All other material terms under the facility remain unchanged. Our Unsecured Line of Credit bears interest at a variable interest rate equal to Eurodollar plus 0.475% per annum and matures on August 3, 2010, with a provision for a one-year extension at our option, subject to certain conditions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renew and or replace the Unsecured Line of Credit upon maturity on favorable terms (including the lenders total commitment) or at all. The Unsecured Line of Credit is a recourse obligation of our Operating Partnership. Under the Unsecured Line of Credit, a facility fee equal to 0.125% per annum is payable 80 Table of Contents in quarterly installments. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment in the event of a change in our Operating Partnership unsecured debt ratings. The Unsecured Line of Credit involves a syndicate of lenders. The Unsecured Line of Credit contains a competitive bid option that allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to make loan advances to us at a negotiated LIBOR-based rate. Our ability to borrow under our Unsecured Line of Credit is subject to our compliance with a number of customary financial and other covenants on an ongoing basis, including: a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however the leverage ratio may increase to no greater than 65% provided that it is reduced back to 60% within 180 days; a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 55%; a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.40; an unsecured leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however the leverage ratio may increase to no greater than 65% provided that it is reduced back to 60% within 180 days; a minimum net worth requirement; an unsecured debt interest coverage ratio of at least 1.75; and limitations on permitted investments. We believe we are in compliance with the financial and other covenants listed above. As of December 31, 2008, we had borrowings of $100.0 million and letters of credit totaling $15.6 million outstanding under the Unsecured Line of Credit, with the ability to borrow $884.4 million. As of February 23, 2009, we had borrowings of $100.0 million and letters of credit totaling $15.7 million outstanding under the Unsecured Line of Credit, with the ability to borrow $884.3 million.

(2) No principal amounts are due prior to maturity. Our unsecured senior notes are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of their principal amount or (2) the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest discounted at a rate equal to the yield on U.S. Treasury securities with a comparable maturity plus 35 basis points (or 25 basis points in the case of the $250 million 12 Year Unsecured Senior Notes that mature on June 1, 2015), in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The indenture under which our senior unsecured notes were issued contains restrictions on incurring debt and 81 Table of Contents using our assets as security in other financing transactions and other customary financial and other covenants, including (1) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, (2) a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 50%, (3) an interest coverage ratio of 1.5, and (4) unencumbered asset value to be no less than 150% of our unsecured debt. As of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with each of these financial restrictions and requirements. BPLP investment grade ratings on its senior unsecured notes are as follows: Rating Organization Rating Moody Baa2 (stable) Standard & Poor A- (negative) FitchRatings BBB (stable) The security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, as it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Unsecured exchangeable senior notes The following summarizes the unsecured exchangeable senior notes outstanding as of December 31, 2008 (dollars in thousands): Coupon/ Stated Rate Effective Rate(1) Exchange Rate Principal Amount First Optional Redemption Date by Company Maturity Date 3.625% Exchangeable Senior Notes 3.625 % 4.037 % 8.5051 (2) $ 747,500 N/A February 15, 2014 2.875% Exchangeable Senior Notes 2.875 % 3.462 % 7.0430 (3) 862,500 February 20, 2012 February 15, 2037 3.750% Exchangeable Senior Notes 3.750 % 3.787 % 10.0066 (4) 450,000 May 18, 2013 May 15, 2036 Total principal 2,060,000 Net discount (21,101 ) Total $ 2,038,899 (1) Yield on issuance date including the effects of discounts on the notes. (2) The initial exchange rate is 8.5051 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the notes (or an initial exchange price of approximately $117.58 per share of our common stock). In addition, we entered into capped call transactions with affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers, which are intended to reduce the potential dilution upon future exchange of the notes. The capped call transactions are expected to have the effect of increasing the effective exchange price to us of the notes from $117.58 to approximately $137.17 per share, representing an overall effective premium of approximately 40% over the closing price on August 13, 2008 of $97.98 per share of our common stock. The net cost of the capped call transactions was approximately $44.4 million. (3) In connection with the special dividend of $5.98 per share of common stock declared on December 17, 2007, the exchange rate was adjusted from 6.6090 to 7.0430 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes effective as of December 31, 2007, resulting in an exchange price of approximately $141.98 per share of our common stock. (4) In connection with the special dividend of $5.98 per share of common stock declared on December 17, 2007, the exchange rate was adjusted from 9.3900 to 10.0066 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes effective as of December 31, 2007, resulting in an exchange price of approximately $99.93 per share of our common stock. 82 Table of Contents 3.625% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2014 On August 19, 2008, our Operating Partnership completed an offering of $747.5 million in aggregate principal amount (including $97.5 million as a result of the exercise by the initial purchasers of their over-allotment option) of its 3.625% exchangeable senior notes due 2014. The notes were priced at 99.0% of their face amount, resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us, after deducting the initial purchasers discounts and offering expenses, of approximately $731.6 million, resulting in an effective interest rate of approximately 4.037% per annum. The notes mature on February 15, 2014, unless earlier repurchased, exchanged or redeemed. On and after January 1, 2014, the notes will be exchangeable at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date at the option of the holders into cash up to their principal amount and, at the Operating Partnership option, cash or shares of our common stock for the remainder, if any, of the exchange value in excess of such principal amount at the applicable exchange rate, which initially equals 8.5051 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the notes (equivalent to an exchange price of approximately $117.58 per share of our common stock) and is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The initial exchange price of approximately $117.58 per share of our common stock represents an approximately 20% premium to the closing price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on August 13, 2008 of $97.98 per share. Prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding January 1, 2014, holders of the notes may only exchange their notes at their option under the following circumstances: (1) during the five business day period after any 10 consecutive trading day period (the measurement period ) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of that measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the exchange rate on each such day; (2) during any fiscal quarter beginning after the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2008 if the last reported sale price of our common stock for each of at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last day of the preceding fiscal quarter is more than 130% of the applicable exchange price for the notes on the last day of such preceding fiscal quarter; (3) if the Operating Partnership has called such notes for redemption to preserve our status as a real estate investment trust and the redemption has not yet occurred; (4) in connection with specified corporate transactions, including a fundamental change; or (5) if our common stock is delisted. The notes may be accelerated upon an event of default as described in Supplemental Indenture No. 7. If we undergo a fundamental change, holders of the notes will have the option to require the Operating Partnership to purchase all or any portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. The Operating Partnership will pay cash for all notes so repurchased. The holders of the notes will have the right to exchange their notes at their option in connection with a fundamental change, and, if a fundamental change occurs, the exchange rate may be increased by up to 1.7011 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the notes, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, for a holder who elects to exchange its notes in connection with the fundamental change. The number of additional shares by which the exchange rate will be increased will be determined by reference to a table included in the Operating Partnership Supplemental Indenture No. 7, based on the date on which the fundamental change occurs or becomes effective and the price paid per share of our common stock in the transaction or event that constitutes such fundamental change. A fundamental change will be deemed to occur upon the consummation of any transaction or event (whether by means of an exchange offer, liquidation, tender offer, consolidation, merger, combination, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) in connection with which more than 50% of our common stock is exchanged for, converted into, acquired for or constitutes solely the right to receive, consideration which is not at least 90% common stock (or American Depositary Shares representing shares of common stock) that is either (1) listed on, or immediately after consummation of such transaction or event will be listed on, a United States national securities exchange; or (2) approved, or immediately after the transaction or event will be approved, for listing or quotation on any United States system of automated dissemination of quotations of securities prices similar to a United States national securities exchange. 83 Table of Contents The notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Operating Partnership and rank equally in right of payment to all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of the Operating Partnership. The notes effectively rank junior in right of payment to all existing and future secured indebtedness of the Operating Partnership to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The notes are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of the subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership. In connection with the closing, we and the Operating Partnership entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the initial purchasers. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, we and the Operating Partnership have agreed, for the benefit of the holders of the notes, to register the resale of the Common Stock, if any, issued upon exchange of the notes on a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We and the Operating Partnership may be required to pay liquidated damages of up to 0.50% per annum of additional interest to the holders of the notes if we and the Operating Partnership fail to meet certain deadlines or take certain actions relating to the registration of our common stock issuable upon exchange of the notes. Neither us nor the Operating Partnership will be required to pay liquidated damages with respect to any note after it has been exchanged. Additionally, pursuant to Supplemental Indenture No. 7, to the extent that any shares of our common stock issued upon exchange of the notes are not covered by a resale registration statement that is effective on the date of the exchange and certain other conditions have been met, we must deliver 0.03 additional shares of our common stock upon exchange of the notes for each of such shares. In connection with the sale of the notes, we and the Operating Partnership also entered into capped call transactions (together, the Capped Call Transaction ) with affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers (Bank of America, N.A., Deutsche Bank AG, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley) (the Option Counterparties ). Pursuant to the Capped Call Transaction, the Operating Partnership will have the right to cause the Option Counterparties to deliver shares of our common stock to the Operating Partnership upon exchange of the notes if the value per share of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Call Transaction, at the time of settlement exceeds an initial strike price of approximately $117.58 per share, subject to certain adjustments similar to those contained in the notes. The Capped Call Transaction is intended to reduce the potential dilution upon future exchange of the notes in the event that the market value per share of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Call Transaction, at the time of settlement is greater than the strike price of the Capped Call Transaction. If the market value per share of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Call Transaction, at the time of settlement exceeds the cap price of the Capped Call Transaction (which is initially equal to approximately $137.17 per share), the dilution mitigation will be limited and there would be dilution to the extent that the market value per share of our common stock exceeds the cap price. The Capped Call Transaction is expected to have the effect of increasing the effective exchange price to the Operating Partnership of the notes to the cap price of the Capped Call Transaction, which represents an initial effective premium of approximately 40% over the closing price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on August 13, 2008 of $97.98 per share. The Capped Call Transaction comprises separate contracts entered into by us and the Operating Partnership and with the Option Counterparties and is not part of the terms of the notes and will not affect the holders rights under the notes. The net cost of the Capped Call Transaction was approximately $44.4 million, which was recorded as a reduction to stockholders equity. 2.875% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2037 On February 6, 2007, our Operating Partnership completed an offering of $862.5 million in aggregate principal amount (including $112.5 million as a result of the exercise by the initial purchasers of their over-allotment option) of its 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037. The notes were priced at 97.433333% of their face amount, resulting in an effective interest rate of approximately 3.438% per annum and net proceeds to us of approximately $840.0 million. The notes mature on February 15, 2037, unless earlier repurchased, exchanged or redeemed. 84 Table of Contents Upon the occurrence of specified events, holders of the notes may exchange their notes prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding February 20, 2012 into cash and, at the Operating Partnership option, shares of our common stock at an exchange rate of 7.0430 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (or an exchange price of approximately $141.98 per share of our common stock). In connection with the special dividend declared on December 17, 2007, the initial exchange rate of 6.6090 was adjusted to 7.0430 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes effective as of December 31, 2007, resulting in an exchange price of approximately $141.98 per share of our common stock. On and after February 20, 2012, the notes will be exchangeable at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date at the option of the holder at the applicable exchange rate. The initial exchange rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Prior to February 20, 2012, the Operating Partnership may not redeem the notes except to preserve our status as a REIT. On or after February 20, 2012, the Operating Partnership may redeem all or a portion of the notes for cash at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Note holders may require the Operating Partnership to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on February 15 of 2012, 2017, 2022, 2027 and 2032 at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the repurchase date. The Operating Partnership will pay cash for all notes so repurchased. If we undergo a fundamental change, note holders will have the option to require the Operating Partnership to purchase all or any portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change purchase date. The Operating Partnership will pay cash for all notes so purchased. In addition, if a fundamental change occurs prior to February 20, 2012, the Operating Partnership will increase the exchange rate for a holder who elects to exchange its notes in connection with such a fundamental change under certain circumstances. In connection with the closing, we and our Operating Partnership entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the initial purchasers, under which we and our Operating Partnership agreed, for the benefit of the holders of the notes, to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and maintain a shelf registration statement providing for the sale by the holders of the notes and our common stock, if any, issuable upon exchange of the notes. The Operating Partnership will be required to pay liquidated damages in the form of specified additional interest to the holders of the notes if we fail to comply with these obligations; provided that we will not be required to pay liquidated damages with respect to any note after it has been exchanged for any of our common stock. On March 13, 2007, we filed with the SEC a registration statement covering the resale of the notes and shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of the notes. The registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on April 20, 2007. 3.75% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2036 On April 6, 2006, our Operating Partnership completed a public offering of $400 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.75% exchangeable senior notes due 2036. On May 2, 2006, the Operating Partnership issued an additional $50 million aggregate principal amount of the notes as a result of the exercise by the underwriter of its over-allotment option. The notes mature on May 15, 2036, unless earlier repurchased, exchanged or redeemed. Upon the occurrence of specified events, holders of the notes may exchange their notes prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding May 18, 2013 into cash and, at the Operating Partnership option, shares of our common stock at an exchange rate of 10.0066 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (or an exchange price of approximately $99.93 per share of common stock). The initial exchange rate of 8.9461 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes and the initial exchange price of approximately $111.78 per share of our common stock were adjusted to 9.3900 and $106.50, respectively, effective as of December 29, 2006 in connection with the special dividend declared on December 15, 2006. In connection with 85 Table of Contents the special dividend declared on December 17, 2007, the exchange rate was further adjusted from 9.3900 to 10.0066 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes effective as of December 31, 2007, resulting in the current exchange price of approximately $99.93 per share of our common stock. On and after May 18, 2013, the notes will be exchangeable at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date at the option of the holder at the applicable exchange rate. The exchange rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Prior to May 18, 2013, the Operating Partnership may not redeem the notes except to preserve our status as a REIT. On or after May 18, 2013, the Operating Partnership may redeem all or a portion of the notes for cash at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Operating Partnership must make at least 12 semi-annual interest payments (including interest payments on November 15, 2006 and May 15, 2013) before redeeming any notes at the option of the Operating Partnership. Note holders may require the Operating Partnership to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on May 18, 2013 and May 15 of 2016, 2021, 2026 and 2031 at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the repurchase date.

The stated interest rate is 5.57% per annum. The mortgage loan requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity.

(5) On November 13, 2008, we closed on an eight-year, $375.0 million mortgage loan collateralized by Four Embarcadero Center located in San Francisco, California. The mortgage loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.10% per annum. Under our interest rate hedging program, we will reclassify into earnings over the eight-year term of the loan as an increase in interest expense approximately $26.4 million (approximately $3.3 million per year) of the amounts recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss resulting in an effective interest rate of 7.02% per annum. (6) The construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.00% per annum and matures on November 21, 2009 with two, one year extension options. In addition, we entered into an interest rate swap contract to fix the one-month LIBOR index rate at 4.57% per annum on a notional amount of $96.7 million. The swap contract went into effect on October 22, 2007 and expired on October 29, 2008. (7) The construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.25% per annum and matures on January 29, 2011 with two, one-year extension options. (8) In accordance with EITF 98-1, the principal amount and interest rate shown were adjusted upon acquisition of the property to reflect the fair value of the assumed note. (9) Includes outstanding indebtedness secured by 91 Hartwell Avenue. (10) The construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum and matures on December 19, 2010 with two one-year extension options. (11) Includes outstanding principal in the amounts of $17.7 million, $2.8 million and $1.1 million which bear interest at fixed rates of 6.70%, 8.54% and 6.75% per annum, respectively. Contractual aggregate principal payments of mortgage notes payable at December 31, 2008 are as follows: Year Principal Payments (in thousands) 2009 $ 274,659 2010 161,489 2011 620,808 2012 105,059 2013 100,436 Thereafter 1,384,957 Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Our primary market risk results from our indebtedness, which bears interest at fixed and variable rates. The fair value of our debt obligations are affected by changes in the market interest rates. We manage our market risk by matching long-term leases with long-term, fixed-rate, non-recourse debt of similar duration. We continue to follow a conservative strategy of generally pre-leasing development projects on a long-term basis to creditworthy tenants in order to achieve the most favorable construction and permanent financing terms. Approximately 94% of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the interest rate risk through the maturity of such outstanding debt. We also manage our market risk by entering into hedging arrangements with financial 87 Table of Contents institutions. Our primary objectives when undertaking hedging transactions and derivative positions is to reduce our floating rate exposure and to fix a portion of the interest rate for anticipated financing and refinancing transactions. This in turn, reduces the risks that the variability of cash flows imposes on variable rate debt. Our strategy mitigates us against future increases in interest rates. During 2007, we commenced an interest rate hedging program for our expected financing activity in 2008 and entered into 11 treasury locks based on a weighted-average 10-year treasury rate of 4.68% per annum on notional amounts aggregating $375.0 million. Nine of the treasury locks with notional amounts aggregating $325.0 million matured on April 1, 2008, at which time we cash-settled the contracts and made cash payments to the counterparties totaling approximately $33.5 million. The remaining two treasury locks with notional amounts aggregating $50.0 million matured on July 31, 2008, at which time we cash-settled the contracts and made cash payments to the counterparties totaling approximately $1.3 million. In addition, we entered into five forward-starting interest rate swap contracts to lock the 10-year LIBOR swap rate on notional amounts aggregating $150.0 million at a weighted-average forward-starting 10-year swap rate of 5.19% per annum. The 10-year treasury rate is a component of the 10-year swap rate and the swap contracts effectively fixed the 10-year treasury rate at a weighted-average interest rate of 4.51% per annum. The swap contracts went into effect on July 31, 2008 and were to expire on July 31, 2018. On July 31, 2008 and September 2, 2008, we cash-settled our forward-starting interest rate swap contracts and made aggregate cash payments to the counterparties totaling approximately $8.6 million. Collectively, all of the foregoing contracts were intended to have effectively fixed the 10-year treasury rate at a weighted-average interest rate of 4.63% per annum on notional amounts aggregating $525.0 million. We entered into the treasury locks and interest rate swap contracts designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges to reduce our exposure to the variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in the hedged rate in contemplation of obtaining ten-year fixed-rate financings in 2008. SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ( SFAS No. 133 ), as amended and interpreted, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments. We have formally documented all of our relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. We also assess and document, both at the hedging instrument inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows associated with the hedged items. All components of the treasury locks and forward-starting interest rate swap contracts were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we modified the estimated dates with respect to our anticipated financings under the interest rate hedging program. As a result, in the aggregate during the first three quarters of 2008 we recognized a net derivative loss of approximately $3.3 million representing the partial ineffectiveness of the interest rate contracts. In addition, on September 9, 2008, we executed an interest rate lock agreement with lenders at an all-in fixed rate, inclusive of the credit spread, of 6.10% per annum for an eight-year, $375.0 million loan collateralized by our Four Embarcadero Center property located in San Francisco, California. Our interest rate hedging program contemplated a financing with a ten-year term and, as a result, under SFAS No. 133, during the third quarter of 2008 we recognized a net derivative loss of approximately $6.6 million representing the partial ineffectiveness of our interest rate contracts. We will reclassify into earnings over the eight-year term of the Four Embarcadero Center loan as an increase in interest expense approximately $26.4 million (approximately $3.3 million per year) of the amounts recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, which amounts represent the effective portion of the applicable interest rate hedging contracts. Our interest rate hedging program also contemplated obtaining additional financing of at least $150.0 million by the end of 2008. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended and interpreted, we determined that we would be unable to complete the financing by the required date under its hedging program. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2008, we recognized a net derivative loss of approximately $7.2 million representing the ineffectiveness of our remaining interest rate hedging contracts. 88 Table of Contents On September 27, 2007, we entered into an interest rate swap contract to fix the one-month LIBOR index rate (including a 1.25% spread), at 5.82% per annum on a notional amount of $96.7 million. The swap contract went into effect on October 22, 2007 and expired on October 29, 2008. At December 31, 2008, our outstanding variable rate debt based on LIBOR totaled approximately $385.5 million. At December 31, 2008, the interest rate on our variable rate debt was approximately 3.62%. If market interest rates on our variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest expense would have increased approximately $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. These amounts were determined solely by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. Due to the uncertainty of specific actions we may undertake to minimize possible effects of market interest rate increases, this analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure. Funds from Operations Pursuant to the revised definition of Funds from Operations adopted by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, we calculate Funds from Operations, or FFO, by adjusting net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP, including non-recurring items) for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures and preferred distributions. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. The use of FFO, combined with the required primary GAAP presentations, has been fundamentally beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a company real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. Amount represents our share, which was 85.49%, 85.32%, 84.40%, 83.74% and 82.97% for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, after allocation to the minority interest in the Operating Partnership. In addition to presenting FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, we also disclose FFO, as adjusted, which excludes the effects of the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate. Losses from early extinguishments of debt result when the sale of real estate encumbered by debt requires us to pay the extinguishment costs prior to the debt stated maturity and to write-off unamortized loan costs at the date of the extinguishment. Such costs are excluded from the gains on sales of real estate reported in accordance with GAAP. However, we view the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate as an incremental cost of the sale transactions because we extinguished the debt in connection with the consummation of the sale transactions and we had no intent to extinguish the debt absent such transactions. We believe that adjusting FFO to exclude these losses more appropriately reflects the results of our operations exclusive of the impact of our sale transactions. Although our FFO, as adjusted, clearly differs from NAREIT definition of FFO, and may not be comparable to that of other REITs and real estate companies, we believe it provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because we believe that by excluding the effects of the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate, management and investors are presented with an indicator of our operating performance that more closely achieves the objectives of the real estate industry in presenting FFO. Neither FFO, nor FFO as adjusted, should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance. Neither FFO nor FFO, as adjusted, represent cash 89 Table of Contents generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and neither of these measures is a measure of liquidity or an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO and FFO, as adjusted, should be compared with our reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table presents a reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders to FFO and FFO, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004: Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands) Net income available to common shareholders $ 125,232 $ 1,324,690 $ 873,635 $ 438,292 $ 284,017 Add: Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of minority interest 4,223 Minority interest in Operating Partnership 22,006 64,916 69,999 71,498 65,086 Less: Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 220,350 47,656 27,338 Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 6,206 16,104 15,327 16,292 Gains on sales of real estate and other assets, net of minority interest 28,502 789,238 606,394 151,884 8,149 Income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures (182,018 ) 20,428 24,507 4,829 3,380 Minority interests in property partnerships (1,997 ) (84 ) 2,013 6,017 4,685 Income before minority interests in property partnerships, income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures, minority interest in Operating Partnership, gains on sales of real estate and other assets, discontinued operations and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 302,751 353,468 294,616 288,300 289,259 Add: Real estate depreciation and amortization(1) 382,600 295,635 283,350 274,476 257,319 Income from discontinued operations 7,274 19,081 18,303 19,843 Income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures(2) (182,018 ) 4,975 6,590 4,829 3,380 Less: Minority interests in property partnerships share of Funds from Operations 3,949 437 479 113 922 Preferred distributions(3) 3,738 4,266 9,418 12,918 15,050 Funds from Operations 495,646 656,649 593,740 572,877 553,829 Add: Losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate 2,675 31,444 11,041 Funds from Operations after supplemental adjustment to exclude losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate 495,646 659,324 625,184 583,918 553,829 Less: Minority interest in Operating Partnership share of Funds from Operations after supplemental adjustment to exclude losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate 71,895 96,808 97,519 94,946 94,332 Funds from Operations available to common shareholders after supplemental adjustment to exclude losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate $ 423,751 $ 562,516 $ 527,665 $ 488,972 $ 459,497 Our percentage share of Funds from Operations basic 85.49 % 85.32 % 84.40 % 83.74 % 82.97 % Weighted average shares outstanding basic 119,980 118,839 114,721 111,274 106,458 90 Table of Contents (1) Real estate depreciation and amortization consists of depreciation and amortization from the Consolidated Statements of Operations of $304,147, $286,030, $270,562, $260,979 and $244,589, our share of unconsolidated joint venture real estate depreciation and amortization of $80,303, $8,247, $9,087, $8,554 and $6,814, and depreciation and amortization from discontinued operations of $0, $2,948, $6,197, $6,662 and $8,352, less corporate related depreciation and amortization of $1,850, $1,590, $1,584, $1,719 and $2,436 and adjustment of asset retirement obligations of $0, $0, $912, $0 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets. Our management also uses NOI to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. NOI excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property results of operations. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs and real estate companies that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. The following sets forth a reconciliation of NOI to net income available to common shareholders for the fiscal years 2004 through 2008.

We have various standing or renewable service contracts with vendors related to our property management. In addition, we have certain other utility contracts we enter into in the ordinary course of business that may extend beyond one year and that vary based on usage. These contracts are not included as part of our contractual obligations because they include terms that provide for cancellation with insignificant or no cancellation penalties. Contract terms are generally one year or less. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Joint Ventures We have investments in twelve unconsolidated joint ventures (including our investment in the Value-Added Fund) with our effective ownership interests ranging from 23.89% to 60%, all of which have mortgage indebtedness. We exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities and therefore they are presently accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

All adjustments related to EITF 98-1 are noted above. (2) In accordance with EITF 98-1, the principal amount and interest rate shown were adjusted upon acquisition of the property to reflect the fair value of the assumed note. (3) Principal amount does not include the assumed mezzanine loan with an aggregate principal amount of $294.0 million and a stated rate of 6.02% per annum, as the venture acquired the lenders interest in this loan for a purchase price of approximately $263.1 million in cash. (4) In connection with the capitalization of the joint venture, loans in an aggregate of $450.0 million were funded by the venture partners on a pro-rata basis. Our share of the partner loans totaling $270.0 million has been reflected in Related Party Note Receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. (5) The financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.25% per annum. (6) This property is owned by the Value-Added Fund. (7) Mortgage financing totals $26.0 million (of which approximately $24.0 million has been disbursed as of December 31, 2008). The mortgage bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 1.50% and matures on March 31, 2011 with two, one-year extension options. The Value-Added Fund has entered into an interest rate swap contract to fix the one-month LIBOR index rate at 4.085% per annum on a notional amount of $24 million. The swap contract went into effect on June 12, 2008 and expires on March 31, 2011. (8) Mortgage financing totals $120.0 million (of which $103.0 million was drawn at closing, $3.3 million was drawn to fund tenant and capital costs, with the remaining $13.7 million available to fund future tenant and capital costs). The mortgage bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 1.75% and matures on May 31, 2011 with two, one-year extension options. The Value-Added Fund has entered into three interest rate swap contracts to fix the one-month LIBOR index rate at 3.63% per annum on an aggregate notional amount of $103 million. The swap contracts went into effect on June 2, 2008 and expire on April 1, 2011. (9) Amount represents outstanding construction financing under a $66.0 million loan commitment collateralized by the retail entity of Wisconsin Place. Wisconsin Place is a mixed-use development project consisting of office, retail and residential properties located in Chevy Chase, Maryland. The construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.375% per annum and matures on March 29, 2010 with two, one-year extension options. Environmental Matters It is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental assessments (which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling) and asbestos surveys in connection with our acquisition of properties. These pre-purchase environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, 95 Table of Contents assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and we are not otherwise aware of environmental conditions with respect to our properties that we believe would have such a material adverse effect. However, from time to time environmental conditions at our properties have required and may in the future require environmental testing and/or regulatory filings, as well as remedial action. In February 1999, we (through a joint venture) acquired from Exxon Corporation a property in Massachusetts that was formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to contain soil and groundwater contamination. We developed an office park on the property. We engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was disturbed in the course of construction. Under the property acquisition agreement, Exxon agreed to (1) bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to our ownership, (2) continue monitoring and/or remediating such releases and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements, and (3) indemnify us for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions. Any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses, and there can be no assurance that the amounts paid under the indemnity, if any, would be sufficient to cover the liabilities arising from any such releases and discharges. Environmental investigations at some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates have identified groundwater contamination migrating from off-site source properties. In each case we engaged a licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations and assessments, and to prepare any required submittals to the regulatory authorities. In each case the environmental consultant concluded that the properties qualify under the regulatory program or the regulatory practice for a status which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at a site. We also believe that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory provisions or regulatory practices regarding upgradient releases. Although we believe that the current or former owners of the upgradient source properties may bear responsibility for some or all of the costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination, we will take such further response actions (if any) that we deem necessary or advisable. Other than periodic testing at some of these properties, no such additional response actions are anticipated at this time. Some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates are located in urban, industrial and other previously developed areas where fill or current or historical uses of the areas have caused site contamination. Accordingly, it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil and/or groundwater handling procedures and/or include particular building design features in connection with development, construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory closure and/or ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner. In these situations it is our practice to investigate the nature and extent of detected contamination and estimate the costs of required response actions and special handling procedures. We then use this information as part of our decision-making process with respect to the acquisition and/or development of the property. For example, we own a parcel in Massachusetts which was formerly used as a quarry/asphalt batching facility. Pre-purchase testing indicated that the site contained relatively low levels of certain contaminants. We have engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to monitor environmental conditions at the site and prepare necessary regulatory submittals based on the results of an environmental risk characterization. A submittal has been made to the regulatory authorities in order to achieve regulatory closure at this site. The submittal included an environmental deed restriction that mandates compliance with certain protective measures in a portion of the site where low levels of residual soil contamination have been left in place in accordance with applicable laws. Development activities have commenced on the site and this work will be performed in accordance with the environmental deed restriction and other environmental requirements applicable to the site. We expect that resolution of the environmental matters relating to the above will not have a material impact on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, we cannot assure you that we have identified all environmental liabilities at our properties, that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified, in full or at all, in the event that such environmental liabilities arise. 96 Table of Contents Newly Issued Accounting Standards In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB ) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ( SFAS No. 157 ). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value, which includes a hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value. SFAS No. 157 also expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 requires the categorization of financial assets and liabilities, based on the inputs to the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to the quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and lowest priority to unobservable inputs. SFAS No. 157 requires the use of observable market data, when available, in making fair value measurements. When inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The levels of the SFAS No. 157 fair value hierarchy are described as follows: Level 1 Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities in an active market that the Company has the ability to access. Level 2 Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3 Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. SFAS No. 157 became effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February 2008, the FASB deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The FASB also removed certain leasing transactions from the scope of SFAS No. 157. On January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157. We have financial instruments consisting of investments in securities and interest rate contracts that are required to be measured under SFAS No. 157. We currently do not have any non-financial assets or non-financial liabilities that are required to be measured under SFAS No. 157. We do not have any fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) as of December 31, 2008. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 ( SFAS No. 159 ). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose, at specified election dates, to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses shall be reported on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS No. 159 became effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. On January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 159 and have currently not elected to measure any financial instruments or other items (not currently required to be measured at fair value) at fair value. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations ( SFAS No. 141(R) ), which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer shall recognize and measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and goodwill acquired in a business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an Amendment of ARB No. 51 ( SFAS No. 160 ), which establishes and expands accounting and reporting standards for minority interests, which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests, in a subsidiary and the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 97 Table of Contents December 15, 2008. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have on our financial position and results of operations. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161 Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ( SFAS No. 161 ). SFAS No. 161 amends and expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133 with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of how derivative instruments and hedging activities affect an entity financial position, financial performance and cash flows. These disclosure requirements include a tabular summary of the fair values of derivative instruments and their gains and losses, disclosure of derivative features that are credit risk related to provide more information regarding an entity liquidity and cross-referencing within footnotes to make it easier for financial statement users to locate important information about derivative instruments. SFAS No. 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008 with early application encouraged. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 161 to have a material impact to us. On May 9, 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. ( FSP ) APB 14-1 Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) ( FSP No. APB 14-1 ) that requires the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) to be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects the issuer nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. FSP No. APB 14-1 requires that the initial proceeds from the sale of Boston Properties Limited Partnership $862.5 million of 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037, $450.0 million of 3.75% exchangeable senior notes due 2036 and $747.5 million of 3.625% exchangeable senior notes due 2014 be allocated between a liability component and an equity component in a manner that reflects interest expense at the interest rate of similar nonconvertible debt. The resulting debt discount will be amortized over the period during which the debt is expected to be outstanding (i.e., through the first optional redemption dates) as additional non-cash interest expense. Based on our understanding of the application of FSP No. APB 14-1, this will result in an aggregate of approximately $0.15 $0.16 per share (net of incremental capitalized interest) of additional non-cash interest expense for fiscal 2008 and approximately $0.23 $0.24 per share for fiscal 2009. Excluding the impact of capitalized interest, the additional non-cash interest expense will be approximately $0.19 $0.20 per share for fiscal 2008 and approximately $0.27 $0.28 per share for fiscal 2009. The additional non-cash interest expense (before netting) will increase in subsequent reporting periods through the first optional redemption dates as the debt accretes to its par value over the same period. FSP No. APB 14-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is not permitted. Upon adoption FSP No. APB 14-1 requires companies to retrospectively apply the requirements of the pronouncement to all periods presented. Our current estimate of the incremental interest expense excluding the impact of capitalized interest for each reporting period is as follows: For the year ended December 31: Approximate Amount (in thousands) 2006 $ 4,200 2007 19,300 2008 27,700 2009 38,600 2010 41,200 2011 43,900 2012 29,800 2013 23,000 2014 2,500 In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( SFAS No. 162 ), which is intended to improve financing reporting by identifying a consistent 98 Table of Contents framework or hierarchy for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States (the GAAP hierarchy). SFAS No. 162 is effective 60 days following the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendment to AU Section 411, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 162 to have a material impact on us. In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP EITF 03-06-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions are Participating Securities ( FSP EITF 03-06-1 ). FSP EITF 03-06-1 clarifies that unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of EPS pursuant to the two-class method. FSP EITF 03-06-1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. All prior-period EPS data presented shall be adjusted retrospectively (including interim financial statements, summaries of earnings, and selected financial data) to conform with the provisions of the FSP. Early application is not permitted. We do not expect the adoption of FSP EITF 03-06-1 to have a material impact on us. Inflation Substantially all of our leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations over a base amount. In addition, many of our leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed increases. We believe that inflationary increases in costs may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and operating expense escalations. 99 Table of Contents
