MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward looking statements This report and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business or others on our behalf, our beliefs and our management assumptions. In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward looking statements in press releases or written statements, or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls, and conference calls. Words such as expect, anticipate, outlook, could, target, project, intend, plan, believe, seek, estimate, should, may, assume, continue, variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We describe our respective risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could affect the outcome or results of operations in Item 1A. Risk Factors. We have based our forward looking statements on our management beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied, or forecast by our forward looking statements. Reference is made in particular to forward looking statements regarding product sales, reimbursement, expenses, earnings per share, liquidity and capital resources, and trends. Except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements after the distribution of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions, or otherwise. Overview The following management discussion and analysis ( MD&A ) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We are a global biotechnology company that discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets human therapeutics based on advances in cellular and molecular biology. Our mission is to serve patients. As a science-based, patient-focused organization, we discover and develop innovative therapies to treat grievous illness. We operate in one business segment human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis. We primarily earn revenues and income and generate cash from sales of human therapeutic products in the areas of inflammation, nephrology and supportive cancer care. For the year ended December 31, 2005, total revenues were $12,430 million and net income was $3,674 million, or $2.93 per share on a diluted basis. As of December 31, 2005, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $5,255 million. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, product sales represented 97% and 95% of total revenues, respectively. Over the last several years, our product sales growth has been primarily driven by sales of Aranesp (darbepoetin alfa), Enbrel (etanercept), and Neulasta (pegfilgrastim), which have benefited from share gains and/or market growth. We expect these products to continue to drive year over year sales growth in the near term. However, we expect that continued share gains will be more of a challenge than those achieved in previous years as we operate in a highly competitive environment. (See Competition in Item 1. Business for further information on the impact of competition on our business.) Going forward, we will continue to focus on share gains, but we will also increase our focus on both growing and penetrating the therapeutic areas in which our products are used. Our principal products have 54 attained significant sales levels, and for certain of our products, in a relatively short period of time. As a result, although we have experienced significant year over year sales growth as a result of share gains and/or market growth, in the near term, we expect our product sales growth to be lower than that achieved in the past several years. Most patients receiving our principal products for approved indications are covered by both government and private payer health care programs. (Through 2005, primary reimbursement for ENBREL was obtained from private payers but, beginning in 2006, ENBREL and Sensipar will be eligible for coverage from the U.S. government under Medicare Program Part D.) Therefore, our principal product sales and sales growth are and will be affected by government and private payer reimbursement policies. While we believe that our 2005 product sales were not significantly impacted by the reimbursement changes resulting from the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act (or the Medicare Modernization Act ( MMA )) that went into effect in 2005, additional provisions of the MMA and other regulations affecting reimbursement that went into effect on January 1, 2006 could affect our product sales and related sales growth in the future. However, we believe that such changes are not likely to be significant to our business in 2006. For additional information on reimbursement and its impact on our business, see Reimbursement in Item 1. Business . International product sales for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 represented 18% and 17% of total product sales and consisted principally of European sales. International product sales have grown significantly over the last several years driven by Aranesp and Neulasta reflecting continued penetration. However, we anticipate facing greater competition in Europe from the availability of biosimilar products. We expect that biosimilar erythropoietin products may be approved in the European Union ( EU ) beginning in late 2006 and could be available in the EU shortly after approval which would compete with Aranesp . We also expect that the first biosimilar G-CSF product may be approved as early as mid-2007 and that it would compete with Neulasta and NEUPOGEN (Filgrastim). We cannot predict whether or to what extent the entry of biosimilar products would impact future Aranesp , Neulasta or NEUPOGEN sales in the EU. (See Competition in Item 1. Business for further information regarding biosimilar products.) In order to maintain commercial success in Europe, we plan to continue to support the development of new standards of care and continue to actively convert NEUPOGEN patients to Neulasta , emphasizing its less frequent dosing requirements as compared to NEUPOGEN . Our international product sales are impacted by foreign currency changes (see Results of Operations discussion below). International product sales growth during 2005 and 2004 benefited by $46 million and $164 million, respectively, from foreign currency exchange rate changes. During 2005, international product sales for the first three quarters of the year benefited from foreign currency exchange rate changes, but were adversely affected in the fourth quarter. However, both the positive and negative impacts that movements in foreign exchange rates have on our international product sales are mitigated, in part, by the natural, opposite impact these exchange rate movements have on our international operating expenses and as a result of our foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impact, both positive and negative, that foreign exchange rate changes may have on our net income. As such, the impact to our net results of operations from changes in foreign currency exchange rates has been largely mitigated. For 2005 and 2004, operating income increased $1,500 million and $257 million over their respective prior year periods, primarily as a result of our product sales growth. Operating income as a percentage of product sales was 40% for 2005 and 34% for 2004. Operating income for 2004 was impacted by the IPR&D charge of $554 million relating to the acquisition of Tularik during 2004 (see Note 7, Acquisitions in the Consolidated Financial Statements). During 2005, we increased our operating expenses to advance our product pipeline and support our product sales growth. During 2005, selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses as a percentage of product sales decreased from 26% to 23% as we leveraged our prior year SG&A spending. In 2006, we expect our R&D expenses to grow 30-40%, principally as a result 55 of significant increases in our clinical development activities discussed below. To support this increased investment in our pipeline, SG&A expenses in 2006 are expected to grow at a rate comparable to the 2005 growth rate. As a result of the significant anticipated growth in R&D expenses, we expect our 2006 operating expenses to grow at a higher rate than our anticipated 2006 product sales growth. We focus our R&D on novel human therapeutics for the treatment of grievous illness. (See Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates in Item 1. Business for further information on our R&D vision and product pipeline.) In December 2005, we signed a definitive merger agreement under which we will pay shareholders of Abgenix, Inc. ( Abgenix ) $22.50 in cash per common share for a total value of approximately $2.2 billion and will assume Abgenix outstanding debt. Abgenix is a company specializing in the discovery, development and manufacture of human therapeutic antibodies and is our co-development partner for panitumumab. The Federal Trade Commission approved the merger on January 19, 2006 and we expect to close the merger, subject to Abgenix shareholder approval, by April 2006. (See Joint Ventures and Business Relationships Abgenix, Inc. in Item 1. Business for further information on the co-development agreement with Abgenix.) We have expanded and will need to continue to significantly expand our clinical development resources, including human capital, to manage and execute increasingly larger and more complex clinical trials. In 2006, we are expecting a significant increase in the number, size, duration and complexity of our clinical trials, in particular with respect to denosumab, our late-stage investigational product for osteoporosis, and we expect total research and development expenses to increase by 30-40%. For example, testing denosumab in the osteoporosis setting requires large clinical trials, substantial time and resources to recruit patients and significant expense to execute. We expect to start eleven mega-site trials (involving 200 or more sites) in 2006 to support denosumab and our other late-stage programs. To execute our clinical trial programs, we need to accelerate the growth of our development organization, implement new management structures and approaches and increase dependence on third-party contract clinical trial providers. Further, to increase the number of patients available for enrollment for our clinical trials, we are planning to open clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of new geographic locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited, including Russia, China, India and some South American countries. We plan to conduct clinical trial activities in these new territories through third-party contract clinical trial providers. There are many economic and industry-wide factors that affect our business, including, among others, those relating to increased complexity and cost of R&D, increasingly intense competition for our currently marketed products and product candidates, broad reimbursement changes, complex and expanding regulatory requirements, and intellectual property protection. (See Item 1. Business and Item 1A. Risk Factors for further information on these economic and industry-wide factors and their impact and potential impact on our business.) In addition to these economic and industry-wide factors, we, as a company, face certain additional challenges and have a number of opportunities as well. We have established leadership positions with all of our principal products, attaining significant sales levels, and for certain of our products, in a relatively short period of time. As a result, we expect our product sales growth rates in the near term will be lower than those achieved in the past several years. We expect increasing competition internationally as the first biosimilar products may be available in Europe shortly after the anticipated approval in late 2006 and in the anemia area worldwide, as the related business opportunities are significant and growing. We believe that future sales growth for certain of our principal products should benefit from increased penetration and market growth through new areas of treatment and/or greater awareness. Further, over the last several years, our pipeline has substantially increased and with that comes the challenge of delivering on the pipeline, including executing on large and complex clinical trials. Our strategy to overcome these challenges and to be successful in taking advantage of our opportunities is straightforward. We plan to: Focus solely on human therapeutics 56 Invest heavily in R&D and be productive Pursue organic growth supplemented by external investments and partnerships Secure and defend our intellectual property Hire and retain the best people In the near term, our 2006 objectives are straightforward as well. We intend to balance short-term financial performance with significant R&D investment to drive long-term growth. We plan to grow our markets and hold or increase share. We will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property and plan to take steps to grow our anemia business. We will continue to proactively manage and expand our production capacity ensuring that our commercial and clinical manufacturing is reliable and not subject to a single-point failure. As always, compliance with regulations and laws is of the utmost importance to us and we intend to sustain and enhance our very good compliance record. Lastly, remaining entrepreneurial, aggressive, and patient-focused as we grow larger will enable us to fulfill these objectives and our mission to serve patients. Results of Operations Product sales For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, total product sales by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions): 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 Total U.S. $ 9,892 19 % $ 8,279 22 % $ 6,764 Total International 2,130 25 % 1,698 54 % 1,104 Total product sales. $ 12,022 20 % $ 9,977 27 % $ 7,868 Product sales are influenced by a number of factors, including demand, third-party reimbursement availability and policies, pricing strategies, wholesaler and end-user inventory management practices, foreign exchange effects, new product launches and indications, competitive products, product supply, and acquisitions. (See Principal Products in Item 1. Business for a discussion of our principal products and their approved indications.) Sales growth in 2005 was principally driven by demand for Aranesp , ENBREL, and Neulasta , which have benefited from share gains and/or market growth. International product sales growth benefited by $46 million from foreign currency exchange rate changes. During 2005, the first three quarters of the year benefited from foreign currency exchange rate changes, but were adversely affected in the fourth quarter. Sales growth in 2004 was principally driven by demand for Aranesp , ENBREL, and Neulasta . U.S. sales for Aranesp and Neulasta were impacted by higher incentives earned by customers under performance-based contracts. International product sales growth benefited by $164 million from foreign currency exchange rate changes. We expect Aranesp , ENBREL, and Neulasta to continue to drive year over year sales growth in the near term. However, we expect that continued share gains will be more of a challenge than those achieved in previous years as we operate in a highly competitive environment. Going forward, we will continue to focus on share gains, but we will also increase our focus on both growing and penetrating the therapeutic areas in which our products are used. 57 In 2005, we believe that our product sales were not significantly impacted by the reimbursement changes resulting from the MMA. We believe this was, in part, due to the effects of CMS oncology demonstration project (the 2005 Demonstration Project ) on sales of our products used in supportive cancer care, especially Aranesp . Furthermore, we believe this was also, in part, due to increased reimbursement rates to physicians from CMS for services associated with drug administration. The 2005 Demonstration Project, which provided financial incentives to physicians for collecting and reporting oncology patient survey data, expired on December 31, 2005. In November 2005, CMS announced a new demonstration project (the 2006 Demonstration Project ) that uses different criteria for how patients with cancer are evaluated and treated and that is targeted at approximately half of the funding originally targeted for the 2005 Demonstration Project. The final rule for the 2006 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Payment Final Rule issued in November 2005 reduced payments for physician services in 2006 by approximately 4.4% on average. However recently passed legislation will eliminate this reduction for 2006. Because we cannot accurately predict the impact of any such changes on how, or under what circumstances, healthcare providers will prescribe or administer our products, we cannot estimate the full impact of the MMA on our business. However, we believe that it is not likely to be significant to our business in 2006. For additional information on reimbursement and its impact on our business, see Reimbursement in Item 1. Business. Aranesp For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, total Aranesp sales by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions): 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 Aranesp U.S. $ 2,104 37 % $ 1,533 56 % $ 980 Aranesp International 1,169 24 % 940 67 % 564 Total Aranesp $ 3,273 32 % $ 2,473 60 % $ 1,544 The increase in U.S. Aranesp sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily driven by market growth and share gains. Sales growth for 2005 was slightly impacted by higher incentives earned by customers attaining higher sales volumes and growth under performance-based contracts. Although the ASPs for U.S. Aranesp trended downward during 2005, we believe that they began to stabilize during the fourth quarter of 2005. In 2005, Aranesp usage in U.S. hospital dialysis clinics increased, reflecting a conversion from EPOGEN (Epoetin alfa). This conversion is expected to stabilize by mid 2006. International Aranesp sales growth for 2005 was principally driven by demand, benefiting only slightly, $20 million, from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in U.S. Aranesp sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 was driven by demand, which benefited from share gains in both oncology and nephrology and market growth. Sales growth was impacted by higher incentives earned by customers attaining higher sales volumes and growth under performance-based contracts. The increase in international Aranesp sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 was principally driven by demand, and to a lesser extent, favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. International Aranesp sales growth for 2004 also benefited by $92 million from foreign currency exchange rate changes. For 2006, we believe Aranesp sales growth will be driven primarily by market growth and greater penetration from extended dosing. However, we believe future worldwide Aranesp sales growth will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: reimbursement by third-party payers (including governments and private insurance plans) (see Item 1A. Risk Factors Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products. ); cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on health care providers; governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines 58 relating to the use of our products; government programs such as the 2006 Demonstration Project; penetration of new and existing markets; patient population growth; the effects of pricing strategies; competitive products or therapies, including biosimilar products in Europe; the development of new treatments for cancer; and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Further, sales of Aranesp have been and may continue to be benefited by its use in U.S. hospital dialysis clinics to treat anemia associated with chronic renal failure instead of EPOGEN . This conversion is expected to stabilize by mid 2006. EPOGEN 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 (Amounts in millions) EPOGEN U.S. $ 2,455 (6 )% $ 2,601 7 % $ 2,435 EPOGEN sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased primarily due to lower demand, unfavorable changes in wholesaler inventory levels, and an unfavorable revised estimate of dialysis demand, primarily spillover, for prior quarters. Demand for 2005 was affected by conversion to Aranesp in the U.S. hospital dialysis clinics, which has represented approximately 10% of the EPOGEN business, and reflects higher sales incentives. This conversion to Aranesp is expected to stabilize by mid 2006. Demand for EPOGEN in the freestanding dialysis clinics remains consistent with patient population growth at approximately 3% to 4%. Spillover is a result of our contractual relationship with Johnson & Johnson (see Summary of Critical Accounting Policies EPOGEN revenue recognition and Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies Product sales to the Consolidated Financial Statements). For the year ended December 31, 2004, the growth in reported EPOGEN sales was primarily driven by demand, which reflects dialysis patient population growth and a continued focus in the renal community on patient outcomes, and to a lesser extent, increases in wholesaler inventory levels. We believe EPOGEN should experience sales growth in 2006 primarily as a result of patient population growth and the stabilization of conversion to Aranesp in the U.S. hospital dialysis clinics by mid 2006. Patients receiving treatment for anemia associated with end stage renal disease with EPOGEN are covered primarily under medical programs provided by the federal government. Therefore, we believe EPOGEN sales growth will further depend on changes in reimbursement rates or a change in the basis for reimbursement by the federal government (see Item 1A. Risk Factors Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products. ). We believe EPOGEN sales growth will also be dependent, in part, on future governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products, cost containment pressures from the federal government on health care providers and the effects of pricing. 59 Neulasta /NEUPOGEN For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, total Neulasta and NEUPOGEN (Filgrastim) sales by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions): 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 Neulasta U.S. $ 1,900 29 % $ 1,476 26 % $ 1,175 NEUPOGEN U.S. 805 3 % 778 (12 )% 881 U.S. Neulasta /NEUPOGEN Total 2,705 20 % 2,254 10 % 2,056 Neulasta International 388 47 % 264 230 % 80 NEUPOGEN International 411 4 % 397 3 % 386 International Neulasta /NEUPOGEN Total 799 21 % 661 42 % 466 Total Worldwide Neulasta /NEUPOGEN $ 3,504 20 % $ 2,915 16 % $ 2,522 The increase in U.S. Neulasta /NEUPOGEN sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 was driven primarily by demand for Neulasta , which benefited from recent guidelines recommending earlier use. U.S. Neulasta /NEUPOGEN sales, Neulasta in particular, also benefited from a label extension based on new clinical data demonstrating the value of first cycle use in moderate risk chemotherapy regimens. In addition, U.S. sales growth was slightly impacted by higher incentives earned by customers attaining higher sales volumes and growth under performance-based contracts. Although the ASPs for U.S. Neulasta have trended downward during 2005, we believe that they began to stabilize during the fourth quarter of 2005. The increase in international Neulasta /NEUPOGEN sales for the year ended December 31, 2005, was driven primarily by demand for Neulasta . International Neulasta /NEUPOGEN sales for 2005 also benefited by $18 million from foreign currency exchange rate changes. The increase in U.S. Neulasta /NEUPOGEN sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily driven by demand for Neulasta , which benefited from new clinical data demonstrating the value of first cycle use. Sales growth was impacted by higher incentives earned by customers attaining higher sales volumes and growth under performance-based contracts. The increase in international Neulasta /NEUPOGEN sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily due to demand for Neulasta , which reflects continued market penetration since the January 2003 launch of Neulasta in Europe, and to a lesser extent, favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. International Neulasta /NEUPOGEN sales growth for 2004 benefited by $65 million from favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe that 2006 sales growth for Neulasta /NEUPOGEN will be primarily driven by greater first cycle use due to increased awareness of febrile neutropenia. However, future worldwide Neulasta /NEUPOGEN sales growth will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: reimbursement by third-party payers (including governments and private insurance plans) (see Item 1A. Risk Factors Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products. ); cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on health care providers; governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products; government programs such as the 2006 Demonstration Project; penetration of existing markets; patient population growth; the effects of pricing strategies; competitive products or therapies, including follow-on biologic products in Europe; the development of new treatments for cancer; and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Future chemotherapy treatments that are less myelosuppressive may require less Neulasta /NEUPOGEN , however, other future chemotherapy treatments that are more myelosuppressive, such as dose dense chemotherapy, could require more Neulasta /NEUPOGEN . NEUPOGEN competes with Neulasta in the United States and Europe. U.S. NEUPOGEN sales have been adversely impacted by conversion to 60 Neulasta . However, we believe that most of the conversion in the United States has occurred. In Europe, we plan to continue actively converting NEUPOGEN patients to Neulasta , emphasizing its less frequent dosing requirements as compared to NEUPOGEN . However, we cannot accurately predict the rate or timing of future conversion of NEUPOGEN patients to Neulasta in Europe. ENBREL For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions): 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 ENBREL U.S. $ 2,470 35 % $ 1,827 46 % $ 1,254 ENBREL International 103 41 % 73 59 % 46 Total ENBREL $ 2,573 35 % $ 1,900 46 % $ 1,300 ENBREL sales growth for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was driven by demand, reflecting strong growth in both rheumatology and dermatology. ENBREL sales growth has benefited from its competitive profile and significant growth of biologics in both the rheumatology and dermatology settings. In dermatology, ENBREL has grown significantly since its approval for moderate to severe psoriasis in April of 2004 and is the number one prescribed systemic therapy in this area. We believe 2006 sales growth will be driven by increased penetration in both the rheumatology and dermatology settings and as a result of ENBREL being eligible for coverage from the U.S. government under Medicare Program Part D beginning in 2006. However, future ENBREL sales growth will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: the effects of competing products or therapies; penetration of existing and new markets, including potential new indications; the availability and extent of reimbursement by government and third-party payers; and governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products (see Item 1A. Risk Factors Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products ). Selected operating expenses The following table summarizes selected operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 (amounts in millions): 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 Product sales $ 12,022 20 % $ 9,977 27 % $ 7,868 Operating expenses: Cost of sales (excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets) $ 2,082 20 % $ 1,731 29 % $ 1,341 % of product sales 17 % 17 % 17 % Research and development $ 2,314 14 % $ 2,028 23 % $ 1,655 % of product sales 19 % 20 % 21 % Write-off of acquired in-process research and development $ 554 Selling, general and administrative $ 2,790 9 % $ 2,556 31 % $ 1,957 % of product sales 23 % 26 % 25 % 61 Cost of sales Cost of sales, which excludes the amortization of acquired intangible assets (see Consolidated Statements of Operations ), increased 20% for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to higher sales volumes. Costs of sales for 2005 was also impacted by the $47 million write-off of a semi-completed manufacturing asset that will not be used due to a change in manufacturing strategy. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2006 is expected to be comparable to 2005. Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2004, increased 29% primarily driven by higher sales volumes, and to a lesser extent, higher manufacturing costs due to changes in the product mix. Research and development R&D expenses are primarily comprised of salaries and benefits associated with R&D personnel, overhead and occupancy costs, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs, contract services, and other outside costs. R&D expenses increased 14% for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily driven by higher staff-related costs, which included the full year integration of the Tularik operations and the buildup of our R&D organization to support the growth in our pipeline. The 2005 growth also reflects higher costs relating to key clinical trials and clinical manufacturing, including the continued ramp up of large-scale phase 3 trials for denosumab (formally known as AMG 162), Amgen investigational therapy for bone loss. In 2005, staff-related costs and clinical trial and clinical manufacturing costs increased approximately $171 million and $118 million, respectively. In 2006, we expect our total R&D expenses to increase 30-40% primarily due to higher staff-related costs and a significant increase in clinical trial and clinical manufacturing costs. Staff-related costs are expected to increase due to a significant increase in personnel throughout 2006. Clinical trial and clinical manufacturing costs are expected to increase due to several large ongoing late-stage clinical trials initiated in 2005 as well as additional planned trials for 2006. These include trials in denosumab, panitumumab, AMG 706, Aranesp , Sensipar , and ENBREL (see Item 1. Business Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates. ) Our expected increase in R&D costs for 2006 does not include any incremental R&D costs associated with the proposed acquisition of Abgenix (see Item 1. Business Joint Ventures and Business Relationships Abgenix, Inc. ) In 2004, R&D expenses increased 23% over the prior year, primarily driven by higher staff-related costs including the addition of R&D personnel from Tularik, and to a lesser extent, higher costs relating to clinical manufacturing and key clinical trials costs, including the commencement of large-scale phase 3 trials for AMG 162, Amgen investigational therapy for bone loss. In 2004, staff-related costs and clinical manufacturing and clinical trial costs increased approximately $233 million and $122 million, respectively. Acquired in-process research and development IPR&D represents an estimate of the fair value of the various R&D projects and technologies in the acquired company pipeline that, as of the acquisition date, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. In 2004, we incurred a charge of $554 million, associated with writing off the fair value of IPR&D acquired in the Tularik acquisition (see Note 7, Acquisitions in the Consolidated Financial Statements). Assuming successful completion of the proposed acquisition of Abgenix expected to close by April 2006, we would expect to incur a charge for IPR&D. However, the amount of this charge has not yet been determined. 62 Selling, general and administrative SG&A expenses are primarily comprised of salaries and benefits associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal, and other administrative personnel; outside marketing expenses; overhead and occupancy costs; and other general and administrative costs. SG&A increased 9% for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to higher outside marketing expenses in support of our principal products. Outside marketing expenses include the Wyeth profit share related to ENBREL, which has increased due to ENBREL sales growth. In 2005, outside marketing expenses and staff-related costs increased approximately $241 million and $42 million, respectively. During 2005, SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased from 26% to 23% as we leveraged our prior year SG&A spending. In 2006, we expect higher Wyeth profit share expense due to expected ENBREL sales growth. However, total SG&A expense growth for 2006 is expected to be comparable to 2005 growth to allow greater investment in the pipeline. In 2004, SG&A increased 31% for the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to higher staff-related costs and higher outside marketing expenses, which reflects higher spending to support our products in competitive markets and sales growth. In 2004, staff-related costs and outside marketing expenses increased approximately $255 million and $236 million, respectively. Other items, net In 2005, other items, net consisted of a $49 million charge, net of amounts previously accrued, for settling certain legal matters associated with a patent legal proceeding. In 2003, other items, net consisted of a benefit for the recovery of costs and expenses associated with a legal award related to an arbitration proceeding with Johnson & Johnson of $74 million, partially offset by a charitable contribution to the Amgen Foundation of $50 million. (See Note 12, Other items, net , to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.) Income taxes Our effective tax rate was 24.5%, 30.4%, and 28.8% for 2005, 2004, and 2003 respectively. Our effective tax rate for 2005 has decreased primarily due to favorable resolution of prior year foreign tax credit claims and research and development tax credits with the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ), and the absence of the write-off of non-deductible IPR&D costs in connection with the acquisition of Tularik in 2004. This decrease was partially offset by the tax on the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The 2004 effective tax rate was higher than the 2003 effective tax rate due to the write-off of non-deductible IPR&D costs of $554 million in connection with the acquisition of Tularik. This increase was partially offset by an increase in the amount of foreign earnings intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. As permitted in Accounting Principles Board Opinion ( APB ) No. 23, Accounting for Income Taxes Special Areas , we do not provide U.S. income taxes on our controlled foreign corporations undistributed earnings that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. On October 22, 2004, the President of the United States signed the American Jobs Creation Act, which provided a temporary incentive to repatriate undistributed foreign earnings. One provision of the American Jobs Creation Act effectively reduced the tax rate by providing an 85% dividend-received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we repatriated $500 million of foreign earnings, which was the maximum amount of foreign earnings qualifying for the reduced tax rate. The tax expense incurred on the repatriation was approximately $43 million. (See Note 3, Income taxes , to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.) 63 Stock option expense In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ( SFAS ) No. 123R, Share-Based Payment. Subsequently, the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) provided for a phase-in implementation process for SFAS No. 123R, which required us to adopt the new accounting standard no later than January 1, 2006. SFAS No. 123R requires us to account for our stock options using a fair-value-based method as described in such statement and recognize the resulting compensation expense in our financial statements. Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for our employee stock options using the intrinsic value method under APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related Interpretations, which generally results in no employee stock option expense. We adopted SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and do not plan to restate our financial statements for prior periods. We plan to continue to use the Black-Scholes option valuation model in estimating the fair value of the stock option awards issued under SFAS No. 123R. The adoption of SFAS No. 123R will have a material impact on our results of operations. The actual annual stock option expense in 2006 is dependent on a number of factors including the number of stock options granted, our common stock price and related expected volatility, and other inputs utilized in estimating the fair value of the stock options at the time of grant. We expect the impact of stock option compensation expense to be in the range of $0.12 to $0.14 per share in 2006 compared to $0.19 for 2005 (see Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies Employee stock options in the Consolidated Financial Statements). The estimated impact of stock option expense for 2006 is less than the corresponding pro forma expense amount for 2005 principally due to a reduction in the estimated number of stock options to be granted in 2006 in favor of a combination of other equity awards. Other equity awards are comprised of restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance units. Stock-based compensation expense relating to these other equity awards for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $106 million and $45 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2003, stock-based compensation expense relating to other equity awards was not significant. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes selected financial data (amounts in millions): December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 5,255 $ 5,808 Total assets 29,297 29,221 Current debt 1,173 Non-current debt 3,957 3,937 Stockholders equity 20,451 19,705 We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations, and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future, as well as to support our stock repurchase programs and other business initiatives, including acquisitions and licensing activities (see Item 1. Business Joint Ventures and Business Relationships Abgenix, Inc. for further discussion regarding the proposed Abgenix acquisition). However, in order to provide for greater financial flexibility and liquidity, we may raise additional capital from time to time by accessing both public and private markets. (See Financing Arrangements for a discussion regarding February 2006 financing activities.) Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities Of the total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at December 31, 2005, approximately $3.1 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use outside the 64 United States. If these funds are repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, additional taxes on certain of these amounts would be required to be paid. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we repatriated $500 million of foreign earnings, which was the maximum amount of foreign earnings qualifying for the reduced tax rate under the American Jobs Act. The repatriation of these funds resulted in an increase in our tax provision of $43 million. The primary objectives for our marketable securities portfolio, which is primarily comprised of fixed income investments, are liquidity and safety of principal. Investments are made with the objective of achieving the highest rate of return, consistent with these two objectives. Our investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer. Financing arrangements As of December 31, 2005 we had convertible notes (30-year, zero-coupon convertible notes) with an accreted value of $1.8 billion outstanding and having an aggregate face amount of $2.36 billion and yield to maturity of 1.125% ( convertible notes ). The holders of the convertible notes may require us to purchase, generally for cash, all or a portion of their convertible notes on various dates (the Put Option ), at a price equal to the original issuance price plus the accrued original issue discount through the purchase date. The earliest date was on March 1, 2006, however, the holders of substantially all of the convertible notes did not require us to repurchase such notes on that date. The next date that the holders of these notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of these notes is on March 1, 2007. Accordingly, the convertible notes were classified as non-current in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005. Holders of the convertible notes may convert each of their convertible notes according to the terms as outlined in Note 4, Financing arrangements in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Moody and Standard & Poor rate our outstanding convertible notes A2 and A+, respectively. As of December 31, 2005 we had $2.0 billion of long-term notes outstanding. These long-term notes consisted of: 1) $1.0 billion of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.0% and mature in 2009 (the 2009 Notes, ), and 2) $1.0 billion of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.85% and mature in 2014 (the 2014 Notes. ) Moody and Standard & Poor rate our outstanding long-term senior notes A2 and A+, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, we had $200 million of additional long-term debt securities outstanding. These long-term debt securities consisted of: 1) $100 million of debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.5% and mature in 2007 (the 2007 Notes ) under a $500 million debt shelf registration (the $500 Million Shelf ), and 2) $100 million of debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate of 8.1% and mature in 2097 (the Century Notes ). Our outstanding long-term debt is rated A2 by Moody and A+ by Standard & Poor s. Under the $500 Million Shelf, all of the remaining $400 million of debt securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time under our medium-term note program with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. In February 2006, we issued $2.5 billion principal amount of convertible notes due in 2011 (the 2011 Convertible Notes ) and $2.5 billion principal amount of convertible notes due in 2013 (the 2013 Convertible Notes ) in a private placement. The 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 0.125% and 0.375%, respectively. The 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes may be convertible based on an initial conversion rate of 12.5247 shares and 12.5814 shares, respectively, per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $79.84 and $79.48 per share, respectively). The 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes may only be converted: 1) during any calendar quarter beginning after June 30, 2006 if the closing price of our common stock exceeds 130% of the respective conversion price per share during a defined period at the end of the previous quarter, 2) if we make specified distributions to holders 65 of our common stock or specified corporate transactions occur, or 3) one month prior to the respective maturity date. Upon conversion, a holder would receive: 1) cash equal to the lesser of the principal amount of the note or the conversion value, as defined, and 2) to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the note, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of common stock and cash, at our option (the excess conversion value ). In addition, upon a change in control, as defined, the holders may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their notes for 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. A total of $3.0 billion of the net proceeds from these debt issuances were used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase program. Concurrent with the issuance of the 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes, we purchased convertible note hedges in private transactions. The convertible note hedges allow us to receive shares of our common stock and/or cash from the counterparties to the transactions equal to the amounts of common stock and/or cash related to the excess conversion value that we would pay to the holders of the 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes upon conversion. These transactions will terminate the earlier of the maturity dates of the related notes or the first day none of the related notes remain outstanding due to conversion or otherwise. The convertible note hedges, which cost an aggregate of approximately $1.5 billion, will be recorded as a reduction of equity. Also concurrent with the issuance of the 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes, we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $107.90 per share in a private placement. Pursuant to these transactions, warrants for 31.3 million shares of our common stock may be settled in May 2011 and warrants for 31.5 million shares of our common stock may be settled in May 2013 (the settlement dates ). If the average price of our common stock during a defined period ending on or about the respective settlement dates exceeds the exercise price of the warrants, the warrants will be settled, at our option, in cash or shares of our common stock. Proceeds received from the issuance of the warrants totaled approximately $774 million. We have a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility to be used for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper support, which matures in November 2010. Additionally, we have a commercial paper program, which provides for unsecured, short-term borrowings of up to an aggregate of $1.2 billion. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility or commercial paper program as of December 31, 2005. We have a $1.0 billion shelf registration (the $1 Billion Shelf ) which allows us to issue debt securities, common stock, and associated preferred share purchase rights, preferred stock, warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock or preferred stock, securities purchase contracts, securities purchase units and depositary shares. The $1 Billion Shelf was established to provide for further financial flexibility and the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2005, no securities had been issued under the $1 Billion Shelf. Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants and as of December 31, 2005, we are in compliance with all applicable covenants. Cash flows The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 (amounts in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 4,911 $ 3,697 $ 3,567 Net cash used in investing activities (59 ) (1,399 ) (3,210 ) Net cash used in financing activities (4,538 ) (1,609 ) (1,372 ) 66 Operating Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2005 resulted primarily from higher cash receipts from customers driven by the growth in product sales and timing differences of cash payments relating to our tax and other accrued liabilities (see Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows). The increase in cash provided by operations for 2004 resulted primarily from higher cash receipts from customers driven by growth in product sales. This increase was partially offset primarily by the timing of cash payments related to our tax liabilities (see Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows). Investing Capital expenditures totaled $867 million in 2005 compared with $1.3 billion in 2004 and $1.4 billion in 2003. Capital expenditures in 2005 primarily related to the Puerto Rico manufacturing expansion which included a new manufacturing plant for the commercial production of Neulasta and NEUPOGEN approved by the FDA in September 2005, Thousand Oaks site expansion, Colorado manufacturing expansion, and site development to support the new ENBREL manufacturing plant in Rhode Island, also approved by the FDA in September 2005. Capital expenditures in 2004 primarily related to the Thousand Oaks site expansion, the new ENBREL manufacturing plant in Rhode Island, and the Puerto Rico manufacturing expansion. Capital expenditures in 2003 related to the new ENBREL manufacturing plant in Rhode Island, the Puerto Rico manufacturing expansion, and the Seattle research center which was completed in January 2004. We currently estimate 2006 spending on capital projects and equipment to be in excess of $1 billion as we continue to increase our manufacturing and R&D operations globally. The most significant of these expenditures are expected to be incurred with the start of engineering and construction of a new process development, bulk manufacturing and formulation, fill, and finish facility in Ireland, the further expansion of the Puerto Rico bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill, and finish facilities, the expansion of R&D operations at existing sites in the United States and the United Kingdom and the construction of a new development center in Uxbridge, United Kingdom. For additional information on our planned capital projects, see Item 1. Business Manufacturing and Raw Materials. In addition, we expect to spend approximately $2.2 billion by the end of April 2006, in conjunction with our proposed acquisition of Abgenix. We will also assume Abgenix debt in connection with this proposed transaction. 67 Financing In December 2004, the Board of Directors (the Board ) authorized us to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of common stock. Additionally, in December 2005, the Board authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $5.0 billion of common stock. As of December 31, 2005, $6.5 billion was available for stock repurchases under these programs. The manner of purchases, amount we spend, and the number of shares repurchased will vary based on a variety of factors including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares, and may include private block purchases as well as market transactions. Repurchases under our stock repurchase programs reflect, in part, our confidence in the long-term value of Amgen common stock. Additionally, we believe that it is an effective way of returning cash to our stockholders. A summary of our repurchase activity for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 is as follows (amounts in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Shares Dollars Shares Dollars Shares Dollars First quarter 26.8 $ 1,675 10.1 $ 650 8.2 $ 451 Second quarter 12.1 750 17.4 1,000 7.3 449 Third quarter 9.5 769 24.0 1,398 4.8 323 Fourth quarter 14.8 1,236 17.6 1,024 9.4 578 Total 63.2 $ 4,430 69.1 $ 4,072 29.7 $ 1,801 (See Item 5. Market for Registrant Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters Item 5(c). Changes in Securities, Use of Proceeds and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for additional information regarding our stock repurchase programs.) On March 2, 2005, as a result of certain holders of the convertible notes exercising their March 1, 2005 put option, we repurchased $1.6 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible notes at their then-accreted value for $1.2 billion in cash, or approximately 40%, of the outstanding convertible notes. We receive cash from the exercise of employee stock options and proceeds from the sale of stock pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan. Employee stock option exercises and proceeds from the sale of stock by us pursuant to the employee stock purchase plans provided $1.1 billion, $453 million, and $529 million of cash during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 respectively. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options will vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the market value of our stock relative to the exercise price of such options. In November 2004, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior notes due 2009 and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.85% senior notes due 2014. The net proceeds totaled $1,989 million and were intended for purchases of stock under the stock repurchase program then in affect and for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and working capital. In February 2006, we raised $5.0 billion of cash proceeds by issuing convertible notes at par in a private placement. Of the $5.0 billion convertible notes, $2.5 billion pay interest at 0.125 percent and are due in 2011 and $2.5 billion pay interest at 0.375 percent and are due in 2013. A total of $3.0 billion of the net proceeds from these debt issuances were used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase program. Concurrent with the issuance of the convertible notes, we purchased convertible note hedges at a cost of approximately $1.5 billion. Also in February 2006, we sold 62.8 million warrants to acquire shares of our common stock for proceeds of $774 million, 31.3 million of which may be settled in May 2011 and 31.5 million of which may be settled in May 2013. For further information on these transactions, see Financing arrangements above. 68 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our financial position or results of operations. Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Accordingly, the table below excludes contractual obligations relating to milestone and royalty payments due to third parties and purchase price consideration for proposed mergers and acquisitions (see Item 1. Business Joint Ventures and Business Relationships Abgenix, Inc. ), all of which are contingent upon certain future events. Such events could include, but are not limited to, development milestones, regulatory approvals, product sales, and shareholder approval for proposed transactions. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. The following chart represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005, aggregated by type (in millions): Payments due by period Contractual obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 years Long-term debt obligations(1) $ 5,326 $ 103 $ 2,081 (2) $ 1,150 $ 1,992 Operating lease obligations 658 74 129 94 361 Purchase obligations(3) 2,879 1,249 1,014 331 285 Total contractual obligations $ 8,863 $ 1,426 $ 3,224 $ 1,575 $ 2,638 (1) The long-term obligation amounts in the above table differ from the related carrying amounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005 due to the accretion of the original issue discount on the convertible notes and the inclusion of future interest payments. Future interest payments are included on the 2007 Notes, the 2009 Notes, the 2014 Notes, and the Century Notes at fixed rates of 6.5%, 4.00%, 4.85%, and 8.1%, respectively, through maturity in 2007, 2009, 2014, and 2097, respectively. (2) Holders of the convertible notes could have required us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on specific dates as early as March 1, 2006 at the original issuance price plus accrued original issue discount ( accreted value ) through the purchase dates. However, the holders of substantially all of the convertible notes did not require us to repurchase such notes on this date. Consequently, the amounts above reflect the convertible notes accreted value on March 1, 2007, the next put date. (See Note 4, Financing arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the terms of the convertible notes.) (3) Purchase obligations primarily relate to (1) our long-term supply agreement with BI Pharma for the manufacture of commercial quantities of ENBREL, which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity for ENBREL and reflect certain estimates such as production run success rates and bulk drug yields achieved; (2) R&D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (3) capital expenditures for engineering and construction which primarily relate to the Colorado manufacturing projects, Thousand Oaks research and development expansion and site development, Rhode Island site development, and certain ongoing Puerto Rico manufacturing projects; and (4) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the 69 ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Product sales, sales incentives and returns Sales of our products other than EPOGEN (see EPOGEN revenue recognition below) are recognized when shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. This typically occurs at the time products are shipped to the customer, generally a wholesale distributor. In the United States, we utilize these wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers such as clinics, hospitals, and pharmacies. Products we sell outside the United States are principally distributed to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending upon the distribution practice in each country for which the product has been launched. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesale distributors using third-party data, and we believe that wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales incentives and returns. Accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts, and other incentives (collectively sales incentives ) are recorded in the same period that the related sales are recorded and are recognized as a reduction in product sales. Sales incentive accruals are based on reasonable estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data, and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales incentives are product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold. Reductions in product sales relating to sales incentives are comprised of the following (amounts in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Rebates $ 1,344 $ 1,033 $ 520 Wholesaler chargebacks 1,559 1,069 553 Discounts and other incentives 891 490 286 Total sales incentives $ 3,794 $ 2,592 $ 1,359 Percent of gross product sales 24 % 20 % 15 % Rebates earned by healthcare providers such as clinics, hospitals and pharmacies in the United States are the sales incentives that are most difficult to estimate. These rebates are performance-based offers that are primarily based on attaining contractually-specified sales volumes and growth. As a result, the calculation of the accrual for these rebates is complicated by the need to estimate customer buying patterns and the resulting applicable contractual rebate rate(s) to be earned over a contractual period. These rebates totaled $1,344 million in 2005, $1,033 million in 2004, and $520 million in 2003. We believe that the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. For example, a 5% change in the revenue reduction 70 attributable to rebates recognized in 2005 would have had an approximate $65 million effect on our reported product sales in 2005. Wholesaler chargebacks are another type of arrangement included in sales incentives that relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the list prices we charge wholesalers. When the healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, the wholesaler charges us for the difference between the prices they pay us and the prices they sold the products to the healthcare providers. These chargebacks from wholesalers totaled $1,559 million in 2005, $1,069 million in 2004, and $553 million in 2003. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare provider and we settle these deductions generally within a few weeks of incurring the liability. Amounts accrued for sales incentives are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. However, such adjustments to date have not been material to our results of operations or financial position. The following table summarizes amounts recorded in accrued liabilities regarding sales incentives (amounts in millions): Balance at Beginning of Period Amounts Charged Against Product Sales* Payments Balance at End of Period Year ended: December 31, 2005 $ 589 $ 3,794 $ 3,519 $ 864 December 31, 2004 $ 358 $ 2,592 $ 2,361 $ 589 * Includes immaterial amounts related to prior year product sales based on changes in estimates. Such amounts represented approximately 1% of incentive amounts charged against product sales for both 2005 and 2004. Accruals for estimated sales returns are recorded in the same period that the related product sales are recorded and are recognized as reductions in product sales. Returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product when appropriate. Historically, sales returns have been insignificant, amounting to approximately 1% of gross product sales. EPOGEN revenue recognition We have the exclusive right to sell Epoetin alfa for dialysis, certain diagnostics, and all non-human, non-research uses in the United States. We granted to Johnson & Johnson a license relating to Epoetin alfa for sales in the United States for all human uses except dialysis and diagnostics. Pursuant to this license, Amgen and Johnson & Johnson are required to compensate each other for Epoetin alfa sales that either party makes into the other party exclusive market, sometimes referred to as spillover. Accordingly, we do not recognize product sales we make into the exclusive market of Johnson & Johnson and do recognize the product sales made by Johnson & Johnson into our exclusive market. Sales in our exclusive market are derived from our sales to our customers, as adjusted for spillover. We are employing an arbitrated audit methodology to measure each party spillover based on independent third-party data on shipments to end users and their estimated usage. Data on end user usage is derived in part using market sampling techniques, and accordingly, the results of such sampling can produce variability in the amount of recognized spillover. We initially recognize spillover based on estimates of shipments to end users and their usage, utilizing historical third-party data and subsequently adjust such amounts based on revised third-party data as received. Differences between initial estimates of spillover and amounts based 71 on revised third-party data could produce materially different amounts for recognized EPOGEN sales. However, such differences to date have not been material. Deferred income taxes Our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States based on our projected cash flow, working capital, and long-term investment requirements of our U.S. and foreign operations. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital, and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, an additional tax provision and related liability would be required which could materially impact our future effective tax rate. The American Jobs Creation Act was enacted on October 22, 2004. One provision of the American Jobs Creation Act effectively reduced the tax rate on a qualifying repatriation of earnings by providing for an 85% dividend-received deduction. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we repatriated $500 million under the American Jobs Creation Act, which was the maximum amount of foreign earnings qualifying for the reduced rate. The tax expense incurred on this repatriation was approximately $43 million. We intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were not repatriated under the American Jobs Creation Act. Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various types of legal proceedings such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, tax claims, and governmental investigations. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent we conclude their occurrence is both probable and estimable. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies. Our income tax returns are routinely audited by the IRS and various state and foreign tax authorities. Significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions because of differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with tax filing positions. While we believe our positions comply with applicable laws, we record liabilities based upon estimates of the ultimate outcomes of these matters. While it is not possible to predict accurately or determine the eventual outcome of these matters, we do not believe any such items currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our annual consolidated financial statements, although an adverse resolution in any quarterly reporting period of one or more of these items could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. Valuation of acquired intangible assets We have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets primarily via the acquisition of biotechnology companies. These intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products and in-process product candidates as well as goodwill arising in business combinations. When significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired, an independent third-party valuation firm is engaged to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations, and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: determining the timing and expected costs to complete the in-process projects, projecting regulatory approvals, 72 estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects, and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project. We believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates.
