ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (For an overview of our business groups, including a discussion of products and services provided, see the Business discussion contained in Part I, Item 1, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.) MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW General Dynamics offers a broad portfolio of products and services in business aviation; combat vehicles, weapons systems and munitions; shipbuilding design, repair and construction; and information systems, technologies and services. We operate through four business groups Aerospace, Combat Systems, Marine Systems and Information Systems and Technology. Our primary customers are the U.S. military, other U.S. government organizations, the armed forces of other nations, and a diverse base of corporate, government and individual buyers of business aircraft. We operate in two primary markets: defense and national security, and business aviation. The majority of our revenues derive from contracts with the U.S. military. The nation engagement in combating terrorism around the world, coupled with the need to grow and modernize U.S. military forces, has driven Department of Defense funding levels since 2001. In particular, procurement and research and development (R&D) budgets, also known as investment accounts, provide the majority of our revenues. For fiscal year 2010, the Congress appropriated $531 billion for the Department of Defense, including approximately $185 billion for procurement and R&D. Budget expenditures generally lag congressional funding, and we expect that expenditures applied toward programs over the next few years will be consistent with defense funding appropriated in recent years. To fund the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, defense budgets have also included supplemental funding. While some of our programs have received supplemental funds, most of our funding is now derived from base budgets. For fiscal year 2010, the Congress has appropriated approximately $130 billion in supplemental funding, including approximately 20 percent for investment accounts. The Defense Department has requested another $33 billion of supplemental funding in 2010. If this second supplemental is approved, defense funding for fiscal year 2010 will total approximately $693 billion. For fiscal year 2011, the President has requested total defense funding of $708 billion, including $159 billion in supplemental funding. The 2011 budget requests $189 billion for investment accounts, an increase of 2 percent over the fiscal year 2010 appropriation, including a nearly 8 percent increase in procurement funding. In February 2010, the Department of Defense published the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), an analysis of military priorities that shapes defense funding over the ensuing four years. This review reiterated the need for the military to prepare for a broad range of security challenges, and it prioritized continued investment in warfighting capabilities served by our portfolio of defense programs. The Pentagon five-year spending plan, also submitted to the Congress in February, reflects the slow, steady growth requirements set forth in the QDR. Through 2015, the base defense budget is expected to grow at a low-single-digit rate. Investment accounts are also projected to display low-single-digit inflation-adjusted growth, with procurement funding for mature programs growing and R&D funding for new programs declining over the period. This five-year plan also forecasts a reduction in future supplemental funding levels consistent with the administration plan to reduce troop levels in Iraq, offset somewhat by an increased footprint in Afghanistan. Our future growth in the U.S. defense market is driven by the size and allocation of the defense budget, the diversity of our exposure to different programs and customers within the budget, our ability to evolve our products to address a fast-changing threat environment, and our successful execution of the contracts we are awarded. While the landscape will continue to evolve in conjunction with dynamic macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, we expect defense funding to continue to be driven by the following: support for the warfighter from the administration and the Congress in the face of threats posed by an uncertain global security environment; the number of troops deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq, coupled with the increase in the overall size of the U.S. military; the need to reset and replenish equipment and supplies damaged and consumed in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001; the need to maintain thousands of jobs that support the health of our nation military infrastructure; and the need to modernize that infrastructure to address the evolving requirements of modern-day warfare. Beyond the U.S. defense market, governments around the world continue to fund weapons and equipment modernization programs, leading to significant defense export opportunities. We are committed to pursuing opportunities presented by international demand for military hardware and information technologies. While the revenue potential can be significant, international defense budgets are subject to unpredictable issues of contract award timing, changing priorities and overall spending pressures. As we broaden the customer base for our defense products around the world, we expect our international sales and exports to grow. The deterioration in the global economic environment in late 2008 and early 2009 significantly impacted the business-aviation market. Difficult economic conditions, tight credit markets and negative business-jet rhetoric General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report 19 Table of Contents in the first half of 2009 caused new-aircraft orders to decline, customers to default on aircraft contracts and pre-owned aircraft inventories to grow. Business-jet market conditions began to improve in the second half of 2009, in line with the broader financial market recovery. Improved flying hours, increased new-aircraft order interest, particularly for large-cabin aircraft, abating customer defaults and higher aircraft service activity helped to stabilize our Aerospace business. Barring any further economic turmoil, we believe the diversity and duration of our business-jet order book positions the Aerospace group for further improvement in 2010. Continued investment in new aircraft products is expected to drive the Aerospace group long-term growth, particularly when it begins delivering its newest aircraft offerings, the G250 (scheduled to enter service in 2011) and the G650 (scheduled to enter service in 2012). Similarly, we believe that aircraft-service revenues provide the group diversified exposure to aftermarket sales fueled by continued growth in the global installed business-jet fleet. We are committed to creating shareholder value through ethical business practices, disciplined program management and continuous operational improvements. Our solid performance is measured in our sustained revenue and earnings growth and strong cash flow. General Dynamics record as an industry leader in cash-flow generation has provided us the flexibility to execute our operational strategy and enabled us consistently to deploy resources to further enhance shareholder returns through acquisitions, payment of dividends and share repurchases. CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW The following discussion of our results of operations is based on operating performance at the business group level. The disclosures focus on the material financial measures we use to evaluate the performance of each of our four business groups, including revenues, operating earnings and margins, cash flow, and orders and backlog. For the defense business groups, the discussion of results of operations is based on specific contracts and programs that drive the group results rather than types of products and services, which often comprise multiple contracts with different customers. For the Aerospace group, the results are analyzed with respect to specific lines of products and services, consistent with how the group is managed. In the defense business groups, the majority of the revenues are generated by long-term government contracts. As discussed further in the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section, we account for revenues under these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under this method, revenue is recognized as work progresses, either as products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered. As a result, changes in revenues are generally discussed in terms of volume. Volume indicates increases or decreases in revenues due to changes in production or construction activity levels, delivery schedules or levels of services on individual contracts. In the Aerospace group, we recognize revenue using the percentage-of-completion method. Sales contracts for new aircraft have two major phases: the manufacture of the green aircraft and the aircraft completion, which includes exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics. We record revenues on these contracts at two milestones: when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer, and when the customer accepts final delivery of the aircraft. Revenues in the Aerospace group aircraft outfitting and services businesses are recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of the service, similar to our defense businesses. Changes in revenues in this group result from the number of new aircraft deliveries (both green and completion), the progress toward completion of aircraft outfitting activities, the level of service activity during the period and the number of pre-owned aircraft sold. Operating earnings and margins in the defense business groups are discussed in terms of changes in revenue volume, performance, the mix of contracts (e.g., fixed-price/cost-reimbursable) and the phases of work within those contracts (e.g., development/production). Performance refers to changes in contract earnings rates during the term of the contract based on revisions to estimates of profit at completion on individual contracts. These revisions result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract and/or the estimated costs required to complete the contract. The following discussion of results provides additional disclosure to the extent that a material or unusual event causes a change in the profitability of a contract. In general, operating earnings and margins in the Aerospace group are a function of the prices we charge for our aircraft, our operational efficiency in manufacturing and completing the aircraft, and the mix of aircraft deliveries among the higher-margin large-cabin and lower-margin mid-size aircraft. Additional factors affecting the group earnings and margins include the volume and profitability of services work performed, the number and type of pre-owned aircraft sold, and the level of general and administrative costs incurred by the group, which include selling expenses and research and development costs. Year Ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 Revenues Operating Earnings Revenues Operating Earnings Revenues Operating Earnings Aerospace $ 5,171 $ 707 $ 5,512 $ 1,021 $ 4,828 $ 810 Combat Systems 9,645 1,262 8,194 1,111 7,797 916 Marine Systems 6,363 642 5,556 521 4,993 421 Information Systems and Technology 10,802 1,151 10,038 1,075 9,622 1,027 Corporate (87 ) (75 ) (61 ) $ 31,981 $ 3,675 $ 29,300 $ 3,653 $ 27,240 $ 3,113 20 General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report Table of Contents Review of 2009 vs. 2008 Year Ended December 31 2009 2008 Variance Revenues $ 31,981 $ 29,300 $ 2,681 9.2 % Operating earnings 3,675 3,653 22 0.6 % Operating margin 11.5 % 12.5 % General Dynamics revenues increased significantly in 2009 compared with 2008, as strong performance in each of our defense businesses more than offset the decline in the business-jet market. The Combat Systems group generated the strongest revenue growth from higher volume in its U.S. and European military vehicle programs and the acquisition of AxleTech International in December 2008. The Marine Systems group revenues were up significantly because of increased activity on U.S. Navy and commercial shipbuilding and repair programs across our shipyards. In the Information Systems and Technology group, increased volume in each of the group U.S. operations and recent acquisitions drove the group revenue growth. Revenues decreased in the Aerospace group in 2009 following our decision to cut aircraft production and deliveries principally mid-size aircraft in response to a significant downturn in the business-jet market in the first half of the year. This decline was offset partially by the acquisition of Jet Aviation in November 2008. Our operating earnings increased slightly in 2009 over 2008. Earnings growth in each of our defense businesses was mostly offset by reduced earnings in Aerospace. Operating margins were up significantly in the Marine Systems group because of improved operating performance at each of our shipyards during the year. In the Information Systems and Technology group, margins remained consistent with those achieved in 2008. A shift in contract mix in the Combat Systems group led to reduced margins compared with the prior year. The Aerospace group margins were reduced by a five-week furlough at the group aircraft assembly operations in the third quarter of 2009, losses associated with pre-owned aircraft activities and the addition of lower-margin business at Jet Aviation. As a result, our overall operating margins decreased by 100 basis points in 2009 compared with 2008. Review of 2008 vs. 2007 Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 Variance Revenues $ 29,300 $ 27,240 $ 2,060 7.6 % Operating earnings 3,653 3,113 540 17.3 % Operating margin 12.5 % 11.4 % We generated solid revenue growth in 2008 compared with 2007, and operating earnings increased at more than twice the rate of revenue growth. The Aerospace and Marine Systems groups achieved the most significant jump in revenues as a result of increases in business-jet deliveries and higher activity on shipbuilding programs. Revenues increased in the Combat Systems group due to strong demand for U.S. military vehicles and related support services. Higher activity in tactical and strategic mission systems contributed the majority of the revenue growth in the Information Systems and Technology group. Our operating earnings increased significantly in 2008, and three of our four business groups reported earnings in excess of $1 billion. Growth in operating earnings exceeded the revenue growth in each of our business groups due to strong program execution and a continued focus on operating performance. Overall, our operating margins increased 110 basis points to 12.5 percent in 2008. Cash Flow Cash flows from operations in 2009 exceeded net earnings for the 11th consecutive year. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.9 billion in 2009, $3.1 billion in 2008 and $3 billion in 2007. Over the three-year period, we deployed our cash to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures, repurchase our common stock, pay dividends and repay maturing debt. Our net debt debt less cash and equivalents and marketable securities was $1.2 billion at year-end 2009 compared with $2.3 billion at the end of 2008. This $1.1 billion decrease in net debt was achieved after the following capital deployments: $811 spent on acquisitions, $577 of dividends paid, $520 of company-sponsored research and development, $385 of capital expenditures, approximately $330 of contributions to our retirement plans and $209 of share repurchases during the year. General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report 21 Table of Contents Other Financial Information General and administrative (G&A) expenses as a percentage of revenues were 6.1 percent in 2009, 5.9 percent in 2008 and 6 percent in 2007. G&A expenses were $2 billion in 2009, $1.7 billion in 2008 and $1.6 billion in 2007. We expect 2010 G&A to be approximately 6 percent of revenues. Net interest expense increased to $160 in 2009 compared with $66 in 2008 and $70 in 2007 due to the issuance of additional debt in 2008 and 2009 and lower interest income, reflecting lower market interest rates and a reduced invested cash balance during the year. We expect net interest expense of approximately $150 in 2010, subject to capital deployment activities during the year. Our effective tax rate was 31.5 percent in 2009, 31.2 percent in 2008 and 31.7 percent in 2007. The 2008 rate included a $35, or approximately $0.09 per-share, benefit from the settlement of tax refund litigation, which reduced the 2008 tax rate by 100 basis points. Our effective tax rate in 2007 was impacted favorably by the resolution of our 2003 to 2004 federal income tax audit with the Internal Revenue Service. This settlement resulted in a benefit of $18, or approximately $0.04 per share, which reduced our effective tax rate by 60 basis points. We anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 31.5 to 32 percent in 2010. For additional discussion of tax matters, see Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Discontinued Operations In 2008, we entered into an agreement to sell our Spanish nitrocellulose operation and recognized a pretax loss of $11 in discontinued operations in anticipation of the sale. We are awaiting Spanish government approval and expect the sale to close in 2010. In 2007, we completed the sale of our coal mining operation and received proceeds of approximately $25. Our reported revenues exclude the revenues associated with these divested businesses. We have presented their operating results, along with the gains and losses from the transactions discussed above, as discontinued operations, net of income taxes. Backlog and Estimated Potential Contract Value Our total backlog was $65.5 billion at the end of 2009 compared to $74.1 billion at year-end 2008. Funded backlog was $45.9 billion at year end, down from $51.7 billion at the end of 2008. We received $26.4 billion of new orders in 2009. The Information Systems and Technology group orders were particularly strong in 2009, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio (orders divided by revenues) greater than one-to-one for the second consecutive year. Combat Systems also had another strong order year, driven in part by growing international order activity late in the year. The total backlog for our defense businesses decreased in 2009 to $46.2 billion at the end of the year, compared with $51.6 billion at the end of 2008. The defense backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts. About three-quarters of the decline in our defense backlog during 2009 was in Marine Systems, which traditionally receives large, multi-year awards and works down that backlog in subsequent periods. The funded portion of the defense backlog was $27 billion at the end of 2009, down from $29.9 billion in December 2008. This includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the Congress and funded by the customer, as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments. While there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program, we have included in the backlog only firm contracts we believe are likely to receive funding. The Aerospace group total backlog was $19.3 billion at the end of 2009 following a record level of $22.5 billion at year-end 2008. Aerospace funded backlog was $18.9 billion at the end of 2009 compared to $21.9 billion at the end of 2008. Aerospace funded backlog represents orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer. The Aerospace unfunded backlog of $433 at the end of 2009 consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services. Our backlog does not include work awarded under unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts, unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts or options to purchase new aircraft, which we refer to collectively as estimated potential contract value. Customers use IDIQ contracts when they have not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed. These agreements, which set forth the majority of the contractual terms, including prices, are funded as delivery orders are placed. A significant portion of our estimated potential contract value includes our estimate of the value we will receive under multiple-award IDIQ contracts in which we are one of several companies competing for task orders. The estimated contract value also includes IDIQ contracts for which we have been designated as the sole-source supplier to design, develop, produce and integrate complex products and systems over several years for the military or other government agencies. We believe the customers intend to fully implement these systems. Because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customer future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders, we recognize these contracts in backlog only when they are funded. 22 General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report Table of Contents Contract options in our defense businesses represent agreements to perform additional work beyond the products and services associated with firm contracts, if the customer exercises the option. These options are negotiated in conjunction with a firm contract and provide the terms under which the customer may elect to procure additional units or services at a future date. Contract options in the Aerospace group represent options to purchase new aircraft and long-term agreements with fleet customers. We recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order. On December 31, 2009, the estimated potential value associated with these IDIQ contracts and contract options was approximately $17.6 billion, up from $16.8 billion at the end of 2008. This represents our estimate of the potential value we will receive. The actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower. We expect to realize this value over the next 10 to 15 years. REVIEW OF OPERATING SEGMENTS AEROSPACE Review of 2009 vs. 2008 Year Ended December 31 2009 2008 Variance Revenues $ 5,171 $ 5,512 $ (341 ) (6.2 )% Operating earnings 707 1,021 (314 ) (30.8 )% Operating margin 13.7 % 18.5 % Gulfstream aircraft deliveries (in units): Green 94 156 (62 ) (39.7 )% Completion 110 152 (42 ) (27.6 )% The Aerospace group revenues decreased in 2009, the net result of a 24 percent decline in Gulfstream revenues that was offset in part by revenues from Jet Aviation, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2008. The combination of the global economic deterioration and credit crisis along with negative business-jet rhetoric had a significant impact on the business-jet market in 2009. To adjust to the economic conditions and weakened demand, we reduced Gulfstream 2009 aircraft production and delivery schedule, primarily in the group mid-size models, to bridge the market downturn. This included a five-week furlough at the group production center in Savannah, Georgia, in July and August. As a result, aircraft-manufacturing revenues decreased 28 percent in 2009 compared with 2008. The economic environment also impacted the group aircraft services business. Organic aircraft-services revenues were down 15 percent in 2009 resulting from reduced flying hours and customer deferral of aircraft maintenance. The decline in aircraft manufacturing and services revenues was slightly offset by higher pre-owned aircraft revenues in 2009. The group sold six pre-owned aircraft for $124 in 2009 compared with two sales for $18 in 2008. The group operating earnings declined in 2009 compared with 2008 due primarily to the factors noted above. The components of the reduction in earnings were as follows: Aircraft manufacturing and completions $ (220 ) Pre-owned aircraft (18 ) Aircraft services 1 Other (77 ) Total decrease in operating earnings $ (314 ) The net decrease in the group aircraft manufacturing and completions earnings in 2009 resulted from the reduction in Gulfstream aircraft deliveries offset in part by the addition of Jet Aviation aircraft completions and refurbishing business. The earnings decline associated with the decreased Gulfstream volume was mitigated by cost-reduction initiatives, a shift in the mix of aircraft deliveries toward large-cabin aircraft, and liquidated damages collected on defaulted aircraft contracts. As a result, aircraft manufacturing margins increased in 2009 over 2008 despite the decline in volume during the year. The group continues to focus on reducing costs through production improvements and operational efficiencies to maintain aircraft-manufacturing margins. In late 2008 and early 2009, the supply in the global pre-owned aircraft market increased significantly, putting considerable pressure on pricing. As a result, the group wrote down the carrying value of its pre-owned aircraft inventory in 2009. Pricing in the pre-owned market appears to have stabilized in the second half of 2009, particularly for large-cabin aircraft. The group continues to work to minimize its pre-owned aircraft exposure, with four pre-owned aircraft valued at $60 remaining in inventory at the end of 2009. Aircraft services earnings were steady in 2009 compared with 2008 as the addition of Jet Aviation maintenance and repair activities, fixed-base operations and aircraft management services offset a decrease in organic aircraft services earnings. A significant reduction in flight hours in the business-jet market put competitive pressure on aircraft maintenance and repair earnings in 2009. The group operating earnings also were impacted negatively in 2009 by severance costs associated with workforce reduction activities and intangible asset amortization related to the Jet Aviation acquisition. The factors discussed above and the addition of lower-margin Jet Aviation business caused the group overall operating margins to decrease 480 basis points in 2009 compared with 2008. General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report 23 Table of Contents Review of 2008 vs. 2007 Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 Variance Revenues $ 5,512 $ 4,828 $ 684 14.2 % Operating earnings 1,021 810 211 26.0 % Operating margin 18.5 % 16.8 % Gulfstream aircraft deliveries (in units): Green 156 138 18 13.0 % Completion 152 138 14 10.1 % The Aerospace group generated significant revenue growth in 2008, attributable primarily to increased aircraft deliveries compared with 2007. New aircraft revenues were up 12 percent in 2008 as a result of the increased aircraft production. Aircraft services volume increased 8 percent over 2007. The acquisition of Jet Aviation in November 2008 contributed approximately one-quarter of the group increase in revenues. The group pre-owned aircraft revenues were $18 in 2008, down from $78 in 2007. The Aerospace group operating earnings increased at a significantly higher rate than revenues in 2008. Approximately $157 of the earnings growth resulted from higher new-aircraft and aircraft-services volume. Improved pricing, a favorable delivery mix and productivity improvements in the aircraft assembly and outfitting processes increased earnings by approximately $105. Reduced sales of pre-owned aircraft and write-downs of pre-owned aircraft inventory reduced the group earnings growth by $25. Increased selling expenses from strong order activity and higher product-development costs associated with the introduction of two new aircraft models in 2008 also reduced the group earnings growth by $26. Backlog and Estimated Potential Contract Value The economic turmoil of late 2008 and early 2009 had a significant impact on the business-jet market. The collapse of the global economy led some customers in the backlog to default on their contracts and caused some prospective customers to delay aircraft orders. Both the large-cabin and mid-size segments experienced a decline in orders in late 2008 and early 2009. However, the mid-size market experienced the greatest impact. Large-cabin orders improved steadily throughout the year. Excluding the introduction of the new G650, large-cabin orders in the fourth quarter of 2009 reached their highest level since the second quarter of 2008. Despite the rebound in order activity resulting in a full-year book-to-bill ratio (orders divided by revenues) greater than one-to-one, the customer defaults led to a 14 percent decline in the group backlog from the end of 2008. The Aerospace group ended 2009 with $19.3 billion of backlog, of which $18.9 billion was funded. Scheduled large-cabin deliveries are sold out through 2010 and well into 2011. Conditions in the mid-size market remain challenging. However, these aircraft represent a declining proportion of our portfolio. We continually assess aircraft production requirements and will modify the group production and delivery schedule as necessary based on the state of the backlog and the business-jet market. Over the past few years, the group customer base has become increasingly diverse, both in customer type and geographic region. The group year-end backlog is divided approximately evenly among public companies, private companies and individual buyers. No one customer represents more than 1 percent of the group backlog. In addition, the backlog has shifted toward the international market, with customers outside North America comprising almost 60 percent of the backlog. The Aerospace backlog has also been diversified to include orders for the group newest aircraft models the G650 and the G250. Both of these aircraft were introduced in 2008 and achieved their scheduled first flight in the fourth quarter of 2009. Initial green deliveries for each are scheduled to begin in 2011. The backlog does not include options to purchase new aircraft or long-term agreements with fleet customers. These arrangements totaled $1.4 billion at the end of 2009 and are included in estimated potential contract value. 2010 Outlook We expect a low- to mid-single-digit percentage increase in the Aerospace group revenues in 2010 compared with 2009. We expect to deliver approximately the same number of aircraft, with a further shift toward the large-cabin models. We also anticipate a modest increase in aircraft services activity in 2010. Based on the favorable mix of aircraft deliveries and the stabilization of the pre-owned aircraft market, tempered by the pace of ongoing operational improvement efforts at Jet Aviation, we expect the Aerospace group margins to improve slightly over 2009 to approximately 14 percent. These expectations do not assume any recovery in the mid-size market in 2010. 24 General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report Table of Contents COMBAT SYSTEMS Review of 2009 vs. 2008 Year Ended December 31 2009 2008 Variance Revenues $ 9,645 $ 8,194 $ 1,451 17.7 % Operating earnings 1,262 1,111 151 13.6 % Operating margin 13.1 % 13.6 % The Combat Systems group revenues increased significantly in 2009 compared with 2008. The increase in revenues was driven by 12.5 percent organic growth and the acquisition of AxleTech International in December 2008. The group received strong contributions to this growth from each of its markets: U.S. military vehicles $ 774 Weapons systems and munitions 532 European military vehicles 145 Total increase in revenues $ 1,451 Increased volume on the Stryker wheeled combat vehicle and Abrams main battle tank programs generated over half of the group revenue growth in 2009. The higher Stryker activity was due to increased vehicle production and modernization work. Under the Abrams program, the group continued to upgrade M1A1 tanks to the M1A2 System Enhancement Package (SEP) configuration for the U.S. Army and produced more Abrams tank kits for Egypt. The revenue growth in the U.S. military vehicles business was tempered somewhat by lower volume on the group mine-resistant, ambush-protected (MRAP) vehicle deliveries, which were completed in the second quarter of 2009. Organic revenues were up in the group weapons systems and munitions businesses due to increased production of armor kits for Stryker vehicles, an increase in deliveries of Hydra-70 rockets and higher volume on munitions supply contracts for the United States and Canada. The group European military vehicle business generated strong revenue growth in 2009. Revenues increased as a result of higher activity on several wheeled armored vehicle production programs, including the Piranha for Belgium and Spain and the Eagle for Germany. Volume also increased on the group European arms and munitions and mobile bridge programs, while activity was down on the Leopard tank program with the Spanish government. The Combat Systems group operating earnings grew in 2009, though at a lower rate than revenues, resulting in a 50 basis-point decrease in operating margins compared with 2008. The group margins in 2008 were unusually high because of a favorable program mix in the U.S. military vehicles business. Review of 2008 vs. 2007 Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 Variance Revenues $ 8,194 $ 7,797 $ 397 5.1 % Operating earnings 1,111 916 195 21.3 % Operating margin 13.6 % 11.7 % In 2008, the Combat Systems group revenues were up compared with 2007 due to strength in the group U.S. military vehicles business. The majority of the revenue growth was generated by higher activity on the MRAP vehicle program, which emerged in late 2007, and several contracts in support of the group Abrams main battle tank modernization efforts, including the SEP upgrade and repair and reset work for battle-damaged M1 tanks. Revenues in the group weapons systems business decreased in 2008 due to fewer deliveries of systems that help protect U.S. combat forces from improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Revenues increased slightly on the group munitions programs over 2007. In the group European military vehicles business, volume was lower during the year on several international military vehicle programs, including the Leopard tank program. The group operating earnings grew significantly in 2008, increasing at more than four times the rate of revenue growth during the year. While the most significant driver of the group earnings growth was improved performance in the U.S. military vehicle business, particularly on the MRAP and Abrams programs, each of the group businesses generated at least a 100 basis-point increase in margins in 2008. The operating leverage achieved across Combat Systems operations in 2008 produced an overall 190 basis-point improvement in the group operating margins compared with 2007. Backlog and Estimated Potential Contract Value The Combat Systems group total backlog was $13.4 billion at the end of 2009, down 10 percent from $15 billion at year-end 2008. Funded backlog decreased 6 percent in 2009 to $11.4 billion at year end. Approximately $930, or 60 percent, of the year-over-year decline in the group backlog is attributable to the Army termination for convenience of the manned ground vehicle portion of the Future Combat Systems (FCS) program. The Army currently is considering its alternatives for ground combat General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report 25 Table of Contents vehicle requirements, which we expect will provide additional opportunities for Combat Systems, including the addition of an eighth Stryker Brigade. The group received $8.6 billion of new orders in 2009. The group backlog consists primarily of long-term production contracts that have scheduled deliveries through 2015. The group backlog at the end of 2009 included approximately $2.8 billion for M1 Abrams main battle tank modernization and upgrade programs. These include the M1A2 SEP, System Technical Support (STS) and Tank Urban Survivability Kit (TUSK) programs. Under the SEP program, we retrofit Abrams main battle tanks with improved electronics, command-and-control capabilities and armor enhancements that are designed to improve the tank effectiveness. The group continued work in 2009 on a multi-year contract awarded in 2008 to upgrade the remaining M1A1 Abrams tanks to the SEP configuration. Approximately 50 percent of the group Abrams backlog at year end was for the SEP program. Under the STS program, we identify improvements and replace obsolete parts on Abrams tanks to maintain the tanks at high operational readiness rates. TUSK is a technological upgrade that improves the effectiveness of the tank in urban warfare environments. At year end, the Abrams backlog included a combined $620 for the STS and TUSK programs. In 2009, the group received awards from the Army totaling $580 for all Abrams-related programs, including awards to build M1A1 Situational Awareness (SA) tanks for the Iraqi army and for M1A2 upgrades for Saudi Arabia. The Army Stryker wheeled combat vehicle program comprised over $2 billion of the group backlog at year end, including the production of approximately 700 vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2012. The group received over $2.1 billion of Stryker orders in 2009, including awards worth approximately $930 for vehicle production, $590 for contractor logistics support and $500 for Stryker modernization. In January 2010, the Army awarded the group a contract worth an additional $85 for battle-damage assessment, repair services and materials for Stryker brigades deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. In February 2010, the Army awarded the group an additional $250 to continue Stryker logistics support and requested funds to establish an additional Stryker Brigade Combat Team. Almost $500 of the group backlog at the end of 2009 was for the U.S. Marine Corps Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) program. The group is building seven new prototypes under the system design and development phase of the EFV program, which the group expects to deliver in 2010. The Combat Systems group has several significant international military vehicle production contracts in backlog. The backlog at the end of the year included: $1.8 billion for Light Armored Vehicles under a Foreign Military Sale (FMS) contract through the Army, $650 for the production of 190 Pizarro Advanced Infantry Fighting Vehicles scheduled for delivery to the Spanish army through 2015, $425 for Pandur vehicles for an international customer, $330 for the production of 90 Pandur II vehicles for the Czech Republic, $240 from the Swiss government to provide 232 Duro wheeled armored personnel vehicles, $170 for a contract with the government of Belgium for 82 Piranha wheeled military vehicles and $170 for the production of 64 Leopard 2E battle tanks, which the group produces for the Spanish army using a design licensed from a German company. In addition, Combat Systems was selected in 2009 as the prime contractor and systems integrator for the Canadian government LAV III upgrade program. The program has a potential value of $850, and we expect to receive a contract in 2010. The Combat Systems group backlog at year end also included approximately $2.6 billion in weapons systems, munitions, detection systems and composite-structures programs. In 2009, the group received awards totaling $210 for the production of Hydra-70 rockets, bringing the total contract value to date to over $1 billion. The group also received awards worth approximately $115 from the Canadian government to supply various calibers of training and tactical ammunition and $75 from the Army for production of M2HB machine guns. 2010 Outlook We expect 4 to 5 percent revenue growth in Combat Systems in 2010 attributable largely to international vehicle contracts and to growing activity in U.S. armament and munitions programs. We anticipate a slight decline in the group operating margins to the high-12 percent range due to a shift in program mix, including the start-up of several new contracts. MARINE SYSTEMS Review of 2009 vs. 2008 Year Ended December 31 2009 2008 Variance Revenues $ 6,363 $ 5,556 $ 807 14.5 % Operating earnings 642 521 121 23.2 % Operating margin 10.1 % 9.4 % Each of the Marine Systems group shipyards contributed to the group strong growth in revenues and operating earnings in 2009 over the prior year. The increase in revenues consisted of the following: Multi-year Navy ship construction $ 552 Other Navy ship design, construction, engineering and repair 229 Commercial ship construction 26 Total increase in revenues $ 807 The group multi-year ship-construction programs for the U.S. Navy include Virginia-class submarines, T-AKE combat-logistics ships and 26 General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report Table of Contents DDG-51 and DDG-1000 destroyers. The Virginia-class program contributed almost two-thirds of the group increase in revenues. The group delivered the sixth boat under the program in 2009 and continued construction on the next five of the remaining 12 boats under contract. Virginia activity is expected to continue to ramp up as the group moves toward construction of two ships per year starting in 2011 with deliveries scheduled through 2018. Activity was down slightly on the T-AKE program in 2009 as the group continued construction on the ninth through 12th ships. The group delivered the seventh and eighth ships in 2009, and deliveries of the remaining four ships awarded to date are scheduled through 2011 with ships 13 and 14 in 2012. On the destroyer programs, revenues were up in 2009 as activity increased significantly on the group design and production contracts for the DDG-1000 next-generation destroyer, while volume on the DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class program decreased, consistent with our expectations. The first DDG-1000 delivery is scheduled in 2014, and the remaining three DDG-51 destroyers under contract are scheduled for delivery through 2011. In addition to these ship-construction programs, volume was up significantly in 2009 on engineering and repair programs for the Navy. The growing service requirements of the Navy aging fleet, along with the rebalancing of the fleet to position more ships on the West Coast, generated significant additional repair volume for our West Coast operations. The group commercial shipbuilding activity consists of a five-ship product carrier program. Activity on this program increased slightly in 2009 as the first three ships were delivered and construction continued on the remaining two ships, which are scheduled for delivery in 2010. The Marine Systems group operating earnings increased significantly in 2009. Each of the group shipyards has focused on operational efficiency and achieved significant labor and material cost reductions during the year. These efforts resulted in higher earnings rates on several key programs in 2009, including the Virginia-class, DDG-51, DDG-1000 and commercial product carrier programs. As a result, the group operating margins increased 70 basis points over 2008 to 10.1 percent. The group significant improvement in 2009 followed a 100-basis point increase in margins in 2008 over 2007. Review of 2008 vs. 2007 Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 Variance Revenues $ 5,556 $ 4,993 $ 563 11.3 % Operating earnings 521 421 100 23.8 % Operating margin 9.4 % 8.4 % Revenues in the Marine Systems group were up in 2008 as a result of increased activity at each of the group shipyards. Activity increased on the Virginia-class program as the group delivered the fourth and fifth boats in the program in 2008. Volume also increased on the T-AKE and DDG-1000 programs. Commercial shipbuilding volume was up in 2008 as the group ramped up construction of the first three of its product-carrier ships. Slightly lower activity on the DDG-51 destroyer program and the completion of the group SSGN submarine conversion contract in the fourth quarter of 2007 slightly offset the other volume increases in the group in 2008. The Marine Systems group improved its performance significantly in 2008, increasing operating earnings at double the rate of revenue growth. As a result of operational efficiencies realized at each of its shipyards, the group increased program earnings rates in 2008 on the Virginia, DDG-51, T-AKE and commercial product carrier programs. These improvements increased the group overall margins by 100 basis points in 2008. Backlog and Estimated Potential Contract Value The Marine Systems group backlog consists of long-term submarine and ship construction programs, as well as numerous repair and engineering contracts. The group generally receives large contract awards that provide backlog for several years. For example, in 2008 the group received a $14 billion contract for the construction of eight Virginia-class submarines to be delivered through 2018. After reaching an all-time high of $26.4 billion at the end of 2008, the group backlog decreased to $22.5 billion at year-end 2009, consistent with this historical pattern. The group funded backlog at the end of 2009 was $7.1 billion, down from $10.5 billion at year-end 2008. The current backlog includes shipbuilding deliveries through 2018. The Virginia-class submarine program was our largest single program in 2009 and is the largest contract in the group backlog. The group backlog at year end included $16.3 billion for 12 Virginia-class submarines. As the prime contractor on the Virginia-class program, we report the entire backlog and revenues associated with the program but share the construction activity and the earnings equally with our teaming partner. The current Navy plan calls for construction of one submarine in 2010 and two per year beginning in 2011. Navy destroyer programs represent another significant component of the group backlog. These include the Arleigh Burke-class DDG-51 and Zumwalt-class DDG-1000 destroyer programs. The group backlog at the end of 2009 included $1.2 billion for the ongoing design effort and construction of the first DDG-1000. In 2009, the group received approximately $300 in orders under the DDG-1000 program, General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report 27 Table of Contents including approximately $160 for Class Common Equipment (CCE) material to begin construction of the first ship. At year end, the backlog included approximately $365 for the remaining three DDG-51 destroyers under contract. We anticipate receiving funding for long-lead materials for an additional DDG-51 in 2010. The group is currently negotiating contracts with the Navy for the construction of two additional DDG-1000s. We expect these awards to provide stability to the group destroyer production for the foreseeable future. The Marine Systems group backlog at year end also included $880 for four of the remaining six ships under the Navy T-AKE combat-logistics ship program, including $200 of long-lead materials for the last two ships. These two ships have been authorized and appropriated by the Congress, and we expect to receive construction contracts in 2010. The year-end backlog included $390 for the Navy Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program. In 2009, the group delivered its first LCS and received an order worth approximately $410 from the Navy for the second ship, scheduled for delivery in 2012. At the end of 2009, the group backlog included approximately $125 for the remaining effort on the group product carrier contract. In addition, the Marine Systems group backlog at year end included approximately $3.2 billion for engineering, repair, overhaul and other services. In January 2010, the Navy awarded the group an additional $120 to continue a development contract for concept studies, engineering and design of a Common Missile Compartment for the next-generation ballistic missile submarines under development for the Navy and the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom. 2010 Outlook We expect 7 to 8 percent revenue growth in Marine Systems in 2010 as activity continues to ramp up on the Virginia-class and DDG-1000 construction programs, as well as submarine engineering activities. The group operating margins should moderate somewhat to the mid-9 percent range due to a shift in contract mix from more mature programs to earlier-stage construction, particularly among the group destroyer programs. INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY Review of 2009 vs. 2008 Year Ended December 31 2009 2008 Variance Revenues $ 10,802 $ 10,038 $ 764 7.6 % Operating earnings 1,151 1,075 76 7.1 % Operating margin 10.7 % 10.7 % The Information Systems and Technology group revenues reached the highest level in the group history in 2009, with revenue growth generated in each of the group market segments. The group organic revenue growth was over 4 percent in 2009 with the remainder of the growth provided by acquisitions in the group information technology (IT) services and intelligence mission systems businesses. The overall increase in revenues in 2009 was well-distributed across the group businesses: Information technology and mission services $ 296 Tactical and strategic mission systems 258 Intelligence mission systems 210 Total increase in revenues $ 764 In the group IT services business, approximately 20 percent of the revenue growth in 2009 was organic and resulted primarily from higher volume on several IT infrastructure and support programs, including the New Campus East (NCE) contract for the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, the Network-Centric Solutions (NETCENTS) program for U.S. federal agencies and the Technology Operations and Maintenance Infrastructure Support (TOMIS) contract for the U.S. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration. The revenue growth on these programs was partially offset by lower activity in the commercial wireless market. The most notable performance drivers in the group tactical and strategic mission systems business were higher volume on the Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T) program and ground-based satellite communications programs, as well as increased sales of encryption products. Volume in the group United Kingdom-based tactical communications operations was steady compared with 2008. The intelligence systems business had the highest revenue growth rate in 2009, the result of organic growth in each of its business areas and the acquisition of Axsys Technologies, Inc., in September 2009. Approximately 60 percent of the revenue growth in this business was organic. Higher activity on cyber security and several classified programs, as well as increased volume on a contract to build the spacecraft for NASA Landsat Data Continuity Mission, contributed the majority of this growth. The Information Systems and Technology group operating earnings increased in line with revenues in 2009. As a result, the group achieved operating margins of 10.7 percent, consistent with 2008. Margins increased in the tactical systems and intelligence systems businesses due to improved performance and a favorable shift in contract mix, but margins were down in the IT services business as a result of contract mix. Review of 2008 vs. 2007 Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 Variance Revenues $ 10,038 $ 9,622 $ 416 4.3 % Operating earnings 1,075 1,027 48 4.7 % Operating margin 10.7 % 10.7 % Revenues in the Information Systems and Technology group increased in 2008, with the most significant growth over 2007 coming from the group tactical and strategic mission systems business. This growth 28 General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report Table of Contents resulted from increased activity on several key U.S. military programs, such as the WIN-T program and the Common Hardware/Software III (CHS-3) program, as well as higher volume on the group ground-based satellite communications programs. Revenues were up in the group core IT services business due primarily to the ramp-up of activity on several new programs, including the TOMIS contract and the Warfighter Field Operations Customer Support (FOCUS) Army training contract. Within the IT services business, the group commercial wireless operations experienced significantly lower activity in 2008 due to reduced demand in the market. Revenues in the group intelligence mission systems business remained steady compared with 2007. Revenues decreased in the group U.K. business due to a scheduled decline in activity on the BOWMAN communications program for the U.K. armed forces, offset in part by higher activity on other command, control, communications, computing and intelligence systems (C4I) programs. Operating margins remained steady compared with 2007, as improved performance on the group tactical communications programs offset an increased proportion of lower-margin service work in the group portfolio. Backlog and Estimated Potential Contract Value The Information Systems and Technology group generated a book-to-bill ratio (orders divided by revenues) greater than one-to-one in 2009 for the second consecutive year. As a result, the group backlog edged up slightly to $10.3 billion at year end after reporting record-level revenues in 2009. The group funded backlog grew 16 percent over year-end 2008 to $8.4 billion at the end of 2009. Unlike our other defense businesses, the Information Systems and Technology group backlog consists of thousands of contracts that have to be reconstituted each year with new program and task order awards, and relatively few large-scale, long-term programs. Some of the more significant programs are highlighted below. The group backlog at year-end 2009 included approximately $860 for the Army WIN-T program. Information Systems and Technology is the prime contractor on this battlefield communications network program that is designed to provide warfighters with fast, secure, mobile command-and-control capabilities. In 2009, the group received almost $500 of awards for WIN-T, bringing the total program value to $2.1 billion. Approximately $670 of the group backlog at year end was for the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Project (MHP). Under the MHP program, the group is scheduled to provide integrated mission systems, training and support for 28 state-of-the-art helicopters that are intended to replace Canada aging fleet of marine helicopters. The group backlog at year end also included approximately $400 for maintenance and long-term support activities for the United Kingdom BOWMAN communications program. BOWMAN is the secure digital voice and data communications system for the U.K. armed forces. In 2009, the group received almost $500 in orders under this program, including an award to upgrade the system capabilities and provide long-term technical support. The Intelligence Information, Command-and-Control Equipment and Enhancements (ICE2) program comprised over $325 of the group backlog at the end of 2009. ICE2 supports critical intelligence and command-and-control systems and networks for U.S. defense and intelligence operations worldwide. Approximately $215 of the group backlog at year end was for the Warfighter FOCUS program. The group provides support for the Army live, virtual and constructive training operations under this contract. In addition to these programs, the group received a number of significant contract awards in 2009, including the following: Approximately $320 in orders under the CHS-3 program to provide commercial and ruggedized computers, network equipment and software to the U.S. armed forces and other U.S. federal agencies worldwide. The group backlog at year end included $175 for CHS-3. Approximately $310 of orders under the NETCENTS program. This program comprised $250 of the group backlog at the end of the year. Approximately $250 of orders under the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) program for design development and risk reduction. MUOS is designed to enable on-the-move satellite connectivity for U.S. and allied forces. The group backlog included $180 for the MUOS program at year end. Approximately $210 from the Army for initial outfitting and transition support of the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and the newly constructed Fort Belvoir Community Hospital. The contract has a maximum potential value of over $320 if all options are exercised. A contract worth approximately $150 for production and deployed-systems support for the U.S. and United Kingdom SSBN submarine fire control system and the SSGN submarine Attack Weapon Control System (AWCS). A task order from the Army worth approximately $110 to modernize classroom training technology under the Information Technology Enterprise Technology Solutions-2 Services (ITES-2S) IDIQ contract. Approximately $70 from the Army to field the enhanced Prophet tactical signals intelligence (SIGINT) system. The contract has a maximum potential value of more than $850 if all options are exercised. General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report 29 Table of Contents The group backlog does not include approximately $12.8 billion of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of IDIQ contracts and unexercised options. The value of these arrangements may be realized over the next 12 years. In 2009, funding under IDIQ contracts and options contributed over $3.6 billion, more than one-third of the group orders, to the group backlog, most notably from WIN-T, CHS-3, NETCENTS and Warfighter FOCUS. Information Systems and Technology was awarded several significant IDIQ contracts during 2009, including the following: One of 59 General Services Administration (GSA) Alliant contracts to provide federal government agencies with integrated information technology solutions. The Alliant program has a $50 billion maximum potential value among all awardees over a 10-year period. One of three contracts under the Advanced Technical Exploitation Program (ATEP), which has a maximum potential value of $600 among all awardees, to provide intelligence analysis, software systems development and support, sensor exploitation research, and development of space-based and airborne sensor data for the U.S. Air Force. One of four contracts under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security National Communications System (NCS) National Security and Emergency Preparedness Scientific, Engineering and Technical Assistance program to provide support for national security/emergency preparedness programs. The program has a maximum potential value of $390 among all awardees. A contract from the Army with a maximum potential value of $200 to develop the Consolidated Product-Line Management system, which will improve the Army ability to manage its live combat training system product lines. Shortly after the end of the year, the group received two significant contracts from the Army one for training support services and one for healthcare IT services. The first is an IDIQ contract to provide technical, management and engineering support services for constructive training systems. It has a maximum potential value of approximately $390. The second is a contract to provide support for the Army Medical Communications for Combat Casualty Care. The contract is worth more than $150 if all options are exercised. 2010 Outlook We expect revenues in the Information Systems and Technology group to grow by 8 to 9 percent in 2010. We expect each of the group businesses to contribute to the growth, particularly in the areas of IT support for intelligence and federal civilian customers, and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance work, including cyber security. The group operating margins should decline slightly but remain in the mid-10 percent range based on the projected contract mix in 2010. CORPORATE Corporate results consist primarily of compensation expense for stock options and a portion of the results from our commercial pension plans. Corporate operating expenses totaled $87 in 2009, $75 in 2008 and $61 in 2007. The increases in Corporate operating expenses in 2009 and 2008 resulted primarily from increased stock option expense. (See Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our stock options.) We expect 2010 Corporate operating expenses of approximately $95. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In the mid-1990s, General Dynamics embarked on a strategy of disciplined capital deployment, generating strong cash flow to enable a series of acquisitions designed to grow the company beyond our core platform businesses. This has resulted in a larger, more diversified company incorporating new products and technologies that meet the needs of an expanded customer base. We continue to place a strong emphasis on cash generation and capital allocation and deployment. This focus has afforded us the financial flexibility to deploy our cash resources to generate shareholder value while preserving a strong balance sheet to position us for the future. Year Ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,855 $ 3,124 $ 2,952 Net cash used by investing activities (1,392 ) (3,663 ) (875 ) Net cash used by financing activities (806 ) (718 ) (786 ) Net cash used by discontinued operations (15 ) (13 ) (4 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and equivalents 642 (1,270 ) 1,287 Cash and equivalents at beginning of year 1,621 2,891 1,604 Cash and equivalents at end of year 2,263 1,621 2,891 Marketable securities 360 143 168 Short-and long-term debt (3,864 ) (4,024 ) (2,791 ) Net (debt) surplus (a) $ (1,241 ) $ (2,260 ) $ 268 Debt-to-equity (b) 31.1 % 40.0 % 23.7 % Debt-to-capital (c) 23.7 % 28.6 % 19.2 % (a) Net (debt) surplus is calculated as total debt less cash and equivalents and marketable securities. (b) Debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total equity. (c) Debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total debt plus total equity. 30 General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report Table of Contents Our cash balances are invested primarily in time deposits from highly rated banks, commercial paper rated A1/P1 or higher and repurchase agreements with direct obligations of the Spanish government as collateral. Our marketable securities balances are invested primarily in term deposits and high-quality corporate, municipal and U.S. government-sponsored debt securities. The marketable securities have an average duration of six months and an average credit rating of AA-. We have not incurred any material losses associated with these investments. The following is a discussion of our major operating, investing and financing activities for each of the past three years, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Operating Activities We generated cash from operating activities of $2.9 billion in 2009, $3.1 billion in 2008 and $3 billion in 2007. In all three years, the operating cash flow was attributed primarily to net earnings and increasing levels of customer deposits, particularly in the Aerospace group. In 2009, cash from operating activities also reflected the collection of approximately $150 from the Czech Republic after we signed a renegotiated contract to provide Pandur II wheeled vehicles. In 2007, the cash flows from operating activities included the collection of approximately $270 of contract funds upon resolution of the Marine Systems group request for equitable adjustment on the T-AKE contract. Termination of A-12 Program. As discussed further in Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements, litigation on the A-12 program termination has been ongoing since 1991. If, contrary to our expectations, the default termination ultimately is sustained and the government prevails on its recovery theories, we, along with The Boeing Company, could collectively be required to repay the U.S. government as much as $1.4 billion for progress payments received for the A-12 contract, plus interest, which was approximately $1.5 billion at December 31, 2009. If this were the outcome, we would owe half of the total, or approximately $1.4 billion pretax. Our after-tax cash obligation would be approximately $715. We believe we have sufficient resources, including access to capital markets, to pay such an obligation, if required. Investing Activities We used $1.4 billion in 2009, $3.7 billion in 2008 and $875 in 2007 for investing activities. The primary uses of cash in investing activities were business acquisitions and capital expenditures. Business Acquisitions. In 2009, we completed two acquisitions for $811. In 2008, we completed five acquisitions for a total of $3.2 billion. In 2007, we completed four acquisitions for a total of $330. We financed these acquisitions using cash on hand and commercial paper. (See Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the acquisitions.) Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures were $385 in 2009, $490 in 2008 and $474 in 2007. The decrease in 2009 compared with 2008 resulted from the completion of several major facility improvement projects in the Aerospace and Marine Systems groups. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $450 in 2010, less than 2 percent of revenues. We had no material commitments for capital expenditures on December 31, 2009. Marketable Securities. As a result of lower market interest rates, we have expanded our investments in available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities in recent years to generate additional return. Net purchases of these securities were $235 in 2009 compared with net sales of $17 in 2008 and net purchases of $179 in 2007. Financing Activities We used $806 in 2009, $718 in 2008 and $786 in 2007 for financing activities. Our typical financing activities are issuances and repayments of debt, payment of dividends and repurchases of common stock. Net cash from financing activities also includes proceeds received from stock option exercises. Debt Proceeds, Net. We had no material debt issuances or repayments in 2007. In 2008, we issued $904 of commercial paper, primarily to fund acquisitions during the year. During that year we also repaid $500 of fixed-rate notes, $150 of senior notes and $20 of term debt on the scheduled maturity dates. We issued $1 billion of five-year fixed-rate notes in December 2008 and another $750 of two-year fixed-rate notes in June 2009. We used the proceeds from the fixed-rate notes for general corporate purposes, including working capital requirements, capital expenditures and to term out our commercial paper borrowings. We ended 2009 with no commercial paper outstanding, and our total debt balance was down by $160 from 2008. We have approximately $1.8 billion in bank credit facilities that have not been drawn upon. These facilities provide backup liquidity to our commercial paper program. The next material repayment of long-term debt is $700 of fixed-rate notes scheduled in the third quarter of 2010. (See Note J to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our debt obligations, including scheduled debt maturities.) Dividends. Our board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of $0.38 per share on March 4, 2009, the 12th consecutive annual increase. The board had previously increased the quarterly dividend to $0.35 per share in March 2008 and $0.29 per share in March 2007. Share Repurchases. In 2009, we repurchased 3.6 million of our outstanding shares on the open market. We repurchased 20 million shares in 2008 and 6.5 million shares in 2007 on the open market. On December 31, 2009, approximately 9.4 million shares remained authorized for repurchase by our board of directors about 2 percent of our total shares outstanding. General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report 31 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Management Metrics Return on Invested Capital. We emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns. In 2009, for the 11th consecutive year, net cash provided by operating activities exceeded net earnings. We deployed this cash to complete acquisitions, continue our trend of annual dividend increases and repurchase our outstanding shares. As a result of this continued focus on cash generation and disciplined capital deployment, our return on invested capital (ROIC) has grown 290 basis points since 2005. We believe ROIC is a useful measure for investors, because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations. We use ROIC to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management. We define ROIC as net operating profit after taxes divided by the sum of the average debt and shareholders equity for the year. Net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus after-tax interest and amortization expense. ROIC in 2008 and 2009 was impacted by the reduction and increase, respectively, in our shareholders equity associated with the returns on our retirement plan assets. (See Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of our retirement plans.) ROIC for 2005 through 2009 is calculated as follows: Year Ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 Earnings from continuing operations $ 2,407 $ 2,478 $ 2,080 $ 1,710 $ 1,448 After-tax interest expense 117 91 89 106 108 After-tax amortization expense 149 100 99 90 70 Net operating profit after taxes 2,673 2,669 2,268 1,906 1,626 Average debt and equity $ 15,003 $ 14,390 $ 13,430 $ 12,220 $ 10,948 Return on invested capital 17.8 % 18.5 % 16.9 % 15.6 % 14.9 % Free Cash Flow. Our free cash flow from operations was $2.5 billion in 2009, $2.6 billion in 2008, $2.5 billion in 2007 and $1.8 billion in each of 2006 and 2005. We define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors, because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our core businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends. We use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management. The following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Year Ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,855 $ 3,124 $ 2,952 $ 2,156 $ 2,033 Capital expenditures (385 ) (490 ) (474 ) (334 ) (262 ) Free cash flow from operations $ 2,470 $ 2,634 $ 2,478 $ 1,822 $ 1,771 Cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations: Net cash provided by operating activities 119 % 126 % 142 % 126 % 140 % Free cash flow from operations 103 % 106 % 119 % 107 % 122 % Over the past five years, we have generated free cash flow from operations well in excess of our earnings from continuing operations during the period an average 110 percent conversion rate. We expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short- and long-term liquidity needs. We believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy. ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION Off-balance Sheet Arrangements On December 31, 2009, other than operating leases, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantees; retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities; derivative instruments indexed to our stock and classified in shareholders equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; or variable interests in entities that provide us with financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support or engage with us in leasing, hedging or research and development services. 32 General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following tables present information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments on December 31, 2009: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Amount Committed Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than 5 Years Long-term debt (a) $ 4,440 $ 867 $ 1,002 $ 2,138 $ 433 Capital lease obligations 1 1 Operating leases 1,037 220 300 171 346 Purchase obligations (b) 25,195 11,183 7,405 4,033 2,574 Other long-term liabilities (c) 13,088 1,664 2,111 1,623 7,690 $ 43,761 $ 13,935 $ 10,818 $ 7,965 $ 11,043 (a) Includes scheduled interest payments. See Note J to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of long-term debt. (b) Includes amounts committed under legally enforceable agreements for goods and services with defined terms as to quantity, price and timing of delivery. This amount includes $19.8 billion of purchase orders for products and services to be delivered under firm government contracts under which we have full recourse under normal contract termination clauses. As disclosed in Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we expect to make approximately $330 of contributions to our retirement plans in 2010. This amount has been excluded from the above amount. (c) Represents other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, including the current portion of long-term liabilities. The projected timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based on management estimates, which are based largely on historical experience. This amount also includes all liabilities under our defined-benefit retirement plans, as discussed in Note P. See Note P for information regarding the plan assets available to satisfy these liabilities.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies Management Discussion and Analysis of our Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to long-term contracts and programs, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, workers compensation, warranty obligations, pre-owned aircraft inventory, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application: Revenue Recognition. We account for revenues and earnings in our defense and aerospace businesses using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we recognize contract revenue as the work progresses either as the products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered, as applicable. We estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the remaining life of the contract based on either input measures (e.g., costs incurred) or output measures (e.g., contract milestones or units delivered), as appropriate to the circumstances. Where an interim output measure is reliably determinable and representative of progress toward completion, we use such output measures. Otherwise, we use input measures. We generally measure progress toward completion on contracts in our defense businesses based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion or based on unit deliveries under the contract. Our contracts for the manufacture of business-jet aircraft usually provide for two major phases: the manufacture of the green aircraft (i.e., before exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics) and its completion. We record revenue at two contractual milestones: when green aircraft are delivered General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report 33 Table of Contents to, and accepted by, the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft. We do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless (1) a contract has been executed with the customer and (2) the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract, as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer and other factors. We include revisions of estimated profits on contracts in earnings under the reallocation method rather than the cumulative catch-up method. Under the reallocation method, the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term, while under the cumulative catch-up method such impact would be recognized immediately. If a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract, we recognize the loss in the period it is identified. Anticipated losses cover all costs allocable to the contracts, including G&A expenses on government contracts. We use the reallocation method because we believe the majority of factors that typically result in changes in estimates of total contract revenue, total costs or the extent of progress toward completion on our long-term contracts affect both the period in which the change is identified and future periods. We believe these changes generally reflect expectations as to future performance and, therefore, the reallocation method is the method that best matches our revenues and earnings in the periods in which they are earned. While we have applied this method consistently for more than 30 years, most contractors use the cumulative catch-up method. The percentage-of-completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion, and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications or other disputes. Contract estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years, including future labor productivity and availability, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials, the impact of delayed performance, the availability and timing of funding from the customer, and the timing of product deliveries. These estimates are based on our best judgment. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our contracts. We review our contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflect changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method. We recognize revenue arising from claims either as income or as an offset against a potential loss only when the amount of the claim can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. In evaluating these criteria, we consider the contractual/legal basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim. We recognize revenue from award or incentive fees when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee. Estimates of award or incentive fees are based on actual award experience and anticipated performance. Goodwill. Since 1995, we have acquired 54 businesses at a total cost of approximately $21 billion, including two in 2009. In connection with these acquisitions, we have recognized $12.3 billion of goodwill. Goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not. The test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process that requires a significant level of estimation by management, particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units. These estimates require the use of judgment. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations. This requires numerous assumptions, including the timing of work embedded in our backlog, our performance and profitability under our contracts, our success in securing future business, and the appropriate interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows. This discounted cash flow analysis is corroborated by top-down analyses, including a market assessment of our enterprise value. Beyond the annual impairment test, we review for factors on a quarterly basis that may lead us to perform a goodwill impairment test, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit. We have recorded no goodwill impairment to date and do not anticipate any reasonably possible circumstances that would lead to an impairment in the foreseeable future. The fair value of each of our reporting units on December 31, 2009, substantially exceeded its carrying value. Commitments and Contingencies. We are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either out of the ordinary course of our business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment. We record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable. The ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known. Deferred Contract Costs. Certain costs incurred in the performance of our government contracts are recorded under GAAP but are not currently allocable to contracts. Such costs include a portion of our estimated workers compensation obligations, other insurance-related assessments, pension and other post-retirement benefits, and environmental expenses. These costs will become allocable to contracts generally when they are paid. We have elected to defer (or inventory) these costs in contracts in process until they are paid, at which time the costs are charged to contracts and recovered from the government. We expect to recover these costs through ongoing business, including existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts. This business base includes numerous contracts for which we are the sole source or one of two suppliers on long-term defense programs. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs under our current and probable follow-on contracts. This assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs, the extent of cost recovery under 34 General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report Table of Contents our contracts and the amount of future contract activity. These estimates are based on our best judgment. If the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected. Retirement Plans. Our defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on a series of assumptions and estimates. The key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected long-term rates of return on plan assets. We determine the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period. We determine the long-term rate of return on assets based on historical returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy. These estimates are based on our best judgment, including consideration of current and future market conditions. In the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted, future pension and post-retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease. For the impact of hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for our commercial pension and post-retirement benefit plans, see Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As discussed under Deferred Contract Costs, our contractual arrangements with the U.S. government provide for the recovery of contributions to our government retirement plans. We have elected to defer recognition of the cumulative net unfunded benefit cost in our government plans to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses. Accordingly, the impact on the retirement benefit cost for these plans that results from annual changes in assumptions does not impact our future earnings either positively or negatively. We believe that our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented. New Accounting Standards In December 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009-17, Consolidations (Topic 810): Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities. ASU 2009-17 provides additional guidance with respect to the requirements for consolidation of a variable interest entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting rights. The standard also requires new disclosures regarding variable interest entities. ASU 2009-17 is effective in the first quarter of 2010. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2009-17 to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820): Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements. ASU 2010-06 requires new disclosures and clarifies some existing disclosures regarding fair value measurements. ASU 2010-06 is effective in the first quarter of 2010.
