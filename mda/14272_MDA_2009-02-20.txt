Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY About the Company Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (which may be referred to as Bristol-Myers Squibb, BMS or the Company) is a global biopharmaceutical and nutritional products company whose mission is to extend and enhance human life by providing the highest quality pharmaceutical and nutritional products. The Company is engaged in the discovery, development, licensing, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of pharmaceuticals and nutritional products. The Company has two reportable segments Pharmaceuticals and Nutritionals. The Pharmaceuticals segment consists of the global pharmaceutical/biotechnology and international consumer medicines business, which accounted for approximately 86% of the Company 2008 net sales. The Nutritionals segment consists of Mead Johnson Nutrition Company (Mead Johnson), primarily an infant formula and children nutritionals business, which accounted for approximately 14% of the Company 2008 net sales. 2008 Financial Highlights The following table is a summary of operating activity: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions 2008 2007 Net Sales $ 20,597 $ 18,193 Net Earnings from Continuing Operations 3,155 1,741 Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations 2,092 424 Net Earnings 5,247 2,165 Net Cash/(Debt) 1,526 (4,047 ) Net Sales The Company net sales from continuing operations increased 13%. PLAVIX* (clopidogrel bisulfate) and ABILIFY* continue to drive worldwide sales growth with sales increases of 18% and 30%, respectively. Significant contributions to sales growth are also provided by other key products including ORENCIA, SPRYCEL and the HIV and Hepatitis portfolio. Net Earnings from Continued Operations The increases in net earnings from continuing operations is attributed to increased sales growth and favorability in gross margins, a portion of which is attributed to a favorable product mix as well as cost savings and avoidances resulting from the Company productivity transformation initiative (PTI). The $582 million after-tax gain related to the tendering of the Company shares in ImClone also had a significant impact on net earnings from continuing operations amongst other specified items discussed in Expenses/Gains below. Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations In 2008, the Company completed the divestitures of its Medical Imaging business for a gross purchase price of $525 million resulting in an after-tax loss of $43 million as well as the ConvaTec business for gross purchase price of approximately $4.1 billion resulting in an after-tax gain of $2.0 billion. The results of the Medical Imaging and ConvaTec businesses and the related gains and losses are included in discontinued operations for all years presented. Net Cash/(Debt) Net cash/(debt) position as of December 31, 2008 improved due to proceeds of $4.6 billion from the divestiture of the ConvaTec and Medical Imaging businesses and proceeds of $1.0 billion from the sale of our ImClone shares. Cash generated from operating activities of $3.7 billion was more than adequate to fund dividend payments of $2.5 billion as well as capital expenditure payments of $941 million. Business Environment The Company conducts its business primarily within the pharmaceutical/biotechnology industry, which is highly competitive and subject to numerous government regulations. Many competitive factors may significantly affect the Company sales of its products, including product efficacy, safety, price and cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, product labeling, quality control and quality assurance of its manufacturing operations, and research and development of new products. To successfully compete for business in 38 Table of Contents the health care industry, the Company must demonstrate that its products offer medical benefits as well as cost advantages. Currently, most of the Company new product introductions compete with other products already on the market in the same therapeutic category, in addition to potential competition of new products that competitors may introduce in the future. The Company manufactures branded products, which are priced higher than generic products. Generic competition is one of the Company leading challenges globally. In the pharmaceutical/biotechnology industry, the majority of an innovative product commercial value is usually realized during the period that the product has market exclusivity. When a product loses exclusivity, it is no longer protected by a patent and is subject to new competing products in the form of generic brands. Upon exclusivity loss, the Company can lose a major portion of that product sales in a short period of time. Currently, generic versions of biological products cannot be approved under United States (U.S.) law. However, the law could change in the future. Even in the absence of new legislation, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is taking steps toward allowing generic versions of certain biologics. Competitors seeking approval of biological products must file their own safety and efficacy data and address the challenges of biologics manufacturing, which involves more complex processes that are more costly than those of traditional pharmaceutical operations. Both in the U.S. and internationally, the health care industry is subject to various government-imposed regulations authorizing prices or price controls that have and will continue to have an impact on the Company sales. In the U.S., Congress and some state legislatures have considered a number of proposals and have enacted laws that could result in major changes in the current health care system, either nationally or at the state level. Driven in part by budget concerns, Medicaid access and reimbursement restrictions have been implemented in some states and proposed in many others. In addition, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act provides outpatient prescription drug coverage to senior citizens in the U.S. This legislation has had a modest favorable impact on the Company as a result of an increase in the number of seniors with drug coverage. At the same time, there continues to be a potential negative impact on the U.S. pharmaceutical business that could result from pricing pressures or controls. In many markets outside the U.S., the Company operates in environments of government-mandated, cost-containment programs, or under other regulatory bodies or groups that can exert downward pressure on pricing. Pricing freedom is limited in the United Kingdom (UK), for instance, by the operation of a profit control plan and in Germany by the operation of a reference price system. Companies also face significant delays in market access for new products as more than two years can elapse after drug approval before new medicines become available in some countries. The growth of Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) in the U.S. has played a large role in the competition that surrounds the health care industry. MCOs seek to reduce health care expenditures for participants by making volume purchases and entering into long-term contracts to negotiate discounts with various pharmaceutical providers. Because of the market potential created by the large pool of participants, marketing prescription drugs to MCOs has become an important part of the Company strategy. Companies compete for inclusion in MCO formularies and the Company generally has been successful in having its major products included. The Company believes that developments in the managed care industry, including continued consolidation, have had and will continue to have a generally downward pressure on prices. Pharmaceutical/biotechnology production processes are complex, highly regulated and vary widely from product to product. Shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures and regulatory approvals. Biologics manufacturing involves more complex processes than those of traditional pharmaceutical operations. As biologics become more important to the Company product portfolio, the Company will continue to make arrangements with third-party manufacturers and to make substantial investments to increase its internal capacity to produce biologics on a commercial scale. One such investment is a new, state-of-the-art manufacturing facility for the production of biologics in Devens, Massachusetts, the construction of which began in May 2007. The Company has maintained a competitive position in the market and strives to uphold this position, which is dependent on its success in discovering and developing innovative, cost-effective products that serve unmet medical need. The Company has expanded PTI activities in order to achieve additional savings in order to further reduce costs, streamline operations and rationalize global manufacturing to become a more productive and competitive biopharmaceutical company. The Company and its subsidiaries are the subject of a number of significant pending lawsuits, claims, proceedings and investigations. It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the final outcome of these investigations or litigations. For additional discussion of legal matters, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 25. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Strategy The Company multi-year strategy is transformation into a next-generation biopharmaceutical company. The strategy encompasses all aspects and all geographies of the business and will yield substantial cost savings and cost avoidance and increase the Company financial flexibility to take advantage of attractive market opportunities that may arise. 39 Table of Contents Managing costs is one part of the Company overall strategy as it transitions to a next-generation biopharmaceutical company, focused on delivering its present commitments, maximizing near-term growth opportunities and improving its earnings base in 2012-2013. The Company announced PTI designed to create a total of $2.5 billion in annual productivity savings and cost avoidance by 2012. The first wave, announced in December 2007, targets $1.5 billion in savings and cost avoidance by 2010. The second wave, announced in July 2008, targets an additional $1.0 billion in savings and cost avoidance by 2012. The Company will continue to focus on the development of our biopharmaceutical business and will maintain its growth by investing in research and development of new product pipeline. The Company will continue to invest in key growth products, including specialty and biologic medicines, and cardiovascular and metabolic drugs. The Company is seeking to reallocate resources to continue its string of pearls strategy and enable strategic transactions, such as the acquisition of Kosan Biosciences, Inc. (Kosan) and strategic alliances, such as the global codevelopment and cocommercialization agreement with Exelixis, Inc. (Exelixis) and a global collaboration agreement with ZymoGenetics, both entered in 2008. The Company will continue pursuing partnerships and expanding other collaborative arrangements with biopharmaceutical companies and will continue entering into strategic alliances with third parties in order to obtain rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical products, the rights to which are owned by such third parties. The Company will continue to maximize the value of our non-core businesses. In 2008, the Company completed the divestiture of its ConvaTec and Medical Imaging businesses. The Company has also sold its mature brands business located in Egypt. New Product and Pipeline Developments SPRYCEL In January 2009, the Company announced the approval of SPRYCEL in Japan. IXEMPRA In December 2008, the Company announced new data from studies of IXEMPRA (ixabepilone) plus capecitabine compared to capecitabine alone, including a pre-specified sub set analysis demonstrating a significant increase in progression free survival in patients with triple negative breast cancer. In November 2008, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in Europe issued a negative opinion on the marketing authorization application for IXEMPRA in the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer. The Company requested a re-examination of the case, which is currently under consideration by CHMP. Exelixis In December 2008, the Company announced a global collaboration with Exelixis covering two novel molecules for cancer with their associated development programs: Exelixis XL184, a small molecule inhibitor of MET, VEGFR2 and RET, which is currently in Phase III development for medullary thyroid cancer; and, Exelixis XL281, a small molecule inhibitor of RAF kinase, which is currently in Phase I development for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies. Under the agreement, the Company receives development and commercialization rights to both programs. Dapagliflozin In December 2008, the Company and AstraZeneca announced expansion of their worldwide collaboration to include the development and commercialization of dapagliflozin in Japan. Dapagliflozin, one of two investigational drugs under joint development by the companies, is currently being studied in Phase III clinical trials in several countries, including the U.S., to assess its efficacy and safety as a once-daily treatment for type 2 diabetes. ERBITUX* In January 2009, the Company and its marketing partner ImClone Systems, Inc. (ImClone), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly), announced, that the companies will withdraw, and eventually resubmit, an application with the FDA to broaden the use of ERBITUX* to include first-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin/vinorelbine). In October 2008, the FDA has accepted for filing and priority review, the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to broaden the indication for ERBITUX* to include use in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. In October 2008, publication of study results showing that metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients with wild-type or normal K-ras tumors who were treated with ERBITUX* plus best supportive care (BSC) had a statistically significant increase in overall survival and progression-free survival compared to those treated with BSC alone. Specifically, patients whose tumors had the normal (mutant negative) K-ras gene achieved a near two-fold improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over patients treated with BSC alone. In patients with mutated K-ras tumors, there was no significant difference in overall or progression-free survival between those treated with ERBITUX* plus BSC and those treated with BSC alone. The Company and the FDA are in discussions regarding possible label changes related to this study. 40 Table of Contents In September 2008, the announcement of five year data showing significant improvements in overall survival for patients with locally or regionally advanced head and neck cancer and the EXTREME study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine showing that ERBITUX* improved survival in first-line recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck cancer. In July 2008, ERBITUX* received marketing approval in Japan for treatment of patients with advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer. In May 2008, at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), a landmark Phase III study (FLEX) showed that the addition of ERBITUX* to platinum-based chemotherapy significantly increased overall survival in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, when compared to platinum-based chemotherapy alone. ABILIFY* A supplemental New Drug Application for ABILIFY* was approved by the FDA in February 2008 for the acute treatment of manic and mixed episodes associated with certain pediatric patients (age 10-17) with Bipolar I Disorder. FDA approval was received in May 2008 for new ABILIFY* indications for pediatric bipolar (ages 10-17) maintenance therapy, pediatric schizophrenia (ages 10-17) maintenance therapy, and as add-on treatment to lithium or valproate for acute treatment of bipolar disorder in both pediatric (age 10-17) and adult patients. The European Commission authorized marketing of ABILIFY* in March 2008 in the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to ABILIFY* treatment. ORENCIA In October 2008, the Company announced results from a 10-month study, which showed that ORENCIA, compared to placebo (PBO), significantly improved multiple aspects of health-related quality of life: physical and psychosocial well being, pain and sleep quality in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients between the ages 6 and 17 years. These results were part of a study looking at the safety and efficacy of ORENCIA in children with JIA who had failed on previous treatments such as methotrexate (MTX) or biologics. In October 2008, the Company announced results from a Phase IIIb study in adult patients with early moderate-to-severe erosive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had never received previous MTX treatment. This study showed that ORENCIA in combination with MTX had significantly more patients achieve a Disease Activity Score 28 using C-reactive protein-defined remission, compared with MTX plus PBO. The safety profile of ORENCIA in combination with MTX was similar to that of MTX plus PBO. Also, in the same quarter, the Company filed an sBLA with the FDA for the use of ORENCIA for patients with early RA. In June 2008, new Phase II data presented at the European League Against Rheumatism demonstrated that ORENCIA may delay the development of RA in people with undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis. In April 2008, ORENCIA was approved by the FDA for treatment of juvenile RA. Additionally, the U.S. label for ORENCIA was revised with an indication that means ORENCIA is now an appropriate option for patients with moderate-to-severe RA, regardless of prior treatment received. REYATAZ In October 2008, the Company announced 96-week data from the CASTLE study, in which 74% of the 440 patients in the REYATAZ/r arm achieved an undetectable viral load, defined as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 RNA less than 50 copies/mL, compared with 68% of the 443 patients in the lopinavir/r arm. The difference between treatment arms may have been related to the 16% discontinuation rate in the REYATAZ/r arm and the 21% discontinuation rate in the lopinavir/r arm. In October 2008, the FDA approved the use of REYATAZ (atazanavir sulfate) 300 milligram once-daily boosted with ritonavir 100 milligram as part of combination therapy in previously untreated (treatment-na ve) HIV-1 infected patients. This use of once-daily REYATAZ/ritonavir in HIV-1 infected treatment-na ve adult patients is based upon 48-week results from the CASTLE study, which demonstrated similar antiviral efficacy of REYATAZ/ritonavir to twice-daily lopinavir/ritonavir, each as part of HIV combination therapy in treatment-na ve HIV-1 infected adult patients. Data from the CASTLE study was published in the August 23 issue of The Lancet . In June 2008, European approval was received for an expanded indication for REYATAZ 300 mg once-daily boosted with ritonavir 100 mg as part of combination therapy in treatment-na ve HIV-1 infected patients. In February 2008, the first data comparing boosted REYATAZ (REYATAZ plus ritonavir) and lopinavir/ritonavir was presented at the Congress on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. 41 Table of Contents BARACLUDE The Company announced in November 2008 data from two separate cohort evaluations, in which long-term treatment with BARACLUDE was associated with improved liver histology, including improvement in fibrosis, in chronic hepatitis B patients. The histology data were presented at the 59th Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. New data at the March 2008 Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver meeting, demonstrated a continued low incidence of resistance to BARACLUDE in nucleoside-naive patients through five years of treatment, which is important for many chronic hepatitis B patients requiring long-term treatment. Apixaban In September 2008, the Company and its development partner Pfizer announced a Phase II study (APPRAISE-1) of apixaban a novel anticoagulant provided encouraging trends suggesting that anticoagulation with apixaban on top of current standards of care and continued beyond the initial hospitalization may reduce the risk of a second heart attack, stroke or death. The primary endpoint was not met in a Phase III study of apixaban for prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients undergoing total knee replacement. The results of the trial do not necessitate any changes in protocols of any other ongoing apixaban studies. The companies are considering further studies in preventing VTE in knee surgery and will not submit the U.S. regulatory filing for VTE prevention in the second half of 2009, as previously communicated. Programs directed toward prevention of VTE, including European Medicines Evaluation Agency registration studies, treatment of VTE, Acute Coronary Systems and in the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation continue as planned. Ipilimumab Favorable updated survival data was announced in September 2008 from three Phase II studies of ipilimumab. Saxagliptin Favorable results were announced in September 2008 of Phase III studies of ONGLYZA (saxagliptin). Regulatory submissions for ONGLYZA were made in both the U.S. and in Europe on June 30 and July 1, respectively. At the annual scientific sessions of the American Diabetes Association, a Phase III study demonstrated that saxagliptin produced significant reductions in key measures of glucose control in treatment-na ve people with type 2 diabetes compared to placebo. Elotuzumab The Company entered into an agreement with PDL BioPharma, Inc. in August 2008, for the global development and commercialization of elotuzumab, an anti-CS1 antibody currently in Phase I development for multiple myeloma. KAI-9803 In May 2008, the Company entered into an agreement with KAI to develop and commercialize KAI novel acute heart attack medicine, KAI-9803. Kosan In June 2008, Bristol-Myers Squibb completed the acquisition of Kosan, a cancer therapeutics company with a library of novel compounds, including Hsp90 inhibitors for cancer and microtubule stabilizers, which may have additional potential in neurodegenerative diseases. ZymoGenetics In January 2009, the Company and ZymoGenetics announced a global collaboration for PEG-Interferon lambda, a novel type 3 interferon currently in Phase Ib development for the treatment of Hepatitis C, and its related development program. PLAVIX* The European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use in March 2008 issued a positive opinion recommending approval of the 300 milligram loading dose tablet of PLAVIX*. This positive opinion was ratified by the European Commission. 42 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussions of the Company results of continuing operations exclude the results related to the Medical Imaging business prior to its divestiture in January 2008, and the ConvaTec business prior to its divestiture in August 2008. Both Medical Imaging and ConvaTec were previously presented as a component of the former Other Health Care operating segment, which was renamed the ConvaTec operating segment subsequent to the Medical Imaging divestiture. These businesses have been segregated from continuing operations and included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. The Company results of operations were as follows: % Change Dollars in Millions 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Net Sales $ 20,597 $ 18,193 $ 16,208 13 % 12 % Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Minority Interest $ 5,471 $ 3,186 $ 2,085 72 % 53 % % of net sales 26.6 % 17.5 % 12.9 % Provision for Income Taxes $ 1,320 $ 682 $ 431 94 % 58 % Effective tax rate 24.1 % 21.4 % 20.7 % Net Earnings from Continuing Operations $ 3,155 $ 1,741 $ 1,214 81 % 43 % % of net sales 15.3 % 9.6 % 7.5 % Net Sales The composition of the changes in net sales was as follows: 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Net Sales Analysis of % Change Analysis of % Change Dollars in Millions 2008 2007 2006 Total Change Volume Price Foreign Exchange Total Change Volume Price Foreign Exchange U.S. $ 12,042 $ 10,422 $ 8,785 16 % 9 % 7 % 19 % 15 % 4 % Non-U.S. 8,555 7,771 7,423 10 % 4 % 1 % 5 % 5 % (1 )% 6 % Total $ 20,597 $ 18,193 $ 16,208 13 % 7 % 4 % 2 % 12 % 7 % 2 % 3 % The 2008 and 2007 increase in U.S. net sales is primarily driven by growth in key U.S. pharmaceutical products which are described below in further detail. Increases in international net sales in 2008 and 2007 were aided by a weakened U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies, especially the euro and U.K. pound. In general, the Company business is not seasonal. For information on U.S. pharmaceutical prescriber demand, reference is made to the table within Pharmaceuticals below, which sets forth a comparison of changes in net sales to the estimated total prescription growth (for both retail and mail order customers) for certain of the Company key pharmaceuticals products and new products sold by the U.S. pharmaceuticals business. The U.S. and non-U.S. net sales are based upon the location of the customer. 43 Table of Contents The Company net sales by segment were as follows: Net Sales % Change % of Total Net Sales Dollars in Millions 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 2008 2007 2006 Pharmaceuticals $ 17,715 $ 15,622 $ 13,861 13 % 13 % 86 % 86 % 86 % Nutritionals 2,882 2,571 2,347 12 % 10 % 14 % 14 % 14 % Total $ 20,597 $ 18,193 $ 16,208 13 % 12 % 100 % 100 % 100 % The Company recognizes revenue net of various sales adjustments to arrive at net sales as reported on the consolidated statements of earnings. These adjustments are referred to as gross-to-net sales adjustments and are further described in Critical Accounting Policies below. The reconciliations of the Company gross sales to net sales by each significant category of gross-to-net sales adjustments were as follows: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions 2008 2007 2006 Gross Sales $ 23,344 $ 20,814 $ 18,909 Gross-to-Net Sales Adjustments Prime Vendor Charge-Backs (529 ) (551 ) (624 ) Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Rebates (796 ) (848 ) (872 ) Managed Health Care Rebates and Other Contract Discounts (376 ) (333 ) (274 ) Medicaid Rebates (205 ) (169 ) (174 ) Cash Discounts (282 ) (239 ) (214 ) Sales Returns (228 ) (155 ) (224 ) Other Adjustments (331 ) (326 ) (319 ) Total Gross-to-Net Sales Adjustments (2,747 ) (2,621 ) (2,701 ) Net Sales $ 20,597 $ 18,193 $ 16,208 The gross-to-net adjustments are primarily a function of gross sales and activity is typically correlated with current sales trends as is the case with managed health care rebates and other contract discounts, Medicaid rebates, cash discounts, and other adjustments in 2008, 2007 and 2006. Managed health care rebates and other contract discounts and Medicaid rebates are also affected by changes to sales mix and contractual and legislative discount rates. The 2007 increases in managed health care rebates and other contract discounts were also impacted by the reduction of reserves in 2006 related to the TRICARE Retail Pharmacy Refund Program. Prime vendor charge-backs decreased throughout 2008 and 2007 as a result lower sales of TAXOL attributed to the loss of exclusivity. The Women, Infant and Children (WIC) rebates decrease is related to the net impact of several WIC contract transactions. The 2008 increase in sales returns is primarily attributed to increased provisions for PRAVACHOL, driven by higher retail sales returns than previously assumed, and the loss of exclusivity of ZERIT. The 2007 variance in sales returns when compared to the prior year is attributed to higher provisions in 2006 for cardiovascular non-exclusive brands and from the discontinued commercialization of TEQUIN (gatifloxacin). 44 Table of Contents The activities and ending balances of each significant category of gross-to-net sales adjustments were as follows: Dollars in Millions Prime Vendor Charge-Backs Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Rebates Managed Health Care Rebates and Other Contract Discounts Medicaid Rebates Cash Discounts Sales Returns Other Adjustments Total Balance at January 1, 2007 $ 63 230 $ 111 $ 137 $ 18 $ 221 $ 124 $ 904 Provision related to sales made in current period 551 845 340 176 238 137 328 2,615 Provision related to sales made in prior periods 3 (7 ) (7 ) 1 18 (2 ) 6 Returns and payments (551 ) (880 ) (306 ) (181 ) (234 ) (201 ) (334 ) (2,687 ) Impact of foreign currency translation 6 4 10 20 Discontinued operations 7 (10 ) 1 (1 ) 2 (1 ) Balance at December 31, 2007 $ 70 $ 198 $ 134 $ 125 $ 24 $ 178 $ 128 $ 857 Provision related to sales made in current period 529 799 383 213 281 136 338 2,679 Provision related to sales made in prior periods (3 ) (7 ) (8 ) 1 92 (7 ) 68 Returns and payments (531 ) (799 ) (357 ) (197 ) (274 ) (189 ) (333 ) (2,680 ) Impact of foreign currency translation 2 (1 ) (5 ) (3 ) (7 ) Discontinued operations (23 ) (1 ) (3 ) (8 ) (35 ) Balance at December 31, 2008 $ 45 $ 195 $ 154 $ 133 $ 31 $ 209 $ 115 $ 882 In 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded gross-to-net sales adjustments related to sales made in prior periods. The significant items included charges for sales returns of $92 million in 2008 and $18 million in 2007, primarily resulting from higher than expected returns of certain non-exclusive products. No other significant revisions were made to the estimates for gross-to-net sales adjustments in 2008 and 2007.

PLAVIX* and ABILIFY*, represented approximately 46% and 16%, of total U.S. pharmaceuticals net sales and represented approximately 53% and 23% of the total growth in pharmaceuticals sales when compared to prior year. In 2007, PLAVIX* and ABILIFY* represented approximately 45% and 15%, of total U.S. pharmaceuticals net sales and contributed approximately 89% and 16%, of total growth in U.S. pharmaceuticals net sales. This growth more than offsets decreases in U.S. net sales attributed to generic competition for PRAVACHOL. Both 2008 and 2007 international pharmaceuticals sales were aided by a weakened U.S. dollar against many foreign currencies when compared to the previous period. The Company reported international net sales do not include copromotion sales reported by its alliance partner, Sanofi-Aventis (Sanofi) for PLAVIX* and AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*, which continued to show growth in 2008. Net sales of key pharmaceutical products represent 80%, 76% and 72% of total pharmaceutical net sales in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The following table details U.S. and international pharmaceuticals net sales by key products, the percentage change from prior year as well as the foreign exchange impact when compared to the prior year.

PLAVIX * - a platelet aggregation inhibitor that is part of the Company alliance with Sanofi U.S. sales increases in 2008 and 2007 were primarily attributed to increased prescription demand and higher average selling prices. Demand was negatively affected beginning in the third quarter of 2006 through the second quarter of 2007 by the launch of a generic clopidogrel bisulfate. The generic in the distribution channel was substantially depleted by June 30, 2007. In 2008 and 2007, estimated total U.S. prescription demand for clopidogrel bisulfate (branded and generic) increased approximately 4% and 8%, respectively, whereas estimated U.S. prescription demand for branded PLAVIX* increased 19% and 34% respectively. 46 Table of Contents International net sales in 2008 were negatively impacted by the August 2008 launch of a clopidogrel alternative salt (clopidogrel beyslate) launched in Germany. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 25. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies PLAVIX* Litigation, for further discussion on PLAVIX* exclusivity litigation in both the U.S. and EU. AVAPRO* /AVALIDE * (known in the EU as APROVEL*/KARVEA*) - an angiotensin II receptor blocker for the treatment of hypertension and diabetic nephropathy that is also part of the Sanofi alliance Worldwide sales increases in 2008 and 2007 were primarily attributed to higher average selling prices which more than offset declines in overall demand. Total U.S. prescription demand for AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* decreased approximately 7% in 2008 and approximately 4% in 2007. PRAVACHOL - - an HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and reducing the risk of heart attack Worldwide sales decreases in 2008 and 2007 were attributed to continued generic competition in the U.S. and key European markets. Market exclusivity ended in the U.S in April 2006 and in 2004 for most EU countries. U.S. sales in 2008 were negatively impacted by higher retail sales returns than previously assumed. REYATAZ - a protease inhibitor for the treatment of HIV U.S. sales increases in 2008 and 2007 were primarily due to a higher prescription demand of 14% and 13%, respectively. The international sales increase in 2008 was primarily due to higher demand across most markets with Europe being the key driver due to the June 2008 approval for front-line treatment. Growth in 2007 international revenue was attributed to increased demand in Europe and Latin America. SUSTIVA Franchise - a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV, which includes SUSTIVA, an antiretroviral drug, and bulk efavirenz, which is also included in the combination therapy, ATRIPLA* (efavirenez 600mg/ emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg), a product sold through a joint venture with Gilead Sciences, Inc. Worldwide sales increases in 2008 and 2007 were primarily due to higher demand attributed to the successful launch of ATRIPLA* in the U.S. in July 2006; in the EU in December 2007; and in Canada in October 2007. U.S. prescription demand for the Sustiva franchise increased approximately 14% in 2008 and 20% in 2007. To a lesser extent, higher average selling prices contributed to the increase in net revenues. BARACLUDE - an oral antiviral agent for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B Worldwide sales increases in 2008 and 2007 were primarily due to the continued growth across all markets, particularly international markets, due to the successful launch in various countries including China in February 2006, the UK and Germany in July 2006, France and Japan in September 2006 and the U.S. in April 2005. There continues to be increased awareness and acceptance of its long-term efficacy, safety and resistance data as evidenced by the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease treatment guidelines that recommended BARACLUDE as a first line treatment option. ERBITUX* - a monoclonal antibody designed to exclusively target and block the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, which is expressed on the surface of certain cancer cells in multiple tumor types as well as normal cells and is currently indicated for use against colorectal cancer and head and neck cancer. ERBITUX* is part of the Company strategic alliance with ImClone Sold by the Company almost exclusively in the U.S., the sales increases in 2008 and 2007 were primarily due to increased demand for a recent indication for usage in the treatment of head and neck cancer. Sales in 2007 were also positively impacted by a transition to a broader distribution model resulting in higher sales associated with initial shipments of inventory to distributors. TAXOL - an anti-cancer agent, currently sold almost exclusively in non-U.S. markets Sales decreases in 2008 and 2007 were due primarily to generic competition in Japan. 47 Table of Contents SPRYCEL - an oral inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases, for the treatment of adults with chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy, including GLEEVEC* (imatinib meslylate) Worldwide sales increases in 2008 and 2007 were primarily due to higher demand associated with the successful launch in the U.S. in July 2006 and in most European markets beginning in the fourth quarter of 2006, higher U.S. selling prices and continued launches in Russia and Turkey in 2008. IXEMPRA - a microtubule inhibitor for the treatment of patients with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer The sales increase in 2008 reflects the launch of the product in the U.S. in October 2007. ABILIFY* - an antipsychotic agent for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar mania disorder and major depressive disorder and is part of the Company strategic alliance with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Otsuka) U.S. sales increases in 2008 and 2007 were primarily attributed to increased demand and higher average selling prices. Prescription demand increased approximately 23% in 2008 and approximately 12% in 2007. Contributing to the prescription growth are new indications in 2008 and 2007 for certain patients with bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. International sales increases in 2008 and 2007 were also primarily attributed to increased prescription demand. 2008 sales growth was aided by a new bipolar indication in the second quarter of 2008 in the EU. ORENCIA - a fusion protein indicated for adult patients with moderate to severe RA who have had an inadequate response to one or more currently available treatments, such as MTX or anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy U.S. sales increases in 2008 and 2007 were primarily due to the continued growth since the launch of this biologic product in the U.S. in February 2006. International sales increase in 2008 reflects the European launch in May 2007. The estimated U.S. prescription change data provided throughout this Form 10-K includes information only from the retail and mail order channels and does not reflect information from other channels, such as hospitals, institutions and long-term care, among others. The estimated prescription data is based on the Next-Generation Prescription Service (NGPS) version 2.0 of the National Prescription Audit provided by IMS Health (IMS), a supplier of market research for the pharmaceutical industry, as described below. The data provided by IMS is a product of IMS own recordkeeping process and is an estimate based on IMS sampling procedures. The data is subject to the inherent limitations of estimates based on sampling and may include a margin of error. The Company has calculated the estimated total U.S. prescription change based on NGPS data on a weighted-average basis to reflect the fact that mail order prescriptions include a greater volume of product supplied compared to retail prescriptions. Mail order prescriptions typically reflect a 90-day prescription whereas retail prescriptions typically reflect a 30-day prescription. The calculation is derived by multiplying NGPS mail order prescription data by a factor that approximates three and adding to this the NGPS retail prescriptions. The Company believes that this calculation of the estimated total U.S. prescription change based on the weighted-average approach with respect to the retail and mail order channels provides a superior estimate of total prescription demand. The Company uses this methodology for its internal demand forecasts. The Company continuously seeks to improve the quality of its estimates of prescription change amounts and ultimate patient/consumer demand through review of its methodologies and processes for calculation of these estimates and review and analysis of its own and third parties data used in such calculations. The Company expects that it will continue to review and refine its methodologies and processes for calculation of these estimates and will continue to review and analyze its own and third parties data used in such calculations. 48 Table of Contents Estimated End-User Demand The following tables set forth for each of the Company key pharmaceutical products sold by the U.S. Pharmaceuticals business, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006: (i) total U.S. net sales for the period; (ii) change in reported U.S. net sales for the period; (iii) estimated total U.S. prescription change for the retail and mail order channels calculated by the Company based on NGPS data on a weighted-average basis and (iv) months of inventory on hand in the wholesale distribution channel.

Pursuant to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Consent Order described below under SEC Consent Order , the Company monitors the level of inventory on hand in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel and outside of the U.S. in the direct customer distribution channel. The Company is obligated to disclose products with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception. The following products had estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel in excess of one month on hand (1) in the case of the Company U.S. Pharmaceuticals products, December 31, 2008 and (2) in the case of the Company international Pharmaceuticals and Nutritionals products, September 30, 2008. At September 30, 2008, BUFFERIN, a salicylatate drug, had approximately 1.1 months of inventory on hand at direct customers compared to approximately 0.9 months of inventory on hand at December 31, 2007. The increased level of inventory on hand was due primarily to increased inventory levels in China caused by distributors preparations for national holidays. At September 30, 2008, DAFALGAN, an analgesic product sold principally in Europe, had approximately 1.1 months of inventory on hand as compared to 1.2 months of inventory on hand at December 31, 2007. The previously stated level of inventory on hand as of September 30, 2008 was due primarily to private pharmacists purchasing DAFALGAN approximately once every eight weeks and the seasonality of the product. At September 30, 2008, VIDEX/VIDEX EC, an antiviral product, had approximately 1.3 months of inventory on hand at direct customers compared to 1.3 months of inventory on hand at December 31, 2007. The previously stated level of inventory on hand was due primarily to government purchasing patterns in Brazil. The Company is contractually obligated to provide VIDEX/VIDEX EC to the Brazilian government upon placement of an order for product by the government. Under the terms of the contract, the Company has no control over the inventory levels relating to such orders. 49 Table of Contents In the U.S., for all products sold exclusively through wholesalers or through distributors, the Company determines its months on hand estimates using information with respect to inventory levels of product on hand and the amount of out-movement of products provided by the Company three largest wholesalers, which accounted for approximately 90% of total gross sales of U.S. Pharmaceuticals products in 2008, and provided by the Company distributors. Factors that may influence the Company estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, wholesaler purchases in light of increases in wholesaler list prices, new product launches, new warehouse openings by wholesalers and new customer stockings by wholesalers. In addition, such estimates are calculated using third-party data, which represent their own record-keeping processes and may also reflect estimates. For pharmaceutical products in the U.S. that are not sold exclusively through wholesalers or distributors and for the Company Pharmaceuticals business outside of the U.S. and Nutritionals business units around the world, the Company has significantly more direct customers. Limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information, where available, varies widely. In cases where direct customer product level inventory, ultimate patient/consumer demand or out-movement data does not exist or is otherwise not available, the Company has developed a variety of other methodologies to calculate estimates of such data, including using such factors as historical sales made to direct customers and third-party market research data related to prescription trends and end-user demand. Accordingly, the Company relies on a variety of methods to estimate direct customer product level inventory and to calculate months on hand for these business units. Factors that may affect the Company estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, direct customer purchases in light of price increases, new product or product presentation launches, new warehouse openings by direct customers, new customer stockings by direct customers and expected direct customer purchases for governmental bidding situations. Nutritionals The composition of the change in nutritional net sales was as follows: Net Sales 2008 vs. 2007 Analysis of % Change 2007 vs. 2006 Analysis of % Change Dollars in Millions 2008 2007 2006 Total Change Volume Price Foreign Exchange Total Change Volume Price Foreign Exchange U.S. $ 1,108 $ 1,128 $ 1,091 (2 )% (6 )% 4 % 3 % 1 % 2 % Non-U.S. 1,774 1,443 1,256 23 % 8 % 12 % 3 % 15 % 4 % 5 % 6 % Total $ 2,882 $ 2,571 $ 2,347 12 % 2 % 8 % 2 % 10 % 3 % 4 % 3 % Infant formulas and toddler/children nutritionals, representing 97%, 96% and 96% of total nutritional net sales in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, were as follows: Net Sales % Change Dollars in Millions 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Infant Formulas $ 1,932 $ 1,786 $ 1,637 8 % 9 % ENFAMIL 1,157 1,082 1,007 7 % 7 % Toddler/Children Nutritionals 856 693 606 24 % 14 % In 2008, the decrease in U.S. nutritional net sales was primarily due to decreased sales of infant formulas. The increase in international nutritionals net sales was primarily due to growth in both infant formulas and children nutritionals. In 2007, the increase in U.S. nutritional net sales was primarily due to increased sales of infant formulas. International nutritional net sales increased primarily due to growth in both infant formulas and children nutritionals. 50 Table of Contents Geographic Areas In general, the Company products are available in most countries in the world. The largest markets are in the U.S., France, Spain, Canada, China, Japan, Italy, Mexico and Germany. The Company sales by geographic areas based on the location of the entity selling the product were as follows: Net Sales % Change % of Total Net Sales Dollars in Millions 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 2008 2007 2006 United States $ 12,042 $ 10,422 $ 8,785 16 % 19 % 58 % 57 % 54 % Europe, Middle East and Africa 4,514 4,036 3,979 12 % 1 % 22 % 22 % 25 % Other Western Hemisphere 1,622 1,628 1,517 7 % 8 % 9 % 9 % Pacific 2,419 2,107 1,927 15 % 9 % 12 % 12 % 12 % Total $ 20,597 $ 18,193 $ 16,208 13 % 12 % 100 % 100 % 100 % See items previously discussed in Item 1. Pharmaceuticals for items impacting the increase in U.S. net sales for 2008 and 2007. Europe, Middle East and Africa sales increases in 2008 are primarily due to sales growth in major European markets for ABILIFY*, SPRYCEL, and the HIV and hepatitis portfolio in addition to a favorable foreign exchange impact of 6%. Sales in 2007 were essentially flat as sales growth in major European markets for SPRYCEL, ABILIFY* and the HIV and hepatitis portfolio, and a favorable foreign exchange impact of 8%, was offset by generic competition for PRAVACHOL and TAXOL. Other Western Hemisphere countries sales in 2008 were essentially flat with a minimum foreign exchange impact. Sales increases in 2007 are primarily due to increased sales of PLAVIX* in Canada and Mexico, key nutritional products and AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* in Canada, and a favorable foreign exchange impact of 4%. These increases were partially offset by the discontinued commercialization of TEQUIN. Pacific region sales increases in 2008 and 2007 are primarily due to sales growth of BARACLUDE in China, Japan, and Korea and key nutritional products throughout the region in addition to favorable foreign exchange impacts of 6% and 5%, respectively. In addition, sales in 2007 were negatively impacted by increased generic competition for TAXOL and PRAVACHOL. No single country outside the U.S. contributed more than 10% of the Company total revenues in 2008, 2007 or 2006. Net sales in France, Canada, Spain and Japan exceeded $500 million in both 2008 and 2007. Net sales in China and Italy exceeded $500 million in 2008, while Mexico had more than $500 million in sales in 2007. 51 Table of Contents Expenses/Gains % Change % of Net Sales Dollars in Millions 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 2008 2007 2006 Costs of products sold $ 6,396 $ 5,868 $ 5,420 9 % 8 % 31 % 32 % 33 % Marketing, selling and administrative 4,792 4,516 4,469 6 % 1 % 23 % 25 % 28 % Advertising and product promotion 1,550 1,415 1,304 10 % 9 % 8 % 8 % 8 % Research and development 3,585 3,227 2,951 11 % 9 % 17 % 18 % 18 % Acquired in-process research and development 32 230 (86 )% 100 % 1 % Provision for restructuring, net 218 183 59 19 % ** 1 % 1 % Litigation expense, net 33 14 302 136 % (95 )% 2 % Gain on sale of product lines and businesses (159 ) (273 ) (200 ) 42 % (37 )% (1 )% (2 )% (1 )% Equity in net income of affiliates (617 ) (524 ) (474 ) (18 )% (11 )% (3 )% (3 )% (3 )% Gain on sale of ImClone shares (895 ) (100 )% (4 )% Other expense, net 191 351 292 (46 )% 20 % 1 % 2 % 2 % Total Expenses, net $ 15,126 $ 15,007 $ 14,123 1 % 6 % 73 % 82 % 87 % ** Change is in excess of 200%. Costs of products sold The improvement in costs of products sold as a percentage of net sales in 2008 was primarily attributed to a more favorable worldwide pharmaceuticals product sales mix, higher U.S. pharmaceuticals average selling prices, and realized manufacturing savings from PTI. These factors were partially offset by product and material price increases. The 2008 costs include manufacturing rationalization charges of $249 million related to the implementation of PTI in 2008, or 1.2% of net sales, compared to $179 million of rationalization charges recorded in 2007, or 1.0% of net sales. The improvement in costs of products sold as a percentage of sales in 2007 was primarily due to sales growth in higher margin products including PLAVIX*. Marketing, selling and administrative The increase in 2008 was primarily related to $104 million of increased process standardization costs incurred as part of PTI when compared to the prior period, $41 million of costs incurred as part of the initial public offering for Mead Johnson, higher selling expenses in support of key products, and an unfavorable 2% foreign exchange impact. The increase in 2007 was primarily due to an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and higher marketing expenses, partially offset by lower sales force expenses. The decrease in marketing, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was the result of increased sales growth outpacing expenses which are being managed through PTI. Advertising and product promotion The increase in 2008 was primarily related to increased promotions for new indications of ABILIFY* in the U.S., increased promotion for ORENCIA, increased expenses in the international Nutritionals business, and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. The increase in 2007 was primarily related to increased spending for direct-to-customer advertising for PLAVIX*, ABILIFY* and ORENCIA, expenses to support the launch of IXEMPRA, higher spending on newer products in Europe, and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Research and development The increase in 2008 was primarily related to increased licensing and upfront and milestone payments, increased spending for pipeline compounds, and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. The 2008 increase was partially offset by sharing of codevelopment costs with alliance partners AstraZeneca and Pfizer. 52 Table of Contents The increase in 2007 was primarily attributed to continued investment in late-stage compounds and developing a pipeline in disease areas that address significant unmet medical needs, as well as increased upfront and milestone payments in 2007 when compared to 2006 as detailed below. The 2007 increase was partially offset by sharing of codevelopment costs with alliance partners AstraZeneca and Pfizer. Upfront and milestone payments made in 2008 and expensed to research and development totaled $348 million and were paid primarily to Exelixis, PDL BioPharma, Inc., and KAI. The 2007 charges totaled $162 million and were paid to Exelixis, Pfizer, Adnexus and Isis. The 2006 charges totaled $70 million and were paid to Exelixis and Solvay Global. Research and development expenses dedicated to pharmaceutical products were 19.6%, 20.0% and 20.3% of pharmaceutical net sales in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Acquired in-process research and development Acquired in-process research and development costs (IPRD) consisted of the estimated fair value of research and development acquired as part of an acquisition which, through December 31, 2008, were immediately expensed at the acquisition date. The 2008 charge related to IPRD from the acquisition of Kosan whereas the 2007 charge related to IPRD obtained from the acquisition of Adnexus Therapeutics, Inc. (Adnexus). Provision for restructuring, net The increase in provision for restructuring, net was attributed to the timing of the implementation of PTI, which was announced in December 2007 and expanded in July 2008. The increase in 2007 was attributed to the charges, primarily severance related, associated with the announcement of the PTI in December 2007. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 3. Restructuring. Litigation expense, net Litigation expenses in 2006 related to reserves for the settlement in principle of certain pricing and sales investigations, partially offset by insurance recoveries from an unrelated matter and positive settlement of a litigation matter. For additional information on litigation matters, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 25. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Gain on sale of product lines and businesses The gain in 2008 was primarily attributable to the sale of the mature brands businesses in Egypt. The gain in 2007 was attributed to the sale of the BUFFERIN* and EXCEDRIN* brands in Japan, Asia (excluding China and Taiwan) and certain Oceanic countries, as well as certain assets related to U.S. dermatology products. The gain in 2006 was attributed to the sale of inventory, patent and intellectual property rights related to DOVONEX*. For additional information on these transactions, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 4. Acquisitions and Divestitures. Equity in net income of affiliates Equity in net income of affiliates was principally related to the Company international joint venture with Sanofi. The increases in 2008 and 2007 are correlated with increases in international PLAVIX* sales. For additional information on equity in net income of affiliates, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 2. Alliances and Collaborations. Gain on sale of ImClone shares The gain on sale of ImClone shares was attributed to the Company receipt of approximately $1.0 billion in cash for the tendering of its investment in ImClone. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 2. Alliances and Collaborations for further detail. 53 Table of Contents Other expense, net The components of other expense, net are as follows: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions 2008 2007 2006 Interest expense $ 310 $ 422 $ 498 Interest income (130 ) (241 ) (274 ) ARS impairment charge 305 275 (Gain)/loss on debt buyback and termination of interest rate swap agreements (57 ) 220 Foreign exchange transaction (gains)/losses (76 ) 15 Other, net (161 ) (120 ) (152 ) Other expense, net $ 191 $ 351 $ 292 Interest expense decreases in 2008 and 2007 were primarily due to decreases in interest rates. Interest income relates primarily to interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities. The decrease in interest income in 2008 was primarily due to the change in mix in the Company short-term investment portfolio as well as a decrease in the rate of return on short-term investments, including U.S. Treasury Bills, when compared to the prior year. ARS impairment charge was attributed to the Company auction rate securities (ARS). In addition, a $19 million loss on the sale of ARS in 2008 was recognized and is included in other, net. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 11. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities for further detail. The gain on debt buyback in 2008 is attributed to the repurchase of certain debt and the monetization of certain interest rate swaps due to the recent appreciation of value. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 18. Short-Term Borrowing and Long-Term Debt for further information. Foreign exchange transaction gains in 2008 were attributed to a strengthening U.S. dollar impact on non-qualifying foreign exchange hedges and on the re-measurement of non-functional currency denominated transactions when compared to the prior year. Other, net includes income from third-party contract manufacturing, certain royalty income and expense, debt retirement costs, gains and losses on sale of property, plant and equipment, gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities, insurance recoveries, deferred income recognized, certain other litigation matters, ConvaTec and Medical Imaging net transitional service fees, amortization of certain upfront payments related to the Company alliances, proceeds from swap terminations, and pension curtailments.

The increase in segment income as a percentage of segment net sales in 2008 was primarily due to similar factors discussed in the analysis of consolidated expenses. A more favorable product sales mix, higher average selling prices and realized manufacturing savings from PTI contributed to a reduction of costs of products sold as a percentage of net sales. The results of PTI also contributed to a reduction of marketing, selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales. Earnings increased in 2007 primarily due to increased PLAVIX* sales and strong sales growth of other key products. The increase in segment income as a percentage of segment net sales in 2007 was similar to the reasons discussed above although to a lesser extent as PTI was beginning in 2007. Nutritionals Earnings increased in 2008 primarily due to increased international net sales. The increase in segment income as a percentage of segment net sales in 2008 was primarily due to the growth rate in net sales exceeding the growth rate for marketing, selling and administrative expenses and research and development as well as a 2007 bad debt charge for a distributor insolvency. These factors were partially offset by higher dairy prices, advertising and promotion expenses and additional legal, accounting and consulting expenses incurred in preparation of the initial public offering. Earnings increased in 2007 primarily due to growth of key products. The decrease in segment income as a percentage of segment net sales in 2007 was primarily due to higher dairy prices, unfavorable product mix and a bad debt charge for a distributor insolvency. Corporate/Other Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest reported in Corporate/Other consists of: Dollars in Millions 2008 2007 2006 Corporate administrative expense $ (532 ) $ (556 ) $ (558 ) Stock-based compensation expense (181 ) (133 ) (112 ) Provision for restructuring, net (218 ) (183 ) (59 ) Litigation expense, net (33 ) (14 ) (302 ) Interest expense (310 ) (422 ) (498 ) Interest income 130 241 274 ARS impairment charge (305 ) (275 ) Gain on sale of ImClone shares 895 Gain on sale of product lines and businesses 159 273 200 Gain/(loss) on debt buyback and termination of interest rate swap agreements 57 (220 ) Other (9 ) 76 95 Total Corporate/Other earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest $ (347 ) $ (993 ) $ (1,180 ) 57 Table of Contents Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest was 24.1% in 2008, compared with 21.4% in 2007 and 20.7% in 2006. The increase in the 2008 effective tax rate from 2007 was primarily due to higher pre-tax income in the U.S., including the gain on sale of ImClone, and earnings mix in high tax jurisdictions in 2008. Partially off-setting these impacts were lower non-deductible charges in 2008 for acquired in-process research and development expenses and lower ARS impairment charges with little or no tax benefit. The tax rate in 2008 was favorably impacted by a benefit of $91 million of tax related to the final settlement of the 2002-2003 audit with the Internal Revenue Service. The 2007 tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the impairment on the Company investment in certain ARS with little tax benefit and the non-deductible write-off of acquired in-process research and development expenses related to the acquisition of Adnexus, partially offset by a tax benefit of $105 million in the first quarter of 2007 due to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters with the Internal Revenue Service related to the deductibility of litigation settlement expenses and U.S foreign tax credits claimed. The effective tax rate for 2006 was unfavorably impacted by the elimination of tax benefits under Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code, the treatment of provisions for a portion of certain litigation reserves as non-deductible, partially offset by favorable U.S. tax legislation enacted in 2006 related to the tax treatment of certain intercompany transactions amongst the Company foreign subsidiaries, and the implementation of tax planning strategies related to the utilization of certain charitable contributions. The Company has recognized significant deferred tax assets at December 31, 2008 related to U.S. Federal foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $451 million and U.S. Federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $271 million. The U.S. Federal charitable contribution carryforwards were fully utilized during 2008 due to gains related to the ConvaTec and Medical Imaging divestitures, while the foreign tax credit and research and development tax credit carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2014. The foreign tax credit and research and development tax credit carryforwards have been reduced due to derecognition under FIN No. 48. The ConvaTec and Medical Imaging divestitures have resulted in a significant reduction to the foreign tax credit and research and development tax credit carryforwards in 2008. The realization of the foreign tax credit and research and development tax credit carryforwards is dependent on generating sufficient domestic-sourced taxable income prior to their expiration. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. Minority Interest Minority interest is primarily related to the Company partnership with Sanofi for the territory covering the Americas related to PLAVIX* sales. Increases of minority interest correspond to the increased sales of PLAVIX*.

In 2008 and future periods, the Company expects cash generated by its U.S. operations, together with existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and borrowings from the capital markets, to be sufficient to cover cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures (which the Company expects to include investments in facilities to increase and maintain the Company capacity to provide biologics on a commercial scale), strategic alliances and acquisitions, milestone payments and dividends paid in the U.S. Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, the conversion of other working capital items and borrowings are expected to fund near-term operations outside the U.S. In December 2006, the Company obtained a $2.0 billion five year revolving credit facility from a syndicate of lenders, which is extendable on the anniversary date with the consent of the lenders. This facility contains customary terms and conditions, including a financial covenant whereby the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capital cannot exceed 50% at the end of each quarter. The Company has been in compliance with this covenant since the inception of this new facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2008. On February 17, 2009, Mead Johnson entered into a three year syndicated revolving credit facility agreement. The credit facility is unsecured and provides for borrowings and letters of credit up to $410 million. 58 Table of Contents Net Financial Assets Net financial asset position at December 31 was as follows: Dollars in Millions 2008 2007 Financial assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 7,976 $ 1,801 Marketable securities-current 289 424 Total financial assets 8,265 2,225 Debt: Short-term borrowings, including current portion of long-term debt 154 1,891 Long-term debt 6,585 4,381 Total debt 6,739 6,272 Net cash/(debt) $ 1,526 $ (4,047 ) Net Cash/(Debt) Net cash/(debt) position at December 31, 2008 improved due to proceeds of $4.6 billion from the divestiture of the ConvaTec and Medical Imaging businesses and proceeds of $1.0 billion from the sale of our ImClone shares. Cash generated from operating activities of $3.7 billion was more than adequate to fund dividend payments of $2.5 billion as well as capital expenditure payments of $941 million. Investments The following table summarizes the Company carrying value and related unrealized (loss)/gain position of its current and non-current marketable securities, which include U.S. dollar-denominated floating rate securities (FRS) and ARS, both of which are accounted for as available for sale debt securities. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 11. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities, for further discussion on the Company FRS and ARS portfolio including the related cost basis and fair value for each investment. December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Carrying Value Unrealized (Loss)/Gain in Accumulated OCI Carrying Value Unrealized (Loss)/Gain in Accumulated OCI Dollars in Millions Current: Available for sale Floating rate securities $ 109 $ (6 ) $ 337 $ (25 ) U.S. Treasury Bills 180 1 Other 87 Total current $ 289 $ (5 ) $ 424 $ (25 ) Non-current: Available for sale Auction rate securities $ 94 $ $ 419 $ (117 ) Floating rate securities 94 (45 ) Total non-current $ 188 $ (45 ) $ 419 $ (117 ) During 2008, the Company received $108 million of principal at par primarily on a FRS that matured in March 2008 and temporarily reduced the carrying value of the remaining FRS by $26 million to $203 million as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI). In addition, during 2008 the Company reclassified $94 million of the remaining FRS with maturity dates beyond 2009 from current assets to non-current other assets due to liquidity concerns and the continued uncertainty in the capital markets. During 2008, the Company received $118 million primarily in connection with the sale of ARS with a carrying value of $137 million, resulting in a loss of $19 million. In addition, a $305 million other-than-temporary impairment charge was recognized, including $117 million that was previously determined to be temporary at December 31, 2007. The 2008 impairment charge was required after an analysis of other-than-temporary impairment factors, including the severity and duration of the decline in value, future prospects of the issuer and the Company ability and intent to hold the securities to recovery. The ARS sold were securities generally backed by sub-prime mortgages, collateralized debt obligations and structured credit. The ARS remaining at December 31, 2008 represents interests in insurance securitizations and to a lesser extent, structured credit. 59 Table of Contents If uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue, these markets deteriorate further or the Company experiences any additional ratings downgrades on any investments in its portfolio (including FRS and ARS), the Company may incur additional impairments to its investment portfolio, which could negatively affect the Company financial condition and reported earnings. The Company believes that, based on the Company current level of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and expected operating cash flows, the current lack of liquidity in the credit and capital markets will not have a material impact on the Company liquidity, cash flow, financial flexibility or its ability to fund its operations, including the dividend. Credit Ratings The Moody Investors Service (Moody s) long-term and short-term credit ratings for the Company are currently A2 and Prime-1, respectively. Moody revised the long-term credit rating outlook to negative from stable. Standard & Poor (S&P) long-term and short-term credit ratings for the Company are currently A+ and A-1, respectively. S&P long-term credit rating remains on stable outlook. Fitch Ratings (Fitch) long-term and short-term credit ratings for the Company are currently A+ and F1, respectively. Fitch long-term credit rating remains on stable outlook. Working Capital The following is a discussion of working capital: December 31, Dollars in Millions 2008 2007 Working capital $ 8,053 $ 1,704 The increase in working capital of $6.3 billion from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008 was impacted by: Proceeds from the sale of the ConvaTec business ($4.1 billion); Proceeds from the sale of our ImClone shares ($1.0 billion); and Proceeds from issuance of 6.125% Notes due 2038 ($1.0 billion) and 5.45% Notes due 2018 ($600 million). Cash Flows The following is a discussion of cash flow activities: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions 2008 2007 2006 Cash flow provided by/(used in): Operating activities $ 3,707 $ 3,153 $ 2,083 Investing activities 5,079 (202 ) 206 Financing activities (2,582 ) (3,213 ) (3,351 ) Operating Activities Cash flow from operating activities represents the cash receipts and cash disbursements related to all activities of the Company other than to investing activities and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting net earnings for: Non-cash operating items such as depreciation and amortization; impairment charges; stock-based compensation charges; Gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities such as gains and losses on the sale of product lines and businesses; and Changes in operating assets and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in results of operations. The Company operating cash flow has grown consistently throughout the three years ended December 31, 2008 as the increases in net income, attributed to reasons noted throughout this MD&A, continue to directly impact operating cash flows. This is evident as the net income adjusted for non-cash operating items as well as gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities amounted to $3.6 billion in 2008, $3.2 billion in 2007 and $2.5 billion in 2006. These amounts exclude the changes in operating assets and liabilities, discussed below. The net impact of the changes in operating assets and liabilities, which are discussed in more detail below, include the impact of changes in receivables, inventories, deferred income, accounts payable, income taxes receivable/payable and other operating assets and liabilities. The Company continues to maximize its operating cash flows with its recently announced working capital initiative designed to continue to improve those working capital items that are most directly affected by changes in sales volume, such as accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable. 60 Table of Contents In 2008, changes in operating assets resulted in a net cash inflow of $117 million which was impacted by: Cash inflows from income tax payable/receivable ($371 million) which includes the impact of the receipt of a $432 million tax refund, including interest, related to a prior year foreign tax credit carryback claim; Cash inflows from accounts payables ($253 million) which are primarily attributed to the timing of vendor and alliance payments; Cash inflows from inventory ($130 million) which is primarily attributed to the utilization of inventories which were built up in the prior year for new product launches and strategic builds for existing products launches including for new indications of ABILIFY*; Cash inflows from deferred income ($61 million) which are primarily due to receipt of upfront and milestone payments from alliance partners; Cash outflows from other operating assets and liabilities ($333 million) which are primarily due to net litigation related payments made in the current period ($190 million) attributed to the settlement of certain pricing and sales litigation accrued in prior periods; pension funding in excess of current year expense ($120 million); and increase in non-current inventory ($112 million); and Cash outflows from accounts receivables ($365 million) which are attributed to increased sales. In 2007, changes in operating assets resulted in a net cash outflow of $7 million which was impacted by: Cash outflows from accounts receivable ($519 million) which are primarily attributed to increased sales; Cash outflows from U.S and foreign income taxes payable ($199 million) which are primarily attributed to tax payments which included settlement payments associated with various tax issues for the 2002-2003 IRS audit; Cash inflows from deferred income ($454 million) which are primarily due to receipt of upfront and milestone payments from alliance partners including Pfizer and AstraZeneca; Cash inflows from other operating assets and liabilities ($170 million) which are primarily due to increases in accrued royalties attributed to increased PLAVIX* sales; and increases in accrued salaries and bonuses due to the timing of payments; partially offset by cash outflows primarily related to litigation related payments ($318 million) for the settlement of pricing and sales litigation accrued in prior periods; and Cash inflows from accounts payables ($141 million) which include the impact of increased purchases of raw materials for planned inventory buildup. In 2006, changes in operating assets resulted in a net cash outflow of $464 million which was impacted by: Cash outflows from other operating assets and liabilities ($573 million) which are primarily due to the pay down of accrued rebates and returns primarily resulting from exclusivity loss of PRAVACHOL, volume erosion on highly rebated PARAPLATIN and TAXOL and lower PLAVIX* volumes; and reduced royalties from lower PLAVIX* sales; Additions in the litigation settlement accrual related to the pricing and sales litigation settlements are primarily offset by net litigation related payments related to other matters accrued in prior years ($272 million); Cash outflows from accounts payable ($349 million) which are primarily due to lower purchases of PRAVACHOL raw materials, due to the loss of PRAVACHOL exclusivity and a significant reduction of payables in early 2006 resulting from lower payment of invoices in December 2005; and Cash inflows from accounts receivables ($444 million) are primarily due to lower PLAVIX* sales and the loss of exclusivity of PRAVACHOL. 61 Table of Contents Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities was $5.1 billion in 2008 and included: Proceeds from the divestiture of ConvaTec ($4.1 billion); Medical Imaging ($483 million); and mature brands business in Egypt ($209 million); Proceeds from the tendering of the Company shares in ImClone ($1.0 billion); Proceeds from the sale and leaseback of the Paris, France facility ($227 million); Capital expenditures ($941 million) which included expenditures associated with the construction of the Company biologic facility in Devens, Massachusetts; and Acquisition of Kosan ($191 million).

Due to the uncertainty of such future obligations, they are excluded from the table. Contributions for both U.S. and international plans are expected to be up to $690 million in 2009. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 24 Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment Benefits for further detail. In addition to the above, the Company has committed to make approximately $3.0 billion potential future research and development milestone payments to third parties as part of in-licensing and development programs. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental and regulatory milestones, for which the specific timing cannot be predicted. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on the Company consolidated balance sheets. For a discussion of contractual obligations, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 18. Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt, Note 21. Financial Instruments, Note 23. Leases, and Note 24. Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment Liabilities. SEC Consent Order As previously disclosed, on August 4, 2004, the Company entered into a final settlement with the SEC, concluding an investigation concerning certain wholesaler inventory and accounting matters. The settlement was reached through a Consent, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 10 to the Company quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2004. Under the terms of the Consent, the Company agreed, subject to certain defined exceptions, to limit sales of all products sold to its direct customers (including wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, retail outlets, pharmacies and government purchasers) based on expected demand or on amounts that do not exceed approximately one month of inventory on hand, without making a timely public disclosure of any change in practice. The Company also agreed in the Consent to certain measures that it has implemented including: (a) establishing a formal review and certification process of its annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC; (b) establishing a business risk and disclosure group; (c) retaining an outside consultant to comprehensively study and help re-engineer the Company accounting and financial reporting processes; (d) publicly disclosing any sales incentives offered to direct customers for the purpose of inducing them to purchase products in excess of expected demand; and (e) ensuring that the Company budget process gives appropriate weight to inputs that come from the bottom to the top, and not just from the top to the bottom, and adequately documenting that process. 63 Table of Contents The Company has established a company-wide policy to limit its sales to direct customers for the purpose of complying with the Consent. This policy includes the adoption of various procedures to monitor and limit sales to direct customers in accordance with the terms of the Consent. These procedures include a governance process to escalate to appropriate management levels potential questions or concerns regarding compliance with the policy and timely resolution of such questions or concerns. In addition, compliance with the policy is monitored on a regular basis. The Company maintains Inventory Management Agreements (IMAs) with most of its U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers, which account for nearly 100% of total gross sales of U.S. Pharmaceutical products. Under the current terms of the IMAs, the Company three largest wholesaler customers provide the Company with weekly information with respect to months on hand product-level inventories and the amount of out-movement of products. These three wholesalers currently account for approximately 90% of total gross sales of U.S. Pharmaceuticals products in 2008, 2007 and 2006. The inventory information received from these wholesalers, together with the Company internal information, is used to estimate months on hand product level inventories at these wholesalers. The Company estimates months on hand product inventory levels for its U.S. Pharmaceutical business wholesaler customers other than the three largest wholesalers by extrapolating from the months on hand calculated for the three largest wholesalers. In contrast, for the Company Pharmaceutical business outside of the U.S. and Nutritionals business units around the world, the Company has significantly more direct customers, limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information, where available, varies widely. Accordingly, the Company relies on a variety of methods to estimate months on hand product level inventories for these business units. The Company believes the above-described procedures provide a reasonable basis to ensure compliance with the Consent. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In 2008, the following new accounting pronouncements, critical to the Company financial statements, discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Recently Issued Accounting Standards , have been considered and evaluated for required application and their impact: EITF Issue No. 07-3, Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services Received for Use in Future Research and Development Activities SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities EITF Issue No. 07-1, Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements Related to the Development and Commercialization of Intellectual Property SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations Critical Accounting Policies The Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, including disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the Company financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in their application, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Because of the uncertainty of factors surrounding the estimates or judgments used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, actual results may vary from these estimates. The Company believes that the following discussion represents its critical accounting policies. Management has discussed the Company critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements , as amended by SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition . The Company accounting policy for revenue recognition has a substantial impact on its reported results and relies on certain estimates that require difficult, subjective and complex judgments on the part of management. The Company recognizes revenue (net of the gross-to-net sales adjustments discussed below, all of which involve significant estimates and judgments) when title and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer, which generally occurs on the date of shipment. 64 Table of Contents In the case of new products for which the product introduction is not an extension of an existing line of product, where the Company determines that there are not products in a similar therapeutic category, or where the Company determines the new product has dissimilar characteristics with existing products, such that the Company cannot reliably estimate expected returns of the new product, the Company defers recognition of revenue until the right of return no longer exists or until the Company has developed sufficient historical experience to estimate sales returns. For discussions on revenue recognition, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition and Sales Rebate and Return Accruals. Gross-to-Net Sales Adjustments The Company has the following significant categories of gross-to-net sales adjustments: prime vendor charge-backs, WIC rebates, managed health care rebates and other contract discounts, Medicaid rebates, cash discounts, sales returns, and other adjustments, all of which involve significant estimates and judgments and require the Company to use information from external sources. The Company accounts for these gross-to-net sales adjustments in accordance with EITF Issue No. 01-9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor Products) , and SFAS No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists, as applicable. See Net Sales section above for a reconciliation of the Company gross sales to net sales by each significant category of gross-to-net sales adjustment. Prime vendor charge-backs The Company U.S. businesses participate in prime vendor programs with government entities, the most significant of which are the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and other parties whereby pricing on products is extended below wholesaler list price to participating entities. These entities purchase products through wholesalers at the lower prime vendor price and the wholesalers charge the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower prime vendor price back to the Company. The Company accounts for prime vendor charge-backs by reducing accounts receivable in an amount equal to the Company estimate of charge-back claims attributable to a sale. The Company determines its estimate of the prime vendor charge-backs primarily based on historical experience regarding prime vendor charge-backs and current contract prices under the prime vendor programs. The Company considers prime vendor payments, levels of inventory in the distribution channel, and the Company claim processing time lag and adjusts the reduction to accounts receivable periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. WIC rebates The Company U.S. Nutritionals business participates on a competitive bidding basis in nutrition programs sponsored by states, tribal governments, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. territories for WIC. Under these programs, the Company reimburses these entities for the difference between wholesaler list price and the contract price on eligible products. The Company accounts for WIC rebates by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to the Company estimate of WIC rebate claims attributable to a sale. The Company determines its estimate of the WIC rebate accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding WIC rebates and current contract prices under the WIC programs. The Company considers levels of inventory in the distribution channel, new WIC contracts, terminated WIC contracts, changes in existing WIC contracts, and WIC participation and adjusts the accrual periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. Managed health care rebates and other contract discounts The Company offers rebates and discounts to managed health care organizations in the U.S. which manage prescription drug programs and Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans covering the Medicare Part D drug benefit in addition to their commercial plans, as well as globally to other contract counterparties such as hospitals and group purchasing organizations. In addition, the Company pays rebates under U.S. Department of Defense TRICARE Retail Pharmacy Refund Program. The Company accounts for managed health care rebates and other contract discounts by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to the Company estimate of managed health care rebates and other contract discounts attributable to a sale. The Company determines its estimate of the managed health care rebates and other contract discounts accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding these rebates and discounts and current contract prices. The Company considers the sales performance of products subject to managed health care rebates and other contract discounts and levels of inventory in the distribution channel and adjusts the accrual periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. 65 Table of Contents Medicaid rebates The Company U.S. businesses participate in state government-managed Medicaid programs as well as certain other qualifying Federal and state government programs whereby discounts and rebates are provided to participating state and local government entities. Discounts and rebates provided through these latter programs are included in the Company Medicaid rebate accrual and are considered Medicaid rebates for the purposes of this discussion. The Company accounts for Medicaid rebates by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to the Company estimate of Medicaid rebate claims attributable to a sale. The Company determines its estimate of the Medicaid rebates accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding Medicaid rebates, as well as any expansion on a prospective basis of its participation in the non-mandatory aspects of the qualifying Federal and state government programs, legal interpretations of applicable laws related to Medicaid and qualifying Federal and state government programs, and any new information regarding changes in the Medicaid programs regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the rebates. The Company considers outstanding Medicaid claims, Medicaid payments, and levels of inventory in the distribution channel and adjusts the accrual periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. Cash discounts In the U.S. and certain other countries, the Company offers cash discounts, approximating 2% of the sales price, as an incentive for prompt payment. The Company accounts for cash discounts by reducing accounts receivable by the full amount of the discounts. The Company considers payment performance and adjusts the accrual to reflect actual experience. Sales returns The Company accounts for sales returns in accordance with SFAS No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists , by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to the Company estimate of sales recorded for which the related products are expected to be returned. The provision for sales returns was $228 million in 2008, $155 million in 2007 and $224 million in 2006, which approximates 1% of gross sales for each of the three years. For returns of established products, the Company determines its estimate of the sales return accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding sales returns, but also considers other factors that could impact sales returns. These factors include levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product recalls, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, introductions of generic products and introductions of competitive new products. The Company considers all of these factors and adjusts the accrual periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. In the event of a product recall or product discontinuance, the Company considers the reasons for and impact of such actions and adjusts the sales return accrual as appropriate, taking into account historical experience, estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and, for product discontinuances, estimates of continuing demand. Sales returns accruals from new products are estimated and primarily based on the historical sales returns experience of similar products, such as those within the same line of product or those within the same or similar therapeutic category. In limited circumstances, where the new product is not an extension of an existing line of product or where the Company has no historical experience with products in a similar therapeutic category, such that the Company cannot reliably estimate expected returns of the new product, the Company defers recognition of revenue until the right of return no longer exists or until the Company has developed sufficient historical experience to estimate sales returns. The Company also considers the shelf life of new products and determines whether it believes an adjustment to the sales return accrual is appropriate. The shelf life in connection with new products tends to be shorter than the shelf life for more established products because the Company may still be developing an optimal manufacturing process for the new product that would lengthen its shelf life. In addition, higher launch quantities may have been manufactured in advance of the launch date to ensure sufficient supply exists to satisfy market demand. In those cases, the Company assesses the reduced shelf life, together with estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and projected demand, and determines whether it believes an adjustment to the sales return accrual is appropriate. Other adjustments In addition to the gross-to-net sales adjustments described above, the Company makes other gross-to-net sales adjustments. For example, the Company offers sales discounts, most significantly in its non-U.S. businesses, and also offers consumer coupons and rebates, most significantly in its U.S. Nutritionals and Pharmaceuticals businesses. In addition, in a number of countries outside the U.S., including certain major European countries, the Company provides rebates to government entities. The Company generally accounts for these other gross-to-net adjustments by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to the Company estimate of the adjustments attributable to a sale. The Company generally determines its estimates of the accruals for these other gross-to-net sales adjustments primarily based on historical experience, performance on commitments to government entities and other relevant factors, including estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel, and adjusts the accruals periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. 66 Table of Contents Use of information from external sources The Company uses information from external sources to estimate its gross-to-net sales adjustments. The Company estimates of inventory at the wholesalers are based on the projected prescription demand-based sales for its products and historical inventory experience, as well as the Company analysis of third-party information, including written and oral information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and sell-through to customers and third-party market research data, and the Company internal information. The inventory information received from wholesalers is a product of their recordkeeping process and excludes inventory held by intermediaries to whom they sell, such as retailers and hospitals. The Company receives information from IMS, a supplier of market research to the pharmaceutical industry, which it uses to project the prescription demand-based sales for many of its U.S. Pharmaceutical products. In 2007, IMS refined and improved its NGPS projection methodology and fully rolled out NGPS Version 2.0 of the National Prescription Audit to all subscribers, which resulted in newly revised volume estimates for historic time periods. Therefore, since the first quarter of 2007, the Company has used the new IMS standard NGPS Version 2.0 projection methodology and has applied NGPS Version 2.0 data for reporting prescription growth and market shares to all periods presented in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company has also continued the practice of combining retail and mail prescription volume on a retail-equivalent basis. The Company uses this methodology for its internal demand forecasts. The Company also uses information from external sources to identify prescription trends, patient demand and average selling prices. The Company estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third-party information, as certain third-party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations including lags between the date as of which third-party information is generated and the date on which the Company receives third-party information. Retirement Benefits The Company pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations. Management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, salary growth, long-term return on plan assets, retirement, turnover, health care cost trend rates, and mortality rates. Depending on the assumptions and estimates used, the pension and postretirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. In addition, the assumptions can materially affect projected benefit obligations and future cash funding. The Company adopted SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) , in the year ended December 31, 2006 and the adoption of this accounting pronouncement resulted in a $1.1 billion reduction of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity, a $767 million reduction in total assets and a $297 million increase in total liabilities. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 did not impact the Company results of operations or cash flows. The Company key assumptions used in calculating its cost of pension benefits are the discount rate, the rate of compensation increase, and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The Company, in consultation with its actuaries, evaluates the key actuarial assumptions and other assumptions used in calculating its cost of pension benefits, such as retirement, turnover and mortality rates, based on expectations or actual experience, as appropriate, and determines such assumptions on December 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension expense for the following year. Depending on the assumptions used, the pension expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. In addition, the assumptions can materially affect projected benefit obligations and future cash funding. Actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors. In determining the discount rate, the Company uses the yield on high quality corporate bonds that coincides with the cash flows of its plans estimated payouts. The Citigroup Above Median yield curve is used in determining the discount rate for the U.S. plans. The assumed rate of compensation increase used by the Company for determining future pension obligations reflects an estimate of the change in actual future compensation levels due to general price levels, productivity, seniority and other factors. The U.S. plans pension expense for 2008 was determined using a 6.75% assumed discount rate and a 3.56% assumed rate of compensation increase. The present value of benefit obligations at December 31, 2008 for the U.S. plans was determined using a 6.5% assumed discount rate and a 3.56% assumed rate of compensation increase. If the assumed discount rate used in determining the U.S. plans pension expense for 2008 had been reduced by 0.25%, such expense would have increased by approximately $17 million. If the assumed rate of compensation increase used in determining the U.S. plans pension expense for 2008 had been reduced by 0.25%, such expense would have decreased by approximately $9 million. If the assumed discount rate used in determining the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2008 had been reduced by 0.25%, the projected benefit obligation would have increased by $126 million. 67 Table of Contents In determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the Company estimates returns for individual asset classes with input from external advisors. The Company also considers long-term historical returns including actual performance compared to benchmarks for similar investments. The U.S. plans pension expense for 2008 was determined using an 8.75% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining the U.S. plans pension expense for 2008 had been reduced by 1%, such expense would have increased by $43 million. For a more detailed discussion on retirement benefits, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 24. Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment Liabilities. Acquisitions The Company consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business after the completion of the acquisition. Acquired businesses are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, which requires that the purchase price be allocated to the net assets acquired at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Amounts allocated to acquired IPRD are expensed at the date of acquisition. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations. There are several methods that can be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, including IPRD, we typically use the income method. This method starts with our forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include: the amount and timing of projected future cash flows; the amount and timing of projected costs to develop the IPRD into commercially viable products; the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows; and the assessment of the asset life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry, as well as expected changes in standards of practice for indications addressed by the asset. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment, as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives. For example, the useful life of the right associated with a pharmaceutical product exclusive patent will be finite and will result in amortization expense being recognized in the results of operations over a determinable period. For a more detailed discussion on acquired in-process research and development, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Acquired In-Process Research and Development. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset fair value is based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including a discounted value of estimated future cash flows. The Company reports an asset to be disposed of at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated net realizable value. Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment using a two-step process. The first step is to identify a potential impairment, and the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss, if any. Goodwill is deemed to be impaired if the carrying amount of a reporting unit goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value. All other long-lived assets are tested for impairment using a one-step process, which consists of a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the asset. Such assets are deemed to be impaired if their net book value exceeds their estimated fair value. The estimates of future cash flows, based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management judgment. Any changes in key assumptions about the Company businesses and their prospects, or changes in market conditions, could result in an impairment charge. 68 Table of Contents Impairment charges of long-lived assets were $63 million in 2008, $104 million in 2007 and $120 million in 2006. For discussions on impairment of long-lived assets, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Equity Investments The Company reviews its equity investments for impairment based on its determination of whether the decline in market value of the investment below the Company carrying value is other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers APB Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock and related interpretations , which set forth factors to be evaluated in determining whether a loss in value should be recognized, including the Company ability to hold its investment, the market price and market price fluctuations of the investment publicly traded shares and inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity, which would justify the carrying amount of the investment. The Company previous investment in ImClone was subject to this accounting. For a discussion of the Company investment in ImClone, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 2. Alliances and Collaborations. For discussions on equity investments, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Investments and Note 2. Alliances and Collaborations. Marketable Securities The Company marketable securities at December 31, 2008 consisted of U.S. Treasury Bills, FRS and ARS. Due to the lack of availability of observable market quotes on the Company investment portfolio of FRS and ARS, the Company utilizes valuation models including those that are based on expected cash flow streams and collateral values, including assessments of counterparty credit quality, default risk underlying the security, discount rates and overall capital market liquidity. The valuation is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Factors that may impact the Company valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities, rates of default of the underlying assets, underlying collateral value, discount rates, counterparty risk and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity. A considerable amount of judgment and estimation is applied in the valuation of FRS and ARS. In addition, the Company also applies judgment in determining whether the marketable securities are other-than-temporarily impaired. The Company typically considers the severity and duration of the decline, future prospects of the issuer and the Company ability and intent to hold the security to recovery. Other-than-temporary impairment charges related to ARS were $305 million and $275 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The carrying value of ARS was $94 million at December 31, 2008. The credit and capital markets have continued to deteriorate in 2009. If uncertainties in these markets continue, these markets deteriorate further or the Company experiences any additional ratings downgrades on any investments in its portfolio (including on ARS), the Company may incur additional impairment charges. For discussions on marketable securities, FRS and ARS, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 10. Fair Value Measurement and Note 11. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities. Restructuring To streamline operations and rationalize manufacturing facilities, the Company has periodically recorded restructuring charges. As a result, the Company has made estimates and judgments regarding its future plans, including future termination benefits and other exit costs to be incurred when the restructuring actions take place. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Adjustments to reflect changes in estimates for restructuring actions taken in prior periods resulted in an increase of $1 million in 2008, and a reduction of $6 million in 2007 and $14 million in 2006. For discussions on restructuring, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Restructuring and Note 3. Restructuring. Contingencies In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its business, that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others, government investigations, shareholder lawsuits, product and environmental liability. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies , the Company records 69 Table of Contents accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These estimates are subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, as such, actual results could vary from these estimates. For discussions on contingencies, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Contingencies, Note 9. Income Taxes and Note 25. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax bases of the Company assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including the long-range forecast of future taxable income and the evaluation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made. The Company had net deferred tax assets of $2.8 billion and $3.5 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, net of valuation allowances of $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion. The Company recognized significant deferred tax assets at December 31, 2008 related to U.S. Federal foreign tax credit carryforwards of $451 million and U.S. Federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of $271 million. The realization of these tax credit carryforwards is dependent on generating sufficient domestic-sourced taxable income prior to their expiration. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. The Company establishes liabilities for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known tax exposures including, but not limited to, transfer pricing matters, tax credits and deductibility of certain expenses. Such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid and may need to be adjusted over time as more information becomes known. For discussions on income taxes, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Income Taxes and Note 9. Income Taxes. Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This annual report and other written and oral statements the Company makes from time to time contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the fact they use words such as should , expect , anticipate , estimate , target , may , project , guidance , intend , plan , believe and other words and terms of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. One can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including factors that could delay, divert or change any of them, and could cause actual outcomes to differ materially from current expectations. These statements are likely to relate to, among other things, the Company goals, plans and projections regarding its financial position, results of operations, cash flows, market position, product development, product approvals, sales efforts, expenses, performance or results of current and anticipated products and the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and financial results, which are based on current expectations that involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including internal or external factors that could delay, divert or change any of them in the next several years. The Company has included important factors in the cautionary statements included in this annual report, particularly under Item 1A. Risk Factors, that the Company believes could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement. Although the Company believes it has been prudent in its plans and assumptions, no assurance can be given that any goal or plan set forth in forward-looking statements can be achieved and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date made. The Company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 70 Table of Contents
