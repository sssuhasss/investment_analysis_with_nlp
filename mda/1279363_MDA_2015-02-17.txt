Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (In Millions, Except Per Share Data or As Otherwise Stated) The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Item 6 Selected Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this 2014 Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's expectations. Factors that could cause such differences include those set forth under Part I, Item 1 Business and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors , as well as Forward-Looking Statements discussed earlier in this 2014 Form 10-K. OVERVIEW Introduction We are a leading managed care company for government-sponsored health care coverage with a focus on Medicaid and Medicare programs. Headquartered in Tampa, Florida, we offer a variety of managed care health plans for families, children, and the aged, blind and disabled, as well as prescription drug plans. As of December 31, 2014 , we served approximately 4.1 million members in 49 states and the District of Columbia. We estimate that we are among the 10 largest Medicaid providers of managed care services plans, and among the 10 largest providers of Medicare Advantage ("MA") plans and prescription drug plans ("PDPs"), all as measured by membership. We believe that our broad range of experience and exclusive government focus allows us to effectively serve our members, partner with our providers and government clients, and efficiently manage our ongoing operations. Summary of Consolidated Financial Results Summarized below are the key financial highlights for the year ended December 31, 2014 . For additional information, refer to the "Results of Operations" section which discusses both consolidated and segment results in more detail. Membership increased 45% in 2014, mainly driven by organic membership growth across all of our segments, primarily in our Medicaid Health Plans and Medicare PDPs segments, as well as the acquisition of Windsor Health Group, Inc. ("Windsor"), which was completed on January 1, 2014. The Windsor acquisition accounted for increases of 80,000 and 103,000 , in our Medicare Health Plans and Medicare PDPs segments, respectively. Excluding Windsor, consolidated membership at December 31, 2014 increased 38% year over year. Premiums increased 36% in 2014, driven mainly by the increases in membership discussed above. The Windsor acquisition accounted for combined increases in Medicare and Medicare PDP segment revenue of $620.5 million for 2014. Additionally, the increase was driven by the net impact of ACA industry fee reimbursement from our Medicaid state customers and Medicaid membership mix changes, partially offset by rate decreases in our Medicare segment and a lower rate in our Medicare PDPs segment, consistent with our 2014 bids. Net Income declined 64% in 2014 due mainly to an increase in the medical benefit ratios for all three of our segments, the impact of unreimbursed ACA industry fees, increased interest expense from higher debt levels in 2014 and the recognition of $24.1 million in impairment and other charges, primarily related to Easy Choice Health Plan Inc. ("Easy Choice"). Partially offsetting these reductions was the increase in premiums from organic growth, lower administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues and the $29.5 million we recognized from the Windsor bargain purchase gain. Key Developments and Accomplishments Our current business priorities include improving health care quality and access for our members, optimizing financial performance, delivering prudent and profitable growth and achieving service excellence. See Part I, Item 1 Business for further discussion of our business priorities. Presented below are key developments and accomplishments relating to progress on our business priorities that occurred or impacted our financial condition and results of operations during 2014 , or occurred in 2015 prior to the filing of this 2014 Form 10-K. 54 Table of Contents In January 2014, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Windsor from Munich Health North America, Inc., a part of Munich Re Group. Through its subsidiaries, Windsor serves Medicare beneficiaries with MA, PDP and Medicare Supplement products. As of December 31, 2014 , Windsor offered MA plans to 37,000 members in 192 counties in the states of Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee. In addition, one of Windsor subsidiaries offers Medicare Supplement insurance policies through which it serves approximately 43,000 members in 39 states as of December 31, 2014 . Windsor also offers PDPs in 11 of the 34 CMS regions to 103,000 members as of December 31, 2014 . In February 2014, we executed a contract with the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration ("AHCA") to provide managed care services to Medicaid recipients in eight of the state 11 regions as part of the state Managed Medical Assistance ("MMA") program. The program commenced on May 1, 2014, with the implementation of three regions. Three additional regions were implemented in June, one in July and one in August. We are serving over 650,000 members in these regions as of December 31, 2014 , compared to 394,000 members that we served in December 2013 under the prior Florida Medicaid program. Effective January 1, 2014, we began offering Medicaid managed care in Essex, Hudson, Middlesex, Passaic and Union counties in New Jersey. In addition, effective July 1, 2014, our New Jersey subsidiary completed the acquisition of Medicaid assets from Healthfirst Health Plan of New Jersey, Inc. ("Healthfirst NJ"), which primarily relate to approximately 42,000 Healthfirst Medicaid members who were transferred to our Medicaid plan in New Jersey, as well as certain provider agreements. As a result, effective July 1, 2014, we offer Medicaid managed care in 10 counties in New Jersey. We have received amendments, written agreements or other documentation from all our Medicaid state customers, that commit them to reimburse us for the portion of the ACA industry fee on our Medicaid plans, including its non-deductibility for income tax purposes for 2014 and 2015. Consequently, we recognized $124.6 million of reimbursement for the ACA industry fee as premium revenue in the year ended December 31, 2014 . Medicare Heath Plans segment membership as of January 1, 2015, was 380,000, a 9% decrease from 417,000 as of December 31, 2014. The approximate decrease of 37,000 members was driven by actions taken in conjunction with our 2015 bids and county withdrawals in California designed to improve the performance of Easy Choice, which resulted in a 28,000 member decrease in California, as well as the Company exit from the Missouri, Ohio, and Arizona markets representing 8,000 members as of December 31, 2014. For 2015, WellCare offers Medicare Advantage plans in 376 counties across 15 states. In October 2014, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS") announced 2015 MA and PDP quality ratings, known as star ratings, which reflected improvement for several of WellCare's plans. The star rating for our Florida plan, which serves approximately 31% of our January 2015 MA membership, maintained its rating of 3.5 stars for 2015. Our California plan, which serves approximately 10% of our January 2015 MA membership, improved its star rating from 3 to 3.5. Due to changes in our bid design based on our 2014 experience, our 2015 PDP bids resulted in one of our basic plans being below the benchmarks in 13 of the 33 CMS regions for which we submitted bids, and within the de minimis range in nine other regions. However, the outcome of our 2015 bids is expected to have a favorable impact on 2015 gross margin results compared to 2014. For 2014, our basic plan was below the benchmarks in 30 regions, of the 33 regions bid, and within the de minimis range in two other regions. In October 2014, WellCare received NCQA Quality Accreditation for its Medicaid and Medicare health plans in Georgia, Kentucky and Missouri. General Economic and Political Environment and Health Care Reform Please refer to Part I, Item 1 Business, General Economic and Political Environment Impacting our Business and Health Care Reform for a further discussion of the current economic and political environment that is affecting our business, including discussion of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the "ACA") and its potential impact on our business. The ACA imposed certain new taxes and fees, including limitations on the amount of compensation that is tax deductible, as well as an annual premium-based health insurance industry assessment (the "ACA industry fee") on health insurers which began in 2014. The total ACA industry fee levied on the health insurance industry was $8 billion in 2014 and 55 Table of Contents will be $11.3 billion in 2015, with increasing annual amounts thereafter, growing to $14.3 billion by 2018. After 2018, the industry fee increases according to an index based on net premium growth. The assessment is being levied on certain health insurers that provide insurance in the assessment year, and is allocated to health insurers based on each health insurer's share of net premiums for all U.S health insurers in the year preceding the assessment. The ACA industry fee is not deductible for income tax purposes, which has significantly increased our effective income tax rate. We incurred $137.7 million of such fees in 2014 and currently estimate that we will incur between $230 and $235 million in such fees in 2015, due to the increase in the total fee to be levied on the industry and the expected increase in our share of total industry premiums for 2014. However, the 2015 final fee amount will not be determined until August 2015. We have received amendments, written agreements or other documentation from all our Medicaid state customers, that commit them to reimburse us for the portion of the ACA industry fee on our Medicaid plans, including its non-deductibility for income tax purposes for 2014. Consequently, we recognized $124.6 million of reimbursement for the ACA industry fee as premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. We have also obtained similar commitments from our Medicaid customers for 2015. CMS does not directly reimburse us for the impact of the ACA industry fee related to MA and PDP premiums. Refer to the risks and uncertainties related to health care reform as discussed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors Future changes in health care law present challenges for our business that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows . RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Financial Results The following table sets forth condensed data from our consolidated statements of operations data, as well as other key data used in our results of operations discussions for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 . The historical results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period. For the Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Revenues: (Dollars in millions) Premium $ 12,915.5 $ 9,509.1 $ 7,400.2 Investment and other income 44.4 18.8 8.8 Total revenues 12,959.9 9,527.9 7,409.0 Expenses: Medical benefits 11,455.2 8,258.6 6,303.9 Selling, general and administrative 1,018.8 856.5 690.8 ACA industry fee 137.7 Medicaid premium taxes 76.5 75.7 82.2 Depreciation and amortization 59.9 44.1 31.6 Interest 39.4 11.9 4.1 Impairment and other charges 24.1 Total expenses 12,811.6 9,246.8 7,112.6 Income from operations 148.3 281.1 296.4 Bargain purchase gain 29.5 Loss on extinguishment of debt (2.8 ) Income before income taxes 177.8 278.3 296.4 Income tax expense 114.1 103.0 111.7 Net income $ 63.7 $ 175.3 $ 184.7 Membership by Segment Medicaid Health Plans 2,310,000 1,759,000 1,587,000 Medicare Health Plans 417,000 290,000 213,000 Medicare PDPs 1,392,000 797,000 869,000 Total 4,119,000 2,846,000 2,669,000 Membership 56 Table of Contents 2014 vs. 2013 Membership increased 45% in 2014, mainly driven by organic membership growth across all of our segments, primarily in our Medicaid Health Plans and Medicare PDPs segments, as well as the Windsor acquisition, which was completed on January 1, 2014. Membership discussion by segment follows: Medicaid Health Plans. Medicaid Health Plans segment membership increased by 551,000 , or 31% year over year, to 2.3 million as of December 31, 2014 , primarily driven by organic membership growth in our Florida, Georgia and Kentucky Medicaid programs. Florida membership increased mainly due to our participation in the Managed Medical Assistance ("MMA") program, which commenced implementation on May 1, 2014, while Kentucky membership increased mainly due to Kentucky's participation in the 2014 Medicaid expansion. Additionally, 42,000 members were transferred to our Medicaid plan in New Jersey as a result of the Healthfirst acquisition. Medicare Health Plans. Medicare Health Plans segment membership increased by 127,000 , or 44% year over year, to 417,000 as of December 31, 2014 . Membership increased primarily from the Windsor acquisition, which contributed approximately 37,000 MA and 43,000 Medicare Supplement program members as of December 31, 2014 , as well as an increase resulting from the 2014 annual election period due to our continued focus on dual-eligible beneficiaries and expansion into new counties. Medicare PDPs. Medicare PDPs segment membership as of December 31, 2014 increased by 595,000 , or 75% , compared to December 31, 2013 as a result of the outcome of our 2014 bids, as well as the inclusion of membership from the Windsor acquisition, which accounted for 103,000 of the increase. 2013 vs. 2012 At December 31, 2013 , we served approximately 2,846,000 members; an increase of 177,000 , or 7% , from 2,669,000 members at December 31, 2012 . The growth in 2013 was mainly driven by acquisitions and organic membership growth in our Medicaid Health Plans and Medicare Health Plans segments, partially offset by a decline in Medicare PDPs membership. Membership discussion by segment follows: Medicaid Health Plans. S egment membership increased by approximately 172,000 compared to December 31, 2012 , primarily driven by our acquisitions of plans in South Carolina and Missouri in 2013, which contributed 50,000 and 104,000 members to the year-over-year increase, respectively, as well as membership growth in our Florida and Kentucky Medicaid programs. Kentucky Medicaid membership increased 85,000 compared to 2012, including approximately 57,000 members that were transferred to us following a competitor's exit from the Kentucky market in July 2013 and 13,000 beneficiaries from Region 3 which we began serving effective January 1, 2013. These increases were partially offset by a decline of approximately 97,000 members resulting from our exit from Ohio, which was effective July 1, 2013. Medicare Health Plans. Segment membership increased by approximately 77,000 compared to December 31, 2012, due mainly to the results of the 2013 annual election period, which resulted in an increase of approximately 37,000 members effective January 1, 2013 due to our geographic expansion into 53 new counties in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, New York, and Texas. Medicare PDPs. Segment membership decreased by approximately 72,000 compared to December 31, 2012 as a result of our 2013 PDP bids, which resulted in the reassignment to other plans, effective January 1, 2013, of members who were auto-assigned to us in 2012 or prior years. Net income 2014 vs. 2013 For the year ended December 31, 2014 , our net income was $63.7 million compared to $175.3 million for the same period in 2013 . The $111.6 million , or 64% , decrease was mainly due to higher medical benefits ratios in all of our segments, including the recognition of unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2014, which mainly impacted our Medicaid and Medicare Health Plans segments, compared to favorable prior year reserve development in 2013; the impact of unreimbursed ACA industry fees; increased interest expense from higher debt levels in 2014; and the recognition of $24.1 million in impairment and other charges, primarily related to the partial impairment of certain intangible assets recorded in the 2012 57 Table of Contents acquisition of Easy Choice Health Plan, Inc. ( Easy Choice ). These decreases were partially offset by the increase in premiums from organic membership growth and acquisitions, lower administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues and the Windsor bargain purchase gain, which amounted to $29.5 million in 2014. Refer to Segment Reporting below for a discussion of current developments, operating results and other key performance measures by reportable segment. 2013 vs. 2012 For the year ended December 31, 2013, our net income was $175.3 million compared to $184.7 million for the same period in 2012. The $9.4 million, or 5%, decrease was mainly driven by the impact of lower favorable development in prior year medical benefits payable, lower results in our Medicare PDPs segment, consistent with lower membership, and increased interest expense and other costs resulting from higher average debt levels in 2013 associated with additional borrowings in February 2013 and November 2013, partially offset by increased premium revenue in our Medicaid and Medicare Health Plans segments resulting from the membership increases noted above. Refer to Segment Reporting below for a discussion of current developments, operating results and other key performance measures by reportable segment. Premium revenue 2014 vs. 2013 Premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased approximately $3.4 billion , or 36% , compared to the same period in 2013, due mainly to the impact of organic membership growth across all of our segments and the Windsor acquisition, which accounted for combined increases in Medicare and PDP segment revenue of $620.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 . Additionally, the increase was due to the impact of the ACA fee reimbursement from our Medicaid state customers, the favorable impact of Medicaid membership mix changes and the benefit of a full year of premiums for our South Carolina and Missouri Medicaid plans that were acquired in the first quarter of 2013. These increases were partially offset by rate decreases in our Medicare Health Plans segment and a lower rate in our Medicare PDPs segment, consistent with our 2014 bids. 2013 vs. 2012 Premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased approximately $2.1 billion, or 28%, compared to the same period in 2012. The increase is primarily attributable to our 2012 and 2013 acquisitions, which collectively contributed $913.4 million, or 12%, to the year-over-year increase, organic membership growth in our Medicaid and Medicare Health Plans segments and rate increases in certain of our Medicaid markets, including the 7% increase in Kentucky that was effective January 1, 2013. Additionally, the increase was partially attributable to Medicaid revenue from payment arrangements with certain states associated with primary care enhanced payments, as mandated by the ACA. These increases were partially offset by the impact of lower membership in our Medicare PDPs segment. Premium revenue included $75.7 million and $82.2 million of Medicaid premium taxes for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 2015 Outlook Excluding Medicaid premium taxes and ACA industry fee reimbursement, premium revenue for 2015 is expected to increase to approximately $13.5 billion to $13.8 billion, primarily driven by growth in our Medicaid Health Plans segment. Investment and other income 2014 vs. 2013 Investment and other income in 2014 was $44.4 million , a $25.6 million increase from $18.8 million in 2013 , primarily driven by the Windsor acquisition, as well as higher volumes of prescription drug plan copayments and specialty prescription drugs sold to non-members. 2013 vs. 2012 Investment and other income in 2013 was $18.8 million, a $10.0 million increase from $8.8 million in 2012, primarily driven by higher volumes of prescription drug plan copayments and specialty prescription drugs sold to non-members. 2015 Outlook 58 Table of Contents We expect that Investment and other income will decline to approximately $15 to $20 million in 2015, due mainly to the outsourcing of our pharmacy mail order operations and a reduction in member copayments. We expect that the decline will be more than offset by expected decreases in selling, general and administrative expense, and prescription drug cost savings resulting from the outsourcing. Medical benefits expense 2014 vs. 2013 Total medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $3.2 billion , or 39% compared to the same period in 2013 , due primarily to increased membership across all our segments, and higher current period medical and pharmacy costs, including higher medical costs associated with the Florida MMA program, which operated at a medical benefits ratio ("MBR") that was higher than our 2013 performance in the state. Also contributing to the higher expense was unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2014, which was due to higher than expected medical services in our Medicaid and Medicare Health Plan segments that were not discernible until the impact became clearer over time as claim payments were processed. For the year ended December 31, 2014 , medical benefits expense was impacted by approximately $48.1 million of unfavorable prior year reserve development compared to $3.0 million of favorable prior year reserve development recognized in 2013. 2013 vs. 2012 Total medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased $2.0 billion, or 31%, compared to the same period in 2012. The increase was due mainly to the increased membership in the Medicaid and Medicare Health Plans segments, including acquisitions, the impact of lower favorable development in prior year medical benefits payable, increased medical expense in the first quarter of 2013 associated with the flu and Medicaid primary care enhanced payments, as mandated by the ACA, partially offset by a decrease in the Medicare PDP segment due to lower membership. For the year ended December 31, 2013, medical benefits expense was impacted by approximately $3.0 million of favorable prior year reserve development compared to $76.7 million of such development recognized in 2012. Selling, general and administrative expense SG&A expense includes aggregate costs related to the resolution of the previously disclosed governmental investigations and related litigation, such as settlement accruals and related fair value accretion, legal fees and other similar costs. Refer to Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies within the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs. We believe it is appropriate to evaluate SG&A expense exclusive of these investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs because we do not consider them to be indicative of long-term business operations. A reconciliation of SG&A expense, including and excluding investigation-related costs, is presented below. For the Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 (In millions) SG&A expense $ 1,018.8 $ 856.5 $ 690.8 Adjustments: Investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs (1.4 ) (2.5 ) (3.9 ) Investigation-related administrative costs (36.2 ) (54.8 ) (47.7 ) Total investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs (37.6 ) (57.3 ) (51.6 ) SG&A expense, excluding investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs $ 981.2 $ 799.2 $ 639.2 SG&A ratio (1) 7.9 % 9.1 % 9.4 % Adjusted SG&A ratio (2) 7.7 % 8.5 % 8.7 % (1) SG&A expense, as a percentage of total premium revenue. 59 Table of Contents (2) SG&A expense, as a percentage of total premium revenue, excluding premium taxes, Medicaid state ACA industry fee reimbursements and investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs. 2014 vs. 2013 Excluding investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs, our SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased approximately 23% , to $981.2 million . SG&A expense increased mainly due to the growth in membership, investments in technology and infrastructure, including costs necessary to meet regulatory changes, investments related to our medical cost initiatives, increased spending related to the integration of recent acquisitions and our other growth and service initiatives. These cost increases were partially offset by improvements in operating efficiency. Our SG&A ratio decreased to 7.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 9.1% for the same period in 2013 . After excluding the investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs, our SG&A ratio in 2014 was 7.7% compared to 8.5% for the same period in 2013 . 2013 vs. 2012 Excluding investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs, our SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased approximately $160.0 million, or 25%, to $799.2 million compared to the same period in 2012. The increase was driven mainly by the growth in membership, investments in technology and infrastructure, including costs necessary to meet regulatory changes, investments related to our medical cost initiatives and increased SG&A from the integration of acquisitions. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2013, we determined that we would be discontinuing certain projects going forward and, as a result, the software and development costs acquired to support these projects would not be fully recoverable. Consequently, we recorded a pre-tax asset impairment charge of $9.0 million. The increase in costs in 2013 noted above were partially offset by improvements in operating efficiency. Our SG&A ratio was 9.1% for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to 9.4% for the same period in 2012. After excluding the investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs, our SG&A ratio in 2013 was 8.5% compared to 8.7% for the same period in 2012. 2015 Outlook Our adjusted administrative expense ratio for 2015 is expected to be between approximately 8.0% and 8.2%, an increase from 7.7% in 2014. The expected increase is driven mainly by continued investments and re-establishment of variable compensation that was eliminated in 2014 due to financial and other performance criteria not meeting targets. ACA Industry Fee 2014 For the year ended December 31, 2014 , we incurred $137.7 million of non-deductible expense for the ACA industry fee, based on our share of total health insurance industry assessment. As discussed in Key Developments and Accomplishments , we currently have received amendments, written agreements or other documentation from all of our state Medicaid customers that commit them to reimburse us for substantially all of the impact of the ACA industry fee attributable to our Medicaid plans, including its non-deductibility for income tax purposes for 2014. 2015 Outlook Currently, we estimate that we will incur between $230 and $235 million total ACA industry fees in 2015, due to the increase in the total fee to be levied on the industry and the expected increase in our share of total industry premiums for 2014. However, the 2015 final fee amount will not be determined until August 2015. Medicaid premium taxes 2014 vs. 2013 Medicaid premium taxes incurred for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $76.5 million compared to $75.7 million for the same period in 2013 . In 2014, Medicaid premiums related to our Medicaid contracts with Georgia, Hawaii, New Jersey and New York were subject to premium taxes. 2013 vs. 2012 60 Table of Contents Medicaid premium taxes incurred for the year ended December 31, 2013 were $75.7 million compared to $82.2 million for the same period in 2012. The year-over-year decline of approximately $6.5 million, or 8%, was primarily driven by our exit from the Ohio Medicaid market, which was effective July 1, 2013. Depreciation and Amortization 2014 vs. 2013 Depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately $15.8 million , or 36% , to $59.9 million in 2014 from $44.1 million in 2013 . The increase in the 2014 periods compared to 2013 is due primarily to incremental amortization related to the intangible assets acquired in conjunction with the Windsor acquisition, which was completed on January 1, 2014, and the Healthfirst NJ acquisition completed on July 1, 2014. Additionally, amortization for the year ended December 31, 2014 was impacted by a full year of amortization related to the Missouri Care and WellCare of South Carolina, Inc. ("WCSC") acquisitions, which were completed during the first quarter of 2013. 2013 vs. 2012 Depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately $12.5 million, or 40%, to $44.1 million in 2013 from $31.6 million in 2012, which included approximately $5.9 million of incremental amortization recorded during 2013 relating to the intangible assets acquired in conjunction with the Desert Canyon, Easy Choice, Missouri Care and WCSC acquisitions. The remaining increase is primarily attributable to incremental infrastructure related investments made during 2013. 2015 Outlook Depreciation and amortization for 2015 is expected to increase to approximately $70 to $72 million, primarily driven by increased investments in our information technology infrastructure. Interest expense 2014 vs. 2013 Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $39.4 million compared to $11.9 million for the same period in 2013 . The $27.5 million increase was primarily driven by higher average debt levels during 2014, as we borrowed an additional $300 million term loan (the "Term Loan") under the current credit agreement in September 2014 and, additionally, issued $600 million of 5.75% senior notes (the "Senior Notes") in November 2013. 2013 vs. 2012 Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $11.9 million compared to $4.1 million for the same period in 2012. The $7.8 million increase was primarily driven by higher average debt levels during 2013, as we borrowed an additional $230 million in term loans under the 2011 credit agreement in February 2013 and, additionally, issued the Senior Notes in November 2013. A portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes was used to payoff the remaining term loan balance under the 2011 credit agreement. 2015 Outlook We expect that interest expense will increase in 2015 compared to 2014, due to higher average debt outstanding from the issuance of the Term Loan in September 2014, and is anticipated to be between $47 and $49 million. Impairment and other charges During the second quarter of 2014, we recognized approximately $24.1 million in impairment and other charges, $18.0 million of which primarily relates to the partial impairment of certain intangible assets recorded in the 2012 acquisition of Easy Choice. The impairment resulted primarily from estimated fair values of the intangible assets that were below the book values of such assets. The estimated fair values of these assets were determined based on an income valuation approach using assumptions appropriate for likely market participants. The estimated fair values reflect a significant decline in anticipated long-term profitability, mainly resulting from an inability to improve the medical cost structure to the degree that was previously estimated and the inability to achieve certain administrative cost savings, as a result of certain developments during the second quarter. The remaining charges also include a charge for the full impairment of intangible assets associated with the 61 Table of Contents purchase of our Arizona MA plan after we concluded during 2014 to exit the Arizona MA market in 2015, and charges resulting from the resolution of certain matters related to the purchase price of our 2013 acquisitions. We were no longer able to recognize such charges as adjustments to acquired assets, since we were beyond the measurement period established in the accounting rules for business combinations. Bargain Purchase Gain As a result of the Windsor acquisition, the estimated fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets that we acquired has exceeded the total consideration payable to the seller by approximately $29.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 . After consideration of all relevant factors, we concluded that the excess fair value constituted a bargain purchase gain in accordance with accounting rules related to business combinations. Loss on extinguishment of debt 2013 In November 2013, a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of $600 million of 5.75% senior notes was used to pay off the remaining $336.5 million term loan balance, plus accrued interest, and we then terminated our 2011 credit agreement. In conjunction with the extinguishment of debt, we incurred approximately $2.8 million for the accelerated recognition of previously deferred financing costs. For further information regarding the 2013 debt transactions, refer to Note 12 Debt within the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income tax expense 2014 vs. 2013 Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $114.1 million , or 64.2% of pre-tax income, compared to $103.0 million , or 37.0% of pre-tax income, for the year ended December 31, 2013 . The higher 2014 effective rate mainly reflects the impact of the non-deductible ACA industry fee. Additionally, the effective rate was lower in 2013 due to an issue resolution agreement reached with the IRS regarding the tax treatment of the investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs, resulting in approximately $7.6 million in additional tax benefit over what was recorded as of December 31, 2012. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by the favorable impact of the Windsor bargain purchase gain. 2013 vs. 2012 Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $103.0 million, or 37.0% of pre-tax income, compared to $111.7 million, or 37.7% of pre-tax income, for the year ended December 31, 2012. The lower effective income tax rate in 2013 is primarily due to an issue resolution agreement reached with the Internal Revenue Service during 2013 regarding the tax treatment of certain investigation-related litigation and other resolution cost, which resulted in the recognition of approximately $7.6 million in income tax benefits during the first quarter of 2013, partially offset by the impact of non-deductible compensation under certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act, which generally limits deductions on executive compensation earned after December 31, 2009 that is paid after December 31, 2012. 2015 Outlook We expect that our effective tax rate will increase in 2015 compared to 2014 due mostly to the expected increase in non-deductible ACA industry fees in proportion to the projected earnings increase in 2015. Segment Reporting Reportable operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available and evaluated on a regular basis by the enterprise's decision-makers to determine how resources should be allocated to an individual segment and to assess performance of those segments. Accordingly, we have three reportable segments: Medicaid Health Plans, Medicare Health Plans and Medicare PDPs. Segment Financial Performance Measures In conjunction with the Windsor acquisition, we reassessed our segment reporting practices during the three months ended March 31, 2014, and made revisions to reflect our current method of managing performance and determining resource 62 Table of Contents allocation, which includes reviewing the results of Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage operations acquired as part of the Windsor acquisition together with MA. Accordingly, we include results for Medicare Supplement operations together with MA and renamed the segment Medicare Health Plans. Similarly, we include the PDP operations acquired as part of the Windsor acquisition together with WellCare PDPs and renamed the segment Medicare PDPs. No changes were made to the composition of our Medicaid segment, but we renamed the segment Medicaid Health Plans. Our primary tools for measuring profitability of our reportable operating segments are premium revenue, gross margin and MBR. Beginning in 2014, the ACA imposes an annual premium-based health insurance industry fees on health insurers. Since the timing of revenue recognition for state Medicaid reimbursement of the ACA industry fee has been delayed and has not matched the expense recognition of the fee, and MA and PDP rates will not be adjusted for the ACA industry fee, we have determined to include the ACA industry fee expense in measuring the profitability of our reportable operating segments. Accordingly, gross margin has been redefined as premium revenue less medical benefits expense, less ACA industry fees. MBR measures the ratio of medical benefits expense to premium revenue excluding Medicaid premium taxes and Medicaid state ACA industry fee reimbursement. We use gross margin and MBR both to monitor our management of medical benefits and medical benefits expense and to make various business decisions, including which health care plans to offer, which geographic areas to enter or exit and which health care providers to include in our networks. Although gross margin and MBR play an important role in our business strategy, we may be willing to enter new geographical markets and/or enter into provider arrangements that might produce a less favorable gross margin and MBR if those arrangements, such as capitation or risk sharing, would likely lower our exposure to variability in medical costs or for other reasons. Changes in gross margin and MBR from period to period depend in large part on our ability to, among other things, effectively price our medical and prescription drug plans, estimate and manage medical costs and changes in estimates related to incurred but not reported claims ("IBNR"), estimate and effectively manage medical benefits expense relative to the primarily fixed premiums we receive, negotiate competitive rates with our health care providers, and attract and retain members. In addition, factors such as changes in health care laws, regulations and practices, changes in Medicaid and Medicare funding, changes in the mix of membership, escalating health care costs, competition, levels of use of health care services, general economic conditions, major epidemics, terrorism or bio-terrorism, new medical technologies, including the new, expensive hepatitis C drugs, and other external factors may affect our operations and may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For further information regarding premium revenues and medical benefits expense, please refer below to " Premium Revenue Recognition and Premiums Receivable ", and " Medical Benefits Expense and Medical Benefits Payable " under " Critical Accounting Estimates. " Reconciling Segment Results The following table reconciles our reportable segment results with our income from operations (before income taxes), as reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). For the Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Gross Margin: (In millions) Medicaid Health Plans $ 839.2 $ 733.8 $ 579.2 Medicare Health Plans 411.6 411.5 305.8 Medicare PDPs 71.8 105.2 211.3 Total gross margin 1,322.6 1,250.5 1,096.3 Investment and other income 44.4 18.8 8.8 Other expenses (1,218.7 ) (988.2 ) (808.7 ) Income from operations $ 148.3 $ 281.1 $ 296.4 Medicaid Health Plans 63 Table of Contents Our Medicaid Health Plans segment includes plans for beneficiaries of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ("TANF"), Supplemental Security Income ("SSI"), Aged Blind and Disabled ("ABD") and other state-based programs that are not part of the Medicaid program, such as Children's Health Insurance Program ("CHIP"), Family Health Plus ("FHP") and Managed Long-Term Care ("MLTC") programs. As of December 31, 2014, we operated Medicaid health plans in Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, New Jersey, New York and South Carolina. We began serving South Carolina members on February 1, 2013, Missouri Care members on April 1, 2013 and New Jersey members on January 1, 2014. As of July 1, 2013, we no longer provided Medicaid services in Ohio. Impacting Our Results Effective May 1, 2014, we began providing managed care services to Medicaid recipients in three regions as part of Florida MMA program. Three additional regions were implemented in June, one in July and one in August, completing the implementation in all eight regions we serve. As of December 31, 2014, we were serving over 650,000 members in these regions, compared to the 394,000 members that we served in December 2013. Our anticipated Florida MMA premium is higher than our historical experience to compensate us for the enhanced benefits and services required in the MMA program, however, we have also incurred higher medical expense compared to our previous expectations, reflecting slower than anticipated medical expense improvement during the initial months of this program. Consistent with past implementation of new programs, we are pursuing improvements to care management and expect to pursue increased reimbursement in order to enhance the financial performance of the MMA program. Care management improvements include improving reimbursement terms and collaboration models in certain of our provider contracts, terminating certain providers when we could not achieve an appropriate cost structure or an agreement to collaborate, adding clinical resources into the local health plan, and embedding nurses in some high volume facilities. Effective January 1, 2014, our Kentucky program began serving new members associated with Kentucky's 2014 ACA Medicaid expansion. Such membership totaled 117,000 as of December 31, 2014 . Effective January 1, 2014, we began offering Medicaid managed care in Essex, Hudson, Middlesex, Passaic and Union counties in New Jersey. In addition, effective July 1, 2014, our New Jersey subsidiary completed the acquisition of Medicaid assets from Healthfirst NJ, which primarily relate to the approximate 42,000 Healthfirst Medicaid members who were transferred to our Medicaid plan in New Jersey, as well as to certain provider agreements that transferred to us. As a result, effective July 1, 2014, we offer Medicaid managed care in 10 counties in New Jersey. We have received amendments, written agreements or other documentation from all our state Medicaid customers, that commit them to reimburse us for the portion of the ACA industry fee attributable to the Medicaid programs in these states, including the related state and federal income tax gross-ups. Consequently, we recognized approximately $124.6 million in reimbursement as premium revenue in the year ended December 31, 2014 . Medicaid Segment Results The following table sets forth the summarized results of operations and other relevant performance measures for our Medicaid segment for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 : 64 Table of Contents For the Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 (In millions) Premium revenue (1) $ 7,572.8 $ 5,585.5 $ 4,389.0 Medicaid premium taxes (1) 76.5 75.7 82.2 Medicaid state ACA industry fee reimbursement (1) 124.6 Total premiums 7,773.9 5,661.2 4,471.2 Medical benefits expense 6,853.1 4,927.4 3,892.0 ACA industry fee 81.6 Gross margin $ 839.2 $ 733.8 $ 579.2 Medicaid MBR, including premium taxes and Medicaid state ACA industry fee reimbursements 88.2 % 87.0 % 87.0 % Impact of: Medicaid premium taxes 0.9 % 1.2 % 1.7 % Medicaid state ACA industry fee reimbursement 1.4 % Medicaid MBR (1) 90.5 % 88.2 % 88.7 % Medicaid Membership: Florida 722,000 486,000 454,000 Georgia 604,000 540,000 570,000 Kentucky 420,000 292,000 207,000 Other states (2) 564,000 441,000 356,000 2,310,000 1,759,000 1,587,000 (1) MBR measures the ratio of our medical benefits expense to premium revenue excluding reimbursement for Medicaid premium taxes and Medicaid state ACA industry fee reimbursement revenue. Because reimbursements for Medicaid premium tax and ACA industry fee impacts are both included in the premium rates or reimbursement established in certain of our Medicaid contracts and also recognized separately as a component of expense, we exclude these reimbursements from premium revenue when calculating key ratios as we believe that their impact is not indicative of operating performance. For GAAP reporting purposes, Medicaid premium taxes and Medicaid state ACA industry fee reimbursements are included in premium revenue. (2) All other states consists of Hawaii, Illinois, and New York during all years presented. In 2012, it also includes Ohio; in 2013, it also includes Missouri and South Carolina; and in 2014, it also includes Missouri, New Jersey and South Carolina. Effective as of June 30, 2012, our Missouri contract expired and was not renewed. We re-entered Missouri Medicaid in March 2013 when we acquired Missouri Care. We were not awarded a Medicaid contract in Ohio for the 2013 fiscal year; however, the state of Ohio contracted with us to provide services to Ohio Medicaid beneficiaries through a transition period, which ended June 30, 2013. 2014 vs. 2013 Excluding Medicaid premium taxes and Medicaid state ACA industry fee reimbursements, Medicaid premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $2.0 billion , or 36% , when compared to the same period in 2013 . The increase in premium revenues was driven mainly by increased membership in Florida, due to organic growth and participation in the Florida MMA program, which commenced implementation on May 1, 2014, and in Kentucky, primarily from its participation in the ACA Medicaid expansion and the additional members received following a competitor's exit from the Kentucky program in 2013. Also contributing to the increase in revenue was the net favorable impact of changes in the geographic and demographic mix of members, higher per member per month ("PMPM") rates related to the Florida MMA membership and growth in New Jersey resulting from expansion and the Healthfirst acquisition. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2014 also reflects the benefit of a full year's membership from the South Carolina and Missouri Care Medicaid acquisitions completed during the first quarter of 2013. These increases were partially offset by our exit from the Ohio Medicaid program effective July 1, 2013. Medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by approximately 39% , when compared to the same period in 2013, mainly driven by the increase in membership, higher current period medical and pharmacy costs, and higher medical costs associated with for the Florida MMA program, which operated at a higher MBR than our 2013 performance in the state. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2014 also reflects recognition of unfavorable prior year 65 Table of Contents reserve development and a full year's membership from the South Carolina and Missouri Medicaid acquisitions completed during the first quarter of 2013. Our Medicaid Health Plan segment MBR, excluding the impact of premium taxes and ACA industry fee reimbursement, increased by 230 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, due to the impact of higher current period medical and pharmacy costs, higher cost associated with the Florida MMA program and unfavorable prior year reserve development recognized in 2014 compared to favorable prior year reserve development recognized in 2013. Pharmacy costs include increased spending on hepatitis C drugs as a result of the new, expensive drugs approved in 2014 as well as other pharmacy cost increases. 2013 vs. 2012 Excluding Medicaid premium taxes, Medicaid premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased $1.2 billion, or 27%, when compared to the same period in 2012. The South Carolina and Missouri acquisitions increased premium revenue by $380.2 million, or 9%, year-over-year, while the remaining $816.3 million, or 18% increase was driven primarily by increased membership in our Kentucky and Florida programs, a 7% rate increase in Kentucky that was effective on January 1, 2013, rate increases in certain other markets in late 2012, changes in geographic and demographic mix of members and Medicaid revenue from payment arrangements with certain states associated with primary care enhanced payments, as mandated by the ACA. The increase in Kentucky Medicaid membership and premiums also reflect the commencement of services provided to beneficiaries in Region 3, which began on January 1, 2013, as well as the additional members received from following a competitor's exit from the Kentucky Medicaid market in July 2013. Medicaid medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased 27%, which is consistent with the increase in membership and premiums. Our Medicaid MBR for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased by approximately 50 basis points when compared to the same period in 2012, mainly reflecting the impact of improved results in Kentucky, partially offset by a lower amount of favorable development of prior years' medical benefits payable in 2013 compared to 2012. The Kentucky program MBR declined to 90.0% in 2013 compared to 105.1% in 2012, as 2012 performance was adversely impacted by relatively high transitional medical benefit expenses for the program which launched in late 2011. The Missouri and South Carolina acquisitions also contributed to the decrease in the Medicaid segment MBR in 2013, as the MBR for these programs was lower than the segment average. 2015 Outlook We anticipate Medicaid segment premium revenue, excluding premium taxes and the Medicaid state ACA industry fee reimbursement, to increase to approximately $8.5 to $8.7 billion in 2015. The increase primarily results from a full year contribution from Florida MMA revenue, the New Jersey managed long-term services and supports product and the New York integrated duals program implementation. We currently expect our Medicaid segment MBR in 2015 to be in the range of approximately 89.25% to 90.25%, excluding the impact of Medicaid premium taxes and the Medicaid state ACA industry fee reimbursement, compared to 90.5% percent in 2014, with the largest driver being continued progress in the Florida MMA business. As discussed in Impacting our Results , we expect continued margin improvement in the Florida MMA program through our performance improvement plan, including applying managed care fundamentals to the MMA population, and collaboration with the state to ensure actuarial soundness. We have obtained amendments, written agreements and other documentation from our Medicaid customers to reimburse us for the impact of the industry fee on our Medicaid plans for 2015, including its non-deductibility for income tax purposes. Medicare Health Plans We contract with CMS under the Medicare program to provide a comprehensive array of Part C and Part D benefits to Medicare eligible persons, provided through our MA plans. Our MA plans are comprised of coordinated care plans ("CCPs"), which are administered through HMOs and generally require members to seek health care services and select a primary care physician from a network of health care providers. In addition, we offer Medicare Part D coverage, which provides prescription drug benefits, as a component of most of our MA plans. In 2014, we operated our MA CCPs in 18 states, including Arkansas, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. We cover a wide spectrum of medical services through our MA plans. For many of our plans, we provide additional benefits not covered by Original Medicare, such as vision, dental and hearing services. Through these enhanced benefits, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our members are generally reduced, which allows our members to better manage their health care costs. 66 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2014, we also offered Medicare Supplement policies in 39 states. Impacting Our Results Our MA business was subjected to substantial margin compression in 2014. As a result of legislation passed in December 2013, the 2% Federal budget sequestration reduction to Medicare provider and plan payments continued in 2014 and will extend through 2023, and our results of operations were and will continue to be negatively impacted. In addition, CMS implemented revised 2014 benchmark rates, which resulted in a rate decrease of approximately 2.0% to 4.0% from 2013 rates. CMS also made changes to the MA and PDP Medicare risk adjustment system involving a risk coding recalibration, which is being phased in over the 2014 and 2015 plan years. The new risk adjustment model included an adjustment to the calculation of health status cost risk based on each beneficiary's diagnosis codes that will reduce the positive adjustments for high-risk patients and increase the negative adjustments for low-risk patients. The change appears to most severely affect our rates for those individuals with complex medical conditions, including many of our dual-eligible and lower income members. Also, CMS implemented an MA coding intensity reduction of 4.91% from 3.41% for payment year 2014. Our MA premium rates have not been adjusted to specifically offset the impact of the ACA industry fee. We gained approximately 37,000 MA members in 192 counties, in the states of Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee, as a result of the Windsor acquisition. In addition, one of Windsor subsidiaries offered Medicare Supplement insurance policies and served approximately 43,000 members in 39 states as of December 31, 2014 . Medicare Health Plans Segment Results The following table sets forth the summarized results of operations and other relevant performance measures for our Medicare Health Plans segment for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 : For the Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 (In millions) Premium revenue $ 3,963.2 $ 3,071.0 $ 1,936.4 Medical benefits expense 3,506.9 2,659.5 1,630.6 ACA industry fee 44.7 Gross margin $ 411.6 $ 411.5 $ 305.8 Medicare Health Plans Membership 417,000 290,000 213,000 Medicare Health Plans MBR 88.5 % 86.6 % 84.2 % 2014 vs. 2013 Medicare premium revenue in 2014 increased $892.2 million , or 29% , when compared to the same period in 2013 . The Windsor acquisition contributed approximately $507.2 million , or 17% , to the year-over-year increase, while organic membership growth in Florida, California, New York and Texas drove the remaining increase. Partially offsetting these increases was the impact of CMS premium rate decreases compared to 2013. Medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $847.4 million , or 32% , compared to the same period in 2013, mainly driven by the increase in membership discussed above. The Medicare Health Plans segment MBR increased by 190 basis points compared to 2013, resulting mainly from the impact of CMS rate decreases and the federal government's budget sequestration, which took effect in April 2013, as well as unfavorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by changes to plan benefit designs and cost sharing terms in 2014 compared with 2013, as well as our ongoing medical cost management initiatives. 2013 vs. 2012 67 Table of Contents Medicare Health Plans premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased $1.1 billion, or 59%, when compared to the same period in 2012. The Easy Choice and Desert Canyon acquisitions contributed $533.2 million, or 27%, to the year-over-year growth, while the remaining $601.4 million, or 32%, increase was mainly attributable to organic membership growth associated with our service area expansion, higher risk adjusted premium, prior year revenue adjustments and the strengthening of our sales processes and our product design. The $1.0 billion, or 63%, increase in medical benefits expense during 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 reflects the increase in membership and premiums and increase in the Medicare Health Plans segment MBR. Medicare Health Plans segment MBR increased by 240 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to 2012 due to the impact of Easy Choice, which operated at a higher MBR relative to the segment average, our 2013 plan design and the impact of the federal government's budget sequestration, partially offset by favorable prior period revenue adjustments. 2015 Outlook We expect premium revenue for our Medicare Health Plans segment in 2015 to be between $3.95 billion and $4.05 billion, stable compared to 2014. For the Medicare Health Plans segment, we currently expect the MBR in 2015 to be in the range of approximately 85.0% to 86.5%, compared to 88.5% in 2014. The expected improvement in 2015 is due to specific actions in 2014 designed to increase focus and make progress toward a more reasonable margin, which include specific 2015 bid actions, the continuing implementation of medical expense initiatives, and the absence of 2014 unfavorable prior year reserve development. As of January 2015, the Company Medicare Health Plans segment membership was approximately 380,000 members. The approximate decrease of 37,000 members was driven by actions taken in conjunction with our 2015 bid and county withdrawals in California designed to improve the performance of Easy Choice, which resulted in a 28,000 member decrease in California, as well as the Company exit from the Missouri, Ohio, and Arizona markets representing 8,000 members as of December 31, 2014. For 2015, WellCare offers Medicare Advantage plans in 376 counties across 15 states. Medicare PDPs We have contracted with CMS to serve as a plan sponsor offering stand-alone Medicare Part D PDP plans to Medicare eligible beneficiaries through our Medicare PDPs segment. As of December 31, 2014, we offered PDP plans in 49 states and the District of Columbia. The PDP benefit design generally results in our incurring a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages of a plan year, and less in the latter stages of a plan year, due to the members' share of cumulative out-of-pocket costs increasing throughout the plan year. As a result, the Medicare PDPs MBR generally decreases throughout the year. Also, the level and mix of members who are auto-assigned to us as and those who actively choose our PDP plans will impact the segment MBR pattern across periods. Impacting Our Results Our Medicare PDP business was subjected to substantial margin compression in 2014. As a result of legislation passed in December 2013, the 2% Federal budget sequestration reduction to Medicare provider and plan payments continued in 2014 and will extend through 2023, and so our results of operations have been, and will continue to be, negatively impacted. In addition, our PDP premium rates from CMS have not been adjusted to specifically offset the impact of the ACA industry fee. Based on the outcome of our 2014 stand-alone PDP bids, our plans were below the benchmarks in 30 of the 33 CMS regions for which we submitted bids and within the de minimis range of the benchmark in two other CMS regions. Comparatively, in 2013, our plans were below the benchmark in 14 regions and within the de minimis range in five other regions. In 2014, we were auto-assigned newly eligible members into our plans for the 30 regions that were below the benchmark. Membership increased to approximately 1,392,000 at December 31, 2014 , compared to 797,000 at December 31, 2013. Medicare PDPs Segment Results The following table sets forth the summarized results of operations and other relevant performance measures for our Medicare PDPs segment for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 : 68 Table of Contents For the Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 (In millions) Premium revenue $ 1,178.4 $ 776.9 $ 992.6 Medical benefits expense 1,095.2 671.7 781.3 ACA industry fee 11.4 Gross margin $ 71.8 $ 105.2 $ 211.3 Medicare PDPs membership 1,392,000 797,000 869,000 Medicare PDPs MBR 92.9 % 86.5 % 78.7 % 2014 vs. 2013 PDP premium revenue increased 52% in 2014 when compared to 2013 , primarily due to the increase in membership, which includes 103,000 members from the Windsor acquisition, partially offset by lower premium rates resulting from our 2014 bids. PDP MBR for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased 640 basis points over the same period in 2013 and contributed to the increase in medical benefits expense. The MBR increase is mainly due to higher drug unit costs, increased utilization of branded and specialty medications, the outcome of our 2014 bids and CMS rate decreases and the federal government's budget sequestration, which took effect in April 2013. 2013 vs. 2012 PDP premium revenue decreased 22% for the year ended December 31, 2013 when compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due a decline in membership resulting from the outcome of our 2013 bids. PDP MBR for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased 780 basis points over the same period in 2012 mainly due to the addition of our new enhanced product, designed for those who choose a PDP, and a shift in membership to this product, as well as higher drug unit costs and the outcome of our 2013 bids. Transition of care costs for the enhanced product also contributed to the increased MBR. The transition period concluded at the end of March 2013. 2015 Outlook We anticipate that PDP segment premium revenue will decrease to approximately $1.0 to $1.1 billion in 2015, primarily as a result of a decline in membership resulting from the outcome of our 2015 bids, as discussed below. We currently anticipate our PDP segment MBR for 2015 will be in the range of approximately 85.5% to 87.0%, down from 92.9% in 2014. The expected year-over-year decrease results mainly from the results of our 2015 bids, which reflect a better balance of margin and membership, including an increase in our basic plan premium. PDP membership as of January 1, 2015 was 1,098,000 , a decrease of approximately 294,000, or 21%, from 1,392,000 as of December 31, 2014. The decline in membership in 2015 is primarily based on the outcome of our 2015 PDP bids, in which our plans were below the benchmarks in 13 of the 33 CMS regions for which we submitted bids and in the de minimis range in nine regions. In 2015, those PDP members who were auto assigned to us in regions where our plans are not below or within the de minimis range were or are being assigned to other plans. However, the outcome of our 2015 bids is expected to have a favorable impact on the 2015 segment results compared to 2014, as discussed above. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Each of our existing and anticipated sources of cash is impacted by operational and financial risks that influence the overall amount of cash generated and the capital available to us. Additionally, we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry. The parent and other non-regulated companies ("non-regulated subsidiaries") are dependent upon dividends and management fees from our regulated subsidiaries, most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions. For a further discussion of risks that can affect our liquidity, see Part I Item 1A Risk Factors included in this 2014 Form 10-K. 69 Table of Contents Liquidity The Company maintains liquidity at two levels: the regulated subsidiary level and the non-regulated parent and subsidiary level. Regulated subsidiaries Our regulated subsidiaries' primary liquidity requirements include: payment of medical claims and other health care services; management fees paid to our non-regulated administrator subsidiary under intercompany services agreements and direct administrative costs, which are not covered by an intercompany services agreement, such as selling expenses and legal costs; and federal tax payments to the parent company under an intercompany tax sharing agreement. Our regulated subsidiaries meet their liquidity needs by: maintaining appropriate levels of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments; generating cash flows from operating activities, mainly from premium revenue; cash flows from investing activities, including investment income and sales of investments; and capital contributions received from our non-regulated subsidiaries. We refer collectively to the cash, cash equivalents and investment balances maintained by our regulated subsidiaries as "regulated cash and investments." Our regulated subsidiaries generally receive premiums in advance of payments of claims for medical and other health care services; however, regulated cash and cash equivalents can fluctuate significantly in a particular period depending on the timing of receipts for premiums from our government partners. Our unrestricted regulated cash and investments (which represent our regulated cash and investments not on deposit with a state in which we operate) was $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2014 , an increase of $300 million from $1.4 billion at December 31, 2013. The increase is due mainly to cash flows from operating activities as well as $89.0 million of contributions received from our non-regulated subsidiaries, partially offset by $68.0 million in dividends distributed to our non-regulated subsidiaries. Our regulated subsidiaries are each subject to applicable state regulations that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of capital and surplus. We continue to maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our regulated subsidiaries. See further discussion under Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions below. Parent and non-regulated subsidiaries Liquidity requirements at the non-regulated parent and subsidiary level generally consist of: payment of administrative costs not directly incurred by our regulated operations, including, but not limited to, staffing costs, business development, rent, branding and certain information technology services; capital contributions and advances paid to our regulated subsidiaries; capital expenditures; debt service; and federal tax payments. Our non-regulated parent and subsidiaries normally meet their liquidity requirements by: management fees earned by our non-regulated administrator subsidiary under intercompany services agreements; dividends received from our regulated subsidiaries; collecting federal tax payments from the regulated subsidiaries; proceeds from issuance of debt and equity securities; and cash flows from investing activities, including investment income and sales of investments. 70 Table of Contents Unregulated cash, cash equivalents and investments was $89.5 million at December 31, 2014 , a decrease of $405.6 million from $495.1 million at December 31, 2013. The decrease resulted mainly from funding provided to certain regulated subsidiaries for various subsidies and other payments the subsidiaries made on behalf of CMS as a Part D plan sponsor for which CMS will reimburse us. The CMS subsidies and payments include, among others, the catastrophic reinsurance subsidy and various premium and cost sharing subsidies for low income members, as well as the CMS risk corridor. Growth in our PDP and MA membership and high drug unit costs has resulted in higher subsidy payments compared with our bids and prior years, and our unregulated cash will continue to be used to fund these benefits until they are settled with CMS, which we expect to occur in the fourth quarter of 2015. Additionally, the decrease in unregulated cash reflects $89.0 million of capital contributions made to certain regulated subsidiaries and payment of certain investigation resolution costs and other related costs. These decreases were partially offset by the $298.6 million in net proceeds from the Term Loan received in September 2014 and $68.0 million of dividends received from regulated subsidiaries. Outlook Based on our experience in 2014, our 2015 PDP and MA bids reflected significantly higher estimates for cash outflows for the government's responsibility of the Part D benefit plan design, particularly for the catastrophic reinsurance subsidy. While the level of subsidy payments we make on behalf of CMS compared with our 2015 bids may still be significant due to the composition of our 2015 PDP membership, which reflects a higher number of dual eligible members relative to our overall population than we expected, we expect a meaningful reduction in our CMS receivable upon settling the 2014 plan year with CMS in the fourth quarter of 2015. Auction Rate Securities As of December 31, 2014 , $32.3 million of our long-term investments were comprised of municipal note securities with an auction reset feature ("auction rate securities"), which are issued by various state and local municipal entities for the purpose of financing student loans, public projects and other activities. Two auction rate securities with an aggregate fair value of $21.3 million have investment grade security credit ratings and one auction rate security with a fair value of $11.0 million has a credit rating below investment grade. Liquidity for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process which allows holders to sell their notes and resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined intervals, usually every seven or 35 days. As of the date of this 2014 Form 10-K, auctions have failed for our auction rate securities and there is no assurance that auctions will succeed in the future. An auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not be matched with an adequate volume of buyers. In the event that there is a failed auction the indenture governing the security requires the issuer to pay interest at a contractually defined rate that is generally above market rates for other types of similar instruments. The securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the contractual rate and be auctioned every seven or 35 days until the auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities, or they mature. As a result, our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our remaining auction rate securities in the near term may be limited or non-existent. In addition, if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate, we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments. Although auctions continue to fail, we believe we will be able to liquidate these securities without significant loss. There are government guarantees or municipal bond insurance in place and we have the ability and the present intent to hold these securities until maturity or market stability is restored. Accordingly, we do not believe our auction rate securities are impaired and as a result, we have not recorded any impairment losses for our auction rate securities. However, it could take until the final maturity of the underlying securities to realize our investments' recorded value. The final maturity as of December 31, 2014 of the underlying securities could be as long as 23 years. The weighted-average life of the underlying securities for our auction rate securities portfolio is 18 years. Cash Flow Activities Our cash flows are summarized as follows: 71 Table of Contents For the Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 (In millions) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 299.3 $ 178.9 $ (30.7 ) Net cash used in investing activities (75.6 ) (290.5 ) (222.8 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (392.7 ) 493.6 28.9 Total net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (169.0 ) $ 382.0 $ (224.6 ) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities We generally receive premiums in advance of payments of claims for health care services; however, cash flows related to our operations can fluctuate significantly in a particular period depending on the timing of premiums receipts from our government partners or payments related to the resolution of government investigations and related litigation. 2014 vs. 2013 Cash provided by operating activities for 2014 was $299.3 million compared to $178.9 million for 2013, mainly resulting from an increase in premiums associated with the growth in membership, as well as the timing of certain premium receipts, partially offset by the $137.7 million ACA industry fee payment remitted to the IRS during September 2014. Operating cash flows for 2014 and 2013 also reflect payments of approximately $36.5 million and $37.6 million, respectively, made to the Civil Division under the terms of the settlement agreement discussed in "Financial Impact of Government Investigation and Litigation" below. 2013 vs. 2012 Cash provided by operating activities in 2013 was $178.9 million compared to cash used in operating activities of $30.7 million for 2012. The year-over-year improvement primarily resulted from the increase in premiums associated with the growth in membership. Operating cash flows in 2013 and 2012 also reflect payments made to the Civil Division of approximately $37.6 million and $39.8 million, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities 2014 vs. 2013 Net cash used in investing activities for 2014 was $75.6 million compared to $290.5 million for 2013. The decrease in cash used in 2014 primarily resulted from a higher amount of cash used in acquisitions in 2013 relative to 2014, including $133.6 million advanced in December 2013 in connection with the Windsor acquisition, which closed in January 2014. Conversely, in 2014 cash flows reflect $48.0 million of net cash acquired from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, investment activities primarily reflect our investment in marketable securities and restricted investments, purchases of property and equipment and proceeds from maturities of marketable securities and restricted investments, which in combination, did not materially change year over year. 2013 vs. 2012 Net cash used in investing activities was $290.5 million in 2013 compared to $222.8 million in 2012. The increase in cash used in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to the $133.6 million advanced in December 2013 in connection with the Windsor acquisition which closed in January 2014, partially offset by the impact from lower collective amounts paid in connection with the 2013 acquisitions as compared to the collective amounts paid in connection with the 2012 acquisitions. Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities Net cash used in financing activities was $392.7 million in 2014, compared to net cash provided of $493.6 million and $28.9 million for 2013 and 2012, respectively. These cash flows mainly reflect: Net funds paid for the benefit of members of approximately $687.9 million for 2014, compared to funds received of $34.0 million and $36.3 million during 2013 and 2012, respectively. These funds represent the net amounts of 72 Table of Contents subsidies received from CMS and the related prescription drug benefits we paid in connection with the low-income cost sharing, catastrophic reinsurance and coverage gap discount components of the Medicare Part D program related to the government's portion of financial responsibility. The increased cash outflows in 2014 are due mainly to increased drug costs relative to our MA and PDP bids. Aggregate net proceeds of $298.6 million in 2014 resulting from the $300.0 million Term Loan issued during September 2014, compared to aggregate net proceeds from debt transactions of $451.4 million in 2013. Debt-related activity in 2013 includes net proceeds of $228.5 million received in connection with the second amendment to our 2011 credit agreement and $587.9 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes in November 2013, partially offset by $28.5 million of payments made on the term loan under our 2011 credit agreement during the first three quarters of 2013. During November 2013, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes to pay off the remaining $336.5 million term loan balance under our 2011 credit agreement, plus accrued interest, and used the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes and organic growth opportunities. Financial Impact of Government Investigation and Litigation Under the terms of settlement agreements entered into on April 26, 2011, and finalized on March 23, 2012, to resolve matters under investigation by the Civil Division and certain other federal and state enforcement agencies (the "Settlement"), WellCare agreed to pay the Civil Division a total of $137.5 million in four equal annual principal payments, plus interest accrued at 3.125%. The estimated fair value of the discounted remaining liability was $35.2 million at December 31, 2014. The Settlement also provides for a contingent payment of an additional $35.0 million in the event that we are acquired or otherwise experience a change in control on or before April 30, 2015, provided that the change in control transaction exceeds certain minimum transaction value thresholds as specified in the Settlement. We currently maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance in the amount of $125.0 million for other matters not addressed above. Capital Resources Credit Agreement In September 2014, we amended and restated our existing credit agreement (as amended and restated, the "Credit Agreement") to provide for the $300.0 million Term Loan, in addition to the previously-existing $300.0 million senior unsecured revolving loan facility (the Revolving Credit Facility ), which may be used for general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Facility provides that up to $75.0 million may be used for letters of credit. The Credit Agreement also provides that we may, at our option, increase the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Facility and/or obtain incremental term loans in an amount up to $75.0 million without the consent of any lenders not participating in such increase, subject to certain customary conditions and lenders committing to provide the increase in funding. The Term Loan matures in full in September 2016, with no amortization payments or prepayment penalties. We are not able to reborrow amounts repaid under the Term Loan. The commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility expire on November 14, 2018 and any amounts outstanding under the facility will be payable in full at that time. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a spread of between 1.50% and 2.625%, or a rate equal to the Prime Rate plus a spread of between 0.50% to 1.625%, depending upon our cash flow leverage ratio (which is defined as the ratio of our total debt to total consolidated EBITDA.) Unutilized commitments under the Credit Agreement are subject to a fee of 0.25% to 0.45% depending upon our cash flow leverage ratio. The Credit Agreement contains negative and financial covenants that limit certain activities of our company and its subsidiaries, including (i) restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness; and (ii) financial covenants that require (a) the cash flow leverage ratio not to exceed a maximum; (b) a minimum interest expense and principal payment coverage ratio; and (c) 105% of our required level of statutory net worth for our health maintenance organization and insurance subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties that must be accurate in order for us to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, we may be required immediately to repay all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Lenders holding at least 50% of the loans and commitments under the Credit Agreement may elect to accelerate the maturity of the loans and/or terminate the commitments under the Credit Agreement upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default. We received net proceeds of $298.6 million in connection with the funding of the Term Loan and the closing of the Credit Agreement in September 2014. The Term Loan is classified as long-term debt in the Company consolidated balance sheet at 73 Table of Contents December 31, 2014 based on its September 2016 maturity date. The interest rate on the Term Loan was 2.5% as of December 31, 2014. Additionally, in November 2013, we terminated our 2011 credit agreement in connection with our entry into the Credit Agreement described above. All amounts outstanding under the 2011 credit agreement were paid in full on November 14, 2013. As of December 31, 2014 and as of the date of this filing, we have not drawn upon the Revolving Credit Facility and we remain in compliance with all covenants under both the Credit Agreement and the Senior Notes (defined below). Senior Notes In November 2013, we completed the offer and sale of $600.0 million in principal amount of 5.75% unsecured Senior Notes due 2020. We received net proceeds of $587.9 million upon issuance of the Senior Notes, after deduction of approximately $12.1 million incurred in debt issuance costs. The Senior Notes will mature on November 15, 2020, with interest on the Senior Notes payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, which commenced on May 15, 2014. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repay the full $336.5 million outstanding under our 2011 credit agreement, and the remaining net proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes, including organic growth opportunities and potential acquisitions. The indenture under which the Senior Notes were issued contains covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of our company and its restricted subsidiaries to: incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock; pay dividends or make other distributions; make other restricted payments and investments; sell assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries; create certain liens; incur restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments, and in the case of our subsidiaries, guarantee indebtedness; engage in transactions with affiliates; create unrestricted subsidiaries; and merge or consolidate with other entities. For additional information on our long-term debt, see Note 12 Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Shelf Registration Statement In August 2012, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC that became automatically effective covering the registration, issuance and sale of an indeterminate amount of our securities, including common stock, preferred stock, senior or subordinated debt securities, depository shares, securities purchase contracts, units or warrants. We may publicly offer securities in the future at prices and terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Initiatives to Increase Our Unregulated Cash We may pursue alternatives to raise additional unregulated cash. Some of these initiatives may include, but are not limited to, obtaining dividends from certain of our regulated subsidiaries, provided sufficient capital in excess of regulatory requirements exists in these subsidiaries, utilizing the Revolving Credit Facility, and/or accessing the debt and equity capital markets. However, we cannot provide any assurances that we will obtain applicable state regulatory approvals for additional dividends to our non-regulated subsidiaries by our regulated subsidiaries or be successful in accessing the capital markets if we determine to do so. We believe that we have sufficient capital, or sufficient access to capital, including through the Revolving Credit Facility, to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months. Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions Each of our HMO and insurance subsidiaries must maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital determined by statute or regulation. The minimum statutory capital requirements differ by state and are generally based on a percentage of annualized premium revenue, a percentage of annualized health care costs, a percentage of certain liabilities, a statutory minimum, risk-based capital ("RBC") requirements or other financial ratios. The RBC requirements are based on guidelines established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC"), and have been adopted by most states. The statutory framework 74 Table of Contents for our regulated subsidiaries' minimum capital requirements could change over time. For instance, RBC requirements may be adopted by more of the states in which we operate. In addition, regulators could require our subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth in excess of the amount required under the applicable state laws if the regulators determine that maintaining such additional statutory net worth is in the best interest of our members and other constituencies. Failure to maintain these requirements would trigger regulatory action by the state. Such statues, regulations and capital requirements also restrict the timing, payment, and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us as the sole stockholder. To the extent our HMO and insurance subsidiaries must comply with these regulations, they may not have the financial flexibility to transfer funds to us. Based upon current statutes and regulations, the minimum capital and surplus requirement, or net assets, for these subsidiaries that may not be transferable to us in the form of loans, advances, or cash dividends was approximately $746.0 million at December 31, 2014 , and $489.0 million at December 31, 2013 . The combined statutory capital and surplus of our HMO and insurance subsidiaries was $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, which was in compliance with the minimum capital requirements as of those dates. Our regulated subsidiaries are also subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments. Dividend restrictions vary by state, but the maximum amount of dividends which can be paid without prior approval from the applicable state is subject to restrictions relating to statutory capital, surplus and net income for the previous year. Some states require prior approval of all dividends, regardless of amount. States may disapprove any dividend that, together with other dividends paid by a subsidiary in the prior 12 months, exceeds the regulatory maximum as computed for the subsidiary based on its statutory surplus and net income. We received $68.0 million , $147.0 million and $192.0 million in dividends from our regulated subsidiaries during the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively. The 2014 amount included $36 million not requiring prior regulatory approval, and $32 million paid after obtaining prior regulatory approval. Under applicable regulatory requirements at December 31, 2014 , the amount of dividends that may be paid through the end of 2015 by our HMO and insurance subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities is approximately $60.0 million in the aggregate. Actual dividends paid may vary due to consideration of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to, for example, premium volume and product mix. For additional information on regulatory requirements, see Note 17 Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth information regarding our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014 . Payments due to period Total Less Than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More than 5 Years (In millions) Operating leases $ 72.4 $ 24.9 $ 28.0 $ 11.5 $ 8.0 Purchase obligations (1) 125.3 80.7 29.6 15.0 Amounts accrued related to investigation resolution (2) 35.2 35.2 Long-term debt 900.0 300.0 600.0 Interest on debt (3) 217.6 42.2 76.2 69.0 30.2 Total $ 1,350.5 $ 183.0 $ 433.8 $ 95.5 $ 638.2 (1) Our purchase obligations include commitments under contracts for equipment leases, software maintenance and the purchase of pharmaceuticals from our pharmacy benefit manager. (2) Based on the terms of the settlement agreement reached with the Civil Division effective as of March 23, 2012, as discussed in Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Represents projected interest on our 5.75% $600.0 million Senior Notes and our $300.0 million Term Loan. We are not an obligor under or guarantor of any indebtedness of any other party; however, we may have to pay referral claims of health care providers under contract with us who are not able to pay costs of medical services provided by other providers. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 75 At December 31, 2014 , we did not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements except for operating leases as described in the table above. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In the ordinary course of business, we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of our results of operations and financial condition in conformity with GAAP. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting estimates relating to premium revenue recognition and premiums receivable, medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable, and goodwill and intangible assets, are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Premium Revenue Recognition and Premiums Receivable We earn premium revenue through our participation in Medicaid, Medicaid-related and Medicare programs. Our Medicaid contracts with state agencies generally are multi-year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions. Our Medicare contracts with CMS renew annually. Our Medicare and Medicaid contracts establish fixed, monthly premium rates per member ("PMPM"), which are generally determined at the beginning of each new contract renewal period; however, premiums may be adjusted by CMS and state agencies throughout the terms of the contracts in certain cases. Premium rate changes are recognized in the period the change becomes effective, when the impact of the change in the rate is reasonably estimable, and collection is assured. Our contracts also have additional provisions as described in the sections below. We recognize premium revenue in the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members. We are generally paid by CMS and state agencies in the month in which we provide services. On a monthly basis, we bill members for any premiums for which they are responsible according to their respective plan. We record premiums earned but not received as premiums receivable and record premiums received in advance of the period of service as unearned premiums in the consolidated balance sheets. Unearned premiums are recognized as revenue when we provide the related services. Member premiums are recognized as revenue in the period of service. We estimate, on an on-going basis, the amount of members' billings that may not be collectible, based on our evaluation of historical trends. An allowance is established for the estimated amount that may not be collectible. In addition, we routinely monitor the collectability of specific premiums receivable from CMS and state agencies, including Medicaid receivables for obstetric deliveries and newborns and net receivables for member retroactivity and reduce revenue and premiums receivable by the amount we estimate may not be collectible. Premium payments are based upon eligibility lists produced by CMS and state agencies. We verify these lists to determine whether we have been paid for the correct premium category and program. From time to time, CMS and state agencies require us to reimburse them for premiums that we received for individuals who were subsequently determined by us, or by CMS or state agencies, to be ineligible for any government-sponsored program or to belong to a plan other than ours. Additionally, the verification of membership may result in additional premiums due to us from CMS and state agencies for individuals who were subsequently determined to belong to our plan for periods in which we received no premium for those members. We estimate the amount of outstanding retroactivity adjustments and adjust premium revenue based on historical trends, premiums billed, the volume of member and contract renewal activity and other information. We record amounts receivable in premiums receivable, net and amounts payable in other accrued expenses and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Supplemental Medicaid Premiums We earn, or earned, supplemental premium payments for eligible obstetric deliveries and newborns of our Medicaid members in Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, New York, South Carolina and, until June 30, 2013, in Ohio. Each state Medicaid contract specifies how and when these supplemental payments are earned and paid. Upon delivery of a newborn, we notify the state agency according to the contract terms. We also earn supplemental Medicaid premium payments in some states for high cost drugs and certain services such as early childhood prevention screenings. We recognize supplemental premium revenue in the period we provide related services to our members. Medicaid Risk-Adjusted Premiums 76 Table of Contents In some instances, our Medicaid premiums are subject to risk score adjustments based on the health profile of our membership. Generally, the risk score is determined by the state agency's analysis of encounter submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state's Medicaid membership. The frequency of when states adjust premiums varies, but is usually done quarterly or semi-annually on a retrospective basis. We recognize periodic changes to risk-adjusted premiums as revenue when the amounts are determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Medicaid ACA Industry Fee reimbursement The ACA imposed certain new taxes and fees, including limitations on the amount of compensation that is tax deductible, as well as an annual premium-based health insurance industry assessment on health insurers which began in 2014. As discussed in "Medicaid Segment Results- Impacting Our Results ", we have received amendments, written agreements or other documentation from all our Medicaid state customers, that commit them to reimburse us for the portion of the ACA industry fee on our Medicaid plans, including its non-deductibility for income tax purposes for 2014. Consequently, we recognized $124.6 million of reimbursement for the ACA industry fee as premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. Medicare Risk-Adjusted Premiums CMS provides risk-adjusted payments for MA Plans and PDPs based on the demographics and health severity of enrollees. The risk-adjusted premiums we receive are based on claims and encounter data that we submit to CMS within prescribed deadlines. We develop our estimates for risk-adjusted premiums utilizing historical experience, or other data, and predictive models as sufficient member risk score data becomes available over the course of each CMS plan year. We recognize periodic changes to risk-adjusted premiums as revenue when the amounts are determinable and collection is reasonably assured, which is possible as additional diagnosis code information is reported to CMS, when the ultimate adjustment settlements are received from CMS, or we receive notification of such settlement amounts. CMS adjusts premiums on two separate occasions on a retrospective basis. The first retrospective adjustment for a given plan year generally occurs during the third quarter of that year. This initial settlement represents the update of risk scores for the current plan year based on the severity of claims incurred in the prior plan year. CMS then issues a final retrospective risk adjusted premium settlement for that plan year in the following year. We develop our estimates for risk-adjusted premiums utilizing historical experience and predictive models as sufficient member risk score data becomes available over the course of each CMS plan year. We populate our models with available risk score data on our members and base risk premium adjustments on risk score data from the previous year. We are not privy to risk score data for members new to our plans in the current plan year; therefore we include assumptions regarding these members' risk scores. We periodically revise our estimates of risk-adjusted premiums as additional diagnosis code information is reported to CMS and adjust our estimates to actual amounts when the ultimate adjustment settlements are either received from CMS or we receive notification from CMS of such settlement amounts. As a result of the variability of factors that determine our estimates for risk-adjusted premiums, the actual amount of the CMS retroactive payment could be materially more or less than our estimates and could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We record any changes in estimates in current operations as adjustments to premium revenue. Historically, we have not experienced significant differences between our estimates and amounts ultimately received. However, in the third quarter of 2013, we recognized risk adjusted premium received as part of the 2012 final settlement that was higher than our original estimates, mainly related to members in our California MA plan that were new to Medicare in 2012. The data provided to CMS to determine members' risk scores is subject to audit by CMS even after the annual settlements occur. An audit may result in the refund of premiums to CMS. While our experience to date has not resulted in a material refund, future refunds could materially reduce premium revenue in the year in which CMS determines a refund is required and could be material to our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Minimum Medical Expense and Risk Corridor Provisions We may be required to refund certain premium revenue to state agencies and CMS under various contractual and plan arrangements. We estimate the impact of these arrangements on a monthly basis and reflect any adjustments to premium revenues in current operations. We report the estimated net amounts due to state agencies and CMS in other payables to government partners in the consolidated balance sheets. Certain of our Medicaid contracts require us to expend a minimum percentage of premiums on eligible medical benefits expense. To the extent that we expend less than the minimum percentage of the premiums on eligible medical benefits, we are required to refund to the state all or some portion of the difference between the minimum and our actual allowable medical benefits expense. We estimate the amounts due to the state agencies as a return of premium based on the terms of our contracts with the applicable state agency. 77 Table of Contents Our MA and PDP prescription drug plan premiums are subject to risk sharing through the CMS Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions. The risk corridor calculation compares our actual experience to the target amount of prescription drug costs, limited to costs under the standard coverage as defined by CMS, less rebates included in our submitted plan year bid. We receive additional premium from CMS if our actual experience is more than 5% above the target amount. We refund premiums to CMS if our actual experience is more than 5% below the target amount. Based on the risk corridor provision and PDP activity-to-date, an estimated risk-sharing receivable or payable is recorded as an adjustment to premium revenue. After the close of the annual plan year, CMS performs the risk corridor calculation and any differences are settled between CMS and our plans. Historically, we have not experienced material differences between the subsequent CMS settlement amount and our estimates. Beginning in 2014, the ACA requires the establishment of a minimum medical loss ratio ( MLR ) for MA plans and Part D plans, requiring them to spend not less than 85% of premiums on medical benefits. The rules implementing the minimum MLR impose financial and other penalties for failing to achieve the minimum MLR, including requirements to refund to CMS shortfalls in amounts spent on medical benefits and termination of a plan MA contract for prolonged failure to achieve the minimum MLR. MLR is determined by adding a plan spending for clinical services, prescription drugs and other direct patient benefits, plus its total spending on quality improvement activities and dividing the total by earned premiums (after subtracting specific identified taxes and other fees). These provisions did not have a material impact on our results of operations in 2014. Medicare Part D Subsidies For qualifying low income PDP members, CMS pays for some, or all, of the member's monthly premium. We receive certain Part D prospective subsidy payments from CMS for our MA and PDP members as a fixed monthly per member amount, based on the estimated costs of providing prescription drug benefits over the plan year, as reflected in our bids. Approximately nine to ten months subsequent to the end of the plan year, or later in the case of the coverage gap discount subsidy, a settlement payment is made between CMS and our plans based on the difference between the prospective payments and actual claims experience. The subsidy components under Part D are described below. Low-Income Cost Sharing Subsidy (LICS) - For qualifying low income members, CMS reimburses us for all or a portion of the low income member's deductible, coinsurance and co-payment amounts above the out-of-pocket threshold. Catastrophic Reinsurance Subsidy - CMS reimburses plans for 80% of the drug costs after a member reaches his or her out-of-pocket catastrophic threshold through a catastrophic reinsurance subsidy. Coverage Gap Discount Subsidy (CGD) - CMS provides monthly prospective payments for pharmaceutical manufacturer discounts made available to members. Catastrophic reinsurance subsidies and the low-income cost sharing subsidies represent cost reimbursements under the Medicare Part D program. We are fully reimbursed by CMS for costs incurred for these contract elements and, accordingly, there is no insurance risk to us. Therefore, amounts received for these subsidies are not considered premium revenue, and are reported, net of the subsidy benefits paid, as Funds receivable/held for the benefit of members in the consolidated balance sheets. The receipts and payments between us and CMS are presented on a net basis as financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows since we are essentially administering and paying the benefit subsidies on behalf of CMS. Historically, the settlement payments between us and CMS have not been materially different from our estimates. However, the balance of funds receivable from CMS grew substantially in 2014 due to increased drug costs relative to our bid estimates. CGD subsidies advance payments are recorded as Funds receivable/held for the benefit of members in the consolidated balance sheets. Receivables are set up for manufacturer-invoiced amounts. Manufacturer payments reduce the receivable as payments are received. After the end of the contract year, during the Medicare Part D Payment reconciliation process for the CGD, CMS will perform a cost-based reconciliation to ensure the Medicare Part D sponsor is paid for gap discounts advanced at the point of sale, based on accepted Prescription Drug Event data. For a further description of the revenue elements related to our segments, see Part I - Item 1 - Business - OUR PRODUCT SEGMENTS . Estimating Medical Benefits Expense and Medical Benefits Payable The cost of medical benefits is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost 78 Table of Contents of incurred but not reported ("IBNR") direct medical benefits expense. Medical benefits payable includes estimates for IBNR, amounts for claims fully adjudicated but not yet paid and certain medically-related administrative costs. Direct medical expenses include amounts paid or payable to hospitals, physicians, pharmacy benefit managers and providers of ancillary services. Recorded direct medical expenses are reduced by the amount of pharmacy rebates earned, which are estimated based on historical utilization of specific pharmaceuticals, current utilization and contract terms. Pharmacy rebates earned but not yet received from pharmaceutical manufacturers are included in pharmacy rebates receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Direct medical expenses may also include reserves for estimated referral claims related to health care providers under contract with us who are financially troubled or insolvent and who may not be able to honor their obligations for the costs of medical services provided by other providers. In these instances, we may be required to honor these obligations for legal or business reasons. Based on our current assessment of providers under contract with us, such losses have not been and are not expected to be significant. Also, included in direct medical expense are estimates for provider settlements due to clarification of contract terms, out-of-network reimbursement, claims payment differences and amounts due to contracted providers under risk-sharing arrangements. Medically-related administrative costs include preventive health and wellness, care management, case and disease management, and other quality improvement costs. Other medically-related administrative costs such as utilization review services, network and provider credentialing and claims handling costs, are recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses. Medical benefits payable represents amounts for claims fully adjudicated but not yet paid and estimates for IBNR. Our estimate of IBNR is the most significant estimate included in our consolidated financial statements.We determine our best estimate of the base liability for IBNR utilizing consistent standard actuarial methodologies based upon key assumptions which vary by business segment. Our assumptions include current payment experience, trend factors, and completion factors. Trend factors in our standard actuarial methodologies include contractual requirements, historic utilization trends, the interval between the date services are rendered and the date claims are paid, denied claims activity, disputed claims activity, benefit changes, expected health care cost inflation, seasonality patterns, maturity of lines of business, changes in membership and other factors. The following table provides a detail of the components of medical benefits payable: December 31, 2014 % of Total December 31, 2013 % of Total (In millions) IBNR $ 1,111.5 75% $ 690.1 72% Other medical benefits payable 372.3 25% 263.3 28% Total medical benefits payable $ 1,483.8 100% $ 953.4 100% The factors and assumptions that are used to develop our estimate of medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable inherently are subject to greater variability when there is more limited experience or information available to us. The ultimate claims payment amounts, patterns and trends for new products and geographic areas cannot be precisely predicted at their onset, since we, the providers and the members do not have experience in these products or geographic areas. Standard accepted actuarial methodologies, discussed above, would allow for this inherent variability. This can result in larger differences between the originally estimated medical benefits payable and the actual claims amounts paid. Conversely, during periods where our products and geographies are more stable and mature, we have more reliable claims payment patterns and trend experience. With more reliable data, we should be able to more closely estimate the ultimate claims payment amounts; therefore, we may experience smaller differences between our original estimate of medical benefits payable and the actual claim amounts paid. In developing our estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For the more recent months, which constitute the majority of the amount of the medical benefits payable, we estimate claims incurred by applying observed trend factors to the fixed fee PMPM costs for prior months, which costs have been estimated using completion factors, in order to estimate the PMPM costs for the most recent months. We validate our estimates of the most recent PMPM costs by comparing the most recent months' utilization levels to the utilization levels in prior months and actuarial techniques that incorporate a historical analysis of claim payments, including trends in cost of care provided and timeliness of submission and processing of claims. 79 Table of Contents Many aspects of the managed care business are not predictable. Medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy. Therefore, we must continually monitor our historical experience in determining our trend assumptions to reflect the ever-changing mix, needs and size of our membership. External factors such as government-mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, catastrophes and epidemics may impact medical cost trends. Other internal factors such as system conversions and claims processing changes may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends. We believe that the amount of medical benefits payable as of December 31, 2014 is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of that date; however, actual payments may differ from established estimates. If the completion factors we used in estimating our IBNR for the year ended December 31, 2014 were decreased by 1%, our net income would decrease by approximately $132.2 million. If the completion factors were increased by 1%, our net income would increase by approximately $129.2 million. After determining an estimate of the base liability for IBNR, we make an additional estimate, also using standard actuarial techniques, to account for adverse conditions that may cause actual claims to be higher than the estimated base reserve. We refer to this additional liability as the provision for moderately adverse conditions. Our estimate of the provision for moderately adverse conditions captures the potential adverse development from factors such as: our entry into new geographical markets; our provision of services to new populations such as the aged, blind and disabled; variations in utilization of benefits and increasing medical costs, including higher drug costs; changes in provider reimbursement arrangements; variations in claims processing speed and patterns, claims payment and the severity of claims; and health epidemics or outbreaks of disease such as the flu or enterovirus. We consider the base actuarial model liability and the provision for moderately adverse conditions as part of our overall assessment of our IBNR estimate to properly reflect the complexity of our business, the number of states in which we operate, and the need to account for different health care benefit packages among those states. Changes in medical benefits payable estimates are primarily the result of obtaining more complete claims information and medical expense trend data over time. Differences between actual experience and estimates used to establish the liability, which we refer to as prior period developments, are recorded in the period when such differences become known and have the effect of increasing or decreasing the reported medical benefits expense in such periods. As discussed below, the cumulative effect of prior year reserve development in 2014 and 2013 was an unfavorable $48.1 million and a favorable $3.0 million, respectively, however, we recognized unfavorable prior periods reserve development in three of four quarters in 2013, and in the first and second quarters of 2014. Based on the unfavorable prior period reserve development experience in these quarters, we refined certain of these assumptions, resulting in increased current period medical benefits costs incurred. The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of medical benefits payable: Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 (In millions) Balances as of beginning of period $ 953.4 $ 733.0 $ 744.8 Acquisitions 107.0 71.6 Medical benefits incurred related to: Current year 11,481.4 8,333.2 6,450.5 Prior year (26.2 ) (74.6 ) (146.6 ) Total 11,455.2 8,258.6 6,303.9 Medical benefits paid related to: Current year (10,089.6 ) (7,490.6 ) (5,754.9 ) Prior year (942.2 ) (619.2 ) (560.8 ) Total (11,031.8 ) (8,109.8 ) (6,315.7 ) Balances as of end of year $ 1,483.8 $ 953.4 $ 733.0 Medical benefits payable recorded at December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 developed favorably by approximately $26.2 million , $74.6 million and $146.6 million in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. A portion of the prior period development was 80 Table of Contents attributable to the release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions, which is included as part of the assumptions. The release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions was substantially offset by the provision for moderately adverse conditions established for claims incurred in the current year. Accordingly, the change in the amount of the incurred claims related to prior years in the Medical benefits payable does not directly correspond to an increase in net income recognized during the period. Medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was impacted by approximately $48.1 million of unfavorable prior year reserve development, mainly due to higher than expected medical services in our Medicaid and Medicare Health Plan segments that were not discernible until the impact became clearer over time as claim payments were processed, while 2013 and 2012 were impacted by approximately $3.0 million and $76.7 million , respectively, of favorable development related to prior years. The favorable development in 2013 was due mainly to the medical cost trend emerging favorably in our Medicaid segment due to lower utilization. The favorable development in 2012 was due to the medical cost trend emerging favorably, mostly in our Medicaid segment and to a lesser extent in our MA and PDP segments, primarily due to lower than projected utilization, partially offset by higher than expected medical services in Kentucky. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired. Goodwill recorded at December 31, 2014 was $263.2 million , which consisted of $152.8 million and $110.4 million attributable to our Medicaid and Medicare Advantage reporting segments, respectively. Goodwill recorded at December 31, 2013 was $236.8 million , which consisted of $126.8 million and $110.0 million attributable to our Medicaid and Medicare Advantage reporting segments, respectively. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it would be more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. Such events or circumstances could include a significant adverse change in business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition and the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit, among others. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, we compare an estimate of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, we compare the implied fair value of the applicable goodwill to its carrying value to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test based on our financial position and results of operations as of June 30 of each year, which generally coincides with the finalization of federal and state contract negotiations and our initial budgeting and planning process. The annual impairment tests are based on an evaluation of estimated future discounted cash flows. The estimated discounted cash flows are based on the best information available to us at the time, including supportable assumptions and projections we believe are reasonable. Our discounted cash flow estimates use discount rates that correspond to a weighted-average cost of capital consistent with a market-participant view. The discount rates are consistent with those used for investment decisions and take into account the operating plans and strategies of our operating segments. Certain other key assumptions utilized, including changes in membership, premium, health care costs, operating expenses, fees, assessments and taxes and effective tax rates, are based on estimates consistent with those utilized in our annual budgeting and planning process that we believe are reasonable. However, if we do not achieve the results reflected in the assumptions and estimates, our goodwill impairment evaluations could be adversely affected, and we may impair a portion of our goodwill, which would adversely affect our operating results in the period of impairment. Impairments, if any, would be classified as an operating expense. Based on the results of our annual impairment testing in 2014, we determined that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value and no goodwill impairment losses were recognized. Other intangible assets resulting from our previous acquisitions include provider networks, broker networks, trademarks, state contracts, non-compete agreements, licenses and permits. We amortize other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives ranging from approximately one to 15 years. These assets are allocated to reporting segments for impairment testing purposes. We review our other intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur, which may potentially affect the estimated useful life or recoverability of the remaining balances of our intangible assets. Such events and changes in circumstances would include significant changes in membership, state funding, federal and state government contracts and provider networks. Upon such an occurrence, recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. Identifiable cash flows are measured at the lowest level for which they are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. If these assets are determined to be impaired, the amount of impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value. 81 Table of Contents During 2014, we recognized approximately $24.1 million in impairment and other charges, approximately $18.0 million of which related to the partial impairment of certain intangible assets recorded in the 2012 acquisition of Easy Choice Health Plan, Inc. ( Easy Choice ). During the year, our Easy Choice MA health plan continued to underperform, mainly reflecting an inability to improve the medical cost structure to the degree that was previously estimated, and the inability to achieve certain administrative cost savings. As a result, we performed an updated assessment of the recoverability of these intangible assets. The current projections of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the Easy Choice health plan reflect a significant decline in the anticipated long-term profitability of this business relative to projections we completed in prior periods. The decline in projected profitability is resulting from the factors noted above, as well the continuing margin compression that is impacting the MA business as a whole. We compared the carrying values of the underlying intangible assets to the projected, undiscounted future net cash flows and determined that the undiscounted future net cash flows were insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets. We measured the fair values of these assets at June 30, 2014 using an income-based valuation approach, and decreased the carrying values of the intangible assets to the estimated fair values, which resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $18.0 million. We believe the assumptions used in the income approach, including the projected cash flows associated with the assets, as well as other key factors and assumptions, including the selection of an appropriate discount rate, were consistent with those that likely market place participants would experience when operating in the same market, with the same membership. The remaining charges for the quarter also include a charge for the full impairment of intangible assets associated the purchase of our Arizona MA plan after we concluded during 2014 to exit the Arizona MA market in 2015, and charges resulting from the resolution of certain matters related to the purchase price of our 2013 acquisitions. We were no longer able to recognize the latter charges as adjustments to acquired assets, since we were beyond the measurement period established in the accounting rules for business combinations.
