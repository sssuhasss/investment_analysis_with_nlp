ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BUSINESS OVERVIEW Northern Trust Corporation (Corporation) is a financial holding company that is a leading provider of asset servicing, fund administration, asset management, fiduciary and banking solutions for corporations, institutions, families and individuals worldwide. Northern Trust focuses on managing and servicing client assets through its two client-focused reporting segments: Corporate & Institutional Services (C&IS) and Wealth Management. Asset management and related services are provided to C&IS and Wealth Management clients primarily by the Asset Management business. The Corporation conducts business through various U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries, including The Northern Trust Company (Bank). The Corporation was originally formed as a holding company for the Bank in 1971. The Corporation has a network of offices in 19 U.S. states, Washington, D.C., and 23 international locations in Canada, Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region. Except where the context otherwise requires, the term Northern Trust refers to Northern Trust Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. FINANCIAL OVERVIEW Net income in 2017 totaled $1.20 billion , up $166.5 million or 16% , from $1.03 billion in 2016 . Earnings per diluted common share totaled $4.92 in 2017 compared to $4.32 in 2016 . Return on average common equity improved to 12.6% in 2017 from 11.9% in 2016 . Revenue increased 8% to $5.38 billion in 2017 from $4.96 billion in the prior year, driven by a 10% increase in trust, investment and other servicing fees and a 16% increase in net interest income, partially offset by a 35% decline in other operating income. Client assets under custody/administration (AUC/A) and under custody, a component of AUC/A, were up 26% and 20% , respectively, as of December 31, 2017 as compared to December 31, 2016 levels. Client assets under management were up 23% as of December 31, 2017 as compared to December 31, 2016 levels. As of December 31, 2017 , AUC/A increased to $10.72 trillion from $8.54 trillion in 2016 , including an increase of $568.1 billion related to the acquisition and integration of UBS Asset Management fund administration units in Luxembourg and Switzerland ( the UBS acquisition ). As of December 31, 2017 , client assets under custody increased to $8.08 trillion from $6.72 trillion , and included $4.94 trillion of global custody assets, up 24% from $3.97 trillion in 2016 . As of December 31, 2017 , client assets under management increased to $1.16 trillion from $942.4 billion in 2016 . Trust, investment and other servicing fees, which represent the largest component of total revenue, increased 10% to $3.43 billion , from $3.11 billion in 2016 , primarily due to favorable markets, new business, and revenue associated with the UBS acquisition. Foreign exchange trading income of $209.9 million decreased 11% from $236.6 million in 2016 , primarily resulting from lower volatility and client volumes. Other operating income was $157.5 million in 2017 , down 35% from $241.2 million in the prior year, primarily due to income recorded in the prior year from the sale of Visa Inc. Class B common shares partially offset by impairment charges associated with our leasing portfolio. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis in 2017 was $1.48 billion , an increase of $215.0 million , or 17% , from $1.26 billion in 2016 , due to higher levels of average earning assets and an increased net interest margin. The net interest margin on an FTE basis increased to 1.33% in 2017 from 1.18% in 2016 primarily due to an increase in short-term interest rates. The provision for credit losses in 2017 was a credit of $28.0 million , reflecting continued improvement in the credit quality of the Corporation s loan portfolio and reductions in outstanding loans and undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit. The provision for credit losses in 2016 was a credit of $26.0 million , which reflected improved credit quality across the portfolio. Loans and leases as of December 31, 2017 totaled $32.6 billion , down 4% from $33.8 billion in 2016 . Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $10.2 million , down from $15.2 million in 2016 . Nonperforming assets as of December 31, 2017 were $155.3 million , a decline from $165.4 million in 2016 . Noninterest expense totaled $3.77 billion in 2017 , up $298.7 million , or 9% , from $3.47 billion in the prior year, reflecting increased compensation, increased equipment and software expense, and increased outside services, including current-year severance-related charges, expense associated with the UBS acquisition, and a one-time employee cash bonus recorded in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The prior year included charges relating to certain securities lending litigation, contractual modifications associated with certain existing asset servicing clients, and severance and other personnel related charges. 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 35 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The provision for income taxes in 2017 totaled $434.9 million , representing an effective tax rate of 26.6% . The provision for income taxes in 2016 totaled $484.6 million , representing an effective tax rate of 31.9% . The current year includes a net benefit to the tax provision attributable to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, an increased income tax benefit derived from vesting of restricted stock units and stock option exercises, and Federal and State research tax credits related to the Corporation technology spend between 2013 and 2017, each of which resulted in a reduction of the effective tax rate. Northern Trust continued to maintain a strong capital position during 2017 , with all capital ratios exceeding those required for classification as well-capitalized under federal bank regulatory capital requirements. Total stockholders equity was $10.2 billion at year-end, up 5% from $9.8 billion in 2016 . During the year ended December 31, 2017 , Northern Trust increased its quarterly common stock dividend to $0.42 per share and repurchased 5.8 million shares of common stock, returning $895.6 million in capital to common stockholders, compared to $754.7 million in 2016 . CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Revenue Northern Trust generates the majority of its revenue from noninterest income that primarily consists of trust, investment and other servicing fees. Net interest income comprises the remainder of revenue and consists of interest income generated by earning assets, net of interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds. Revenue in 2017 was $5.38 billion , an increase of 8% from $4.96 billion in 2016 . Noninterest income represented 73% of total revenue in 2017 compared to 75% in 2016 , and totaled $3.95 billion , up 6% from $3.73 billion in 2016 . The current-year increase in noninterest income primarily reflected higher trust, investment and other servicing fees, including revenue associated with the UBS acquisition, partially offset by lower other operating income, primarily due to income recorded in the prior year from the sale of Visa Inc. Class B common shares partially offset by impairment charges associated with our leasing portfolio, and lower foreign exchange trading income. Trust, investment and other servicing fees totaled $3.43 billion in 2017 , up $326.2 million , or 10% , from $3.11 billion in 2016 , primarily due to favorable markets, new business, and revenue associated with the UBS acquisition of $21.1 million . Foreign exchange trading income in 2017 totaled $209.9 million , down $26.7 million , or 11% , compared with $236.6 million in 2016 , primarily resulting from lower volatility and client volumes. Other operating income was $157.5 million in 2017 , down 35% from $241.2 million in the prior year. The prior year included the sale of 1.1 million Visa Inc. Class B common shares, net of the valuation adjustment to existing swap agreements, for a net gain of $118.2 million , partially offset by impairment charges and the loss on sale related to the decision to exit a portion of a non-strategic loan and lease portfolio and impairment charges related to the residual value of certain aircraft and rail cars of $18.9 million . Net interest income on an FTE basis in 2017 was $1.48 billion , an increase of $215.0 million , or 17% , from $1.26 billion in 2016 , due to higher levels of average earning assets and an increased net interest margin. Average earning assets increased $4.1 billion , or 4% , in 2017 , reflecting higher levels of securities and short-term interest bearing deposits, partially offset by a decrease in loans and leases. The net interest margin on an FTE basis increased to 1.33% in 2017 from 1.18% in 2016 , primarily due to an increase in short-term interest rates.

Trust, investment and other servicing fees are based primarily on the market value of assets held in custody, managed and serviced; the volume of transactions; securities lending volume and spreads; and fees for other services rendered. Certain market value calculations on which fees are based are performed on a monthly or quarterly basis in arrears. Based on an analysis of historical trends and current asset and product mix, management estimates that a 10% rise or fall in overall equity markets would cause a corresponding increase or decrease in Northern Trust trust, investment and other servicing fees of approximately 3% and in total revenue of approximately 2%. For a more detailed discussion of 2017 trust, investment and other servicing fees, refer to the Reporting Segments and Related Information section. When considering the impact of markets on the Corporation results, the following tables present selected market indices and the percentage changes year over year.

For the purposes of disclosing AUC/A, to the extent that both custody and administration services are provided, the value of the assets is included only once. At December 31, 2017 , AUC/A were $10.72 trillion , up 26% from $8.54 trillion at December 31, 2016 . The increase in AUC/A primarily reflected favorable markets, client assets obtained in the UBS acquisition, net inflows, and the favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Assets under custody, a component of AUC/A, were $8.08 trillion at December 31, 2017 , up 20% from $6.72 trillion at December 31, 2016 , and included $4.94 trillion of global custody assets, compared to $3.97 trillion at December 31, 2016 . The increase in assets under custody primarily reflected favorable markets, net inflows, and the favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Assets under management totaled $1.16 trillion , up 23% from $942.4 billion at the end of 2016 . The increase primarily reflected the favorable impact of markets and net inflows. 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 37 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AUC/A by reporting segment were as follows: TABLE 6: ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY/ADMINISTRATION BY REPORTING SEGMENT DECEMBER 31, CHANGE ($ In Billions) 2017 2016 2015 2017 /2016 2016 /2015 Corporate & Institutional $ 10,066.8 $ 7,987.0 $ 7,279.7 26 % 10 % Wealth Management 655.8 554.3 517.3 18 7 Total Assets Under Custody/Administration $ 10,722.6 $ 8,541.3 $ 7,797.0 26 % 10 % Assets under custody by reporting segment were as follows: TABLE 7: ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY BY REPORTING SEGMENT DECEMBER 31, CHANGE FIVE-YEAR COMPOUND GROWTH RATE ($ In Billions) 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2017 /2016 2016 / 2015 Corporate & Institutional $ 7,439.1 $ 6,176.9 $ 5,565.8 $ 5,453.1 $ 5,079.7 20 % 11 % 11 % Wealth Management 645.5 543.6 506.3 515.7 496.0 19 7 8 Total Assets Under Custody $ 8,084.6 $ 6,720.5 $ 6,072.1 $ 5,968.8 $ 5,575.7 20 % 11 % 11 % Assets under custody were invested as follows: TABLE 8: ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY BY INVESTMENT TYPE DECEMBER 31, 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 Equities 47 % 46 % 44 % 45 % 47 % Fixed Income Securities 35 36 37 36 34 Cash and Other Assets 16 17 17 17 17 Securities Lending Collateral 2 1 2 2 2 Assets under management by reporting segment were as follows: TABLE 9: ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT BY REPORTING SEGMENT DECEMBER 31, CHANGE FIVE-YEAR COMPOUND GROWTH RATE ($ In Billions) 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2017 / 2016 2016 / 2015 Corporate & Institutional $ 871.2 $ 694.0 $ 648.0 $ 709.6 $ 662.7 26 % 7 % 9 % Wealth Management 289.8 248.4 227.3 224.5 221.8 17 9 8 Total Assets Under Management $ 1,161.0 $ 942.4 $ 875.3 $ 934.1 $ 884.5 23 % 8 % 9 % 38 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Assets under management were invested and managed as follows: TABLE 10: ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT BY INVESTMENT TYPE DECEMBER 31, 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 Equities 51 % 51 % 51 % 52 % 54 % Fixed Income Securities 16 17 17 17 17 Cash and Other Assets 19 20 20 18 17 Securities Lending Collateral 14 12 12 13 12 TABLE 11: ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT BY MANAGEMENT STYLE DECEMBER 31, 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 Index 46 % 47 % 47 % 49 % 51 % Active 41 40 40 39 43 Multi-Manager 5 5 4 6 4 Other 8 8 9 6 2 Foreign Exchange Trading Income Northern Trust provides foreign exchange services in the normal course of business as an integral part of its global custody services. Active management of currency positions, within conservative limits, also contributes to foreign exchange trading income. Foreign exchange trading income totaled $209.9 million in 2017 compared with $236.6 million in the prior year. The decrease of $26.7 million , or 11% , was primarily due to lower volatility and client volumes in 2017 . Treasury Management Fees Treasury management fees, generated from cash and treasury management products and services provided to clients, totaled $56.4 million in 2017 , down 10% from $62.8 million in 2016 , primarily due to lower transaction volumes. Security Commissions and Trading Income Security commissions and trading income is generated primarily from securities brokerage services provided by Northern Trust Securities, Inc., and totaled $89.6 million in 2017 , up 10% , or $8.2 million , from $81.4 million in 2016 , primarily due to higher core brokerage revenues. Other Operating Income The components of other operating income include: TABLE 12: OTHER OPERATING INCOME FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, CHANGE ($ In Millions) 2017 2016 2015 2017 / 2016 2016 / 2015 Loan Service Fees $ 50.7 $ 56.6 $ 59.1 (10 )% (4 )% Banking Service Fees 48.6 50.6 48.2 (4 ) 5 Other Income 58.2 134.0 139.8 (57 ) (4 ) Total Other Operating Income $ 157.5 $ 241.2 $ 247.1 (35 )% (2 )% Loan service fees totaled $50.7 million in 2017 , down $5.9 million or 10% , from $56.6 million in 2016 , primarily due to lower loan-related commitment fees in the current year. Other income totaled $58.2 million in 2017 , down $75.8 million or 57% , from $134.0 million in 2016 . The prior-year other income included the gain on the sale of 1.1 million Visa Inc. Class B common shares, net of the valuation adjustment to existing swap agreements, totaling $118.2 million , offset by impairment charges and the loss on sale related to the decision to exit a portion of a non-strategic loan and lease portfolio, as well as impairment charges related to the residual value of certain aircraft and rail cars of $18.9 million . 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 39 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Investment Security Losses, Net Net investment security losses totaled $1.6 million and $3.2 million in 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Losses in 2017 and 2016 include $0.2 million and $3.7 million of charges related to the other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) of certain Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) eligible held-to-maturity securities, respectively. NONINTEREST INCOME 2016 COMPARED WITH 2015 Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $3.11 billion in 2016 , up 4% from $2.98 billion in 2015 , primarily due to new business and lower money market mutual fund fee waivers, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates and markets. Foreign exchange trading income decreased 10% to $236.6 million in 2016 from $261.8 million in 2015 , attributable to lower client volumes in 2016 . Other operating income totaled $241.2 million in 2016 , a decrease of 2% from $247.1 million in 2015 . Other operating income in 2016 included the gain on the sale of 1.1 million Visa Inc. Class B common shares, net of the valuation adjustment to existing swap agreements, totaling $118.2 million , offset by impairment charges and the loss on sale related to the decision to exit a portion of a non-strategic loan and lease portfolio, as well as impairment charges related to the residual value of certain aircraft and rail cars of $18.9 million . Other income in 2015 included a $99.9 million net gain on the sale of 1.0 million Visa Class B common shares. Net investment security losses totaled $3.2 million and $0.3 million in 2016 and 2015 , respectively. There were $3.7 million of charges in 2016 related to the OTTI of certain CRA eligible held-to-maturity securities. There were no OTTI losses in 2015 . Net Interest Income Net interest income stated on an FTE basis is a non-generally-accepted-accounting-principle (GAAP) financial measure that facilitates the analysis of asset yields. Management believes an FTE presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest margins for comparative purposes. When adjusted to an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable, and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income. A reconciliation of net interest income on a GAAP basis to net interest income on an FTE basis is provided on page 86. An analysis of net interest income on an FTE basis, major balance sheet components impacting net interest income and related ratios are provided below.

Earning assets including federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell, interest-bearing due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with banks, Federal Reserve and other central bank deposits, securities, and loans and leases are financed by a large base of interest-bearing funds that include client deposits, short-term borrowings, senior notes and long-term debt. Earning assets also are funded by net noninterest-related funds, which include demand deposits, and stockholders equity, reduced by nonearning assets such as noninterest-bearing cash and due from banks, items in process of collection, and buildings and equipment. Net interest income is subject to variations in the level and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing funds and their relative sensitivity to interest rates. In addition, the levels of nonperforming assets and client compensating deposit balances used to pay for services impact net interest income. Net interest income in 2017 was $1.43 billion , up $194.3 million , or 16% , from $1.23 billion in 2016 . Net interest income on an FTE basis for 2017 was $1.48 billion , an increase of $215.0 million , or 17% , from $1.26 billion in 2016 , due to higher levels of average earning assets and an increased net interest margin. Average earning assets increased $4.1 billion , or 4% , to $111.2 billion from $107.0 billion in 2016 , primarily reflecting higher levels of securities and short-term interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by reductions in loans and leases. The net interest margin in 2017 was 1.29% , up from 1.15% in 2016 . The net interest margin on an FTE basis in 2017 was 1.33% , up from 1.18% in 2016 . Growth in average earning assets primarily reflected higher levels of Federal Reserve and other bank deposits and securities, partially offset by reductions in interest-bearing due from and deposits with banks and loans and leases. Federal Reserve and other bank deposits averaged $23.9 billion , an increase of $3.5 billion or 17% , from $20.4 billion in 2016 . Securities, inclusive of Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank stock and certain community development investments which are classified in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets, averaged $44.7 billion , an increase of $2.7 billion , or 6% , from $42.0 billion in 2016 . Interest-bearing due from and deposits with banks averaged $7.1 billion in 2017 , down $1.6 billion , or 18% , from $8.7 billion in 2016 . Loans and leases averaged $33.6 billion , a decrease of $478.3 million , or 1% , from $34.0 billion in 2016 . The increase in average earning assets was primarily funded by higher levels of interest-bearing deposits and short-term borrowings, partially offset by reductions of demand and other noninterest-bearing deposits. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $6.0 billion , or 9% , to $73.4 billion in 2017 from $67.4 billion in 2016 . Average short-term borrowings increased $359.0 million , or 6% , to $6.7 billion in 2017 from $6.3 billion in 2016 . Average demand and other noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $3.1 billion , or 12% , to $23.1 billion in 2017 from $26.2 billion in 2016 . Stockholders equity averaged $10.0 billion in 2017 , compared with $9.1 billion in 2016 . The increase of $895.3 million , or 10% , was attributable to current-year earnings, partially offset by the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the Corporation share repurchase program and dividend declarations. During the year ended December 31, 2017 , the Corporation increased its quarterly common stock dividend by 11% to $0.42 per share and repurchased 5.8 million shares, returning $895.6 million in capital to common stockholders, compared to $754.7 million in 2016 . Under the Corporation 2017 Capital Plan, which was reviewed without objection by the Federal Reserve, the Corporation may repurchase up to $454.6 million of common stock after December 31, 2017 , through June 2018. For additional analysis of average balances and interest rate changes affecting net interest income, refer to the Average Balance Sheets with Analysis of Net Interest Income included in Supplemental Item Selected Statistical and Supplemental Financial Data. NET INTEREST INCOME 2016 COMPARED WITH 2015 Net interest income on an FTE basis increased 15% to $1.26 billion in 2016 from $1.10 billion in 2015 , reflecting higher levels of earning assets and an increased net interest margin. The net interest margin on an FTE basis in 2016 was 1.18% , up from 1.07% in 2015 . The net interest margin on an FTE basis in 2015 reflects the impact of a $17.8 million impairment of the residual value of certain assets under leveraged lease agreements. Average earning assets increased $4.8 billion , or 5% , to $107.0 billion in 2016 from $102.2 billion in 2015 . Growth in average earning assets primarily reflected higher levels of securities and loans and leases, partially offset by a decrease in interest-bearing due from and deposits with banks. Stockholders equity averaged $9.1 billion and $8.6 billion in 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The increase in 2016 reflected retained earnings and the issuance of our Series D preferred stock, partially offset by the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the Corporation's share repurchase program and dividend declarations. Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses was a credit of $28.0 million in 2017 compared with a credit provision of $26.0 million in 2016 , and a credit provision of $43.0 million in 2015 .

The current year also included $12.0 million in compensation expense related to a one-time employee cash bonus recorded in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The increase in salary expense was driven by staff growth and base-pay adjustments. Staff on a full-time equivalent basis totaled approximately 18,100 at December 31, 2017 , up 6% from approximately 17,100 at December 31, 2016 . Employee Benefits Employee benefits expense totaled $319.9 million in 2017 , up $26.6 million , or 9% , from $293.3 million in 2016 reflecting increases in payroll taxes, medical expense, severance-related charges, expense associated with the UBS acquisition, and payroll taxes on a one-time employee cash bonus recorded in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The current year included $4.2 million in severance-related charges, compared to $1.5 million in the prior year. Outside Services Outside services expense totaled $668.4 million in 2017 , up $41.3 million , or 7% , from $627.1 million in 2016 , reflecting an increase in technical services, subcustodian expense, expense associated with the UBS acquisition, and severance-related charges.

Other Operating Expense Other operating expense in 2017 totaled $331.6 million , down $32.8 million , or 9% , from $364.4 million in 2016 . The components of other operating expense are as follows: TABLE 15: OTHER OPERATING EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, CHANGE ($ In Millions) 2017 2016 2015 2017 / 2016 2016 / 2015 Business Promotion $ 95.4 $ 83.6 $ 85.1 14 % (2 )% FDIC Insurance Premiums 34.7 31.7 25.2 9 26 Staff Related 42.8 43.0 40.5 (1 ) 6 Other Intangibles Amortization 11.4 8.8 10.9 30 (19 ) Other Expenses 147.3 197.3 166.3 (25 ) 19 Total Other Operating Expense $ 331.6 $ 364.4 $ 328.0 (9 )% 11 % Business promotion expense increased $11.8 million , or 14% compared to the prior year, primarily related to higher costs associated with the Northern Trust-sponsored PGA TOUR golf tournament.

Other expenses in 2016 included charges in connection with an agreement to settle certain securities lending litigation of $50.0 million and charges related to contractual modifications associated with existing C&IS clients of $18.6 million . Other expenses in in the current year reflect higher charges associated with account servicing activities, expense associated with supplemental compensation plans, costs associated with the UBS acquisition, and increases in various other operating expense categories. NONINTEREST EXPENSE 2016 COMPARED WITH 2015 Noninterest expense in 2016 totaled $3.47 billion , up 6% from $3.28 billion in 2015 . Results for 2016 included charges relating to certain securities lending litigation of $50.0 million , contractual modifications associated with certain existing asset servicing clients of $18.6 million , and severance and other personnel related charges of $17.5 million . Results for 2015 included a $45.8 million charge related to voluntary cash contributions to certain constant dollar NAV funds. Compensation expense increased 7% to $1.54 billion in 2016 from $1.44 billion in 2015 , reflecting severance-related charges of $13.0 million as well as higher salary expenses and performance-based incentive compensation. Employee benefits expense totaled $293.3 million in 2016 , up 3% from $285.3 million in 2015 , primarily reflecting higher medical expense and payroll taxes, partially offset by a decrease in retirement-related expense. Outside services expense totaled $627.1 million in 2016 , up 5% from $595.7 million in 2015 , primarily reflecting increased technical services and consulting services, partially offset by a reduction in third-party advisory fees. Equipment and software expense increased 3% to $467.4 million in 2016 compared to $454.8 million in 2015 , primarily related to increased software amortization, partially offset by a decrease in software dispositions. Occupancy expense for 2016 was $177.4 million , up 2% from $173.5 million in 2015 , primarily related to an early termination penalty recorded in 2016 and higher rent expense. Other operating expense totaled $364.4 million in 2016 , up 11% from $328.0 million in 2015 , reflecting charges relating to certain securities lending litigation of $50.0 million and contractual modifications associated with certain existing asset servicing clients of $18.6 million , as well as increases in FDIC deposit protection expense and other miscellaneous expense categories. Other operating expense in 2015 included a $45.8 million charge related to voluntary cash contributions to certain constant dollar NAV funds. Provision for Income Taxes Provisions for income tax and effective tax rates are impacted by levels of pre-tax income, tax rates, and the impact of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries whose earnings are reinvested indefinitely outside the United States, as well as nonrecurring items such as the resolution of tax matters and changes in income tax rates and tax laws. The 2017 provision for income taxes was $434.9 million , representing an effective rate of 26.6% . This compares with a provision for income taxes of $484.6 million and an effective rate of 31.9% in 2016 . 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 43 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The current-year tax provision includes a net benefit attributable to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of $53.1 million as outlined below, an increased income tax benefit derived from the vesting of restricted stock units and stock option exercises, and Federal and State research tax credits of $20.9 million , $17.6 million of which were recognized related to the Corporation technology spend between 2013 and 2016, each resulting in a reduction of the effective tax rate. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. It also requires companies to pay a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred. At December 31, 2017 , Northern Trust has made a reasonable estimate as to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as follows: TABLE 16: IMPACT OF TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (In Millions) 2017 Federal Taxes on Mandatory Deemed Repatriation $ 150.0 Impact Related to Federal Deferred Taxes (210.0 ) Other Adjustments 6.9 Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes $ (53.1 ) The amounts related to federal taxes on mandatory deemed repatriation and certain other adjustments are considered provisional as of December 31, 2017 , as Northern Trust did not have the necessary information available to complete its accounting for the change in tax law and as such has provided a reasonable estimate. Northern Trust will continue to refine the related calculations as additional analyses are completed. In addition, these provisional amounts may require adjustment based on an evolving understanding of the new tax law and the issuance of guidance by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). As a result of the changes in U.S. tax law, Northern Trust expects its effective tax rate to be approximately 23% to 24% in 2018. The income tax provision for 2017 reflects reductions totaling $50.0 million related to certain non-U.S. subsidiaries whose earnings are being reinvested indefinitely outside of the United States. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act being enacted on December 22, 2017, these earnings and the earnings from prior years which have been reinvested indefinitely outside of the United States are deemed to have been repatriated to the United States and subject to a repatriation tax. Northern Trust repatriation tax has been estimated to be $150.0 million and recorded as an income tax provision. The repatriation tax will be paid in installments over eight years as permitted under U.S. income tax laws. The income tax provision of $484.6 million for 2016 reflects reductions totaling $50.1 million related to certain non-U.S. subsidiaries whose earnings were reinvested indefinitely outside of the United States. The 2015 income tax provision of $491.2 million represented an effective tax rate of 33.5% , and reflects reductions of $43.6 million related to non-U.S. subsidiaries whose earnings were reinvested indefinitely outside the United States. REPORTING SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION Northern Trust is organized around its two client-focused reporting segments: C&IS and Wealth Management. Asset management and related services are provided to C&IS and Wealth Management clients primarily by the Asset Management business. The revenue and expenses of Asset Management and certain other support functions are allocated fully to C&IS and Wealth Management. Income and expense associated with the Corporation and the Bank wholesale funding activities and investment portfolios, as well as certain corporate-based expense, executive level compensation and nonrecurring items are not allocated to C&IS and Wealth Management, and are reported in Northern Trust third reporting segment, Treasury and Other, in the following pages. C&IS and Wealth Management results are presented to promote a greater understanding of their financial performance. The information, presented on an internal management-reporting basis, is derived from internal accounting systems that support Northern Trust strategic objectives and management structure. Management has developed accounting systems to allocate revenue and expense related to each segment. These systems incorporate processes for allocating assets, liabilities and equity, and the applicable interest income and expense. Equity is allocated to the reporting segments based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, risk, regulatory considerations, and internal metrics. Allocations of capital and certain corporate expense may not be representative of levels that would be required if the segments were independent entities. The accounting policies used for management reporting are consistent with those described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Transfers of income and expense items are recorded at cost; there is no consolidated profit or loss on 44 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS sales or transfers between reporting segments.

The 3% increase in C&IS net income in 2016 primarily resulted from higher net interest income and trust, investment and other servicing fees, partially offset by higher noninterest expense and provision for credit losses and lower foreign exchange trading income and other noninterest income. C&IS Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees C&IS trust, investment and other servicing fees are primarily attributable to services related to custody, fund administration, investment management, and securities lending. Custody and fund administration fees are driven primarily by values of client assets under custody/administration, transaction volumes, and number of accounts. The asset values used to calculate these fees vary depending on the individual fee arrangements negotiated with each client. Custody fees related to asset values are client specific and are priced based on quarter-end or month-end values, values at the beginning of each quarter or average values for a month or quarter. The fund administration fees that are asset-value-related are priced using month-end, quarter-end, or average daily balances. Investment management fees, which are based generally on client assets under management, are based primarily on market values throughout a period. Securities lending revenue is affected by market values; the demand for securities to be lent, which drives volumes; and the interest rate spread earned on the investment of cash deposited by investment firms as collateral for securities they have borrowed. The other services fee category in C&IS includes such products as investment risk and analytical services, benefit payments, and other services. Revenue from these products is based generally on the volume of services provided or a fixed fee. Provided below are the components of C&IS trust, investment and other servicing fees.

Fees from investment management increased $31.7 million , or 9% , from 2016 to 2017 due to higher market levels. Securities lending revenue decreased 1% from 2016 to 2017 due to lower spreads, partially offset by higher loan volumes. C&IS other trust, investment and servicing fees increased $6.5 million , or 5% , from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to an increase in investment risk and analytical services. C&IS trust, investment, and other servicing fees totaled $1.79 billion in 2016 , an increase of $90.9 million or 5% , from $1.70 billion in 2015 , primarily reflecting new 46 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS business and lower money market mutual fund fee waivers, partially offset by lower equity markets and the unfavorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates.

Assets under management increased 26% to $871.2 billion at December 31, 2017 , from $694.0 billion at December 31, 2016 . Cash and other assets deposited by investment firms as collateral for securities borrowed from custody clients are managed by Northern Trust and are included in assets under custody and under management. This securities lending collateral totaled $167.5 billion and $111.8 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. C&IS Foreign Exchange Trading Income Foreign exchange trading income totaled $197.9 million in 2017 , a $26.5 million , or 12% , decrease from $224.4 million in 2016 . The decrease is attributable to lower volatility and client volumes. Foreign exchange trading income in 2016 of $224.4 million decreased $25.0 million , or 10% , from $249.4 million in 2015 , due to lower client volumes as compared to 2015 . C&IS Other Noninterest Income Other noninterest income for 2017 totaled $176.1 million , up $29.1 million , or 20% , from $147.0 million in 2016 , which in turn was down $23.5 million , or 14% , from $170.5 million in 2015 . The year-over-year variances from 2015 - 2017 were primarily due to impairment charges and loss on sales related to the decision to exit a portion of a non-strategic loans and leases portfolio in 2016 . C&IS Net Interest Income Net interest income on an FTE basis increased $168.8 million , or 30% , in 2017 to $733.8 million from $565.0 million in 2016 , primarily attributable to an increase in the net interest margin and average earning assets. Net interest margin on an FTE basis increased to 0.99% from 0.81% , primarily reflecting higher yields on earning assets. Average earning assets totaled $74.3 billion , an increase of $4.6 billion , or 7% , from $69.7 billion in the prior year. The earning assets in C&IS consisted primarily of intercompany assets and loans and leases. Funding sources were primarily comprised of non-U.S. custody-related interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $53.8 billion in 2017 , up from $46.6 billion in 2016 . Net interest income on an FTE basis increased $150.6 million or 36% , in 2016 to $565.0 million from $414.4 million in 2015 , primarily attributable to an increase in the net interest margin and average earning assets. Results from 2015 included a $17.8 million charge related to the residual value of certain aircraft under leveraged lease agreements. C&IS Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses was $3.4 million for 2017 , compared to a provision of $1.9 million in 2016 , and a provision credit of $22.6 million in 2015 . The 2017 provision reflected an increase to a specific reserve in the commercial portfolio which was partially charged-off during the year, partially offset by improved credit quality across the portfolio. The 2016 provision reflected an increase to a specific reserve in the commercial portfolio that was charged-off during the prior year, partially offset by improved credit quality across the portfolio. The provision credit in 2015 primarily reflected improved credit quality across the portfolio coupled with the adoption of a change in estimation methodology for inherent losses. 48 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS C&IS Noninterest Expense Total C&IS noninterest expense, which includes the direct expense of the reporting segment, indirect expense allocations for product and operating support, and indirect expense allocations for certain corporate support services, totaled $2.19 billion in 2017 , an increase of $182.3 million , or 9% , from $2.01 billion in 2016 . The increase was primarily due to higher indirect expense allocations, compensation expense, severance-related charges of $25.9 million , higher expense associated with the UBS acquisition of $24.2 million , and higher outside services expense, partially offset by lower other operating expenses. Noninterest expense in 2016 included charges relating to certain securities lending litigation of $50.0 million , charges related to contractual modifications associated with existing C&IS clients of $18.6 million , and severance and other personnel related charges of $7.4 million . Noninterest expense for 2016 increased $155.8 million , or 8% , from $1.86 billion in 2015 . The increase was primarily due to higher indirect expense allocations, other operating expenses, and compensation expense in 2016 .

Wealth Management net income increased 15% in 2017 , primarily reflecting higher trust, investment and other servicing fees and net interest income and, partially offset by higher noninterest expense and a higher provision for income taxes. The 13% increase in Wealth Management net income in 2016 from 2015 is primarily attributable to higher net interest income and trust, investment and other servicing fees, partially offset by a higher provision for income taxes and higher noninterest expense. 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 49 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Wealth Management Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees Provided below is a summary of Wealth Management trust, investment and other servicing fees and assets under custody and under management.

Global Family Office provides specialized asset management, investment consulting, global custody, fiduciary, and private banking services to ultra-wealthy domestic and international clients. Wealth Management fee income is calculated primarily based on market values. Wealth Management trust, investment and other servicing fees were $1.45 billion in 2017 , up $129.4 million , or 10% , from $1.32 billion in 2016 , which in turn was up $36.7 million , or 3% , from $1.28 billion in 2015 . The results in 2017 benefited from favorable markets and new business. The 3% increase in trust, investment and other servicing fees in 2016 compared to 2015 was attributable to lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. Wealth Management money market mutual fund fee waivers totaled $6.2 million and $60.4 million in 2016 and 2015 , respectively. At December 31, 2017 , assets under custody in Wealth Management were $645.5 billion compared with $543.6 billion at December 31, 2016 . Assets under management were $289.8 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to $248.4 billion at the previous year end. 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 51 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Wealth Management Foreign Exchange Trading Income Foreign exchange trading income totaled $3.1 million in 2017 , a $5.5 million , or 64% , decrease from $8.6 million in 2016 . The decrease is attributable to lower volatility and client volumes. Foreign exchange trading income in 2016 decreased $3.8 million , or 32% , as compared to 2015 , reflecting lower client volumes in 2016 . Wealth Management Other Noninterest Income Other noninterest income for 2017 totaled $103.9 million , a decrease of $1.8 million , or 2% , from $105.7 million in 2016 , due to decreases in banking fees and credit-related service charges. Other noninterest income in 2016 decreased $6.1 million , or 6% , as compared to 2015 , primarily reflecting lower security commissions and trading income. Wealth Management Net Interest Income Net interest income on an FTE basis was $736.2 million for 2017 , up $84.8 million , or 13% , from $651.4 million in 2016 , primarily attributable to an increase in the net interest margin. Net interest margin on an FTE basis increased to 2.80% from 2.48% , reflecting higher yields on earning assets. Average earning assets totaled $26.3 billion in the current year and prior year. Net interest income on an FTE basis in 2016 increased $83.3 million , or 15% , from 2015 and the net interest margin on an FTE basis in 2016 of 2.48% increased from the 2015 margin of 2.29% . The higher net interest margin in 2016 as compared to 2015 was attributable to higher yields on earning assets. Earning assets and funding sources in 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 were primarily comprised of loans and domestic interest-bearing deposits. Wealth Management Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses was a credit of $31.4 million for 2017 , compared to a provision credit of $27.9 million in 2016 , and a provision credit of $20.4 million in 2015 . The 2017 provision credit was primarily driven by continued improvement in the credit quality of the commercial real estate and residential real estate portfolios, partially offset by charge offs in the current year. The 2016 provision credit was primarily driven by continued improvement in the credit quality of the residential real estate and private client portfolios. The 2015 provision credit primarily reflected improved credit quality of commercial real estate and residential real estate loan classes coupled with the adoption of a change in estimation methodology for inherent losses. Wealth Management Noninterest Expense Total noninterest expense, which includes the direct expense of the reporting segment, indirect expense allocations for product and operating support, and indirect expense allocations for certain corporate support services, totaled $1.41 billion in 2017 , an increase of $90.0 million , or 7% , from $1.32 billion in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher indirect expense allocations, severance-related charges of $19.5 million , compensation expense, and outside services expense in the current year. Noninterest expense for 2016 increased $23.4 million , or 2% , from $1.29 billion in 2015 . The increase was primarily due to higher compensation expense and indirect expense allocations in 2016 . 52 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Treasury and Other Treasury and Other includes income and expense associated with the wholesale funding activities and the investment portfolios of the Corporation and the Bank. Treasury and Other also includes certain corporate-based expense, executive level compensation and nonrecurring items not allocated to the reporting segments. The following table summarizes the results of operations of Treasury and Other for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 on a management-reporting basis.

Treasury and Other noninterest income in 2017 was $30.8 million compared to $133.1 million in 2016 . The decrease primarily reflects a decrease in other operating income, a component of other noninterest income, due to a prior-year gain on the sale of 1.1 million Visa Class B common shares. Treasury and Other net interest income on an FTE basis in 2017 was $5.0 million , down $38.6 million , or 89% , from $43.6 million in 2016 . The decrease reflected a decline in the net interest margin and lower levels of earning assets. Net interest income on an FTE basis in 2016 decreased $69.3 million , or 61% , to $43.6 million from $112.9 million in 2015 . The decrease reflected a decline in the net interest margin, partially offset by higher levels of earning assets. Treasury and Other noninterest expense in 2017 equaled $169.6 million , up $26.4 million , or 18% , from $143.2 million in 2016 . The increase is primarily attributable to higher general overhead costs, including compensation and equipment and software expense, partially offset by an increase in indirect expense allocations to C&IS and Wealth Management. The benefit from income taxes was $146.0 million in 2017 compared to a benefit of $4.3 million in the prior year, primarily due to lower income before income taxes, the net benefit attributable to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of $53.1 million , an increase in the excess tax benefit related to share-based compensation, and Federal and State research tax credits of $17.6 million related to the Corporation technology spend between 2013 and 2016 and recorded in 2017 . Asset Management Asset Management, through the Corporation various subsidiaries, supports the C&IS and Wealth Management reporting segments by providing a broad range of asset management and related services and other products to clients around the world. Investment solutions are delivered through separately managed accounts, bank common and collective funds, registered investment companies, exchange traded funds, non-U.S. collective investment funds, and unregistered private investment funds. Asset Management capabilities include active, passive and engineered equity; active and passive fixed income; cash management; alternative asset classes (such as private equity and hedge funds of funds); and multi-manager advisory services and products. Asset Management activities also include overlay services and other risk management services. Asset Management operates internationally through subsidiaries and distribution arrangements and its revenue and expense are allocated fully to C&IS and Wealth Management. 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 53 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS At December 31, 2017 , Northern Trust managed $1.16 trillion in assets for personal and institutional clients, including $871.2 billion for C&IS clients and $289.8 billion for Wealth Management clients.

The remaining portfolio was composed of corporate notes, asset-backed securities, negotiable certificates of deposit, obligations of states and political subdivisions, auction rate securities and other securities, of which as a percentage of the total securities portfolio, 8% were rated double-A, 3% were rated below double-A, and 10% were not rated by Moody Investors Service or Standard and Poor's (primarily negotiable certificates of deposits of banks and non-U.S. sovereign securities whose long-term ratings are at least A). At December 31, 2017 , 29% of corporate debt was rated triple-A, 31% was rated double-A, and 40% was rated below double-A or not rated. Securities classified as other asset-backed at December 31, 2017 had average lives of less than 5 years, and 100% were rated triple-A. Unrealized losses within the investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2017 were $249.4 million as compared to $176.0 million at December 31, 2016 , primarily reflecting higher market rates since purchase; 36% of the corporate debt portfolio is backed by guarantees provided by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental entities. There were $0.2 million and $3.7 million of losses recognized in 2017 and 2016 , respectively, in connection with the write-down of CRA securities determined to be OTTI. There were no OTTI losses recognized in 2015 . Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized financings and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. To minimize any potential credit risk associated with these transactions, the fair value of the securities purchased or sold is monitored, limits are set on exposure with counterparties, and the financial condition of counterparties is regularly assessed. It is Northern Trust policy to take possession, either directly or via third-party custodians, of securities purchased under agreements to resell. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are held by the counterparty until the repurchase. 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 55 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Loans and Leases During 2017, the Corporation implemented a change in the classification of certain loans and leases to enhance the consistency of its reporting across various regulatory regimes. As a result, the prior-period loan and lease balances below have been adjusted to conform with current-period presentation. The adjustments generally reflected reclassification of loans and leases from the commercial and institutional class to the residential real estate class. There was no impact on total loans and leases previously reported. The following table presents the amounts outstanding of loans and leases by segment and class as of December 31, 2017 and the preceding four year-ends.

Residential real estate loans totaled $7.2 billion at December 31, 2017 , or 22% of total U.S. loans, compared with $8.1 billion , or 24% of total U.S. loans, at December 31, 2016 . All residential real estate loans are underwritten utilizing Northern Trust credit policies, which do not support the origination of loan types generally considered to be of high risk in nature, such as option ARM loans, subprime loans, loans with initial teaser rates, and loans with excessively high loan-to-value ratios. Residential real estate loans consist of traditional first lien mortgages and equity credit lines that generally require a loan-to-collateral value of no more than 65% to 80% at inception. Appraisals of supporting collateral for residential real estate loans are obtained upon refinancing or default or when otherwise considered warranted. Residential real estate collateral appraisals are performed and reviewed by independent third parties. Of the total $7.2 billion in residential real estate loans at December 31, 2017 , $1.9 billion were in Florida, $1.4 billion were in the greater Chicago area, and $1.4 billion were in California, with the remainder distributed throughout the other geographic regions within the United States served by Northern Trust. Legally binding commitments to extend residential real estate credit, which are primarily equity credit lines, totaled $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Commercial Real Estate In managing its credit exposure, management has defined a commercial real estate loan as one where: (1) the borrower principal business activity is the acquisition or the development of real estate for commercial purposes; (2) the principal collateral is real estate held for commercial purposes, and loan repayment is expected to flow from the operation of the property; or (3) the loan repayment is expected to flow from the sale or refinance of real estate as a normal and ongoing part of the business. Unsecured lines of credit to firms or individuals engaged in commercial real estate endeavors are included without regard to the use of loan proceeds. The commercial real estate portfolio consists of commercial mortgages and construction, acquisition and development loans extended primarily to investors well known to Northern Trust. Underwriting standards generally reflect conservative loan-to-value ratios and debt service coverage requirements. Recourse to owners through guarantees also is commonly required. Commercial mortgage financing is provided for the acquisition or refinancing of income-producing properties. Cash flows from the properties generally are sufficient to amortize the loan. These loans are primarily located in the Illinois , 56 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS California , Florida , Texas , and Arizona markets. Construction, acquisition and development loans provide financing for commercial real estate prior to rental income stabilization. The intent is generally that the borrower will sell the project or refinance the loan through a commercial mortgage with Northern Trust or another financial institution upon completion. The table below provides additional detail regarding commercial real estate loan types: TABLE 31: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS DECEMBER 31, ($ In Millions) 2017 2016 Commercial Mortgages: Office $ 825.2 $ 866.1 Apartment/Multi-family 623.3 784.8 Retail 631.1 698.1 Industrial / Warehouse 311.1 359.7 Other 445.6 457.6 Total Commercial Mortgages 2,836.3 3,166.3 Construction, Acquisition and Development Loans 350.8 445.0 Single Family Investment 164.8 179.6 Other Commercial Real Estate Related 130.8 211.6 Total Commercial Real Estate Loans $ 3,482.7 $ 4,002.5 At December 31, 2017 , legally binding commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit to commercial real estate borrowers totaled $312.5 million and $13.8 million , respectively. At December 31, 2016 , legally binding commitments and standby letters of credit totaled $546.1 million and $15.7 million , respectively. 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 57 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Nonperforming Assets and 90 Days Past Due Loans During 2017, the Corporation implemented a change in the classification of certain nonperforming loans and leases to enhance the consistency of its reporting across various regulatory regimes. As a result, the prior-period balances below have been adjusted to conform with current-period presentation. These adjustments generally reflect reclassification of nonperforming loans and leases from commercial and institutional class to the residential real estate class. There was no impact on total nonperforming loans and leases previously reported. Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and leases and other real estate owned (OREO). OREO is comprised of commercial and residential properties acquired in partial or total satisfaction of loans. Loans that are delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing interest can fluctuate widely at any reporting period based on the timing of cash collections, renegotiations and renewals. The following table presents nonperforming assets and loans that were delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing at December 31, 2017 and each of the prior four year-ends.

Changes in the level of nonperforming assets may be indicative of changes in the credit quality of one or more loan classes. Changes in credit quality impact the allowance for credit losses through the resultant adjustment of the specific allowance and of the qualitative factors used in the determination of the inherent allowance levels within the allowance for credit losses. Allowance and Provision for Credit Losses During 2017, the Corporation implemented a change in the classification of certain loans and leases to enhance the consistency of its reporting across various regulatory regimes. The previously reported allowance for credit losses remains unadjusted, as the impact of the reclassification on the allowance was immaterial.

The following table shows the specific portion of the allowance and the allocated inherent portion of the allowance and its components by loan category at December 31, 2017 , and at each of the prior four year-ends.

At December 31, 2017 , the specific allowance component amounted to $5.4 million compared with $2.1 million at the end of 2016 . The $3.3 million increase is primarily attributable to additional allowances provided for new nonperforming loans, partially offset by charge-offs and pay-offs. 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 59 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The decrease in the specific component of the allowance from $3.1 million in 2015 to $2.1 million in 2016 was primarily attributable to charge-offs and pay-offs, partially offset by additional allowances provided for new nonperforming loans. Inherent Component of the Allowance: The inherent component of the allowance addresses exposure relating to probable but unidentified credit-related losses. The inherent component of the allowance also covers the credit exposure associated with undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit. To estimate the allowance for credit losses on these instruments, management uses conversion rates to determine the estimated amount that will be drawn and assigns an allowance factor determined in accordance with the methodology utilized for outstanding loans. The inherent portion of the allowance decreased $41.5 million to $148.4 million at December 31, 2017 , compared with $189.9 million at December 31, 2016 , which decreased $40.3 million from $230.2 million at December 31, 2015 . The decrease in 2017 was primarily driven by continued improvement in the credit quality of the commercial real estate and residential real estate portfolios. The decrease in 2016 was primarily driven by continued improvement in the credit quality of the residential real estate and private client portfolios. Overall Allowance: The evaluation of the specific component and the inherent component above resulted in a total allowance for credit losses of $153.8 million at December 31, 2017 , compared with $192.0 million at the end of 2016 . The allowance of $131.2 million assigned to loans and leases, as a percentage of total loans and leases, was 0.40% at December 31, 2017 , down from a $161.0 million allowance, representing 0.48% of total loans and leases, at December 31, 2016 . Allowances assigned to undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit totaled $22.6 million and $31.0 million at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , respectively, and are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Provision: The provision for credit losses was a credit of $28.0 million and net charge-offs totaled $10.2 million in 2017 . This compares with a credit provision of $26.0 million and net charge-offs of $15.2 million in 2016 , and a $43.0 million credit provision and net charge-offs of $19.5 million in 2015 . Impaired Loans A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when its terms have been modified as a concession resulting from the debtor financial difficulties, referred to as a troubled debt restructuring. As of December 31, 2017 , impaired loans totaled $139.8 million and included $98.4 million of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings as compared to total impaired loans of $156.1 million at December 31, 2016 , which included $127.6 million of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings. Impaired loans had $5.4 million and $2.1 million of the allowance for credit losses allocated to them at December 31, 2017 , and December 31, 2016 , respectively. Impaired loans are measured based upon the loan market price, the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan effective interest rate, or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. If the loan valuation is less than the recorded value of the loan, dependent upon the level of certainty of loss, either a specific allowance is established or a charge-off is recorded for the difference. Smaller balance (individually less than $1 million as of December 31, 2017 ) homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment and excluded from impaired loan disclosures as allowed under applicable accounting standards. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The use of estimates and assumptions is required in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and actual results could differ from those estimates. The SEC has issued guidance relating to the disclosure of critical accounting estimates. Critical accounting estimates are those that require management to make subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Changes that may be required in the underlying assumptions or estimates in these areas could have a material impact on Northern Trust future financial condition and results of operations. For Northern Trust, accounting estimates that are viewed as critical are those relating to the allowance for credit losses and pension plan accounting. Management has discussed the development and selection of each critical accounting estimate with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (Audit Committee). 60 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses represents management estimate of probable losses which have been incurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. The loan and lease portfolio and other lending-related credit exposures are regularly reviewed to evaluate the level of the allowance for credit losses. In determining an appropriate allowance level, Northern Trust evaluates the allowance necessary for impaired loans and lending-related commitments and also estimates losses inherent in other lending-related credit exposures. The allowance for credit losses consists of the following components: Specific Allowance: The specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lending-related commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows, collateral value, and other factors that may impact the borrower ability to pay. For impaired loans where the amount of specific allowance, if any, is determined based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral, third-party appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management. These appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect management judgment as to the realizable value of the collateral. Inherent Allowance: The inherent allowance estimation methodology is based on internally developed loss data specific to the Northern Trust loan and lease portfolio. The estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustment framework segregate the loan and lease portfolio into segments. For each segment, the probability of default and the loss given default are applied to the total exposure at default to determine a quantitative inherent allowance. The estimated allowance is reviewed by the Loan Loss Reserve Committee within a qualitative adjustment framework to determine an appropriate adjustment to the quantitative inherent allowance for each segment of the loan portfolio. In determining the appropriate adjustment, management applies judgment by assessing internal risk factors, potential limitations in the quantitative methodology and environmental factors that are not contemplated in the quantitative methodology. The Loan Loss Reserve Committee is comprised of representatives from Credit Risk Management, the reporting segments and Corporate Finance. The quarterly analysis of the specific and inherent allowance components and the control process maintained by Credit Risk Management and the lending staff are the principal methods relied upon by management for the timely identification of, and adjustment for, changes in estimated credit loss levels. In addition to Northern Trust own experience, management also considers regulatory guidance. Control processes and analyses employed to determine an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are reviewed on at least an annual basis and modified as considered appropriate. Loans, leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for credit losses. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Determinations as to whether loan balances for which the collectability is in question are charged-off or a specific reserve is established based on management assessment as to the level of certainty regarding the amount of loss. The provision for credit losses, which is charged to income, is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level deemed to be appropriate through the above process. Actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision for credit losses may be either greater than or less than actual net charge-offs. Management estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption. Management evaluates numerous variables, many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates, in determining an appropriate allowance level. Due to the inherent imprecision in accounting estimates, other estimates or assumptions could reasonably have been used in 2017 and changes in estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Additionally, as an integral part of their examination process, various federal and state regulatory agencies also review the allowance for credit losses. These agencies may require that certain loan balances be classified differently or charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. However, management believes that the allowance for credit losses adequately addresses these uncertainties and has been established at an appropriate level to cover probable losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 61 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Pension Plan Accounting Northern Trust maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all U.S. employees (the Qualified Plan) and a U.S. noncontributory supplemental pension plan (the Nonqualified Plan). Certain European-based employees also retain benefits in local defined benefit pension plans, of which the majority are closed to new employees and to future benefit accruals. Measuring cost and reporting liabilities resulting from defined benefit pension plans requires the use of several assumptions regarding future interest rates, asset returns, compensation increases, mortality rates, and other actuarially-based projections relating to the plans. Due to the long-term nature of this obligation and the estimates that are required to be made, the assumptions used in determining the periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation are closely monitored and reviewed annually for adjustments that may be required. Pension accounting guidance requires that differences between estimates and actual experience be recognized as other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. The differences are amortized into net periodic pension expense from accumulated other comprehensive income over the future working lifetime of eligible participants. As a result, differences between the estimates made in the calculation of periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation and actual experience affect stockholders equity in the period in which they occur but continue to be recognized as expense systematically and gradually over subsequent periods. Northern Trust recognizes the significant impact that these pension-related assumptions have on the determination of the pension obligations and related expense and has established procedures for monitoring and setting these assumptions each year. These procedures include an annual review of actual demographic and investment experience with the pension plans actuaries. In addition to actual experience, adjustments to these assumptions consider observable yields on fixed income securities, known compensation trends and policies, as well as economic conditions and investment strategies that may impact the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets. In determining the pension expense for the U.S. plans in 2017 , Northern Trust utilized a discount rate of 4.46% for both the Qualified Plan and the Nonqualified Plan. The rate of increase in the compensation level is based on a graded schedule from 9.00% to 2.50% that averaged 4.39% . The expected long-term rate of return on Qualified Plan assets was 6.75% . In evaluating possible revisions to pension-related assumptions for the U.S. plans as of Northern Trust December 31, 2017 measurement date, the following were considered: Discount Rate: Northern Trust estimates the discount rate for its U.S. pension plans by applying the projected cash flows for future benefit payments to the Aon Hewitt AA Above Median yield curve as of the measurement date. This yield curve is composed of individual zero-coupon interest rates for 198 different time periods over a 99-year time horizon. Zero-coupon rates utilized by the yield curve are mathematically derived from observable market yields for AA-rated corporate bonds. This yield curve model referenced by Northern Trust in establishing the discount rate resulted in a rate of 3.79% at December 31, 2017 for the Qualified and Nonqualified plans, a decrease from 4.46% at December 31, 2016 . Compensation Level: Based on a review of actual and anticipated salary experience, the compensation scale assumption is based on a graded schedule from 9.00% to 2.50% that averages 4.39% . Rate of Return on Plan Assets: The expected return on plan assets is based on an estimate of the long-term (30 years) rate of return on plan assets, which is determined using a building block approach that considers the current asset mix and estimates of return by asset class based on historical experience, giving proper consideration to diversification and rebalancing. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are also evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness. As a result of these analyses, Northern Trust rate of return assumption for the Qualified Plan decreased from 6.75% for 2017 to 6.00% for 2018 . Mortality Table: Northern Trust uses the aggregate RP-2014 mortality table with adjustment from 2014 to 2006. Northern Trust pension obligations reflect proposed future improvement under scale MP-2017, released by the Society of Actuaries in October 2017. This assumption was updated at December 31, 2017 from improvement scale MP-2016. The updated improvement scale applies to annuity payments only and results in generally lower projected mortality improvements than estimated by the MP-2016 improvement scale. Mortality assumptions on lump sum payments remain static and continue to be in line with the IRS prescribed table for minimum lump sums in 2018. The IRS prescribed table for 2018 now reflects the aggregate RP-2014 mortality table with adjustment from 2014 to 2006, and future improvements under scale MP-2016. Annual net pension expense in 2018 is expected to increase by approximately $19 million , primarily driven by the decrease in discount rate and a lower expected rate of return on plan assets. 62 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In order to illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions on the expected U.S Plans periodic pension expense in 2018 and the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2017 , the following table is presented to show the effect of increasing or decreasing each of these assumptions by 25 basis points. TABLE 35: SENSITIVITY OF U.S. PENSION PLANS ASSUMPTIONS ($ In Millions) 25 BASIS POINT INCREASE 25 BASIS POINT DECREASE Increase (Decrease) in 2018 Pension Expense Discount Rate Change $ (4.2 ) $ 4.4 Compensation Level Change 1.8 (1.7 ) Rate of Return on Plan Assets Change (3.7 ) 3.7 Increase (Decrease) in 2017 Projected Benefit Obligation Discount Rate Change (49.7 ) 52.6 Compensation Level Change 6.7 (6.4 ) Pension Contributions: The deduction limits specified by the Internal Revenue Code for contributions made by sponsors of defined benefit pension plans are based on a Target Liability under the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. There were no contributions to the Qualified Plan in 2017 and 2016 . Northern Trust contributed $50.0 million to the Qualified Plan at the beginning of 2018. The minimum required contribution to the Qualified Plan is expected to be zero in 2018 . The remaining maximum deductible contribution is estimated at $250 million for 2018 . FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires certain assets and liabilities to be reported at fair value. As of December 31, 2017 , approximately 25% of Northern Trust total assets and approximately 1% of its total liabilities were carried on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. As discussed more fully in Note 3, Fair Value Measurements, to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, GAAP requires entities to categorize financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value according to a three-level valuation hierarchy. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted, active market prices for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to valuation techniques that require significant management judgment because one or more of the significant inputs are unobservable in the market place (Level 3). Approximately 17% of Northern Trust assets carried at fair value are classified as Level 1. Northern Trust typically does not hold equity securities or other instruments that are actively traded on an exchange. Approximately 83% of Northern Trust assets and 98% of its liabilities carried at fair value are categorized as Level 2, as they are valued using models in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets. Investment securities classified as available for sale make up 97% of Level 2 assets with the remaining 3% primarily consisting of derivative financial instruments. Level 2 liabilities are comprised solely of derivative financial instruments. Northern Trust Level 2 assets include available for sale and trading account securities, the fair values of which are determined predominantly by external pricing vendors. Northern Trust has a well-established process to validate prices received from pricing vendors as discussed more fully in Note 3, Fair Value Measurements, to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. As of December 31, 2017 , all derivative assets and liabilities, excluding the swap related to the sale of certain Visa Class B common shares described below, were classified as Level 2 and approximately 96% , measured on a notional value basis, related to client-related and trading activities, predominantly consisting of foreign exchange contracts. Derivative instruments are valued internally using widely accepted income-based models that incorporate inputs readily observable in actively quoted markets and reflect contractual terms of contracts. Northern Trust evaluated the impact of counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk on the valuation of derivative instruments. Factors considered included the likelihood of default by Northern Trust and its counterparties, the remaining maturities of the instruments, net exposures after giving effect to master netting agreements, available collateral, and other credit enhancements in determining the appropriate fair value of derivative instruments. The resulting valuation adjustments are not considered material. As of December 31, 2017 , the fair value of Northern Trust Level 3 assets was $4.3 million . Level 3 assets consist of auction rate securities purchased from Northern Trust clients. To estimate the fair value of auction rate securities, Northern Trust uses external pricing vendors that incorporate transaction details and market based inputs such as past auction results, 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 63 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS trades and bids. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements are the prices of the securities supported by little market activity and for which trading is limited. As of December 31, 2017 , Northern Trust Level 3 liabilities consisted of swaps that Northern Trust entered into with the purchaser of 1.1 million and 1.0 million shares of Visa Class B common shares previously held by Northern Trust and sold in June 2016 and 2015, respectively. Pursuant to the swaps, Northern Trust retains the risks associated with the ultimate conversion of the Visa Class B common shares into shares of Visa Inc. Class A common stock (Visa Class A common shares), such that the counterparty will be compensated for any dilutive adjustments to the conversion ratio and Northern Trust will be compensated for any anti-dilutive adjustments to the ratio. The swaps also require periodic payments from Northern Trust to the counterparty calculated by reference to the market price of Visa Class A common shares and a fixed rate of interest. The fair value of the swaps are determined using a discounted cash flow methodology. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement are Northern Trust own assumptions about estimated changes in the conversion rate of the Visa Class B common shares into Visa Class A common shares, the date on which such conversion is expected to occur and the estimated growth rate of the Visa Class A common share price. See Visa Class B Common Shares under Note 24, Contingent Liabilities, provided in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. While Northern Trust believes its valuation methods for its assets and liabilities carried at fair value are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions, particularly as applied to Level 3 assets, could have a material effect on the computation of their estimated fair values. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09). ASU 2014-09 is a converged standard between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that provides a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers across transactions and industries. The primary objective of ASU 2014-09 is revenue recognition that represents the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Northern Trust adopted ASU 2014-09 as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. In 2017, Northern Trust focused efforts on completing an extensive contract review, covering services offered in each of its respective locations throughout the world, principal versus agent considerations, developing detailed disclosures required by ASU 2014-09 and assessing the extent of changes to the internal control environment. Northern Trust recognizes the majority of its revenues over time under current policy and will continue this practice for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. ASU 2014-09 is not expected to require significant changes to revenue-related information technology applications. As a result of completing its implementation project, Northern Trust will disclose additional information related to revenue recognition and implement certain changes to gross vs. net presentation for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 will not impact significantly Northern Trust consolidated financial condition or results of operations. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (ASU 2016-01). ASU 2016-01 requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method or those that result in consolidation) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income unless a policy election is made for investments without readily determinable fair values. Additionally, ASU 2016-01 requires public entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for measurement purposes and eliminates the requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet. Furthermore, it requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or in the accompanying notes to the financial statements. ASU 2016-01 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Northern Trust adopted ASU 2016-01 as of January 1, 2018. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 will not impact significantly Northern Trust consolidated financial condition or results of operations. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 introduces a lessee model that brings most leases onto the balance sheet, with certain specified scope exceptions. Specifically within the lessee model under ASU 2016-02, a lessee is required to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make future lease payments, known as the lease liability, and a right-of-use asset (ROU asset) representing its right to use the underlying asset over the lease term. ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with certain practical expedients available. Northern Trust has established an overall governance structure 64 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS and a detailed project plan for its implementation efforts, along with taking further action in defining the future operating model for lease accounting and administration. Northern Trust does not expect a significant change in leasing activity between now and adoption on January 1, 2019. Although Northern Trust is currently assessing the impact of ASU 2016-02, it is expected to have a significant impact on Northern Trust consolidated financial condition , with the most significant changes related to the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases. ASU 2016-02 is not expected to impact significantly Northern Trust consolidated results of operations. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13). ASU 2016-13 significantly changes the way impairment of financial instruments is recognized by requiring immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of financial instruments. The main provisions of ASU 2016-13 include (1) replacing the incurred loss approach under current GAAP with an expected loss model for instruments measured at amortized cost, (2) requiring entities to record an allowance for available-for-sale debt securities rather than reduce the carrying amount of the investments, as is required by the other-than-temporary-impairment model under current GAAP, and (3) a simplified accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans. ASU 2016-13 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, although early adoption is permitted. Northern Trust has established a working group across various functions, an overall governance structure, and has finalized a detailed project plan for its implementation efforts. Further, Northern Trust assessed its current inventory of underlying credit models along with the suitability of these models for the overall expected loss impairment model under ASU 2016-13 and prepared a comprehensive gap analysis. Development activities for new and modified credit loss models have commenced. Northern Trust continues to evaluate specific application issues and the overall impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13. In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-08, Receivables-Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Securities (ASU 2017-08), which amends the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium and shortens the amortization period for the premium to the earliest call date. ASU 2017-08 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, although early adoption is permitted. Northern Trust is currently assessing the impact of adoption of ASU 2017-08. In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (ASU 2017-12). The main provisions of ASU 2017-12 better align an entity risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to both the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships. ASU 2017-12 eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. Further, ASU 2017-12 eases certain documentation and assessment requirements and modifies the accounting for components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. ASU 2017-12 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, although early adoption is permitted. Northern Trust plans to early adopt ASU 2017-12 in the first half of 2018. Northern Trust currently applies the shortcut method of accounting available under GAAP for substantially all fair value hedges and other aspects of Northern Trust current hedge accounting program and therefore ASU 2017-12 is not expected to impact significantly Northern Trust consolidated financial condition or results of operations upon adoption. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (ASU 2018-02). The amendments in ASU 2018-02 allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act . ASU 2018-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption of the amendments in ASU 2018-02 is permitted. The amendments in ASU 2018-02 may be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is recognized. Northern Trust plans to early adopt ASU 2018-02 in the first quarter of 2018, and expects to reclassify approximately $25 million from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Capital expenditures in 2017 included ongoing enhancements to Northern Trust software and hardware capabilities, the opening of new offices, and the expansion and renovation of several existing offices. Capital expenditures for 2017 totaled $472.8 million , of which $381.2 million was for software, $58.3 million was for computer hardware, $27.1 million was for building and leasehold improvements, and $6.2 million was for furnishings. These capital expenditures principally support and enhance Northern Trust investment management, asset servicing and asset management capabilities, as well as relationship management and client interaction. Additional capital expenditures committed for systems technology will result in future expense for the depreciation of hardware and amortization of software. Software amortization and 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 65 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS depreciation on computer hardware and machinery are charged to equipment and software expense. Depreciation on building and leasehold improvements and on furnishings is charged to occupancy expense and equipment expense, respectively. Capital expenditures for 2016 totaled $473.4 million , of which $362.1 million was for software, $66.1 million was for computer hardware, $37.2 million was for building and leasehold improvements, and $8.0 million was for furnishings. OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Assets Under Custody/Administration and Assets Under Management Northern Trust, in the normal course of business, holds assets under custody/administration and management in a fiduciary or agency capacity for its clients. In accordance with GAAP, these assets are not assets of Northern Trust and are not included in its consolidated balance sheets. Commitments, Letters of Credit and Securities Lent with Indemnification Northern Trust, in the normal course of business, enters into various types of commitments and issues letters of credit to meet the liquidity and credit enhancement needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these instruments represent the potential credit exposure should the instrument be drawn fully upon and the client default. To control the credit risk associated with entering into commitments and issuing letters of credit, Northern Trust subjects such activities to the same credit quality and monitoring controls as its lending activities. The following table provides details of Northern Trust off-balance-sheet financial instruments as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 . TABLE 36: SUMMARY OF OFF-BALANCE-SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH CONTRACT AMOUNTS DECEMBER 31, ($ In Millions) 2017 2016 Undrawn Commitments to Extend Credit One Year and Less $ 8,617.3 $ 10,953.5 Over One Year 18,205.3 21,814.6 Total $ 26,822.6 $ 32,768.1 Standby Letters of Credit $ 2,970.0 $ 3,846.1 Commercial Letters of Credit 37.7 24.0 Custody Securities Lent with Indemnification 143,568.2 102,325.2 66 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Undrawn commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since a significant portion of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future loans or liquidity requirements. The following table provides information about the industry sector and expiration dates of undrawn commitments to extend credit as of December 31, 2017 .

Standby letters of credit obligate Northern Trust to meet certain financial obligations of its clients, if, under the contractual terms of the agreement, the clients are unable to do so. These instruments are primarily issued to support public and private financial commitments, including commercial paper, bond financing, initial margin requirements on futures exchanges and similar transactions. Northern Trust is obligated to meet the entire financial obligation of these agreements and in certain cases is able to recover the amounts paid through recourse against collateral received or other participants. Standby letters of credit of $3.0 billion and $3.8 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, include $92.5 million and $134.2 million , respectively, of standby letters of credit secured by cash deposits or participated to others. The weighted average maturity of standby letters of credit was 24 months at December 31, 2017 and 2016 . As part of its securities custody activities and at the direction of its clients, Northern Trust lends securities owned by clients to borrowers who are reviewed and approved by the Northern Trust Capital Markets Credit Committee. In connection with these activities, Northern Trust has issued indemnifications to certain clients against certain losses that are a direct result of a borrower failure to return securities when due, should the value of such securities exceed the value of the collateral required to be posted. Borrowers are required to collateralize fully securities received with cash or marketable securities. As securities are loaned, collateral is maintained at a minimum of 100% of the fair value of the securities plus accrued interest. The collateral is revalued on a daily basis. The amount of securities loaned subject to indemnification was $143.6 billion and $102.3 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Because of the credit quality of the 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 67 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS borrowers and the requirement to collateralize fully securities borrowed, management believes that the exposure to credit loss from this activity is not significant and no liability was recorded at December 31, 2017 , or 2016 related to these indemnifications. Additional information about Northern Trust off-balance-sheet financial instruments is included in Note 27, Off-Balance-Sheet Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Variable Interest Entities Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) are defined within GAAP as entities which either have a total equity investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. Investors that finance a VIE through debt or equity interests, or other counterparties that provide other forms of support, such as guarantees, subordinated fee arrangements, or certain types of derivative contracts, are variable interest holders in the entity and the variable interest holder, if any, that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity and a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the entity is deemed to be the VIE primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE. Leveraged Leases. In leveraged leasing transactions, Northern Trust acts as lessor of the underlying asset subject to the lease and typically funds 20 - 30% of the asset cost via an equity ownership in a trust with the remaining 70 - 80% provided by third-party non-recourse debt holders. In such transactions, the trusts, which are VIEs, are created to provide the lessee use of the property with substantially all of the rights and obligations of ownership. The lessee maintenance and operation of the leased property has a direct effect on the fair value of the underlying property, and the lessee also has the ability to increase the benefits it can receive and limit the losses it can suffer by the manner in which it uses the property. As a result, Northern Trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs given it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs. Tax Credit Structures. Northern Trust invests in qualified affordable housing projects and community development entities (collectively, community development projects) that are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of tax credits. The community development projects are formed as limited partnerships and limited liability companies in which Northern Trust invests as a limited partner/investor member through equity contributions. The economic performance of the community development projects, which are VIEs, is subject to the performance of their underlying investment and their ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. Northern Trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of any community development projects as it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the underlying investments or to affect their ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. This power is held by the general partners and managing members who exercise full and exclusive control of the operations of the VIEs. Investment Funds. Northern Trust acts as asset manager for various funds in which clients of Northern Trust are investors. As an asset manager of funds, Northern Trust earns a competitively priced fee that is based on assets managed and varies with each fund investment objective. Based on its analysis, Northern Trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs under GAAP. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity As the Corporation principal subsidiary encompassing all of Northern Trust banking activities, the Bank centrally manages liquidity for all U.S. and international banking operations. Liquidity is provided by a variety of sources, including client deposits (institutional and personal) from the C&IS and Wealth Management businesses, wholesale funding from the capital markets, maturities of short-term investments, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and unencumbered liquid assets that can be sold or pledged to secure additional funds. While management does not view central bank discount windows as primary sources of liquidity, at December 31, 2017 , the Bank had over $32.9 billion of securities and loans readily available as collateral to support discount window borrowings. The Bank also is active in the U.S. interbank funding market, providing an important source of additional liquidity and low-cost funds. Liquidity supports a variety of activities, including client withdrawals, purchases of securities, net loan growth, and draws on commitments to extend credit. Northern Trust maintains a very liquid balance sheet, with cash and due from banks, deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks, short-term money market assets and investment securities in aggregate representing 70% of total assets 68 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS as of December 31, 2017 . The market value of unencumbered securities at the Bank, which include those placed at the Federal Reserve discount window, totaled $39.2 billion at December 31, 2017 . The Corporation and the Bank each satisfied the U.S. liquidity coverage ratio requirements during 2017 . The liquidity of the Corporation is managed separately from that of the Bank. The primary sources of cash for the Corporation are issuances of debt or equity, dividend payments from the Bank and interest earned on investment securities and money market assets. On May 8, 2017, the Corporation issued $350 million of 3.375% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes, due May 8, 2032. The Corporation also received $525.0 million of dividends from the Bank in 2017 . Dividends from the Bank are subject to certain restrictions, as discussed in further detail in Note 30, Restrictions on Subsidiary Dividends and Loans or Advances, to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The Corporation uses of cash consist mainly of dividend payments to the Corporation stockholders; the payment of principal and interest to note holders; repurchases of its common stock; and investments in, or loans to, its subsidiaries. The most significant uses of cash by the Corporation during 2017 were $523.1 million of common stock repurchases and $356.8 million of common stock dividends. The Corporation liquidity, defined as the amount of cash and highly marketable assets, was $1.0 billion and $757.0 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. During, and at year-end, 2017 and 2016 , these assets were comprised almost entirely of cash in a demand deposit account at the Bank or overnight money market placements, both of which were fully available to the Corporation to support its own cash flow requirements or those of its subsidiaries, as needed. Average liquidity during 2017 and 2016 was $750.5 million and $562.8 million , respectively. The cash flows of the Corporation are shown in Note 33, Northern Trust Corporation (Corporation only), to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. A significant source of liquidity for both the Corporation and the Bank is the ability to draw funding from capital markets globally. The credit ratings of the Corporation and the Bank as of December 31, 2017 , provided below, allow Northern Trust to access capital markets on favorable terms. TABLE 38: NORTHERN TRUST CREDIT RATINGS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 CREDIT RATING STANDARD & POOR S MOODY S FITCHRATINGS Northern Trust Corporation: Senior Debt A+ A2 AA- Subordinated Debt A A2 A+ Preferred Stock BBB+ Baa1 BBB Trust Preferred Capital Securities BBB+ A3 BBB+ Outlook Stable Stable Stable The Northern Trust Company: Short-Term Deposit A-1+ P-1 F1+ Long-Term Deposit AA- Aa2 AA Subordinated Debt A+ A2 A+ Outlook Stable Stable Stable A significant downgrade in one or more of these ratings could limit Northern Trust access to capital markets and/or increase the rates paid for short-term borrowings, including deposits, and future long-term debt issuances. The size of these rate increases would depend on multiple factors, including the extent of the downgrade, Northern Trust relative debt rating compared to other financial institutions, current market conditions, and other factors. In addition, as discussed in Note 25, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Northern Trust enters into certain master netting arrangements with derivative counterparties that contain credit-risk-related contingent features in which the counterparty has the option to declare Northern Trust in default and accelerate cash settlement of net derivative liabilities with the counterparty in the event Northern Trust credit rating falls below specified levels. The net maximum amount of these termination payments that Northern Trust could have been required to pay at December 31, 2017 , was $187.9 million . Other than these credit-risk-related contingent derivative counterparty payments, Northern Trust had no long-term debt covenants or other credit-risk-related payments at December 31, 2017 , that would be triggered by a significant downgrade in its debt ratings. 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 69 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Statements of Cash Flows For the year ended December 31, 2017 , net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion , primarily reflecting period earnings and the impact of non-cash charges such as amortization of computer software, partially offset by other operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 , was $1.5 billion and was primarily the result of period earnings and other operating activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $14.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 , primarily attributable to an increase in deposits with Federal Reserve and other central banks as well as net purchases of securities held to maturity. Net cash used in investing activities of $10.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 , primarily attributable to net purchases of securities available for sale and held to maturity as well as an increase in deposits with Federal Reserve and other central banks. For the year ended December 31, 2017 , net cash provided by financing activities totaled $11.3 billion , primarily reflecting higher levels of total deposits, federal funds purchased, increases in short-term other borrowings, and the proceeds from the issuance by the Corporation of 3.375% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes, partially offset by the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the Corporation's share repurchase program, dividends paid on common and preferred stock, and repayments of the 5.85% subordinated notes previously issued by the Bank and due November 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016 , net cash provided by financing activities totaled $7.5 billion , primarily reflecting higher levels of total deposits, increases in short-term other borrowings, the issuance of Series D Preferred Stock, and net proceeds received from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the Corporation's share repurchase program and dividends paid on common and preferred stock. Regulatory Environment Northern Trust actively follows regulatory developments and regularly evaluates its liquidity risk management framework against proposed rulemaking and industry best practices in order to comply with applicable regulations and further enhance its liquidity policies. Please refer to Liquidity Standards under Supervision and Regulation in Item 1, Business, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of applicable liquidity standards. Contractual Obligations The following table shows Northern Trust contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 .

(3) Purchase obligations consist primarily of ongoing operating costs related to outsourcing arrangements for certain cash management services and the support and maintenance of the Corporation technological requirements. Certain obligations are in the form of variable rate contracts and, in some instances, 2017 activity was used as a base to project future obligations. (4) Northern Trust has elected to pay the net tax liability on deferred foreign earnings in eight installments as allowed under section 965(h) of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Capital Management One of Northern Trust primary objectives is to maintain a strong capital position to merit the confidence of clients, counterparties, creditors, regulators and stockholders. A strong capital position helps Northern Trust execute its strategies and withstand unforeseen adverse developments. 70 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Senior management, with oversight from the Capital Governance Committee and the full Board of Directors, is responsible for capital management and planning. Northern Trust manages its capital on both a total Corporation basis and a legal entity basis. The Capital Committee is responsible for measuring and managing capital metrics against levels set forth within the Capital Policy approved by the Board of Directors. In establishing the metrics related to capital, a variety of factors are taken into consideration, including the unique risk profiles of Northern Trust businesses, regulatory requirements, capital levels relative to peers, and the impact on credit ratings. Capital levels were strengthened in 2017 as average stockholders equity increased $895.3 million , or 10% , reaching $10.0 billion . Total stockholders equity was $10.2 billion at December 31, 2017 , as compared to $9.8 billion at December 31, 2016 . In July 2017, the Board increased the quarterly common stock dividend by 11% to $0.42 per common share. Common dividends totaling $372.5 million were declared in 2017 . During the year ended December 31, 2017 , the Corporation repurchased 5.8 million shares of common stock, including 0.5 million shares withheld related to share-based compensation, at an average price per share of $90.25 . Preferred dividends totaling $49.8 million were declared in 2017 . 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 71 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In accordance with Basel III requirements, capital ratios are calculated using both the standardized and advanced approaches. For each ratio, the lower of the result calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approach serves as the effective ratio for purposes of determining capital adequacy. The following table provides a reconciliation of the Corporation common stockholders equity to total risk-based capital and its risk-based capital ratios, under the applicable U.S. regulatory rules as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 .

(3) Beginning with the first quarter of 2015, advanced approaches banking organizations must calculate and report their supplementary leverage ratio. Effective January 1, 2018, the Corporation will be subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3 percent. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , the Corporation capital ratios exceeded the minimum requirements for classification as well-capitalized under applicable U.S. regulatory requirements. Further information regarding the Corporation and the Bank capital ratios and the minimum requirements for classification as well-capitalized is provided in the 72 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1, Business, and Note 32, Regulatory Capital Requirements, to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. As of December 31, 2017 , the Corporation common equity Tier 1 capital ratio as calculated under the advanced approaches methodologies would have been 13.3% on a fully phased-in basis, while the Corporation common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the standardized approach would have been 12.4% on a fully phased-in basis. RISK MANAGEMENT Risk Management Overview Northern Trust employs an integrated enterprise risk management framework to support its strategies. The framework provides a methodology to identify, assess, monitor, measure, manage and report both internal and external risks to Northern Trust, and promotes a culture of risk awareness across the organization. Northern Trust risk culture encompasses the general awareness, attitude and conduct of employees with respect to risk and the management of risk across all lines of defense within the organization. The key risk categories that are inherent in Northern Trust business activities include: credit, operational, fiduciary, compliance, market, liquidity, and strategic risk. Northern Trust reinforces a culture of effective risk management by defining risk management accountabilities, embedding such accountabilities in performance expectations across the company, training and developing employees and evaluating and rewarding employee performance. Risk Governance and Oversight Overview Risk governance is an integral aspect of corporate governance at Northern Trust, and includes clearly defined accountabilities, expectations, internal controls and processes for risk-based decision-making and escalation of issues. The diagram below provides a high-level overview of Northern Trust risk governance structure, highlighting the oversight of the Board of Directors and key risk-related committees. TABLE 41: RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE Northern Trust Corporation Board of Directors Audit Committee Business Risk Committee Capital Governance Committee Compensation and Benefit Committee Global Enterprise Risk Committee (GERC) Credit Risk Committee Operational Risk Committee Fiduciary Risk Committee Compliance & Ethics Oversight Committee Market & Liquidity Risk Committee Model Risk Oversight Committee The Board of Directors provides oversight of risk management directly and through certain of its committees: the Audit Committee, the Business Risk Committee, the Capital Governance Committee and the Compensation and Benefits Committee. The Board of Directors approves Northern Trust enterprise risk management framework and Corporate Risk Appetite Statement. The Business Risk Committee assumes primary responsibility and oversight with respect to credit risk, operational risk, fiduciary risk, compliance risk, market risk, liquidity risk, and strategic risk. The Audit Committee provides oversight with respect to financial reporting and legal risk, while the Compensation and Benefits Committee oversees the development and operation of Northern Trust incentive compensation program. The Compensation and Benefits Committee annually reviews management assessment of the effectiveness of the design and performance of Northern Trust incentive compensation arrangements and practices in providing incentives that are consistent with Northern Trust safety and soundness. This assessment includes an evaluation of whether Northern Trust incentive compensation arrangements and practices discourage inappropriate risk-taking behavior by participants. The Capital Governance Committee of the Board assists the Board in discharging its oversight duties with respect to capital management and planning activities. Among other responsibilities, the Capital Governance Committee oversees Northern Trust capital adequacy assessments, forecasting, and stress testing processes and activities, including the annual CCAR exercise, and challenges management, as appropriate, on various elements of such processes and activities. Accordingly, the Capital Governance Committee provides oversight with respect to Northern Trust linkage of material risks to the capital adequacy assessment process. 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 73 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) oversees Northern Trust management of risk, promotes risk awareness and fosters a proactive risk management environment wherein risks inherent in the business strategy are identified, understood, appropriately monitored and mitigated. The CRO reports directly to the Business Risk Committee and the Corporation Chief Executive Officer. The CRO regularly advises the Business Risk Committee and reports to the Committee at least quarterly on risk exposures, risk management deficiencies and emerging risks. In accordance with the enterprise risk management framework, the executive risk management team of Northern Trust, together with the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Capital Management Officer, General Counsel and General Auditor, meets as the Global Enterprise Risk Committee (GERC) to provide executive management oversight and guidance with respect to the management of the categories of risk within Northern Trust. Among other risk management responsibilities, GERC receives reports or recommendations from senior risk committees that are responsible for the management of risk, and from time to time may delegate responsibility to such committees for risk issues. Senior risk committees include: The Credit Risk Committee (CRC) establishes and monitors credit-related policies and practices throughout Northern Trust and promotes their uniform application. The Operational Risk Committee (ORC) provides independent oversight and is responsible for setting the Corporate Operational Risk Management Policy and developing the operational risk management framework and programs that support the coordination of operational risk activities. The Fiduciary Risk Committee (FRC) is responsible for establishing and reviewing the fiduciary risk policies and establishing the fiduciary risk framework, governance and programs that support the coordination of fiduciary risk activities. The Compliance & Ethics Oversight Committee (CEOC) provides oversight and direction with respect to compliance policies, implementation of the compliance and ethics program, and the coordination of regulatory compliance initiatives across the Corporation. The Market & Liquidity Risk Committee (MLRC) oversees activities relating to the management of market and liquidity risks by facilitating a focused review of market and liquidity risk exposures and providing rigorous challenge of related policies, key assumptions, and practices. The Model Risk Oversight Committee (MROC) is responsible for providing management attention, direction, and oversight of the model risk management framework and model risk within Northern Trust. In addition to the aforementioned committees, Northern Trust deploys business and regional risk committees that also report into GERC. Risk Identification and Risk Management Process As part of the integrated enterprise risk framework, Northern Trust has established key risk identification and risk management processes, embedded within its businesses to enable prudent risk-taking behavior. Integral to the risk framework are Northern Trust processes for definition and communication of acceptable risk appetite and reporting against risk appetite, dynamic assessment of risk against its strategic and business objectives, and a three lines of defense operating model. Northern Trust defines the organization risk appetite as the amount and types of risk that it is willing to assume in its exposures and business activities to achieve its strategic and financial objectives. Northern Trust manages its business activities consistent with the Corporate Risk Appetite Statement, in which specific guidelines are detailed for each key risk category. Northern Trust Corporate Risk Appetite Statement reflects the expectation that risk is consciously considered as part of day-to-day activities and strategic decisions. Northern Trust risk assessment process, aligned with this expectation, consists of a series of programs that identify, measure, manage, and report risks in line with risk appetite and guidelines. A common risk language used across Northern Trust supports risk identification processes and consistent identification of risk, designation of material risks, and grouping of risks into risk themes for effective analysis, oversight, and management of Northern Trust aggregate risk profile. Northern Trust maintains a three lines of defense operating model to embed a robust risk management capability within its businesses. The model, used to communicate risk management expectations across the organization, contains three roles, each a complimentary level of risk management accountability. Within this operating model, Northern Trust businesses are the first line of defense for protecting it against the risks inherent in its businesses and are supported by dedicated business risk management teams. The Risk Management function, the second line of defense, sets the direction 74 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS for Northern Trust risk management activities and provides aggregate risk oversight and reporting in support of risk governance. Audit Services, the third line of defense, provides independent assurance as to the effectiveness of the integrated enterprise risk framework. Risk Control Risk Control is an internal, independent review function within the Risk Management function. Risk Control is managed by the Chief Risk Control Officer and is comprised of Model Risk Management, Credit Review, Global Compliance Testing and Basel Independent Verification groups, each with its own risk focus and oversight. Model Risk Management is responsible for the implementation and management of the enterprise-wide model risk framework and independently validating new models and reviewing and re-validating existing models. Credit Review provides an independent, ongoing assessment of credit exposure and related credit risk management processes across Northern Trust. Global Compliance Testing evaluates the effectiveness of procedures and controls designed to comply with relevant laws and regulations, as well as corresponding Northern Trust policies governing regulatory compliance activities. Lastly, Basel Independent Verification promotes rigor and accuracy in Northern Trust ongoing compliance with Basel III requirements and adherence to Enhanced Prudential Standards, including Liquidity Stress Testing. The Business Risk Committee oversees Risk Control generally as well as each of these groups. Audit Services Audit Services is an independent control function that assesses and validates controls within Northern Trust enterprise risk management framework. Audit Services is managed by the General Auditor with oversight from the Audit Committee. Audit Services tests the overall adequacy and effectiveness of the system of internal controls associated with the advanced systems on an ongoing basis and reports the results of these audits directly to the Audit Committee. Audit Services includes professionals with a broad range of audit and industry experience, including risk management expertise. The General Auditor reports directly to the Audit Committee and the Corporation Chief Executive Officer. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk to interest income or principal from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to perform on an obligation. Credit Risk Overview Credit risk is inherent in many of Northern Trust activities. A significant component of credit risk relates to loans, leases, securities, and counterparty-related exposures. Northern Trust loan portfolio differs significantly from those of other large U.S. financial institutions in that Northern Trust is generally: not an originator of loan products to be sold into a secondary market or to be bundled into asset securitizations; not an agent bank or syndicator of loans, where risk management is achieved post-close through the sale of participations; and not a participant in leveraged financial transactions, such as project finance, private-equity-originated acquisition financing or hedge fund leveraging. Credit Risk Framework and Governance The Credit Risk Management function is the focal point of the credit risk framework and, while independent of the businesses, it works closely with them to achieve the goal of assuring proactive management of credit risk. To monitor and control credit risk, the Credit Risk Management function maintains a framework that consists of policies, standards, and practices designed to promote a conservative credit culture. This function also monitors adherence to corporate policies, standards, and external regulations. The Credit Risk Management function provides a system of checks and balances for Northern Trust diverse credit-related activities by monitoring these activities and practices and promoting their uniform application throughout Northern Trust. The credit risk framework provides authorities for approval of the extension of credit. Individual credit authority for commercial and personal loans is limited to specified amounts and maturities. Credit requests exceeding individual authority because of amount, rating, term or other conditions, are referred to the relevant Group Credit Approval Committee. Credit decisions involving exposure in excess of these limits require the approval of the Senior Credit Committee. The Capital Markets Credit Committee has sole credit authority for the approval, modification, or renewal of credit exposure to all wholesale market counterparties. 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 75 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The CRC establishes and monitors credit-related policies and practices throughout Northern Trust and promotes their uniform application. The Chief Credit Officer reports directly to the CRO and chairs the CRC. Independent oversight and review of the credit risk framework also is provided by Risk Control. Credit Risk Measurement An integral component of credit risk measurement is Northern Trust internal risk rating system. Northern Trust internal risk rating system enables identification, measurement, approval and monitoring of credit risk. Calculations include entity-specific information about the obligor or counterparty probability of default and exposure-specific information about loss given default, exposure at default and maturity. The Credit Risk Management function is responsible for the ongoing oversight of each model that supports the internal risk-rating system. Independent model governance and oversight is further supported by the activities of Risk Control. Loans and Other Extensions of Credit A significant component of credit risk relates to the loan portfolio, including contractual obligations such as legally binding commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. These contractual obligations and arrangements are discussed in the Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements section and in Note 27, Off-Balance-Sheet Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. As part of Northern Trust credit processes, the Credit Risk Management function oversees a range of portfolio reviews that focus on significant and/or weaker-rated credits. This approach allows management to take remedial action in an effort to deal with potential problems. An integral part of the Credit Risk Management function is a formal review of past due and potential problem loans to determine which credits, if any, need to be placed on nonperforming status or charged off. Northern Trust maintains a loan portfolio watch list for adversely classified credit exposures that includes all nonperforming credits as well as other loans with elevated risk of default. Independent from the Credit Risk Management function, Credit Review undertakes both on-site and off-site file reviews that evaluate effectiveness of management implementation of the Credit Risk Management requirements. Counterparty Credit Risk Counterparty credit risk for Northern Trust primarily arises from a variety of funding, treasury, trading and custody-related activities, including over-the-counter (OTC) currency and interest rate derivatives, and from indemnified securities lending transactions. Credit exposure to counterparties is managed by use of a framework for setting limits by product type and exposure tenor. To calculate exposure, Northern Trust treats repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and indemnified securities lending transactions as repo-style transactions. Foreign exchange exposures and interest rate derivatives are treated as OTC derivatives. The exposure at default measurement methodology for each eligible type of counterparty credit exposure, including the use of netting and collateral as risk mitigants, is determined based on operational requirements, the characteristics of the contract type and the portfolio size and complexity. Credit Risk Mitigation Northern Trust considers cash flow to be the primary source of repayment for client-related credit exposures. However, Northern Trust employs several different types of credit risk mitigants to manage its overall credit risk in the event cash flow is not sufficient to repay a credit exposure. Northern Trust broadly groups its risk mitigation techniques into the following three primary categories. Physical and Financial Collateral: Northern Trust primary risk mitigation approaches include the requirement of collateral. Residential and commercial real estate exposures are typically secured by properly margined mortgages on the property. In cases where loans to commercial or certain Wealth Management clients are secured by marketable securities, the daily values of the securities are monitored closely to ensure adherence to collateral coverage policies. Netting: On-balance-sheet netting is employed on a limited basis. Netting is primarily related to foreign exchange transactions with major banks and institutional clients subject to eligible master netting agreements. Northern Trust has elected to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of netting within its regulatory capital calculation at this time. Guarantees: Personal and corporate guarantees are often taken to facilitate potential collection efforts and to protect Northern Trust claims relative to other creditors. Northern Trust has elected not to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of guarantors within its regulatory capital calculation at this time. 76 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Another important risk management practice is the avoidance of undue concentrations of exposure, such as in any single (or small number of related) obligor/counterparty, loan type, industry, geography, country or risk mitigant. Processes are in place to establish limits on certain concentrations and the monitoring of adherence to the limits. Operational Risk Operational risk is the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, human factors and systems, or from external events. Operational Risk Overview Operational risk is inherent in each of Northern Trust businesses and corporate functions and reflects the potential for inadequate information systems, operating problems, product design and delivery difficulties, potential legal actions, or other catastrophes to result in losses. Operational risk includes compliance, fiduciary and legal risks, which under the Corporation risk structure are governed and managed explicitly. Operational Risk Framework and Governance To monitor and control operational risk, Northern Trust maintains a framework consisting of risk management policies, programs and practices designed to promote a sound operational environment and maintain the Corporation operational risk profile and losses within approved risk appetites and guidelines. The framework is deployed consistently and globally across all businesses and its objective is to identify and measure the factors that impact risk and drive action to reduce future loss events. The Operational Risk Management function is responsible for defining the operational risk framework and providing independent oversight of the framework across Northern Trust. It is the responsibility of each business to implement the enterprise-wide operational risk framework and business-specific risk management programs to identify, monitor, measure, and manage operational risk and mitigate Northern Trust exposure to loss. Several key programs support the operational risk framework, including: Loss Event Data Program - a program that collects internal and external loss data for use in monitoring operational risk exposure, various business analyses and a Basel Advanced Management Approach (AMA) capital quantification. Risk and Control Self-Assessment - a structured risk management process used by Northern Trust businesses to analyze the risks that are present in their respective business environments, processes and activities and to assess the adequacy of associated internal controls. Operational Risk Scenario Analysis - a systematic process of obtaining expert opinions from business managers and risk management experts to derive reasoned assessments of the likelihood of occurrence and the potential loss impact of plausible high-severity operational losses. Product and Process Risk Management Program - a program used for evaluating and managing risks associated with the introduction of new and modified noncredit products and services, significant changes to operating processes, and related significant loss events. Outsourcing Risk Management Program - a program that provides processes for appropriate risk assessment, measurement, monitoring and management of outsourced technology and business process outsourcing. Information Security and Technology Risk Management - a program that communicates and implements compliance and risk management processes and controls to address information security, including cyber threats and technology risks to the organization. Significant New Business Opportunity - a program that assesses the resource requirements, impact on systems and controls, and other risk factors prior to taking on significant new business. Business Continuity Management Program - a program designed to minimize business impact and support the resumption of mission critical functions for clients following an incident. Physical Security - a program that provides for the safety of Northern Trust partners, clients, and visitors worldwide. Insurance Management Program - a program designed to reduce the monetary impact of certain operational loss events. As discussed in Risk Control, Model Risk Management also is part of the operational risk framework. The ORC is responsible for overseeing the activities of Northern Trust related to the management of operational risk including establishing the Corporate Operational Risk Policy and approving the operational risk framework and programs. This committee has the expanded role of coordinating operational risk issues related to compliance and fiduciary risks. The 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 77 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS purpose of this committee is to provide executive management insight and guidance to the management of existing and emerging operational risks. Operational Risk Measurement Northern Trust utilizes the AMA capital quantification process to estimate required capital for the Corporation and applicable U.S. banking subsidiaries. Northern Trust AMA capital quantification process incorporates outputs from the Loss Event Data, Risk and Control Self-Assessment and Operational Risk Scenario Analysis programs to derive required capital. Business environment factor information is used to estimate loss frequency. The AMA capital quantification process uses a Loss Distribution Approach methodology to combine frequency and severity distributions to arrive at an estimate of the potential aggregate loss at the 99.9 th percentile of the aggregate loss distribution over a one-year time horizon. Information Security and Technology Management Effective management of risks related to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information is crucial in an environment of increasing cyber threat and requires a structured approach to establish and communicate expectations and required practices. Northern Trust approach to information security begins at a governance level with an organizational structure that reflects support from executive management and includes risk committees comprised of members from across Northern Trust businesses. In addition to a strong governance process, internal controls and risk management practices are designed to keep risk at levels appropriate to Northern Trust overall risk appetite and the inherent risk in the markets in which Northern Trust operates. Northern Trust employees are responsible for promoting information security as well as adhering to applicable policies and standards and other means provided to them to safeguard electronic information and business systems within their care. Training and awareness programs to educate employees on information security are on-going and include multiple approaches such as mandatory computer-based training, phishing simulations, and the designation of individuals as Information Security and Privacy Champions within the businesses. In cases where Northern Trust relies on vendors to perform services, controls are routinely reviewed for alignment with industry standards and their ability to protect information. Any findings identified are remediated following a risk-based approach. In addition to the various information security controls managed and monitored within the organization, Northern Trust uses external third-party security teams on a regular basis to assess effectiveness. These teams perform security program maturity assessments, penetration tests, security assessments and reviews of Northern Trust susceptibility to social engineering attacks such as spear phishing. Northern Trust operates a global security operations center for threat identification and response. This center aggregates security threat information from systems and platforms across the businesses, and alerts the organization in accordance with its documented Cyber Incident Response Plan. The Cyber Incident Response Plan is used to respond to cybersecurity incidents. A cybersecurity incident is defined as an incident caused by damaging activity, which requires actions to prevent and respond to disruptions, denials, compromises or exfiltration that impact the confidentiality, integrity and availably of the assets of Northern Trust or its clients. The plan provides a streamlined approach that can be invoked rapidly to address matters that raise enterprise concern and to communicate impact, actions and status to senior management, including the Chief Information Security Officer, and appropriate stakeholders. The plan is designed to work with enterprise-level response plans and is tested routinely. Business Resiliency and Continuity Management Northern Trust business resiliency approach encompasses business continuity and disaster recovery processes enterprise-wide (including staff, technology and facilities) to ensure that following a disaster or business interruption Northern Trust resumes mission-critical business and economic functions and fulfills all regulatory and legal requirements. Northern Trust business resiliency mitigation and preventative measures include sophisticated physical security, resilient designs and peer capacity for its corporate data centers, a highly redundant global network, robust network security, resiliency centers that offer alternative workstations, and transfer of work and work-from-home programs that provide further capability. All of Northern Trust businesses are required to risk-assess regularly their critical functions and develop business continuity plans covering resource requirements (people, systems, vendor relationships and other assets), arrangements for obtaining these resources and prioritizing the resumption of each function in compliance with corporate standards. The strength of the business continuity programs of all critical third-party vendors to Northern Trust are reviewed on a regular basis. All of Northern Trust businesses test their plans at least annually. The ORC annually reviews and presents the corporate business continuity plan to the Business Risk Committee. 78 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiduciary Risk Fiduciary risks are risks arising from the failure, in administering or managing financial and other assets in clients fiduciary accounts: i) to adhere to a fiduciary standard of care if required under the terms of governing documents or applicable laws; or ii) to properly discharge fiduciary duties. Fiduciary status may hinge on the nature of a particular function being performed and fiduciary standards may vary by jurisdiction, type of relationship and governing document. Fiduciary Risk Overview The fiduciary risk management framework identifies, assesses, measures, monitors and reports on fiduciary risk matters deemed significant. Fiduciary risk is mitigated through internal controls and risk management practices that are designed to identify, understand and keep such risk at levels consistent with the organization overall risk appetite while also managing the inherent risk in each relationship for which Northern Trust serves in a fiduciary capacity. Each business is responsible for complying with all corporate policies and external regulations and for establishing specific procedures, standards and guidelines to manage fiduciary risk within the desired risk appetite level. Fiduciary Risk Framework and Governance The FRC is responsible for establishing and reviewing the fiduciary risk policies and establishing the fiduciary risk framework, governance and programs that support the coordination of fiduciary risk activities to identify, monitor, manage and report on fiduciary risk. In addition, the FRC serves as an escalation point for significant issues raised by its subcommittees or elsewhere in the organization. Compliance Risk Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, other regulatory requirements, or codes of conduct and other standards of self-regulatory organizations applicable to Northern Trust. Compliance risk includes the following two subcategories: Regulatory Risk - risk arising from failure to comply with prudential and conduct of business or other regulatory requirements. Financial Crime Risk - risk arising from financial crime (e.g., money laundering, sanctions violations, fraud, insider dealing, theft, etc.) in relation to the products, services, or accounts of the institution, its clients, or others associated with the same. Compliance Risk Framework and Governance The compliance risk management framework identifies, assesses, controls, measures, monitors and reports on compliance risk. The framework is designed to minimize compliance risk and maintain an environment in which criminal or regulatory violations do not occur. The framework includes a comprehensive governance structure and a Compliance and Ethics Program approved by the Business Risk Committee. Each business is responsible for the implementation and effectiveness of the Compliance and Ethics Program and specific compliance policies within their respective businesses. Each business is responsible for its respective employees compliance with corporate policies and external regulations and for establishing specific procedures, standards and guidelines to manage compliance risk in accordance with Northern Trust Compliance and Ethics Program. The CEOC establishes and monitors adherence to Northern Trust Compliance and Ethics Program. The Chief Compliance and Ethics Officer reports to the Business Risk Committee as appropriate and chairs the CEOC. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to raise sufficient funds or maintain collateral to meet balance sheet and contingent liability cash flow obligations when due, because of firm-specific or market-wide events. Liquidity Risk Overview Northern Trust maintains a strong liquidity position and conservative liquidity risk profile. Northern Trust balance sheet is liability-driven. That is, the main driver of balance sheet changes comes from changing levels of client deposits, which are generally related to the level of global custody assets serviced and commercial and personal deposits. This liability-driven business model differs from a typical asset-driven business model, where increased levels of deposits and wholesale borrowings are required to support, for example, increased levels of lending for execution of the organization investment strategy. Northern Trust balance sheet generally consists of high-quality assets with relatively short durations, resulting in low liquidity risk. 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 79 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity Risk Framework and Governance Northern Trust maintains a liquidity risk framework consisting of risk management policies, and practices to keep its risk profile within the Board-approved Corporate Risk Appetite Statement. All liquidity risk activities are overseen by the Risk Management function, which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities. Exposure limits for liquidity risk are set by the Board and committee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to corporate policies, external regulations and established procedures. Limits are monitored based on measures such as the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the liquidity stress-testing buffer across a range of time horizons. The Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) provides first line management oversight and is responsible for approving strategies and activities within the risk appetite, overseeing balance sheet resources, and reviewing reporting such as cash flows and stress test results. The MLRC provides second line oversight and is responsible for approving sub-policies and procedures, establishing and monitoring risk metrics, and approving methodologies and key assumptions that drive liquidity risk measurement. Liquidity Risk Analysis, Monitoring, and Reporting Liquidity risk is analyzed and monitored in order to ensure compliance with the approved risk appetite. Various liquidity analysis and monitoring activities are employed by Northern Trust to understand better the nature and sources of its liquidity risks, including: liquidity stress testing, liquidity metric monitoring, collateral management, intraday management, cash flow projections, operational deposit assessments, liquid asset buffer measurement, funds transfer pricing, and contingency funding planning. The liquidity risk management process is supported through management and regulatory reporting. Both Northern Trust Treasury and Market and Liquidity Risk Management functions produce management reports using the outputs from the liquidity assessment, monitoring, and analysis, enabling oversight bodies to make informed decisions and support management of risk within the approved risk appetite. Holistic liquidity metrics such as LCR and internal liquidity stress testing are actively monitored, along with a suite of other metrics that provide early warning indicators of changes in the risk profile. Market Risk There are two types of market risk, interest rate risk and trading risk. Interest rate risk is the potential for movements in interest rates to cause changes in net interest income and the market value of equity. Trading risk is the potential for movements in market variables such as foreign exchange and interest rates to cause changes in the value of trading positions. Market Risk Framework and Governance Northern Trust maintains a market risk framework consisting of risk management policies and practices to keep its risk profile within the Board-approved Corporate Risk Appetite Statement. All market risk activities are overseen by the Risk Management function, which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities. Exposure limits for market risk are set by the Board and committee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to corporate policies, external regulations and established procedures. Limits are monitored based on measures such as sensitivity of net interest income (NII), sensitivity of market value of equity (MVE), and Value-at-Risk (VaR) across a range of time horizons. ALCO provides first line management oversight and is responsible for approving strategies and activities within the risk appetite, overseeing balance sheet resources, and reviewing reporting such as stress test results. The MLRC provides second line oversight and is responsible for approving sub-policies and procedures, establishing and monitoring risk metrics, and approving methodologies and key assumptions that drive market risk measurement. Interest Rate Risk Overview Interest rate risk is the risk to NII, associated with the balance sheet, or MVE due to changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates can have a positive or negative impact on NII depending on the positioning of assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet instruments. Changes in interest rates also can impact the values of assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet positions, which indirectly impact the MVE. To mitigate interest rate risk, the structure of the balance sheet is managed so that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities (adjusted for hedges) are highly correlated, which allows Northern Trust interest-bearing assets and liabilities to contribute to NII even in periods of volatile interest rates. 80 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS There are four commonly recognized types of structured interest rate risk: repricing, which arises from differences in the maturity and repricing terms of assets and liabilities; yield curve, which arises from changes in the shape of the yield curve; basis, which arises from imperfect correlation in the adjustment of the rates earned and paid on different financial instruments with otherwise similar repricing characteristics; and behavioral characteristics embedded optionality, which arises from client or counterparty behavior in response to interest rate changes. Interest Rate Risk Analysis, Monitoring, and Reporting Northern Trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk: NII and MVE sensitivity. NII sensitivity provides management with a short-term view of the impact of interest rate changes on NII. MVE sensitivity provides management with a long-term view of interest rate changes on MVE as of the period-end balance sheet. Both simulation models use the same initial market interest rates and product balances. Northern Trust limits aggregate interest rate risk (as measured by the NII sensitivity and MVE sensitivity simulation techniques) to an acceptable level within the context of risk appetite. A variety of actions may be used to implement risk management strategies to modify interest rate risk including: purchase of securities; sale of securities that are classified as available for sale; issuance of senior notes and subordinated notes; collateralized borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank; placing and taking Eurodollar time deposits; and hedges with various types of derivative financial instruments. NII Sensitivity The modeling of NII sensitivity incorporates on-balance-sheet positions, as well as derivative financial instruments (principally interest rate swaps) that are used to manage interest rate risk. Northern Trust uses market implied forward interest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity (i.e. change) of a static balance sheet to changes in interest rates. Stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates, nonparallel (i.e. twist) changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter, and changes to the relationship among the yield curves (i.e. basis risk). The NII sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments. These assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior. The simulation cannot precisely estimate NII sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions; therefore, there could be a change in NII sensitivity to the extent that actual behavior differs from that assumed. The following key assumptions are incorporated into the NII simulation: the balance sheet size and mix remains constant over the simulation horizon with maturing assets and liabilities replaced with instruments with similar terms as those that are maturing, with the exception of certain nonmaturity deposits that are considered short-term in nature and therefore receive a more conservative interest-bearing treatment; prepayments on mortgage loans and securities collateralized by mortgages are projected under each rate scenario using a third-party mortgage analytics system that incorporates market prepayment assumptions; cash flows for structured securities are estimated using a third-party vendor in conjunction with the prepayments provided by the third-party mortgage analytics vendor; nonmaturity deposit pricing and lives are projected based on Northern Trust actual historical patterns and management judgment, depending upon the availability of historical data and current pricing strategies/or judgment; and new business rates are based on current spreads to market indices. 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 81 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table shows the estimated NII impact over the next twelve months of 100 and 200 basis point upward movements in interest rates relative to forward rates. Each rate movement is assumed to occur gradually over a one-year period. Given the low level of interest rates, the simulation of NII for rates 100 and 200 basis points lower would not provide meaningful results. TABLE 42: NET INTEREST INCOME SENSITIVITY AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 ($ In Millions) INCREASE/(DECREASE) ESTIMATED IMPACT ON NEXT TWELVE MONTHS OF NET INTEREST INCOME INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES ABOVE MARKET IMPLIED FORWARD RATES 100 Basis Points $ 102 200 Basis Points 161 The NII sensitivity analysis does not incorporate any management actions that may be used to mitigate adverse effects of actual interest rate movement. For that reason and others, the estimated impacts do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as estimates of interest rate risk. NII sensitivity is not comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided. Further, the estimated impacts presented above are not directly comparable to those presented in prior periods due to changes to client deposit pricing assumptions and the implementation of interest rate risk model enhancements. MVE Sensitivity MVE is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities, net of the value of instruments that are used to manage the interest rate risk of balance sheet items. The potential effect of interest rate changes on MVE is derived from the impact of such changes on projected future cash flows and the present value of these cash flows and is then compared to the established limit. Northern Trust uses current market rates (and the future rates implied by these market rates) as the base case and measures MVE sensitivity under various rate scenarios. Stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates, nonparallel (i.e. twist) changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter, and changes to the relationship among the yield curves (i.e. basis risk). The MVE sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments. These assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior. The simulation cannot precisely estimate MVE sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions; therefore, there could be a change in MVE sensitivity to the extent that actual behavior differs from the incorporated assumptions. Many of the assumptions that apply to NII sensitivity also apply to MVE sensitivity simulations, with the following separate key assumptions incorporated into the MVE simulation: the present value of nonmaturity deposits are estimated using remaining lives, which are based on a combination of Northern Trust actual historical runoff patterns and management judgment - some balances are assumed to be core and have longer lives while other balances are assumed to be temporary and have comparatively shorter lives; and the present values of most noninterest-related balances (such as receivables, equipment, and payables) are the same as their book values. The following table shows the estimated impact on MVE of 100 and 200 basis point shocks up from current market implied forward rates. Given the low level of interest rates and assumed interest rate floors as rates approach zero, the simulation of MVE for rates 100 or 200 basis points lower would not provide meaningful results. TABLE 43: MARKET VALUE OF EQUITY SENSITIVITY AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 ($ In Millions) INCREASE/(DECREASE) ESTIMATED IMPACT ON MARKET VALUE OF EQUITY INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES ABOVE MARKET IMPLIED FORWARD RATES 100 Basis Points $ 383 200 Basis Points 258 82 2017 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation Table of Contents MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The MVE simulations do not incorporate any management actions that may be used to mitigate adverse effects of actual interest rate movements. For that reason and others, the estimated impacts do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as estimates of interest rate risk. MVE sensitivity is not comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided. Further, the estimated impacts presented above are not directly comparable to those presented in prior periods due to changes to client deposit pricing assumptions and the implementation of interest rate risk model enhancements. During the year ended December 31, 2017 , Northern Trust did not exceed its NII sensitivity limits or its MVE sensitivity limits. Foreign Currency Risk Overview Northern Trust's balance sheet is exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of its holdings of non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities, investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries, and future non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue and expense. To manage currency exposures on the balance sheet, Northern Trust attempts to match its assets and liabilities by currency. If those currency offsets do not exist on the balance sheet, Northern Trust will use foreign exchange derivative contracts to mitigate its currency exposure. Foreign exchange contracts are also used to reduce Northern Trust currency exposure to future non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue and expense. In addition, Northern Trust provides foreign exchange services to clients. Most of these services are provided in connection with Northern Trust growing global custody business. In the normal course of business Northern Trust also engages in trading of non-U.S. currencies for its own account. Both activities are considered trading activities. The primary market risk associated with global foreign exchange trading activities is foreign exchange risk. Foreign currency trading positions exist when aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the U.S. dollar do not offset each other in amount, or offset each other over different time periods. Foreign Currency Risk Measurement Northern Trust measures daily the risk of loss associated with all non-U.S. currency positions using a VaR model and applying the historical simulation methodology. This statistical model provides estimates, based on a variety of high confidence levels, of the potential loss in value that might be incurred if an adverse shift in non-U.S. currency exchange rates were to occur over a small number of days. The model incorporates foreign currency and interest rate volatilities and correlations in price movements among the currencies. VaR is computed for each trading desk and for the global portfolio. VaR measures are computed in a vended software application which reads foreign exchange positions from Northern Trust trading systems each day. Data vendors provide foreign exchange rates and interest rates for all currencies. The Risk Management function monitors on a daily basis VaR model inputs and outputs for reasonableness. Foreign Currency Risk Monitoring, Reporting and Analysis Northern Trust monitors several variations of the foreign exchange VaR measures to meet specific regulatory and internal management needs. Variations include different methodologies (historical, variance-covariance and Monte Carlo), equally weighted and exponentially weighted volatilities, horizons of one day and ten days, confidence levels ranging from 95% to 99.95% and look back periods of one year and four years. Those alternative measures provide management an array of corroborating metrics and alternative perspectives on Northern Trust market risks. Automated daily reports are produced and distributed to business managers and risk managers. The Risk Management function also reviews and reports several variations of the VaR measures in historical time series format to provide management with a historical perspective on risk. The table below presents the levels of total regulatory VaR and its subcomponents for global foreign currency in the years indicated below, based on the historical simulation methodology, a 99% confidence level, a one-day horizon and equally weighted volatility. The total VaR for foreign currency is typically less than the sum of its two components due to diversification benefits derived from the two subcomponents.

Other Nonmaterial Trading Activities Market risk associated with other trading activities is negligible. Northern Trust broker-dealer, Northern Trust Securities, Inc., maintains a small portfolio of trading securities held for customer accommodation purposes which averaged $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 . Northern Trust is also party to interest rate derivative contracts consisting mostly of interest rate swaps entered into to meet clients interest rate management needs, but also including a small number of caps, floors, and swaptions (an option to enter into an interest rate swap). All interest rate derivative transactions are executed by the Treasury department. When Northern Trust enters into client transactions, its practice is to mitigate the resulting market risk with offsetting interbank derivative transactions with matching terms and maturities. Strategic Risk Strategic risk is the vulnerability of the organization to internal or external developments that render corporate strategy ineffective or unachievable. The consequences of strategic risk can be diminished long-term earnings and capital, as well as reputational damage to the firm. Strategic risk includes the following three subcategories: Macroeconomic and geopolitical risk, which centers on events or themes that would have a significant, detrimental impact on financial markets, and by extension, financial services firms. Episodes of this kind would tend to have general, as opposed to idiosyncratic, consequences. Business risk, which arises from change in the following areas: Internal: situations within Northern Trust that threaten business continuity, profitability, or the achievement of strategic objectives Secular: behavioral or technological change that affects clients and renders a Northern Trust process or service obsolete Competitive: new products or shifts in the industry landscape that challenge Northern Trust performance Regulatory: changes to prudential or fiscal policy that have an adverse impact on Northern Trust or its clients Reputation risk, which is a residual risk which arises from negative perception on the part of clients, counterparties, stockholders, investors, debt holders, market analysts, regulators, staff, or other relevant parties that adversely affects Northern Trust ability to conduct its businesses or to access sources of funding. Strategic Risk Framework and Governance Northern Trust maintains a framework that consists of risk management policies, frameworks and practices designed to identify, analyze, and limit, where possible, the sources and negative consequences of strategic risk. The Strategic Risk Management function is responsible for defining the strategic risk framework and providing independent oversight of the framework across Northern Trust. In furtherance of this effort, Northern Trust has established governance and strategic planning processes for review and effective challenge, where appropriate, of business strategy and new products. In addition, Northern Trust maintains a Global Stress Testing Framework which governs stress testing exercises conducted by Northern Trust businesses and enterprise tabletop exercises that examine the consequences of macroeconomic or geopolitical shocks. Northern Trust also maintains the Global Emergency Response Plan, which guides its reaction to adverse external events if they arise. Both GERC and the Business Risk Committee are responsible for reviewing the general methods, guidelines and policies by which Northern Trust monitors and controls strategic risk.

RECONCILIATION TO FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT The following table presents a reconciliation of interest income, net interest income, net interest margin, and total revenue prepared in accordance with GAAP to such measures on an FTE basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes this presentation provides a clearer indication of these financial measures for comparative purposes. When adjusted to an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income.
