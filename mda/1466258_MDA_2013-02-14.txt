Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information, including our financial statements and the notes thereto, which appears elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview Organization We are a diversified, global company that provides products, services and solutions to enhance the quality and comfort of air in homes and buildings, transport and protect food and perishables, secure homes and commercial properties, and increase industrial productivity and efficiency. Our business segments consist of Climate Solutions, Residential Solutions, Industrial Technologies and Security Technologies, each with strong brands and leading positions within their respective markets. We generate revenue and cash primarily through the design, manufacture, sale and service of a diverse portfolio of industrial and commercial products that include well-recognized, premium brand names such as Club Car , Ingersoll-Rand , Schlage , Thermo King and Trane . To achieve our mission of being a world leader in creating safe, comfortable and efficient environments, we continue to focus on increasing our recurring revenue stream from parts, service, used equipment and rentals; and to continuously improve the efficiencies and capabilities of the products and services of our businesses. We also continue to focus on operational excellence strategies as a central theme to improving our earnings and cash flows. Trends and Economic Events We are a global corporation with worldwide operations. As a global business, our operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic factors, as well as political factors, wherever we operate or do business. Our geographic and industry diversity, as well as the diversity of our product sales and services, has helped mitigate the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on our consolidated operating results. Given the broad range of products manufactured and geographic markets served, management uses a variety of factors to predict the outlook for the Company. We monitor key competitors and customers in order to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future. In addition, our order rates are indicative of future revenue and thus a key measure of anticipated performance. In those industry segments where we are a capital equipment provider, revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers, who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy. Current market conditions, including challenges in international markets, continue to impact our financial results. The uneven commercial new construction activity in the United States and Europe is negatively impacting the results of our Security Technologies segment and commercial Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) business. However, we believe the commercial HVAC equipment replacement and aftermarket is slowly recovering. We have seen moderate growth in the American and Asian industrial markets, and the North American refrigerated transport market. While U.S. residential and consumer markets continue to be a challenge as new single-family housing construction and consumer confidence remain at low levels, we are beginning to see moderate improvements in the U.S. new builder and replacement markets. The residential HVAC business also continues to be impacted by a mix shift to units with a lower Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating (SEER). As economic conditions stabilize, we expect slight revenue growth along with benefits from restructuring and productivity programs. Despite the current market environment, we believe we have a solid foundation of global brands and leading market shares in all of our major product lines. Our growing geographic and industry diversity coupled with our large installed product base provides growth opportunities within our service, parts and replacement revenue streams. In addition, we are investing substantial resources to innovate and develop new products and services which we expect will drive our future growth. Venezuela Devaluation In February 2013, the government of Venezuela announced a devaluation of the Bolivar, from the preexisting exchange rate of 4.29 Bolivars to the U.S. dollar to 6.3 Bolivars to the U.S. dollar. We have two subsidiaries with significant operations in Venezuela. As a result of the devaluation, we are estimating a foreign currency loss of approxima tely $10 million in th e first quarter of 2013. The February devaluation did not impact our 2012 results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. Further devaluation of the Bolivar could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. For additional information, see Part I, Item 1(a), Risk Factors in this Form 10-K. 24 Table of Contents Significant events in 2012 Proposed Spin-Off Transaction In December 2012, our Board of Directors announced a plan to spin off our commercial and residential security businesses (the New Security Company). The separation will result in two standalone companies: Ingersoll Rand, a world leader in creating comfortable, sustainable and efficient environments through its industrial, transport refrigeration, and HVAC businesses; and the New Security Company, a leading global provider of electronic and mechanical security products and services, delivering comprehensive solutions to commercial and residential customers. This new company portfolio of brands will include Schlage, LCN , Von Duprin , Interflex , CISA , Briton , Bricard , BOCOM Systems, Dexter , Kryptonite , Falcon and Fusion Hardware Group. We expect the spin-off, which is intended to be tax free to shareholders, to be completed prior to year-end 2013. However, the completion of the spin-off is subject to certain customary conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals, receipt of a ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service as to the tax-free nature of the spin-off, as well as certain other matters relating to the spin-off, receipt of legal opinions, execution of intercompany agreements, effectiveness of appropriate filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and final approval of the transactions contemplated by the spin-off, as may be required under Irish law. There can be no assurance that any separation transaction will ultimately occur, or, if one does occur, its terms or timing. Upon completion of the spin-off, Ingersoll-Rand plc (IR-Ireland) will cease to have any ownership interest in the New Security Company, and the New Security Company will become an independent publicly traded company. The New Security Company is anticipated to be an Irish public limited company (plc). The disclosures within this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations do not take into account the proposed spin-off of the commercial and residential security businesses. 2012 Dividend Increase and 2013 Share Repurchase Program In December 2012, we announced an increase in our quarterly stock dividend from $ 0.16 to $ 0.21 per share beginning with our March 2013 payment. The dividend is payable March 28, 2013, to shareholders of record on March 12, 2013. In December 2012, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $ 2.0 billion of our ordinary shares under a new share repurchase program upon completion of the current share repurchase program. The new share repurchase program is expected to begin in 2013. These repurchases will be accounted for as a reduction of Ordinary shares and Capital in excess of par value as they will be canceled upon repurchase. 2011 Share Repurchase Program In April 2011, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $ 2.0 billion of our ordinary shares under a new share repurchase program. On June 8, 2011, we commenced share repurchases under this program. During the year ended December 31, 2012 , we repurchased 18.4 million shares for approximately $ 0.8 billion , excluding commissions. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we repurchased 36.3 million shares for approximately $ 1.2 billion , excluding commissions. These repurchases were accounted for as a reduction of Ordinary shares and Capital in excess of par value as they were canceled upon repurchase. Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Amendments On June 8, 2012, our Board of Directors approved amendments to our retirement plans for certain U.S. and Puerto Rico non-bargained employees. Eligible non-bargained employees hired prior to July 1, 2012 were given a choice of remaining in their respective defined benefit plan until the plan freezes on December 31, 2022 or freezing their accrued benefits in their respective defined benefit plan as of December 31, 2012 and receiving an additional 2% non-matching Company contribution into the Company's applicable defined contribution plan. Eligible employees hired or rehired on or after July 1, 2012 will automatically receive the 2% non-matching Company contribution into the applicable defined contribution plan in lieu of participating in the defined benefit plan. Beginning January 1, 2023, all eligible employees will receive the 2% non-matching contribution into the applicable defined contribution plan. On February 1, 2012, our Board of Directors approved amendments to our postretirement medical plan with respect to post-65 retiree medical coverage. Effective January 1, 2013, we discontinued offering company-sponsored retiree medical coverage for certain individuals age 65 and older. We transitioned affected individuals to coverage through the individual Medicare market and will provide a tax-advantaged subsidy to those retirees eligible for subsidized company coverage that can be used toward reimbursing premiums and other qualified medical expenses for individual Medicare supplemental coverage that is purchased through our third-party Medicare coordinator. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of these amendments. 25 Table of Contents Significant events in 2011 Dividend Increase In April 2011, we increased our quarterly stock dividend from $ 0.07 to $ 0.12 per share beginning with our June 2011 payment. In December 2011, we announced an increase in our quarterly stock dividend from $ 0.12 per share to $ 0.16 per share beginning with our March 2012 payment. Discontinued Operations On December 30, 2011, we completed the divestiture of our security installation and service business, which was sold under the Integrated Systems and Services brand in the United States and Canada, to Kratos Public Safety & Security Solutions, Inc. As a result of the sale, we have reported this business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. See "Divestitures and Discontinued Operations" within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and also Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our discontinued operations. Divested Operations On September 30, 2011 and November 30, 2011, we completed transactions to sell our Hussmann refrigerated display case business to a newly-formed affiliate (Hussmann Parent) of private equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice, LLC (CD&R). These transactions included the equipment business and certain of the service branches in the U.S. and Canada, and the equipment, service and installation businesses in Mexico, Chile, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan (Hussmann Business) and the remaining North American Hussmann service and installation branches (Hussmann Branches). We negotiated the final terms of the transaction to include our ownership of a portion of the common stock of Hussmann Parent, which represents significant continuing involvement. Therefore, the results of Hussmann are included in continuing operations for all periods presented, with our ownership interest reported using the equity method of accounting subsequent to September 30, 2011. See "Divestitures and Discontinued Operations" within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and also Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our divested operations. Significant events in 2010 Discontinued Operations On December 30, 2010, we completed the divestiture of our gas microturbine generator business, which was sold under the Energy Systems brand, to Flex Energy, Inc. As a result of the sale, we have reported this business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. On October 4, 2010, we completed the divestiture of our European refrigerated display case business, which was sold under the KOXKA brand, to an affiliate of American Industrial Acquisition Corporation (AIAC Group). As a result of the sale, we have reported this business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. See "Divestitures and Discontinued Operations" within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and also Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our discontinued operations. Healthcare Reform In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Bill of 2010 (collectively, the Healthcare Reform Legislation) were signed into law. As a result, effective 2013, the tax benefits available to us are reduced to the extent our prescription drug expenses are reimbursed under the Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy program. Although the provisions of the Healthcare Reform Legislation relating to the retiree drug subsidy program did not take effect until 2013, we were required to recognize the full accounting impact in our financial statements in the reporting period in which the Healthcare Reform Legislation was enacted. As retiree healthcare liabilities and related tax impacts were already reflected in our financial statements, the Healthcare Reform Legislation resulted in a non-cash charge to income tax expense in the first quarter of 2010 of $ 40.5 million . Currently, our retiree medical plans receive the retiree drug subsidy under Medicare Part D. No later than 2014, a significant portion of the drug coverage will be moved to a Medicare-approved Employer Group Waiver Plan while retaining the same benefit provisions. This change resulted in an actuarial gain which decreased our December 31, 2010 retiree medical plan liability, as well as the net actuarial losses in other comprehensive income by $ 41.1 million . 26 Table of Contents Results of Operations - For the years ended December 31 Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data 2012 % of Revenues 2011 % of Revenues 2010 % of Revenues Net revenues $ 14,034.9 $ 14,782.0 $ 14,001.1 Cost of goods sold (9,758.2 ) 69.5% (10,493.6 ) 71.0% (10,059.9 ) 71.9% Selling and administrative expenses (2,776.0 ) 19.8% (2,781.2 ) 18.8% (2,679.8 ) 19.1% Gain (loss) on sale/asset impairment 4.5 % (646.9 ) 4.4% % Operating income 1,505.2 10.7% 860.3 5.8% 1,261.4 9.0% Interest expense (253.5 ) (280.0 ) (283.2 ) Other, net 25.0 33.0 32.5 Earnings before income taxes 1,276.7 613.3 1,010.7 Provision for income taxes (227.0 ) (187.2 ) (228.1 ) Earnings from continuing operations 1,049.7 426.1 782.6 Discontinued operations, net of tax (5.7 ) (56.8 ) (117.5 ) Net earnings 1,044.0 369.3 665.1 Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (25.4 ) (26.1 ) (22.9 ) Net earnings attributable to Ingersoll-Rand plc $ 1,018.6 $ 343.2 $ 642.2 Diluted net earnings (loss) per ordinary share attributable to Ingersoll-Rand plc ordinary shareholders: Continuing operations $ 3.30 $ 1.18 $ 2.24 Discontinued operations (0.02 ) (0.17 ) (0.35 ) Net earnings $ 3.28 $ 1.01 $ 1.89 Net Revenues Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by 5.1% , or $ 747.1 million , compared with the same period of 2011 , which primarily resulted from the following: Pricing 1.6 % Volume/product mix 0.3 % Currency exchange rates (1.5 )% Hussmann (5.5 )% Total (5.1 )% The decrease in revenues was primarily driven by the absence of Hussmann for the year ended December 31, 2012, which contributed $ 818.5 million of revenue in the same period in 2011. This decrease was partially offset by improved pricing across all segments and higher volumes within the Residential Solutions and Industrial Technologies business segments. 27 Table of Contents Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by 5.6% , or $ 780.9 million , compared with the same period of 2010 , which primarily resulted from the following: Volume/product mix 2.7 % Pricing 2.7 % Currency exchange rates 1.6 % Acquisitions/divestitures 0.1 % Hussmann * (1.5 )% Total 5.6 % * Represents the impact of a partial year of operations for the Hussmann Business and Branches in 2011. The increase in revenues was primarily driven by higher volumes and product mix experienced within the Climate Solutions and Industrial Technologies business segments, as well as improved pricing and favorable foreign currency impacts across all segments. Operating Income/Margin Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased to 10.7% from 5.8% for the same period in 2011 . Included in Operating income for 2011 is a $ 646.9 million loss on sale/asset impairment charge related to the divestiture of Hussmann, which had a 4.4 point impact on 2011 operating margin. Excluding the loss on sale/asset impairment, operating margin increased by 0.5 points. The increase was primarily due to improved pricing in excess of material inflation and realization of productivity benefits in excess of other inflation across all sectors. These increases were partially offset by increased investment spending, lower volumes in our Climate Solutions and Security Technologies business segments, and unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Also included in Operating income for 2011 is a $ 23 million gain associated with the sale of assets from a restructured business in China. This gain had a 0.2 point impact on operating margin for 2011. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased to 5.8% from 9.0% for the same period in 2010 . Included in Operating income for 2011 is a $ 646.9 million loss on sale/asset impairment charge related to the divestiture of Hussmann, which had a 4.4 point impact on 2011 operating margin. Excluding the loss on sale/asset impairment, operating margin increased by 1.2 points. The increase was primarily due to improved pricing in excess of material inflation across all sectors, the realization of productivity benefits in excess of other inflation, and higher volumes in our Climate Solutions and Industrial Technologies business segments. These improvements were partially offset by unfavorable volume/product mix within our Residential Solutions and Security Technologies segments as well as increased investment spending. Also included in Operating income for 2011 is a $ 23 million gain associated with the sale of assets from a restructured business in China. This gain had a 0.2 point impact on operating margin for 2011. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by $ 26.5 million compared with the same period of 2011 as a result of lower average debt balances in 2012 . Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased $ 3.2 million compared with the same period of 2010 as a result of lower average debt balances in 2011 . Other, Net The components of Other, net, for the year ended December 31 are as follows: In millions 2012 2011 2010 Interest income $ 16.3 $ 25.9 $ 15.2 Exchange gain (loss) (2.8 ) 2.8 0.9 Earnings (loss) from equity investments (5.9 ) (3.5 ) Other 17.4 7.8 16.4 Other, net $ 25.0 $ 33.0 $ 32.5 For the year ended December 31, 2012 , Other, net decreased by $ 8.0 million compared with the same period of 2011 . The decrease in Other, net resulted primarily from decreased interest income due to lower average cash balances in 2012 , foreign currency losses, and an equity loss on the Hussmann equity investment of $ 5.9 million in 2012 compared to $ 3.5 million in 2011. These 28 Table of Contents decreases were partially offset by other activity primarily related to adjustments to actual and expected insurance recoveries as a result of a settlement. For the year ended December 31, 2011 , Other, net increased by $ 0.5 million compared with the same period of 2010 . The increase in Other, net resulted from favorable currency impacts and increased interest income as a result of higher average cash balances during 2011. Included within Earnings (loss) from equity investments is a $ 3.5 million equity loss on the Hussmann equity investment for 2011 incurred subsequent to the Hussmann divestiture transaction dates. Provision for Income Taxes The 2012 tax provision of $ 227.0 million included a $2.6 million Hussmann-related tax charge. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the effective tax rate, excluding the Hussmann Loss on sale/asset impairment and the Hussmann-related tax charge, was 17.6% compared to 21.9% in 2011, when excluding the Hussmann-related tax benefit discussed below. The 2012 tax rate was below the U.S. Statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which, in aggregate, have a lower effective rate and a net reduction in non-U.S. valuation allowances, partially offset by net increases in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and a non-cash charge to income tax expense related to the required tax accounting between the enactment date of March 30, 2010 and the effective date of January 1, 2013 of the Healthcare Reform Legislation. The 2011 tax provision of $ 187.2 million included an $ 88.9 million Hussmann-related tax benefit. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the effective tax rate, excluding the Hussmann Loss on sale/asset impairment and the Hussmann-related tax benefit, was 21.9% compared to 22.6% in 2010. The 2011 tax rate was below the U.S. Statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which, in aggregate, have a lower effective rate and net changes in our valuation allowances, partially offset by the accrual of a previously unrecorded future withholding tax liability and net increases in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits. Included in the 2010 effective rate was a $40.5 million non-cash charge to income tax expense related to the Healthcare Reform Legislation, partially offset by net changes in our valuation allowance. Review of Business Segments The segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each segment included in continuing operations. Segment operating income is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for performance reviews, compensation and resource allocation. For these reasons, we believe that Segment operating income represents the most relevant measure of segment profit and loss. We may exclude certain charges or gains from Operating income to arrive at a Segment operating income that is a more meaningful measure of profit and loss upon which to base our operating decisions. We define Segment operating margin as Segment operating income as a percentage of Net revenues. Climate Solutions Our Climate Solutions segment delivers energy-efficient refrigeration and HVAC throughout the world. Encompassing the transport refrigeration markets as well as the commercial HVAC markets, this segment offers customers a broad range of products, services and solutions to manage controlled temperature environments. This segment includes the market-leading brands of Thermo King and Trane. On September 30, 2011 and November 30, 2011, we completed transactions to sell Hussmann to a newly-formed affiliate (Hussmann Parent) of private equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice, LLC (CD&R). As part of the deal terms we have an ongoing equity interest in Hussmann Parent, therefore operating results continue to be recorded within continuing operations. However, subsequent to the respective transaction dates our earnings from this equity interest are not reported in Segment operating income. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded a pre-tax loss on sale and asset impairment charges related to the Hussmann divestiture totaling $ 646.9 million . These charges, as well as related adjustments recorded in 2012, have been excluded from Segment operating income within the Climate Solutions segment as management excludes these charges from Operating income when making operating decisions about the business. See "Divestitures and Discontinued Operations" within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and also Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our divested operations. 29 Table of Contents 2011 Net revenues and Segment operating income for the Climate Solutions segment includes the operating results of the Hussmann Business and Branches prior to the sale. The operating results for the Hussmann Business and Branches are included in Net revenues and Segment operating income for the Climate Solutions segment for the years ended December 31 as follows: In millions 2011 2010 Net revenues $ 818.5 $ 1,106.1 Segment operating income $ 58.6 $ 84.4 On October 4, 2010, we completed the divestiture of our European refrigerated display case business, which was sold under the KOXKA brand, to an affiliate of American Industrial Acquisition Corporation (AIAC Group). As a result of the sale, we have reported this business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. Segment information has been revised to exclude the results of this business for all periods presented. Segment results for the years ended December 31 were as follows: Dollar amounts in millions 2012 % change 2011 % change 2010 Net revenues $ 7,409.1 (10.6)% $ 8,284.6 6.2% $ 7,800.8 Segment operating income 768.1 (6.9)% 824.6 37.8% 598.3 Segment operating margin 10.4 % 10.0 % 7.7 % 2012 vs 2011 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by 10.6% or $ 875.5 million , compared with the same period of 2011 , which primarily resulted from the following: Pricing 1.4 % Volume/product mix (0.6 )% Currency exchange rates (1.5 )% Hussmann (9.9 )% Total (10.6 )% Our Trane commercial HVAC business continues to be impacted by weakness in the worldwide commercial building markets. Trane commercial HVAC revenues increased as growth within our parts, services and solutions markets offset declines in equipment and systems in Europe and Asia. Net revenues in our transport businesses decreased driven by declines in sea-going container revenues. Growth in the Americas was more than offset by declines in Europe. Segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by 6.9% , or $ 56.5 million , compared with the same period of 2011 . Included in 2011 Segment operating income is $ 58.6 million of income related to Hussmann and a $ 23 million gain associated with the sale of assets from a restructured business in China. Segment operating margin improved to 10.4% due to pricing improvements in excess of material inflation ($127 million) and productivity benefits in excess of other inflation ($22 million), partially offset by unfavorable volume/product mix ($45 million), increased investment spending ($52 million), and unfavorable currency impacts ($28 million). 2011 vs 2010 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by 6.2% or $ 483.8 million , compared with the same period of 2010 , which primarily resulted from the following: Volume/product mix 4.6 % Pricing 2.3 % Currency exchange rates 1.8 % Acquisitions/divestitures 0.1 % Hussmann * (2.6 )% Total 6.2 % * Represents the impact of a partial year of operations for the Hussmann Business and Branches in 2011. 30 Table of Contents Trane commercial HVAC revenues reflect market recovery within our equipment, systems, parts, services and solutions markets. Trane commercial HVAC revenues increased in all major geographic regions, with strong year-over-year improvements in the Americas, Asia, and Europe. Net revenues in our transport businesses experienced growth in most geographic areas due to improved activity within the refrigerated trailer and truck markets. In addition, sea-going container revenues and worldwide bus revenues improved due to an increase in end-market activity. Segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by 37.8% , or $ 226.3 million , compared with the same period of 2010 . The increase, which improved Segment operating margin to 10.0% from 7.7% , was primarily related to pricing improvements in excess of material inflation ($36 million), productivity benefits in excess of other inflation ($115 million), and favorable volumes/product mix ($90 million). However, the benefits resulting from these improvements were partially offset by increased investment spending ($28 million) and the impacts of only a partial year of operations for the Hussmann Business and Branches in 2011 ($10 million). Included in Segment operating income for 2011 was a $ 23 million gain associated with the sale of assets from a restructured business in China. This gain had a 0.3 point impact on Segment operating margin. Residential Solutions Our Residential Solutions segment provides safety, comfort and efficiency to homeowners throughout North America and parts of South America. It offers customers a broad range of products, services and solutions including mechanical and electronic locks, energy-efficient HVAC systems, indoor air quality solutions, advanced controls, portable security systems and remote home management. This segment is comprised of well-known brands like American Standard , Schlage and Trane. Segment results for the years ended December 31 were as follows: Dollar amounts in millions 2012 % change 2011 % change 2010 Net revenues $ 2,054.4 2.1% $ 2,012.7 (5.1)% $ 2,121.7 Segment operating income 115.4 85.8% 62.1 (67.5)% 191.3 Segment operating margin 5.6 % 3.1 % 9.0 % 2012 vs 2011 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by 2.1% or $ 41.7 million , compared with the same period of 2011 , which primarily resulted from the following: Pricing 1.4 % Volume/product mix 0.7 % Total 2.1 % Trane residential HVAC revenues increased due to improved activity levels in both the new residential construction and replacement markets. These improvements were slightly offset by a continued mix shift to lower SEER units. Residential security revenues increased as a result of improved sales to new builder markets and South American customers. Segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by 85.8% , or $ 53.3 million , compared with the same period of 2011 . The increase, which improved Segment operating margin to 5.6% from 3.1% , was primarily driven by productivity benefits in excess of other inflation ($63 million) and pricing improvements in excess of material inflation ($28 million). These improvements were partially offset by unfavorable volume/product mix ($46 million). 2011 vs 2010 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased by 5.1% or $ 109.0 million , compared with the same period of 2010 , which primarily resulted from the following: Volume/product mix (10.5 )% Pricing 5.1 % Currency exchange rates 0.3 % Total (5.1 )% 31 Table of Contents Trane residential HVAC revenues were impacted by continued weakness in the U.S. new residential construction and replacement markets as well as a mix shift to lower SEER units. Residential security revenues increased as a result of improved sales to new builder markets and big box customers primarily during the fourth quarter. Segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased by 67.5% , or $ 129.2 million , compared with the same period of 2010 . The decrease, which lowered Segment operating margins to 3.1% from 9.0% , was primarily related to unfavorable volumes/product mix ($155 million), partially offset by pricing improvements in excess of material inflation ($41 million). Industrial Technologies Our Industrial Technologies segment provides products, services and solutions that improve productivity, energy efficiency, safety, and operations. It offers global customers a diverse and innovative range of products including compressed air systems, power tools, pumps, material handling equipment, and golf, utility, and rough terrain vehicles. It also provides a range of service offerings including preventative maintenance and comprehensive care multi-year contracts, service parts, installation, remanufactured compressors and tools, and solutions to optimize customers' energy and total production costs. This segment includes the Ingersoll-Rand, Club Car, and ARO market-leading brands. On December 30, 2010, we completed the divestiture of our gas microturbine generator business, which was sold under the Energy Systems brand, to Flex Energy, Inc.

The growth in the Americas was primarily driven by improved air compressor sales. Club Car revenues increased due to improved pricing and growth in the golf car and utility vehicle markets. Segment operating income increased by 9.7% , or $ 40.3 million , during 2012 . The increase, which improved Segment operating margin to 15.5% from 14.6% , was primarily driven by productivity benefits in excess of other inflation ($59 million), pricing improvements in excess of material inflation ($29 million), and favorable volume/product mix ($19 million). These improvements were partially offset by increased investment spending ($52 million) and unfavorable currency impacts ($14 million). 2011 vs 2010 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by 14.8% , or $ 367.7 million , compared with the same period of 2010 , which primarily resulted from the following: Volume/product mix 10.3 % Pricing 2.7 % Currency exchange rates 1.8 % Total 14.8 % We experienced strong growth within our Air and Productivity business primarily due to increased volume in all major geographic regions.

Divestitures and Discontinued Operations Divested Operations Hussmann Divestiture On September 30, 2011, we completed a transaction to sell our Hussmann refrigerated display case business to a newly-formed affiliate (Hussmann Parent) of private equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice, LLC (CD&R). This transaction included the equipment business and certain of the service branches in the U.S. and Canada, and the equipment, service and installation businesses in Mexico, Chile, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan (Hussmann Business). The final transaction allowed Hussmann Parent the option to acquire the remaining North American Hussmann service and installation branches (Hussmann Branches). Hussmann Parent completed the acquisition of the Hussmann Branches on November 30, 2011. The Hussmann Business and Branches, which are reported as part of the Climate Solutions segment, manufacture, market, distribute, install, and service refrigerated display merchandising equipment, refrigeration systems, over the counter parts, and other commercial and industrial refrigeration applications. The Hussmann Business divestiture was originally announced on April 21, 2011 and met the criteria for classification as held for sale treatment in accordance with GAAP during the first quarter of 2011. During the third quarter of 2011, we negotiated the final transaction to sell the Hussmann Business and Branches to CD&R in exchange for $ 370 million in cash, subject to purchase price adjustments, and common stock of Hussmann Parent, such that following the sale, CD&R would own cumulative convertible participating preferred stock of Hussmann Parent, initially representing 60% of the outstanding capital stock (on an as-converted basis) of Hussmann Parent, and we would own all of the common stock, initially representing the remaining 40% of the outstanding capital stock (on an as-converted basis) of Hussmann Parent. Our ownership of common stock of Hussmann Parent represents significant continuing involvement. Therefore, the results of the Hussmann Business and Branches are included in continuing operations for all periods presented. Based on these terms, we recorded a total pre-tax loss on sale/asset impairment charge of $ 646.9 million during the full year of 2011.

Compact Equipment manufactured and sold compact equipment, including skid-steer loaders, compact track loaders, mini-excavators and telescopic tool handlers; portable air compressors, generators and light towers; general-purpose light construction equipment; and attachments. We were in dispute regarding post-closing matters with Doosan Infracore. During the second quarter of 2011, we collected approximately $ 48.3 million of our outstanding receivable from Doosan Infracore related to certain purchase price adjus tments. During the second quarter of 2012, Doosan Infracore paid the Company a total of $ 46.5 million to settle the outstanding receivable and remaining disputed post-closing matters. Other discontinued operations, net of tax from previously sold businesses is mainly related t o postretirement benefits, product liability, worker's compensation, and legal costs (mostly asbestos-related) and tax effects of post-closing purchase price adjustments. Liquidity and Capital Resources We earn a significant amount of our operating income in jurisdictions where it is deemed to be permanently reinvested. Our most prominent jurisdiction of operation is the U.S. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate funds to the U.S., and no provision for U.S. income taxes has been made with respect to such earnings. We expect existing cash and cash equivalents available to the U.S., the cash generated by our U.S. operations, our committed credit lines as well as our expected ability to access 36 Table of Contents the capital markets will be sufficient to fund our U.S. operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents and the cash generated by our non-U.S. operations will be sufficient to fund our non-U.S. operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our U.S. operations, and we determine that repatriation of non-U.S. cash is necessary, such amounts would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes. D uring the year ended December 31, 2012, we repurchased 18.4 million shares for approximately $ 0.8 billion , excluding commissions, under our current share repurchase program. These repurchases were accounted for as a reduction of Ordinary shares and Capital in excess of par value as they were canceled upon repurchase. In December 2012, we announced an increase in our quarterly ordinary share dividend from $ 0.16 to $ 0.21 per share beginning with our March 2013 payment. In addition, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of our ordinary shares under a new share repurchase program upon completion of the current share repurchase program. These repurchases will be accounted for as a reduction of Ordinary shares and Capital in excess of par value as they will be canceled upon repurchase. We expect to commence purchases under this new repurchase program in 2013. We expect our available cash flow, committed credit lines and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to fund the increased dividend and share repurchases. In addition to the capital needs discussed above, we have debt maturities of $600 million of 6.0% senior notes in August 2013 and $655 million of 9.5% senior notes in April 2014, which we expect to refinance prior to maturity. Liquidity The following table contains several key measures to gauge our financial condition and liquidity at the periods ended December 31: In millions 2012 2011 2010 Cash and cash equivalents $ 882.1 $ 1,160.7 $ 1,014.3 Short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt 963.7 763.3 761.6 Long-term debt 2,269.3 2,879.3 2,922.3 Total debt 3,233.0 3,642.6 3,683.9 Total Ingersoll-Rand plc shareholders equity 7,147.8 6,924.3 7,964.3 Total equity 7,229.3 7,012.4 8,059.1 Debt-to-total capital ratio 30.9 % 34.2 % 31.3 % Short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt at December 31 consisted of the following: In millions 2012 2011 Debentures with put feature $ 343.0 $ 343.6 Exchangeable Senior Notes 341.2 6.000% Senior notes due 2013 600.0 Other current maturities of long-term debt 10.8 12.5 Other short-term borrowings 9.9 66.0 Total $ 963.7 $ 763.3 Commercial Paper Program The maximum aggregate amount of unsecured commercial paper notes available to be issued, on a private placement basis, under the commercial paper program is $ 2 billion as of December 31, 2012 . Under the commercial paper program, Ingersoll-Rand Global Holding Company Limited (IR-Global), may issue notes from time to time, and the proceeds of the financing will be used for general corporate purposes. Each of IR-Ireland, Ingersoll-Rand Company Limited (IR-Limited), and Ingersoll-Rand International Holding Limited (IR-International) has provided an irrevocable and unconditional guarantee for the notes issued under the commercial paper program. We had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 . 37 Table of Contents Debentures with Put Feature At December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 , we had outstanding $343.0 million and $ 343.6 million , respectively, of fixed rate debentures which only require early repayment at the option of the holder. These debentures contain a put feature that the holders may exercise on each anniversary of the issuance date. If exercised, we are obligated to repay in whole or in part, at the holder option, the outstanding principal amount (plus accrued and unpaid interest) of the debentures held by the holder. If these options are not exercised, the final maturity dates would range between 2027 and 2028 . On February 15, 2012, holders of these debentures had the option to exercise the put feature on $ 37.2 million of the outstanding debentures. No holder chose to exercise the put feature at that date. On October 15, 2012, holders of these debentures had the option to exercise the put feature on $ 306.4 million of the outstanding debentures. Holders chose to exercise the put feature on $ 0.6 million of the outstanding debentures at that date, and were paid in November 2012. Based on our cash flow forecast and access to the capital markets, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to repay any amounts exercised as a result of the put features. Exchangeable Senior Notes Due 2012 In April 2009, we issued $ 345 million of 4.5% Exchangeable Senior Notes (the Notes) through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IR-Global. We settled all remaining outstanding Notes during 2012. As a result, we paid $ 357.0 million in cash and issued 10.8 million ordinary shares to settle the principal, interest and equity portion of the Notes. Other On May 26, 2010, we entered into a 3-year, $ 1.0 billion revolving credit facility through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IR-Global. On March 15, 2012, this credit facility was refinanced with a 5-year, $ 1.0 billion revolving credit facility maturing on March 15, 2017 . We also have a 4-year, $1.0 billion revolving credit facility maturing on May 20, 2015 , through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IR-Global. Each of IR-Ireland, IR-Limited and IR-International has provided an irrevocable and unconditional guarantee for these credit facilities. The total committed revolving credit facilities of $ 2.0 billion are unused and provide support for our commercial paper program as well as for other general corporate purposes. In addition, other available non-U.S. lines of credit were $ 933.3 million , of which $ 705.4 million was unused at December 31, 2012 . These lines provide support for bank guarantees, letters of credit and other general corporate purposes. Pension Plans Our investment objective in managing defined benefit plan assets is to ensure that all present and future benefit obligations are met as they come due. We seek to achieve this goal while trying to mitigate volatility in plan funded status, contribution and expense by better matching the characteristics of the plan assets to that of the plan liabilities. Prior to 2011, we utilized asset/liability modeling studies as the basis for global asset allocation decisions. In 2011, we adopted a dynamic approach to asset allocation whereby a plan's allocation to fixed income assets increases progressively over time towards an ultimate target of 90% as a plan moves toward full funding. We monitor plan funded status and asset allocation regularly in addition to investment manager performance. We monitor the impact of market conditions on our defined benefit plans on a regular basis. During 2012 , none of our defined benefit pension plans have experienced a significant impact on their liquidity due to the volatility in the markets. For further details on pension plan activity, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash Flows The following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for the years ended December 31, respectively. For additional details, please see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the Consolidated Financial Statements. In millions 2012 2011 2010 Operating cash flow provided by (used in) continuing operations $ 1,277.7 $ 1,230.2 $ 756.4 Investing cash flow provided by (used in) continuing operations (146.4 ) 207.5 (179.0 ) Financing cash flow provided by (used in) continuing operations (1,303.9 ) (1,246.4 ) (403.7 ) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $ 1,277.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared with $ 1,230.2 million in 2011 . Operating cash flows for 2012 and 2011 reflect consistent working capital levels and consistent earnings from continuing operations after taking into account the non-cash loss on sale/asset impairment charges related to the Hussmann divestiture. 38 Table of Contents Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $ 1,230.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with $ 756.4 million in 2010 . Operating cash flows for 2011 reflect improved earnings from continuing operations after taking into account the non-cash loss on sale/asset impairment charge related to the Hussmann divestiture. Operating cash flows for 2010 reflect discretionary cash contributions to our pension funds of $444 million ($359 million after tax benefit received). Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $ 146.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared with net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations of $ 207.5 million in 2011 . The change in investing activities is primarily attributable to decreased net proceeds from business dispositions and sale of property, plant, and equipment in 2012 compared to 2011, partially offset by a $44.3 million dividend from the Company's equity investment in Hussmann Parent in 2012. During 2011, the Company received net proceeds from business dispositions of $400.3 million related to the sale of the Hussmann Business and Branches and the collection of proceeds for purchase price adjustments on the sale of Doosan Infracore. During 2011, we also received proceeds from the sale of assets from a restructured business in China. Net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations was $ 207.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations of $ 179.0 million in 2010 . The change in investing activities is primarily attributable to net proceeds from business dispositions of $400.3 million related to the sale of the Hussmann Business and Branches and the collection of proceeds for purchase price adjustments on the sale of Doosan Infracore. We also received proceeds from the sale of assets from a restructured business in China. These proceeds were partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures during 2011. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2012 was $ 1,303.9 million , compared with $ 1,246.4 million during 2011 . The change in financing activities is primarily related to the settlement of the Exchangeable Senior Notes and increased dividend payments during 2012, partially offset by decreased share repurchases and increased proceeds from shares issued under incentive plans in 2012. Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2011 was $ 1,246.4 million , compared with $ 403.7 million during 2010 . The change in financing activities is primarily related to approximately $ 1.2 billion of share repurchases as well as increased dividend payments, partially offset by lower repayments of long term debt in 2011. Capital Resources Based on historical performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance, the cash generated from our operations, our committed credit lines and our expected ability to access capital markets will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, share repurchase programs, upcoming debt maturities, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for the foreseeable future. Capital expenditures were $ 262.6 million , $ 242.9 million and $ 179.5 million for 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Our investments continue to improve manufacturing productivity, reduce costs and provide environmental enhancements and advanced technologies for existing facilities. The capital expenditure program for 2013 is estimated to be approximately $250 million, including amounts approved in prior periods. Many of these projects are subject to review and cancellation at our option without incurring substantial charges. For financial market risk impacting the Company, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk. Capitalization In addition to cash on hand and operating cash flow, we maintain significant credit availability under our Commercial Paper Program. Our ability to borrow at a cost-effective rate under the Commercial Paper Program is contingent upon maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. As of December 31, 2012 , our credit ratings were as follows: Short-term Long-term Moody P-2 Baa1 Standard and Poor A-2 BBB+ The credit ratings set forth above are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Our public debt does not contain financial covenants and our revolving credit lines have a debt-to-total capital covenant of 65%. As of December 31, 2012 , our debt-to-total capital ratio was significantly beneath this limit. 39 Table of Contents Guarantees Subsequent to the Ireland Reorganization, IR-Ireland and IR-Limited guarantee fully and unconditionally the outstanding public debt of IR-International, IR-Global and IR-New Jersey. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations by required payment periods, in millions: Less than 1 year 1 - 3 years 3 - 5 years More than 5 years Total Short-term debt $ 9.9 $ $ $ $ 9.9 Long-term debt 953.9 * 1,168.8 16.5 1,085.0 3,224.2 Interest payments on long-term debt 214.2 259.3 198.3 385.2 1,057.0 Purchase obligations 1,001.4 1,001.4 Operating leases 132.4 187.3 103.4 49.3 472.4 Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,311.8 $ 1,615.4 $ 318.2 $ 1,519.5 $ 5,764.9 * Includes $343 million of debt redeemable at the option of the holder. The scheduled maturities of these bonds range between 2027 and 2028. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Future expected obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans, income taxes, environmental, asbestos-related, and product liability matters have not been included in the contractual cash obligations table above. Pensions At December 31, 2012 , we had net obligations of $ 918.4 million , which consist of noncurrent pension assets of $ 5.1 million and current and non-current pension benefit liabilities of $ 923.5 million . It is our objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required. We currently project that we will contribute approximately $ 102.5 million to our plans worldwide in 2013 . Because the timing and amounts of long-term funding requirements for pension obligations are uncertain, they have been excluded from the preceding table. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions At December 31, 2012 , we had postretirement benefit obligations of $ 851.4 million . We fund postretirement benefit costs principally on a pay-as-you-go basis as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations. Benefit payments, which are net of expected plan participant contributions and Medicare Part D subsidy, are expected to be approximately $ 69.3 million in 2013 . Because the timing and amounts of long-term funding requirements for postretirement obligations are uncertain, they have been excluded from the preceding table. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Income Taxes At December 31, 2012 , we have total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions of $ 533.7 million and $ 84.1 million of related accrued interest and penalties, net of tax. The liability has been excluded from the preceding table as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding matters relating to income taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax disputes. Contingent Liabilities We are involved in various litigations, claims and administrative proceedings, including those related to environmental, asbestos-related, and product liability matters. We believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities, and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time. Because the timing and amounts of potential future cash flows are uncertain, they have been excluded from the preceding table. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. See Note 9 and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on matters affecting our liquidity. Critical Accounting Policies Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. These estimates and 40 Table of Contents assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from estimates. If updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical. Allowance for doubtful accounts We have provided an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable which represents our best estimate of probable loss inherent in our accounts receivable portfolio. This estimate is based upon our policy, derived from our knowledge of our end markets, customer base and products. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets We have significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet related to acquisitions. Our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested and reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment or when there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate that the fair value of an asset is more likely than not less than the carrying amount of the asset. Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and begins with a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test included in U.S. GAAP. For those reporting units where it is required, the first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. To the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed, wherein the reporting unit's carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill. To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value, impairment exists and must be recognized. As quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units, the calculation of their estimated fair value in step one is based on two valuation techniques, a discounted cash flow model (income approach) and a market adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues (market approach), with each method being equally weighted in the calculation. We believe an equal weighting of both approaches is appropriate. The income approach relies on the Company's estimates of future cash flows and explicitly addresses factors such as timing, growth and margins, with due consideration given to forecasting risk. The market approach reflects the market's expectations for future growth and risk, with adjustments to account for differences between the guideline publicly traded companies and the subject reporting units. In step 2, the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in the first step of the goodwill impairment test, was the price paid to acquire that reporting unit. Recoverability of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is first assessed using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. This assessment is used as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset. For those indefinite-lived assets where it is required, a fair value is determined on a relief from royalty methodology (income approach) which is based on the implied royalty paid, at an appropriate discount rate, to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset. The present value of the after-tax cost savings (i.e. royalty relief) indicates the estimated fair value of the asset. Any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess. The determination of the estimated fair value and the implied fair value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions about estimated cash flows, including profit margins, long-term forecasts, discount rates and terminal growth rates. We developed these assumptions based on the market and geographic risks unique to each reporting unit. 2012 Impairment Test For our annual impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2012, we concluded it was necessary to calculate the fair value for each of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles. Based on the results of these calculations, we determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values. The estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment, which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows. 41 Table of Contents Goodwill - Under the income approach, we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates ranging from 10.0% to 15.5% , near term growth rates ranging from (3.5)% to 14.8% and terminal growth rates ranging from 2.5% to 4.0% . Under the market approach, we used an adjusted multiple ranging from 6.6 to 9.2 of projected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and 0.8 to 1.8 of projected revenues based on the market information of comparable companies. Additionally, we compared the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization. For all reporting units except two, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value) was a minimum of 15% . The two reporting units with a percentage of carrying value less than 15%, reported within the Residential Solutions and Security Technologies segments, exceeded their carrying value by 14.4% and 2.5% , respectively. These reporting units have goodwill of approximately $ 599 million and $ 190 million , respectively. For the specific Security Technologies reporting unit that exceeded its carrying value by less than 5%, we have provided below additional assumptions and a sensitivity analysis. Under the income approach we assumed a discount rate of 10%, near term growth rates ranging from (1.1)% to 5% and a terminal growth rate of 2.5%. Under the market approach, we assumed a weighted average multiple of 7.8 and 7.1 times projected 2012 and 2013 EBITDA, respectively, and a multiple of 0.8 times projected 2012 and 2013 revenue, based on industry market data. Holding other assumptions constant, a 1.0% increase in the discount rate would result in a $20 million decrease in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, a 1.0% decrease in the long-term growth rate would result in a $15 million decrease in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and a 5.0% decrease in the selected market multiples would result in a $15 million decrease in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. Each of these scenarios individually would result in the reporting unit failing step 1. Assessing the fair value of goodwill includes, among other things, making key assumptions for estimating future cash flows and appropriate market multiples. These assumptions are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity. We make every effort to estimate future cash flows as accurately as possible with the information available at the time the forecast is developed. However, changes in assumptions and estimates may affect the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, and could result in impairment charges in future periods. Factors that have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit include but are not limited to the following: Decreases in estimated market sizes or market growth rates due to greater-than-expected declines in volumes, pricing pressures or disruptive technology; Declines in our market share and penetration assumptions due to increased competition or an inability to develop or launch new products; The impacts of the European sovereign debt crisis, including greater-than-expected declines in pricing, reductions in volumes, or fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; The level of success of on-going and future research and development efforts, including those related to recent acquisitions, and increases in the research and development costs necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and launch new products; Increase in the price or decrease in the availability of key commodities and the impact of higher energy prices; Increases in our market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital; and Changes in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses. Other Indefinite-lived intangible assets - In testing our other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we assumed forecasted revenues for a period of five years with discount rates ranging from 12.0% to 12.5%, terminal growth rates ranging from 2.5% to 3.0%, and royalty rates ranging from 3.0% to 5.0%. The fair values of our Trane and American Standard tradenames exceeded their respective carrying amounts by less than 15%. The two tradenames exceeded their carrying value by 10.5% and 13.0%, respectively. The carrying values of these tradenames are approximately $2,497 million and $105 million, respectively, at December 31, 2012. A significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the long-term growth rate, decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on their estimated fair values of any of our tradenames. 2011 Impairment Test As a result of the planned divestiture of Hussmann, we were required to test Goodwill remaining within the Climate Solutions segment for impairment in the first quarter of 2011. No impairment charge was required for the remaining Climate Solutions 42 Table of Contents segment. Based on year to date operational results, and management turnover within the Residential HVAC reporting unit, we updated our fair value assessment of the reporting unit in the third quarter of 2011 and noted that the fair value of the reporting unit continued to exceed its carrying amount. For our annual impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2011, we determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values. The estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment, which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows. Goodwill - Under the income approach, we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates ranging from 12.0% to 17.0% and terminal growth rates ranging from 2.5% to 4.0%. Under the market approach, we used an adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues based on the market information of comparable companies. Additionally, we compared the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization. For all reporting units except two, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value) was a minimum of 15%. The two reporting units with a percentage of carrying value less than 15%, reported within the Residential Solutions and Security Technologies segments, exceeded their carrying value by 5.8% and 10.9%, respectively. These reporting units have goodwill of approximately $599 million and $198 million, respectively. A significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the long-term growth rate, or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units. Other Indefinite-lived intangible assets - In testing our other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we assumed forecasted revenues for a period of five years with discount rates ranging from 12.5% to 14.5%, terminal growth rates ranging from 2.5% to 3.0%, and royalty rates ranging from 3.0% to 5.0%. The fair values of two of our tradenames exceeded their respective carrying amounts by less than 15%. The two tradenames, reported within the Climate Solutions and Residential Solutions segments, exceeded their carrying value by 7.3% and 11.6%. The carrying values of these tradenames are approximately $2,497 million and $105 million. A significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the long-term growth rate, decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on their estimated fair values. Long-lived assets and finite-lived intangibles Long-lived assets and finite-lived intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. Assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows can be generated. Impairment in the carrying value of an asset would be recognized whenever anticipated future undiscounted cash flows from an asset are less than its carrying value. The impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset as determined by an estimate of discounted cash flows. We believe that our use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting principles. Changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to these valuations. Loss contingencies Liabilities are recorded for various contingencies arising in the normal course of business, including litigation and administrative proceedings, environmental and asbestos matters and product liability, product warranty, worker compensation and other claims. We have recorded reserves in the financial statements related to these matters, which are developed using input derived from actuarial estimates and historical and anticipated experience data depending on the nature of the reserve, and in certain instances with consultation of legal counsel, internal and external consultants and engineers. Subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for these types of liabilities, we believe our estimated reserves are reasonable and do not believe the final determination of the liabilities with respect to these matters would have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows for any year. Asbestos matters Certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries are named as defendants in asbestos-related lawsuits in state and federal courts. We record a liability for our actual and anticipated future claims as well as an asset for anticipated insurance settlements. Although we were neither a manufacturer nor producer of asbestos, some of our formerly manufactured components from third party suppliers utilized asbestos-related components. As a result, we record certain income and expenses associated with our asbestos liabilities and corresponding insurance recoveries within discontinued operations, net of tax, as they relate to previously divested businesses, except for amounts associated with Trane U.S. Inc. asbestos liabilities and corresponding insurance recoveries which are recorded within continuing operations. Refer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of asbestos-related matters. Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized and earned when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (a) persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; (b) price is fixed or determinable; (c) collectability is reasonably assured; and (d) delivery has occurred or service has been rendered. Delivery generally occurs when the title and the risks and rewards of ownership have substantially transferred to the customer. Revenue from maintenance contracts or extended warranties is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract, unless another method is more representative of the costs 43 Table of Contents incurred. We enter into agreements that contain multiple elements, such as equipment, installation and service revenue. For multiple-element arrangements, the revenue relating to undelivered elements is deferred until delivery of the deferred elements. We recognize revenue for delivered elements when the delivered item has stand-alone value to the customer, customer acceptance has occurred, and there are only customary refund or return rights related to the delivered elements. Revenues from certain of our equipment and the related installation sold under construction-type contracts are recorded using the percentage-of-completion method in accordance with GAAP. Income taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We recognize future tax benefits, such as net operating losses and non-U.S. tax credits, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered in our judgment to be more likely than not. We regularly review the recoverability of our deferred tax assets considering our historic profitability, projected future taxable income, timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the feasibility of our tax planning strategies. Where appropriate, we record a valuation allowance with respect to a future tax benefit. The provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Future changes in applicable laws, projected levels of taxable income, and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us. In addition, tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions, timing and amount of income or deductions, and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate. A significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return. We believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters. We will adjust our estimate if significant events so dictate. To the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates, the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved. Employee benefit plans We provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retirees, including pensions, postretirement and postemployment benefits. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, employee mortality, turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates. Actuarial valuations are performed to determine expense in accordance with GAAP. Actual results may differ from the actuarial assumptions and are generally accumulated and amortized into earnings over future periods. We review our actuarial assumptions at each measurement date and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends, if appropriate. The discount rate, the rate of compensation increase and the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are determined as of each measurement date. A discount rate reflects a rate at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. Discount rates for all plans are established using hypothetical yield curves based on the yields of corporate bonds rated AA quality. Spot rates are developed from the yield curve and used to discount future benefit payments. The rate of compensation increase is dependent on expected future compensation levels. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of returns expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on what is achievable given the plan investment policy, the types of assets held and the target asset allocation. The expected long-term rate of return is determined as of each measurement date. We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our actuaries, outside investment advisors and information as to assumptions used by plan sponsors. Changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension cost or postretirement benefit cost. Estimated sensitivities to the expected 2013 net periodic pension cost of a 0.25% rate decline in the two basic assumptions are as follows: the decline in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately $8.6 million and the decline in the estimated return on assets would increase expense by approximately $7.9 million. A 0.25% rate decrease in the discount rate for postretirement benefits would increase expected 2013 net periodic postretirement benefit cost by $0.7 million and a 1.0% increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase the cost by approximately $1.4 million. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements: In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2011-04, "Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)." ASU 2011-04 represents converged guidance between GAAP and IFRS resulting in common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 and subsequent interim periods. The requirements 44 Table of Contents of ASU 2011-04 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. The revised disclosure requirements are reflected in Note 12. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, "Presentation of Comprehensive Income." ASU 2011-05 requires us to present components of other comprehensive income and of net income in one continuous statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive statements. The option to report other comprehensive income within the statement of equity has been removed. This new presentation of comprehensive income is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 and subsequent interim periods. The revised presentation requirements are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12, "Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassification of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05." The revised amendments defer the presentation in the financial statements of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income for annual and interim financial statements. The deferral is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 and subsequent interim periods. The revised presentation requirements are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, "Testing Goodwill for Impairment." This revised standard provides entities with the option to first use an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If a conclusion is reached that reporting unit fair value is not more likely than not below carrying value, no further impairment testing is necessary. This revised guidance applies to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, and the related interim and annual goodwill impairment tests. The requirements of ASU 2011-08 did not have an impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment." This revised standard provides entities with the option to first use an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If a conclusion is reached that the indefinite-lived intangible asset fair value is not more likely than not below carrying value, no further impairment testing is necessary. We elected to early adopt. The requirements of ASU 2012-02 did not have an impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, "Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities." ASU 2011-11 requires enhanced disclosures including both gross and net information about financial and derivative instruments eligible for offset or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement. This new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 and subsequent interim periods. The requirements of ASU 2011-11 will not have an impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
