ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (For an overview of the company business groups, including a discussion of products and services provided, see the Business discussion contained in Part I, Item 1, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.) MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW General Dynamics designs, develops, manufactures and supports leading-edge technology products and services for mission-critical information systems and technologies; land and expeditionary combat systems, armaments and munitions; shipbuilding and marine systems; and business aviation. The company primary customers are the U.S. military, other government organizations, the armed forces of allied nations and a diverse base of corporate and industrial buyers. It operates through four primary business groups Information Systems and Technology, Combat Systems, Marine Systems and Aerospace and a small Resources group. The company has two primary business markets defense and business aviation. The majority of the company revenues derive from contracts with the U.S. military. Current U.S. policy is to pursue the Global War on Terrorism, encourage the spread of democratic institutions and significantly enhance homeland defense efforts. U.S. military doctrine provides that these diverse and demanding missions require U.S. armed forces that are equipped and trained to prevail quickly in small- and large-scale conflicts around the world. Current policy also dictates that success will require the transformation of U.S. forces so they are more strategically mobile, operationally lethal and tactically survivable. These endeavors have driven steady funding increases for the U.S. Department of Defense since 2001. For fiscal year 2005, the Congress appropriated $403 billion for the Department of Defense, a 30 percent increase in funding since 2001. This amount includes $148 billion for procurement and research and development (R&D) activities, an increase of 44 percent since 2001. Procurement and R&D budgets provide the majority of the company revenues. Their sustained increases demonstrate solid administration and congressional support. With previously approved and recently announced supplemental funding, the Congress is being asked to provide additional funding for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, bringing the Department of Defense total funding for fiscal year 2005 to over $500 billion, approximately a 60 percent increase since 2001. Over 16 percent of the supplemental 2005 spending will go toward additional procurement, as currently requested by the president. The U.S. Army will receive $9 billion of that request, and the U.S. Marine Corps will get $3 billion, assuming the Congress approves the president request. For fiscal year 2006, the president has requested that the Congress appropriate $420 billion for the Department of Defense, a 4 percent increase over 2005. This includes $147 billion for procurement and R&D. Overall, while Department of Defense funding levels may change over time, the company expects the levels of funding available for its programs to remain consistent for 2005 and 2006. General Dynamics 2004 Annual Report 15 The global defense market is shaped largely by the demands of the U.S. military. Many foreign governments remain committed to funding weapons and equipment modernization in the pursuit of interoperability with U.S. and allied forces and flexible capabilities for peacekeeping and regional operations. The company continues to focus on the needs of these customers and expects growing international sales. The Aerospace group is one of the world leading designers and manufacturers of business-jet aircraft and is a leader in the long-range and ultra-long-range, large-cabin business-jet market, as well as in the business-jet service and product support market. The group market is influenced in part by the capital goods sector and the demand for business-aviation products by U.S. and foreign businesses, the U.S. and other governments, and high-net-worth individuals. The business-aviation market improved considerably during 2004, with an increase in demand, a reduction in aircraft inventory both new and pre-owned and a firming in pricing. The increase in demand was across the Aerospace group customer base, reflecting the improved global economy and higher U.S. corporate earnings. The cost containment and efficiency initiatives that the company implemented in 2003 resulted in a marked increase in the group earnings and margins in 2004. The company expects that the business-aviation market will continue to improve and that the group will continue to benefit from that improvement and from its management and cost-reduction initiatives. General Dynamics management is committed to creating shareholder value through ethical business practices, disciplined program management and continuous operational improvements. The company has proven itself over the past 10 years as an industry leader in generating strong cash flows, which have enabled it to enhance returns through strategic and tactical acquisitions, payment of dividends and share repurchases. CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW Results of Operations General Dynamics net sales increased 17 percent in 2004 over 2003 to $19.2 billion. This growth resulted from increased volume across all of the company primary business groups and in part from acquisitions in the Information Systems and Technology and Combat Systems groups. The Information Systems and Technology group provided the most significant contribution to the sales growth in 2004 as a result of strong demand for its communications and information technology products and services. The company 2004 performance followed sales growth of 20 percent in 2003. The company net sales increased to $16.4 billion in 2003 from $13.7 billion in 2002. This increase was driven by acquisitions in the Information Systems and Technology and Combat Systems groups and increased volume in the company defense businesses, reduced in part by lower sales of new aircraft in the Aerospace group. In 2004, General Dynamics focus on operations and program execution resulted in substantial improvement in the company earnings and operating margins over 2003. Operating earnings increased 34 percent from 2003, double the rate of sales growth, to $1.9 billion in 2004. All of the company major business units contributed to this performance. The Aerospace group improved its earnings significantly on effectively the same volume as 2003. The Marine Systems group experienced reduced losses in its commercial shipbuilding business compared with 2003, which also contributed to higher earnings in 2004. Overall, the company operating margins increased to 10.1 percent in 2004 from 8.8 percent in 2003, reflecting the increased demand for the company products and services, the successful integration of businesses acquired in 2003 and improved processes that resulted in significant cost reductions. Operating earnings in 2003 decreased 8 percent from 2002 to $1.4 billion. The impact of increased volume across the company and acquisitions in the Information Systems and Technology and Combat 16 General Dynamics 2004 Annual Report Systems groups was offset by decreased earnings in the Marine Systems and Aerospace groups. Earnings were down in those groups in 2003 due to performance problems on commercial shipbuilding contracts and reduced sales of new aircraft and market pricing pressures at Gulfstream. The company generated substantial cash flow from operating activities in 2004 and 2003, significantly exceeding net earnings in each year. In 2002, cash flow from operating activities approximated net earnings. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion in 2004 compared with $1.7 billion in 2003 and $1.1 billion in 2002. The company used its cash to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures, repurchase its common stock, pay dividends and reduce debt. General and administrative (G&A) expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 6.2 percent in 2004 compared with 6.6 percent in 2003 and 6.5 percent in 2002. G&A was $1.2 billion in 2004, $1.1 billion in 2003 and $892 in 2002. In 2004, the company had net expense from non-operating items of $8 compared with income of $3 in 2003. In 2002, income from non-operating items was $47, which included a $36 gain from the sale of certain assets of Combat Systems Space Propulsion operation. Net interest expense increased to $148 in 2004 from $98 in 2003 because of a higher average borrowing balance from the company issuance of additional debt in 2003 used to fund acquisitions. Net interest expense was $45 in 2002. The company effective tax rate was 32.6 percent in 2004, 27.3 percent in 2003 and 33.7 percent in 2002. The 2003 tax rate was lower than the other years because of the settlement of the 1996 to 1998 audit cycle with the Internal Revenue Service and the resolution of some outstanding state tax disputes. These events resulted in non-cash benefits in 2003 totaling $68, favorably impacting the company tax rate by 5 percent. In 2004, General Dynamics reviewed its businesses to identify operations that were not core to the company and could be divested. As a result, the company completed the sale of two businesses in 2004 and entered into definitive agreements to sell two additional businesses, both of which closed in the first quarter of 2005. The company reported net sales for all periods presented exclude the revenues associated with these businesses. Their earnings, however, are included as discontinued operations, net of income taxes, for all periods. For additional discussion of these divestiture activities, see Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The company exited its undersea fiber-optic cable-laying business in the fourth quarter of 2002 because of substantial overcapacity in the market and a lack of contract backlog. The results of this business operations in 2002 are included as discontinued operations, net of income taxes. The company recognized an after-tax loss of $134, including an after-tax charge of $109 for ship lease obligations and the write-down of assets to net realizable value upon disposal of this business. General Dynamics total backlog reached its highest level ever, $42.1 billion, and the funded backlog grew 14 percent over 2003 to $28.3 billion at December 31, 2004. Each of the company business groups experienced significant new order activity in 2004, resulting in total new orders of $19.6 billion during the year. The total backlog for the company defense businesses was $35 billion at the end of 2004, up $1.1 billion over year-end 2003. The defense backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts. The funded portion of this backlog grew 14 percent in 2004 to $23.4 billion. This includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the Congress and funded by the customer, as well as commitments by international customers that are also approved and funded by their governments. The unfunded backlog for the defense businesses represents firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated. The backlog does not include work awarded under indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts. The total potential value of these contracts, which may be realized over the next 10 years, was approximately $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2004. The Aerospace group total backlog at December 31, 2004, was $6.8 billion, an increase of 5 percent over 2003. Perhaps more important, the Aerospace funded backlog, which is an indicator of near-term demand, increased 13 percent in 2004 to $4.6 billion. This growth reflects the increase in demand for new aircraft throughout the year that culminated in a record number of orders in the fourth quarter. The funded backlog includes orders for which the company has definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer. The unfunded backlog of $2.2 billion at year-end 2004 consists of options to purchase new aircraft and agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services. The Resources group backlog was $258 at year-end 2004, of which $200 was funded. General Dynamics 2004 Annual Report 17 REVIEW OF OPERATING SEGMENTS INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 Variance Net sales $ 6,781 $ 4,889 $ 1,892 39 % Operating earnings 715 536 179 33 % Operating margin 10.5 % 11.0 % The Information Systems and Technology group sales and earnings increased significantly in 2004 compared with 2003. The group enjoyed growing demand in all of its markets tactical and strategic mission systems, intelligence mission systems, and network infrastructure and information technology (IT) services including: communication products, such as the BOWMAN program for the United Kingdom armed forces and the Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T) program for the Army; global mission solutions, including the Intelligence Information, Command-and-Control Equipment and Enhancements (ICE2) contract for the U.S. Air Force; surveillance and reconnaissance systems; and network infrastructure and wireless systems. Acquisitions in 2003 and 2004 were the other major driver of the sales growth, contributing about half of the increase over 2003. The group 2004 operating margins were down slightly from 2003 because of a change in the mix of program deliveries through the year and lower-margin businesses acquired in the second half of 2003. Of note, the group overall margins improved in 2004 over the fourth quarter of 2003 as it continued to integrate these businesses. During 2004, the company completed two acquisitions in the group Spectrum Astro, Inc., in July and TriPoint Global Communications Inc., in September. These acquisitions enhance the group offerings in space vehicle integration and mobile communications. The company expects the Information Systems and Technology group to experience single-digit sales growth in 2005. Operating margins should remain similar to average margins in 2004, though margins may fluctuate from period to period based on contract mix and timing of deliveries. The group will continue to focus on operations and program performance and the integration of the businesses acquired in 2004. Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 Variance Net sales $ 4,889 $ 3,669 $ 1,220 33 % Operating earnings 536 435 101 23 % Operating margin 11.0 % 11.9 % In 2003, the group experienced significant sales and earnings growth over 2002 as a result of increased volume in several areas of the business, including: infrastructure and IT support services, communications systems, ruggedized computing equipment and high-speed encryption products. The acquisitions of Veridian Corporation and Digital System Resources, Inc., in the third quarter of 2003 also contributed significantly to the sales and earnings growth, though the lower margins associated with these businesses reduced the group overall operating margins as discussed above. The Information Systems and Technology group backlog grew to a record $9.4 billion in 2004, an increase of 26 percent over 2003. The group funded backlog, representing over 75 percent of the total backlog, increased by $1.2 billion in 2004. Unlike the company other defense businesses, the Information Systems and Technology group backlog is made up primarily of a large number of mid-size contracts and programs. However, 2004 saw an unusually high number of awards for large-scale, long-term programs in the defense market for communications and IT products and services. The group received many of these significant awards during the year, leading to the substantial increase in backlog. The Army selected the Information Systems and Technology group as the prime contractor for its WIN-T program. WIN-T is the Army key initiative designed to transform its tactical communications network from the current 18 General Dynamics 2004 Annual Report system to support the future force. The entire WIN-T program has a potential value of $7 billion through 2018, and work is expected to be shared evenly with the company principal subcontractor. The group was also awarded Cluster 5 of the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), a contract worth $295 to develop small, lightweight software-defined radios for use by all branches of the U.S.military in systems ranging from handhelds to unattended sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles. The JTRS program is designed to transform joint service operations by providing communication flexibility and adaptability to fighting forces. If all options are exercised, the contract has a potential value of over $1 billion through 2011. The group is part of a team that was selected by the U.S. Navy to build the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), a narrowband tactical satellite communications system. The Information Systems and Technology group will lead the segments of the MUOS program that supply network management, satellite control and a secure ground network, as well as a JTRS-compliant terminal solution. The subcontract is valued at over $800. The group is also a member of a team that was selected as Canada Maritime Helicopter Project (MHP) provider. The MHP program calls for the replacement of Canada aging fleet of marine helicopters with 28 state-of-the-art helicopters to be used for anti-submarine patrols, surveillance, search-and-rescue and disaster relief. The company has been selected to provide the integrated mission systems for the new helicopters and related support for 20 years under a subcontract arrangement with a potential value of up to $1.3 billion. The Information Systems and Technology group was also awarded a five-year contract valued at approximately $480 to continue its support of the U.S. Joint Forces Command Joint Experimentation Program and Joint Futures Lab, which develops new warfighting concepts, organizational structures and emerging technologies. The company has supported this program for the past six years, providing services such as R&D, engineering, and formulation and analysis of joint operational concepts. The Information Systems and Technology group backlog at the end of 2004 also includes several international programs, reflecting the demand for its products and services overseas. The group most significant international contract is the BOWMAN program, a secure digital voice and data communications system for the U.K. armed forces. The group year-end backlog includes approximately $1.9 billion for the BOWMAN program. The group backlog does not include approximately $6.3 billion of potential contract value awarded under IDIQ contracts. IDIQ contracts are used when the customer has not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed. These agreements set forth the majority of the contractual terms, including prices, but are funded as delivery orders are placed. A significant portion of this IDIQ value represents contracts for which the company has been designated as the sole-source supplier over several years to design, develop, produce and integrate complex products and systems for the military or other government agencies. Management believes that the customers intend to fully implement these systems. However, because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customer future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders, the company recognizes these contracts in backlog only when they are funded. The company was awarded several significant IDIQ contracts during 2004, including one of four contracts under the Air Force Network-Centric Solutions (NETCENTS) program. Under the NETCENTS program, the company will provide information technology, networking, and voice, video and data communications products and services to support the Air Force global information requirements. The multiple-award IDIQ program has a three-year base period with two one-year options and a potential value of $9 billion. In addition, the Information Systems and Technology group was awarded one of 12 Information Technology Systems Support (ITSS) III contracts by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to provide state-of-the-art IT services and project-related hardware to DOJ organizations and other federal agencies. This multiple-award IDIQ program has a performance period of seven years and a ceiling value of approximately $1 billion. COMBAT SYSTEMS Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 Variance Net sales $ 4,407 $ 4,007 $ 400 10 % Operating earnings 522 443 79 18 % Operating margin 11.8 % 11.1 % The Combat Systems group posted solid increases in net sales and operating earnings in 2004 compared with 2003. Strengthened by acquisitions completed in 2003, the group volume increased in 2004 as demand for its products grew both in the United States and abroad. In particular, the group sales of armored vehicles in Europe, including Leopard tanks, Ulan infantry fighting vehicles and Piranha combat vehicles, increased significantly in 2004. In addition, the group experienced increased activity on its contract to develop manned ground vehicles for the Army Future Combat Systems (FCS) program and in its munitions and armaments businesses. These gains were partially offset by lower volume on some combat vehicle production programs, including fewer M1 Abrams tank upgrades and reduced deliveries on the Stryker program due to the timing of customer requirements. Operating earnings increased at almost double the rate of the group sales growth in 2004. A shift in contract mix and improved performance on General Dynamics 2004 Annual Report 19 a number of the group programs, including FCS, Stryker and tactical air munitions contracts, contributed to the strong earnings performance. The company expects the Combat Systems group sales to increase significantly in 2005 based on the group solid backlog and opportunities for growth in the United States and internationally. Operating margins in 2005 should approximate those achieved in 2004. Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 Variance Net sales $ 4,007 $ 2,786 $ 1,221 44 % Operating earnings 443 309 134 43 % Operating margin 11.1 % 11.1 % In 2003, the Combat Systems group experienced substantial growth in net sales and operating earnings due largely to several acquisitions during the year. In 2003, the company acquired General Motors Defense, Intercontinental Manufacturing Company and Steyr Daimler Puch Spezialfahrzeug Aktiengesellschaft & Company KG. In addition, increased activity on the Leopard tank production program, growing contributions to the Army FCS program and solid performance in the company munitions and armaments businesses augmented the contributions of acquired businesses. This growth was reduced in part by fewer M1 Abrams main battle tank upgrades and reduced deliveries of the Pizarro Advanced Infantry Fighting Vehicle in Spain. The Combat Systems group total backlog increased in 2004 to $8.7 billion at year end. The group funded backlog grew by 10 percent to reach $6.4 billion at the end of 2004. The group backlog consists primarily of long-term production contracts with scheduled deliveries through 2012. The group backlog at year end includes approximately $790 for the production of Stryker wheeled combat vehicles. In 2004, Combat Systems received orders from the Army for 328 vehicles valued at approximately $440 to complete the fourth Stryker brigade. The group also was awarded three delivery orders worth $206 for 95 additional Stryker combat vehicles, including the first production of the Mobile Gun System and Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Reconnaissance variants. In the first quarter of 2005, the Army ordered 423 additional vehicles, valued at over $580, to equip the fifth Stryker brigade. The Stryker program, which currently calls for a total of six brigades by 2008, is a key component of the ongoing Army transformation. The Army also awarded the Combat Systems group several contracts to extend the company M1 Abrams main battle tank program. The first was a delivery order valued at $121 under a contract to upgrade 65 M1A2 Abrams tanks to the M1A2 System Enhancement Program (SEP) configuration. Through this program, the company retrofits M1A2 tanks with improved electronics, command-and-control capabilities and armor enhancements that are designed to improve the tank effectiveness. In January 2005, the Army awarded the company a modification worth $161 to upgrade an additional 64 M1A2 Abrams tanks. During 2004, the company was also awarded a $52 delivery order for 120 M1A1 Abrams Integrated Management (AIM) material sets to be delivered by June 2006. In addition, the company was awarded a contract modification valued at $267 to provide 125 M1A1 hardware kits for the Egyptian co-production program. Another significant award for the Combat Systems group in 2004 was a $25 delivery order initiating a contract for the production of Joint Biological Point Detection Systems (JBPDS). The JBPDS is a self-powered instrument suite that rapidly detects and identifies biological warfare agents such as airborne viruses, bacteria and toxins. This contract has a potential value of $750 for approximately 1,100 systems through 2009 if all options are exercised. Internationally in 2004, the Government of Portugal conducted a competition for armored vehicles and in December selected the group Pandur II vehicle and funded the program. A contract valued at over $475 to produce 260 armored combat vehicles was finalized and added to the backlog in the first quarter of 2005. In addition to the 2004 contract awards discussed above, Combat Systems backlog at year end includes several significant ongoing programs. The group is contributing to the Army FCS program through the development of manned ground vehicles and the autonomous navigation system for unmanned and manned ground vehicles. The group backlog at the end of 2004 includes $1.8 billion for this aspect of the FCS program. The Information Systems and Technology group is also participating in this program, providing the integrated computer system, sensor data management and mission planning and preparation services. The FCS program has been restructured to deliver newly developed technologies to existing forces as soon as they are available, rather than waiting until all planned technology innovations are complete. With this acceleration of new technologies, the Army plans to focus on networking capabilities, unattended munitions, unmanned systems and manned ground vehicles. 20 General Dynamics 2004 Annual Report The Combat Systems group Leopard program is a long-term battle tank manufacturing contract for the Spanish army under license from a German company. The year-end backlog includes $1.2 billion for the production of 232 Leopard tanks, with deliveries scheduled through 2008. The group also produces Pizarro Advanced Infantry Fighting Vehicles for the Spanish army. The group backlog at the end of 2004 includes over $850 for the production of 212 Pizarro vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2012. Another key program in the Combat Systems group is the Marine Corps Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) contract. In 2004, the company was awarded a contract modification to continue the system development and demonstration phase of the EFV program, which deferred the beginning of low-rate initial production from 2005 to 2006. The group backlog at year-end 2004 includes approximately $470 for this effort. Program production, which currently calls for over 1,000 vehicles, is scheduled to begin in 2006 and continue into 2020. The Combat Systems year-end 2004 backlog also includes over $1.2 billion in armament, munitions and composite structures programs. The ammunition programs include the production of Hydra-70 (70mm) rockets, motors and warheads. In 2004, the group received orders worth approximately $125 from the U.S.Army Aviation and Missile Command for the Hydra-70 program. These orders extended deliveries through 2006 and brought the total contract value to date to $960. Also in 2004, the U.S.Army Joint Munitions Command awarded the group $110 worth of modifications to a contract for the production of MK80 Series bomb bodies. The contract has a total potential value of $240, and deliveries are scheduled through 2005. MARINE SYSTEMS Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 Variance Net sales $ 4,726 $ 4,271 $ 455 11 % Operating earnings 292 216 76 35 % Operating margin 6.2 % 5.1 % In 2004, the Marine Systems group net sales grew as a result of higher activity on engineering and repair contracts and several early-stage production and development programs, including the T-AKE combat-logistics ships, the conversion of Trident ballistic missile submarines to a conventional-strike configuration (SSGN) and the Virginia-class submarine program. The growth in sales was partially reduced by lower volume on commercial shipbuilding contracts and mature production programs, including the delivery of the final Seawolf-class submarine. The group operating earnings and margins improved significantly in 2004 compared with 2003 because of improved results on the company commercial shipbuilding programs in 2004 relative to 2003. The company experienced losses in the first quarter of 2003 on the construction of two roll-on/roll-off cargo ships. The two ships were delivered later in the year with no additional write- offs. Later in 2003, the group recorded losses on the first of four double-hull oil tankers. The losses totaled $70 and were the result of labor hour and material cost growth. The company estimates to complete the tankers remained firm through the first half of 2004. However, after the first ship was delivered in the third quarter of 2004, the company identified additional performance problems related to schedule delays and subcontractor difficulties. As a result, the company recorded additional losses on the contract of $43 in the second half of 2004. The second and third double-hull tankers are scheduled for delivery in 2005, with the fourth to be delivered in 2006. Management continues to monitor the program closely in order to mitigate the risk of further cost growth. The company expects the Marine Systems group sales in 2005 to approximate the group results in 2004 with slightly improved margins, assuming no further deterioration on the commercial tanker contract. Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 Variance Net sales $ 4,271 $ 3,650 $ 621 17 % Operating earnings 216 287 (71 ) (25 )% Operating margin 5.1 % 7.9 % In 2003, the Marine Systems group net sales increased over 2002 from increased activity on a number of design and early-stage production contracts, including the Virginia-class, SSGN and T-AKE programs, as well as growth in engineering and repair work. This growth was offset partially by lower activity on several mature ship construction programs. Earnings and margins declined in 2003 as a result of the performance issues on the two commercial shipbuilding programs discussed above. General Dynamics 2004 Annual Report 21 The Marine Systems group backlog at the end of 2004 was $16.8 billion, consisting of numerous long-term submarine and ship construction programs, along with repair and engineering contracts. The group funded backlog grew by $1.1 billion, or 13 percent, in 2004, reaching $9.9 billion at year end. This backlog provides for shipbuilding programs through 2014. While the Navy future shipbuilding plan fluctuates over time, the group current shipbuilding and submarine programs are well-funded through the next several years. The group most significant contract in backlog is the Virginia-class submarine construction program. The company has nine Virginia-class submarines under contract following the delivery of the lead ship in the class, the Virginia , in October 2004. At year-end 2004, the group backlog includes $9.1 billion for the construction of these submarines. The current Navy plan calls for one submarine to be delivered per year. The company is the prime contractor on this program, and construction is shared equally with its teaming partner. The group backlog at the end of 2004 includes $3.4 billion for 10 Arleigh Burke-class DDG destroyers scheduled for delivery through 2010. This includes $489 in funding awarded to the company in 2004. In January 2005, the Navy awarded the company an additional $562, which funded the final destroyer under contract in the DDG program. During 2004, the Navy exercised options worth approximately $580 for the fifth and sixth ships in the T-AKE program, a new class of combat-logistics ships. The group backlog includes $1.5 billion at year end for the construction of the first six ships with deliveries scheduled from 2006 through 2008. In January 2005, the Navy exercised additional options worth approximately $590 for two more ships, bringing the total contract value to $2.5 billion. The contract has options for four more ships for a total potential contract value of $3.7 billion. The group also received approximately $390 in contract modifications from the Navy in 2004 to provide design, engineering, material and logistics support for strategic and attack submarines; R&D for submarine research vehicles; and planning, scheduling and technical support for submarine maintenance activities. These awards modify a $32 contract awarded in March 2004 that has a potential value of $1.1 billion over five years if all options are exercised. In 2004, the group received $165 in modifications to its contract to convert four Trident ballistic-missile submarines to an SSGN configuration, a multi-mission submarine optimized for conventional tactical strike and special-operations support. These awards modify a contract that the Navy awarded to the Marine Systems group in 2002 and bring the total program value to over $1 billion. In January 2005, the Navy awarded the group an additional $150 contract modification to continue the conversion. The Marine Systems group leads one of two teams selected for the final stage of development for the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), the Navy newest class of high-speed surface combatants designed to operate in coastal areas against terrorist threats, high- speed swarm boats, mines and diesel submarines. In 2004, the Navy awarded the group an option worth $79 to continue development of its proposed design for the LCS. AEROSPACE Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 Variance Net sales $ 3,012 $ 2,946 $ 66 2 % Operating earnings 393 218 175 80 % Operating margin 13.0 % 7.4 % Aircraft Deliveries (in units): Green 78 74 Completion 77 74 The Aerospace group sales increased slightly in 2004 compared with 2003. New aircraft deliveries and aircraft services activity were up while pre-owned aircraft sales were lower. The group earnings and margins in 2004 grew considerably over 2003. This increase resulted from three factors: substantial cost reductions, positive earnings on pre-owned aircraft sales versus losses in 2003 and a combination of additional new aircraft deliveries and a more favorable mix of deliveries. In 2003, the company initiated a series of cost-containment efforts and process improvements in response to declining market conditions and an oversupply of aircraft in the business-jet market. These steps removed significant costs from the group new aircraft manufacturing process. In addition, the company implemented a more disciplined approach to pre-owned aircraft activity. As a result, sales of pre-owned aircraft in 2004 resulted in earnings of $6 compared with losses of $64 in 2003. These factors, combined with the increased volume and improved mix of aircraft deliveries, resulted in the significant rise in earnings and margins for the group in 2004. Business-jet market conditions improved significantly in 2004. Demand for new aircraft increased steadily throughout the year, and there was a marked improvement in pricing in the order activity late in the year. The group finished 2004 with a record number of orders in the fourth quarter and for the full year, excluding orders from fractional fleet customers. With the 2005 production schedule substantially sold out, the company expects moderate sales growth in the Aerospace group in 2005 with improving operating margins. 22 General Dynamics 2004 Annual Report Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 Variance Net sales $ 2,946 $ 3,289 $ (343 ) (10 )% Operating earnings 218 447 (229 ) (51 )% Operating margin 7.4 % 13.6 % Aircraft Deliveries (in units): Green 74 85 Completion 74 94 Net sales and operating earnings decreased in 2003 compared with 2002 because of deterioration in the business-jet market during the second half of 2002 and the first half of 2003. Lower demand for new aircraft and oversupply of new and pre-owned aircraft for sale in the market resulted in downward pricing pressures. These factors lowered the group sales and caused earnings and margins to decline in 2003. Summary of Aircraft Statistical Information Sales contracts for new aircraft usually have two major milestones: the manufacture of the green aircraft and the aircraft completion, which includes exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics. The company records revenues when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer, and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft. The following table summarizes key unit data for the Aerospace group orders and backlog: Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 New orders 96 75 76 Options exercised 1 3 2 Firm orders (a) 97 78 78 Cancellations (a) (2 ) (12 ) (6 ) Total orders 95 66 72 New options (a) 3 Firm contracts in backlog 175 158 173 Options in backlog 100 103 103 Total aircraft in backlog 275 261 276 Completions in backlog (b) 39 38 38 (a) Excludes fractional activity, because these orders are made under master agreements that the customer draws down over several years. The company received orders for 55 aircraft and 50 options in 2002 and cancellations for seven aircraft in 2003 from fractional fleet customers. (b) Represents aircraft that have moved from green production to the completion process as of year end. Backlog includes only the value of the completion effort on these aircraft. The Aerospace group backlog reached $6.8 billion at year-end 2004. Approximately 70 percent of the group backlog, or $4.6 billion, was funded at year end. In 2004, the group received the largest number of new aircraft orders in the company history, excluding orders from fractional fleet customers. The backlog includes aircraft deliveries scheduled through 2011. A significant portion of the group backlog is with NetJets Inc. (NetJets), a unit of Berkshire Hathaway and the leader in the fractional aircraft market. The group funded backlog at year end includes $1.9 billion with NetJets, representing firm contracts for 107 aircraft, including 12 green aircraft that are scheduled for delivery in 2005. The unfunded backlog includes $1.4 billion for 100 aircraft options from NetJets, constituting all of the options in backlog. NetJets also represents 70 percent of the maintenance and support services in unfunded backlog. Deliveries of aircraft to NetJets are scheduled from 2005 through 2011 and represent as little as 4 percent and as much as 12 percent of projected new aircraft sales in those years. General Dynamics 2004 Annual Report 23 The group remaining $2.7 billion of funded backlog at year-end 2004 consists of contracts with a broad range of customers from a variety of industries and includes approximately $400 of contracts with government customers. RESOURCES The company Resources group principally consists of two businesses: a coal mining company and an aggregates company that supplies the construction industry. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 Variance Net sales $ 252 $ 256 $ (4 ) (2 )% Operating earnings 19 32 (13 ) (41 )% Net sales in 2004 were down compared with 2003 as a result of decreased volume in the coal business offset in part by a slight increase in activity in the aggregates business. The group 2004 operating earnings were lower than 2003 because the earnings in 2003 were favorably impacted by the reduction of surface reclamation obligations in the company coal mining operations. Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 Variance Net sales $ 256 $ 286 $ (30 ) (10 )% Operating earnings 32 89 (57 ) (64 )% Net sales in 2003 decreased versus 2002 because of lower volume in the coal and aggregates businesses from unfavorable seasonal conditions. The 2003 operating earnings were down from 2002 due to the volume decline and reduced earnings in the company commercial pension plan. In addition, the 2002 earnings were favorably impacted by the resolution of contingency reserves that had previously been established, due to an improved long-term outlook for some of the coal operation contracts. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In the mid-1990s, General Dynamics embarked on a strategy of disciplined capital deployment, focusing on strong cash flow generation to enable a series of strategic and tactical acquisitions designed to grow the company beyond its core platform businesses. These acquisitions incorporated new products and technologies and expanded the company customer base. Since 1995, the company has acquired 37 businesses at a total cost of over $13.5 billion. This has resulted in a larger, more diversified company while preserving a strong balance sheet and sustained financial flexibility. In 2004, the company continued its strong performance of cash generation, with net cash provided by operating activities far surpassing net earnings for the second year in a row. The company employed this cash to complete three niche acquisitions, continue its trend of annual dividend increases and pay down debt to further enhance an already strong balance sheet. The company ended 2004 with a cash balance of $976, total debt of $3.3 billion and a debt-to-capital ratio of 31.4 percent. Free cash flow from operations totaled $1.5 billion for both 2004 and 2003, compared with $860 in 2002. Management defines free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Management believes free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors, because it portrays the company ability to generate cash from its core businesses for such purposes as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions and paying dividends. The following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,802 $ 1,723 $ 1,122 Capital expenditures (266 ) (222 ) (262 ) Free cash flow from operations $ 1,536 $ 1,501 $ 860 Cash flows as a percentage of net earnings: Net cash provided by operating activities 147 % 172 % 122 % Free cash flow from operations 125 % 150 % 94 % As discussed above, the company uses its free cash flow from operations in a disciplined capital deployment process to invest internally, make acquisitions, pay dividends and repurchase the company shares in the open market. With free cash flow from operations projected to approximate net earnings in 2005, the company expects to continue to generate funds in excess of its short- and long-term liquidity needs. Management believes that the company has adequate funds on 24 General Dynamics 2004 Annual Report hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute its financial and operating strategy. The following is a discussion of the company major operating, investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Operating Activities The company generated strong cash flow from operating activities in 2004. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion in 2004, $1.7 billion in 2003 and $1.1 billion in 2002. In each year, net earnings was the primary driver of the company cash flow. In 2004, cash from operating activities exceeded net earnings primarily due to taxes paid being lower than the tax provision. In 2003, the increase in cash flow was attributable to substantial reductions in both new and pre-owned aircraft inventory in the Aerospace group and an influx of customer advances near the end of the year. In 2002, cash provided by operating activities approximated net earnings. Termination of A-12 Program. As discussed further in Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements, litigation on the A-12 program termination has been ongoing since 1991. If, contrary to the company expectations, the default termination is ultimately sustained, the company and The Boeing Company could collectively be required to repay the U.S. government as much as $1.4 billion for progress payments received for the A-12 contract, plus interest, which was approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2004. In this outcome, the government contends the company liability would be approximately $1.2 billion pretax, or $700 after-tax. The company believes that it has sufficient resources to pay such an obligation, if required, while still retaining ample liquidity. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $783 in 2004, compared with $3.2 billion in 2003 and $398 in 2002. The primary uses of cash in investing activities were business acquisitions and capital expenditures. Business Acquisitions. In 2004, the company completed three acquisitions at a total cost of approximately $500. On July 9, the company acquired Spectrum Astro, Inc., of Gilbert, Arizona. On September 17, the company acquired TriPoint Global Communications Inc., based in Newton, North Carolina. On November 1, the company acquired Engineering Technology Inc., of Orlando, Florida. On August 11, 2003, the company completed its acquisition of Veridian Corporation, headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, for approximately $1.5 billion in cash. On March 1, 2003, the company acquired GM Defense of London, Ontario, a business unit of General Motors Corporation, for approximately $1.1 billion in cash. On June 14, 2002, the company acquired the outstanding stock of Advanced Technical Products, Inc., for $214 in cash, plus the assumption of $43 in outstanding debt, which was repaid at the time of the acquisition. The company completed several other business acquisitions in the Information Systems and Technology, Combat Systems and Aerospace groups during 2003 and 2002 at a total cost of approximately $550. The company financed these acquisitions by issuing commercial paper. The company refinanced a substantial portion of its commercial paper during 2003, as discussed in Financing Activities. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures were $266 in 2004, $222 in 2003 and $262 in 2002. The company expects capital expenditures of approximately $350 in 2005. The anticipated increase over 2004 results from planned repairs to a damaged graving dock at Electric Boat and facilities improvements at Gulfstream. The company had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2004. Sale of Assets. In 2004, the company sold two small, non-core businesses. The company also signed definitive agreements to sell two additional businesses. These transactions closed in early 2005. In 2002, the company sold certain assets of its Space Propulsion operation. The remainder of the Space Propulsion operation is included in the Combat Systems group. The company received approximately $50 in cash during the three-year period ended December 31, 2004, from the sale of real estate in southern California. Financing Activities In 2004, cash used by financing activities was $904, versus $2 billion of cash generated in 2003 and $836 of cash used in 2002. The company typical financing activities are issuances and repayments of debt, payment of dividends and repurchases of common stock. Debt Proceeds, Net. In 2004, the company repaid $500 of floating-rate notes that matured in September. In 2003, the company issued $3.1 billion of medium-term fixed-rate debt securities under a Form S-3 Registration Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The proceeds of this debt were used to repay a substantial portion of the company commercial paper in 2003, which had the effect of fixing interest rates on debt that previously carried variable rates. Net repayments of commercial paper were $182 in 2004, $529 in 2003 and $451 in 2002. As of December 31, 2004, the company had no commercial paper outstanding. The company has $2 billion in bank credit facilities that have not been drawn upon and are used to provide backup liquidity to the commercial paper program. The company does not have any material debt that is scheduled to mature in 2005. General Dynamics 2004 Annual Report 25 Dividends. On March 2, 2005, the company board of directors declared an increased regular quarterly dividend of $.40 per share the eighth consecutive annual increase. The board had previously increased the quarterly dividend to $.36 per share in March 2004, to $.32 per share in March 2003 and to $.30 per share in March 2002. Share Repurchases. During 2004, the company did not repurchase any shares of its issued and outstanding common stock in the open market. In 2003, the company repurchased 4.7 million shares at an average price of $64 per share, for a total value of approximately $300. In 2002, the company repurchased 1.3 million shares for $100. As of December 31, 2004, the company had approximately 4.5 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase. During the first month of 2005, the company repurchased 1 million shares for approximately $100. ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2004, the company had no material off-balance sheet arrangements, other than operating leases. This includes guarantees; retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities; derivative instruments indexed to the company stock and classified in shareholders equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; and variable interests in entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company or engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the company. Contractual Obligations The following table presents information about the company contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Amount Committed Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Long-term debt (a) $ 4,197 $ 144 $ 764 $ 882 $ 2,407 Capital lease obligations 10 2 4 3 1 Operating leases 581 122 183 109 167 Purchase obligations (b) 5,240 1,508 1,774 977 981 Other long-term liabilities (c) 3,042 1,132 513 293 1,104 $ 13,070 $ 2,908 $ 3,238 $ 2,264 $ 4,660 (a) Includes scheduled interest payments.

In addition, as disclosed in Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company expects to make approximately $46 of contributions to its retirement plans in 2005, which has been excluded from the above amount. (c) Represents other long-term liabilities on the company Consolidated Balance Sheet, including the current portion of long-term liabilities. The projected timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based on management estimates, which are largely based on historical experience.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to long-term contracts and programs, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, workers compensation, warranty obligations, pre-owned aircraft inventory, and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application: Revenue Recognition Government Contracts. The company accounts for sales and earnings under long-term defense contracts and programs using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. The company follows the guidelines of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts, except that revisions of estimated profits on contracts are included in earnings under the reallocation method, in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes , rather than the cumulative catch-up method. Under the reallocation method, the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining life of the contract, while under the cumulative catch-up method such impact would be recognized immediately. If a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract, the company recognizes the loss in the period it is identified. Anticipated losses cover all costs allocable to the contracts, including G&A expenses. The company estimates profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes that profit evenly over the remaining life of the contract based on either input (e.g., costs incurred) or output (e.g., units delivered) measures, as appropriate to the circumstances. The percentage-of-completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion, and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications. These estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years, including future labor productivity and availability, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, availability of materials, the impact of delayed performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, and the timing of product deliveries. These estimates are based on the company best judgment. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of the company contracts. The company reviews its contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflects changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method. Business Aircraft. The company accounts for contracts for aircraft certified by the FAA in accordance with Statement of Position 81-1. These contracts usually provide for two major milestones: the manufacture of the green aircraft (i.e., before exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics) and its completion. The company records revenue at two points: when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft. The company does not recognize revenue at green delivery unless (1) a contract has been executed with the customer and (2) the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract, as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer. Pre-owned Aircraft Inventories. In connection with orders for new aircraft, the company routinely offers customers trade-in options. Under these options, if exercised, the company will accept trade-in aircraft at a predetermined price based on estimated fair value. It is the company policy to limit its investment in pre-owned aircraft inventory at any point in time to $200, unless specifically authorized. Once acquired in connection with a sale of new aircraft, the company records pre-owned aircraft at the lower of trade-in value or estimated net realizable value. The company treats any excess of the trade-in price above the net realizable value as a reduction of revenue upon the recording of the new aircraft sales transaction. The company also regularly assesses the carrying value of pre-owned aircraft in inventory and adjusts the carrying value to net realizable value when appropriate. The company determines net realizable value by using both internal and external aircraft valuation information. These valuations involve estimates and assumptions about many factors, including current market conditions, future market conditions, the age and condition of the aircraft and the availability of the aircraft in the market. These estimates are based on the company best judgment. Gross margins on sales of pre-owned aircraft can vary from quarter to quarter depending on the mix of aircraft sold and current market conditions. General Dynamics 2004 Annual Report 27 Commitments and Contingencies. The company is subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of its business or arising under provisions relating to the protection of the environment. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment. The company records a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is probable and when the company exposure is reasonably estimable. The ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may change as further facts and circumstances become known. Deferred Contract Costs. Certain costs incurred in the performance of the company government contracts are recorded under GAAP but are not currently allocable to contracts. Such costs include a portion of the company estimated workers compensation, other insurance-related assessments, retirement benefits and environmental expenses. These costs will become allocable to contracts when they are paid. In accordance with AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Audits of Federal Government Contractors, the company defers these costs in contracts in process until they are paid, at which time the costs are charged to contracts and recovered from the government. The company expects to recover these costs through ongoing business, including both existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts. This business base includes numerous contracts for which the company is the sole source or one of two suppliers on long-term defense programs. The company regularly assesses the probability of recovery of these costs under its current and probable follow-on contracts. This assessment requires the company to make assumptions about future contract costs, the extent of cost recovery under the company contracts and the amount of future contract activity. These estimates are based on the company best judgment. If the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of the company remaining contracts could be adversely affected. Pension Plans. The company makes assumptions about discount rates and long-term rates of return on plan assets to determine its net periodic pension cost in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions. These estimates are based on the company best judgment, including consideration of both current and future market conditions. The company considers both internal and external evidence to determine the appropriate assumptions. In the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted, future pension cost as determined under SFAS 87 could increase or decrease. If the assumed rate of return on plan assets increased or decreased by 25 basis points, the company net pension income associated with its commercial plans would have increased or decreased by approximately $3 in 2004. Likewise, had the interest rate used to discount the company projected pension obligation increased or decreased by 25 basis points, the net pension income associated with the commercial plans would have increased or decreased by approximately $1 in 2004. The company contractual arrangements with the U.S.government provide for the recovery of contributions to the company government plans. In accordance with AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Audits of Federal Government Contractors, the company has deferred recognition of the cumulative earnings in its government plans to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses. As such, the company future income is not subject to the consequences of changes in the assumptions associated with these plans. Management believes that its judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented. New Accounting Standards In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS 123(R)). SFAS 123(R) supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value. SFAS 123(R) is effective in the third quarter of 2005. The company expects the adoption of SFAS 123(R) to reduce its net earnings by approximately $15 in 2005. 28 General Dynamics 2004 Annual Report
