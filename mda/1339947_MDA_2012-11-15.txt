In 2010, we changed our fiscal year end to September 30 from December 31 to better align our financial reporting period, as well as our annual planning and budgeting process, with our business cycle, particularly the cable broadcast year. This Annual Report on Form 10-K reports our financial results for the year ended September 30, 2012 ( 2012 ), the year ended September 30, 2011 ( 2011 ) and the nine-month transition period from January 1, 2010 through September 30, 2010 ( 2010 ). For purposes of comparison, we have included the unaudited financial results for the year ended September 30, 2010 (which reflects our combined results for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 and the nine-month transition period from January 1, 2010 through September 30, 2010) and nine months ended September 30, 2009. See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We manage our operations through two reporting segments: Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment . Our measure of segment performance is adjusted operating income (loss). We define adjusted operating income (loss) for our segments as operating income (loss), before equity-based compensation and certain other items identified as affecting comparability, including restructuring charges and asset impairment, when applicable. Equity-based compensation is excluded from our segment measure of performance since it is set and approved by the Compensation Committee of Viacom Board of Directors in consultation with corporate executive management, and is included as a component of consolidated adjusted operating income. When applicable, we use consolidated adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom and adjusted diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) from continuing operations, among other measures, to evaluate our actual operating performance and for planning and forecasting of future periods. We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because they clarify our actual operating performance, make it easier to compare Viacom results with those of other companies and allow investors to review performance in the same way as our management. Since these are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ), they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom and diluted EPS as indicators of operating performance and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. For a reconciliation of our adjusted measures and discussion of the items affecting comparability refer to the section entitled Factors Affecting Comparability . Media Networks Our Media Networks segment, which includes brands such as MTV, VH1, CMT, Logo, BET, CENTRIC, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., TeenNick, Nicktoons, Nick at Nite, COMEDY CENTRAL, TV Land, SPIKE, Tr3s, Paramount Channel and VIVA, provides entertainment content and related branded products for consumers in targeted demographics attractive to advertisers, content distributors and retailers. We create, acquire and distribute programming and other content to our audiences across multiple platforms, which allows them to engage with our content how and where they want to view and interact with it: on television, online and on mobile devices and through a variety of consumer products. 38 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Our Media Networks segment generates revenues in three categories: (i) the sale of advertising related to our content and marketing services, (ii) affiliate fees from cable television operators, direct-to-home satellite television operators, digital distributors, telecommunications operators and mobile networks and (iii) ancillary revenues, which include consumer products licensing, brand licensing, home entertainment sales of our programming, television syndication and casual gaming. Our advertising revenues may be affected by the strength of advertising markets and general economic conditions and may fluctuate depending on the success of our programming, as measured by viewership, at any given time. Audience measurement ratings may vary due to the timing of availability of new episodes of popular programming, success of our programming, performance of competing programs and other entertainment alternatives for viewers, as well as variations related to the methods used by third parties to measure ratings. Advertising revenues may also fluctuate due to seasonal variations, typically being highest in the first quarter of our fiscal year. In addition, advertising revenues may fluctuate due to the timing of significant programming events, such as awards shows or premieres. Our affiliate agreements with cable and satellite operators are generally multi-year carriage agreements with set rate increases that provide us with a reasonably stable source of revenues. The amount of the fees we receive is generally a function of the number of subscribers and the rates we receive per subscriber. Expirations of our affiliate agreements are staggered. Digital distribution agreements typically cover a large amount of programming and provide for various dates upon which each program becomes available for distribution on the digital platform. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized upon program availability and fluctuates quarterly depending on the availability of the programs licensed. Digital distribution agreements are generally for a shorter term than carriage agreements with traditional cable and satellite television operators reflecting the relatively less mature nature of the digital distribution business. Our ancillary revenues vary based on consumer spending, the popularity of our programming, volume of content available for sale during a particular period and acceptance of our or our partners products. Media Networks segment expenses consist of operating expenses, selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses and depreciation and amortization. Operating expenses are comprised of costs related to original and acquired programming, including programming amortization, expenses associated with the manufacturing and distribution of home entertainment products and consumer products licensing, participation fees, integrated marketing expenses and other costs of sales. SG&A expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, marketing, research and professional service fees and facility and occupancy costs. Depreciation and amortization expenses reflect depreciation of fixed assets, including transponders financed under capital leases, and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. Filmed Entertainment Our Filmed Entertainment segment produces, finances and distributes motion pictures and other entertainment content under the Paramount Pictures, Paramount Vantage, Paramount Classics, Insurge Pictures, MTV Films, and Nickelodeon Movies brands. Paramount also acquires films for distribution and has distribution relationships with third parties, including DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc. ( DreamWorks Animation ). In general, motion pictures produced, acquired and/or distributed by our Filmed Entertainment segment are exhibited theatrically domestically and internationally, followed by their release in various windows on DVDs and Blu-ray discs, electronic sell-through (e.g., download-to-own), video-on-demand, subscription video-on-demand, pay and basic cable television, broadcast television and syndicated television, and, in some 39 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) cases, by other exhibitors such as airlines and hotels (the distribution windows ). In fiscal year 2012, the Filmed Entertainment segment theatrically released in domestic and/or international markets Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol, Paranormal Activity 3, The Dictator, The Adventures of Tintin and Hugo, among others. Paramount also distributed DreamWorks Animation Madagascar 3: Europe Most Wanted and Puss in Boots. Our Filmed Entertainment segment generates revenues worldwide principally from: (i) the theatrical release and/or distribution of motion pictures, (ii) home entertainment, which includes sales of DVDs, Blu-ray discs and other products relating to the motion pictures we release theatrically and direct-to-DVD, as well as certain other programming, including content we distribute on behalf of third parties, (iii) television and digital license fees paid worldwide by third parties for film exhibition rights during the various other distribution windows and through digital distributors and (iv) ancillary revenues from digital license fees paid worldwide by third parties for film exhibition rights through digital distributors, providing production services to third parties, primarily at Paramount studio lot, licensing of its brands for consumer products and theme parks, and distribution of content specifically developed for digital platforms and game distribution. Revenues from motion picture theatrical releases tend to be cyclical with increases during the summer months and around holidays, particularly in the first quarter of our fiscal year. The theatrical success of a motion picture is a significant factor in determining the revenues it is likely to generate in home entertainment sales and licensing fees during the various other distribution windows. Our home entertainment revenues may also be affected by the number, timing and mix of home entertainment releases in any given period, consumer tastes and consumption habits, the prominence given by distributors and retailers to our releases compared to those of our competitors, and by overall economic conditions, including consumer preference for rental or purchase and trends in discretionary spending. While the DVD category continues to decline, this has been partially offset by increases in revenues from digital sources. The home entertainment industry continues to experience softness in the DVD market as a result of several factors, including the maturation of the standard definition DVD format, the popularity of various emerging digital distribution platforms and continuing weakness in the overall economy. The output term of Paramount agreement with DreamWorks Animation expires on the later of the delivery of 13 qualified animated motion pictures and December 31, 2012, subject to earlier termination under certain limited circumstances. Paramount has released 13 DreamWorks Animation films under the agreement in theaters, two of which were released in fiscal year 2012, and expects to distribute the final film under the agreement in November 2012. In October 2010, Paramount and MVL Productions LLC ( Marvel ), now a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company, amended the arrangement under which Paramount distributes certain of Marvel self-produced feature films on a worldwide basis. Paramount transferred to Marvel substantially all of its worldwide distribution rights to The Avengers and all of its worldwide distribution rights to Iron Man 3 , in exchange for aggregate minimum guaranteed payments to Paramount of $115 million and the right for Paramount to receive certain contingent consideration. Paramount retained its distribution rights to Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger, which were released in fiscal year 2011 and were the final two theatrical titles released under the distribution arrangement with Marvel, and to the previously released Iron Man and Iron Man 2. Filmed Entertainment segment expenses consist of operating expenses, SG&A expenses and depreciation and amortization. Operating expenses principally include the amortization of film costs of our released feature films (including participations accrued under our third-party distribution arrangements), print and advertising expenses and other distribution costs. We incur marketing costs before and throughout the theatrical release of a film and, to a lesser extent, other distribution windows. Such costs are incurred to generate public interest in our films and 40 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) are expensed as incurred; therefore, we typically incur losses with respect to a particular film prior to and during the film theatrical exhibition and profitability may not be realized until well after a film theatrical release. Therefore, the results of the Filmed Entertainment segment can be volatile as films work their way through the various distribution windows. SG&A expenses include employee compensation, facility and occupancy costs, professional service fees and other overhead costs. Depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Year ended September 30, 2012 vs. 2011 Consolidated Results of Operations Our summary consolidated results of operations are presented below for the years ended September 30, 2012 and 2011. Year Ended September 30, Better/(Worse) (in millions, except per share amounts) 2012 2011 $ % Revenues $ 13,887 $ 14,914 $ (1,027) (7 )% Operating income 3,901 3,710 191 5 Adjusted operating income 3,901 3,854 47 1 Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom 2,345 2,146 199 9 Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom 2,264 2,247 17 1 Diluted EPS from continuing operations 4.36 3.61 0.75 21 Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations $ 4.21 $ 3.78 $ 0.43 11 % See the section entitled Factors Affecting Comparability for a reconciliation of our adjusted measures to our reported results. Revenues Worldwide revenues decreased $1.027 billion, or 7%, to $13.887 billion in the year ended September 30, 2012. Filmed Entertainment decreased $1.103 billion, principally reflecting lower theatrical and home entertainment revenues. Media Networks contributed a partially offsetting increase of $49 million with higher affiliate revenues more than offsetting the declines in advertising and ancillary revenues. Operating Income Adjusted operating income increased $47 million, or 1%, to $3.901 billion in the year ended September 30, 2012. Media Networks adjusted operating income increased $41 million, principally reflecting the net increase in revenues. Filmed Entertainment adjusted operating income decreased $16 million, principally reflecting the difficult comparison against the benefit from the sale of the distribution rights to The Avengers and Iron Man 3 to Marvel in the prior year, partially offset by this year increased digital revenues. Adjusted results for the year ended September 30, 2011 exclude the impact of $144 million of restructuring charges. Including the impact of the prior year restructuring charges, operating income increased $191 million, or 5%, in the year ended September 30, 2012. See the section entitled Segment Results of Operations for a more in-depth discussion of the revenues, expenses and adjusted operating income for each of the Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment segments. 41 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Viacom Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom increased $17 million, or 1%, to $2.264 billion in the year ended September 30, 2012, principally due to the increase in tax-effected adjusted operating income described above, partially offset by lower equity income due to a Viacom 18 equity loss. Our effective income tax rate was 34.0% in the year ended September 30, 2012, as compared with 34.3% in the year ended September 30, 2011, excluding the impact of discrete items. The decrease in this year effective rate is principally due to incremental tax benefits associated with qualified production activities. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations increased $0.43 per diluted share to $4.21, principally reflecting fewer outstanding shares. Including the impact of the prior year restructuring charges and a loss on extinguishment of debt and discrete tax benefits in both years, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom increased $199 million, or 9%, in the year ended September 30, 2012. Diluted EPS from continuing operations increased $0.75 per diluted share to $4.36. See the section entitled Factors Affecting Comparability for a reconciliation of our adjusted measures to our reported results. Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax The loss from discontinued operations in both years was principally related to Harmonix Music Systems Inc. ( Harmonix ). The $364 million loss in 2012 principally reflects a $383 million pre-tax charge related to the earn-out dispute with the former shareholders of Harmonix, which we sold in December 2010. The $10 million loss in 2011 principally reflects the loss on the disposal of Harmonix and the Harmonix operating loss for the period through the date of sale, partially offset by the related tax benefit. Segment Results of Operations Transactions between reportable segments are accounted for as third-party arrangements for the purposes of presenting segment results of operations. Typical intersegment transactions include the purchase of advertising by the Filmed Entertainment segment on Media Networks properties and the purchase of Filmed Entertainment feature films exhibition rights by Media Networks .

Domestic revenues were $7.791 billion, an increase of $69 million, or 1%. International revenues were $1.403 billion, a decrease of $20 million, or 1%, with 2 percentage points of decline resulting from foreign exchange. Advertising Worldwide advertising revenues decreased $241 million, or 5%, to $4.756 billion in the year ended September 30, 2012. Domestic advertising revenues decreased 4%, primarily driven by lower commercial units sold. Lower ratings resulted in fewer commercial units being available for sale as units were used to achieve ratings guarantees. International advertising revenues decreased 11%, including lower revenues from certain production and promotional events, with 4 percentage points of the decline resulting from foreign exchange. Affiliate Fees Worldwide affiliate fees increased $370 million, or 11%, to $3.889 billion in the year ended September 30, 2012, principally reflecting rate increases, as well as a benefit from the availability of certain programming related to digital distribution arrangements. Domestic affiliate revenues increased 10% and international revenues increased 14%, including a 2-percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of digital distribution arrangements, domestic affiliate revenue growth was in the high-single digits. Ancillary Worldwide ancillary revenues decreased $80 million, or 13%, to $549 million in the year ended September 30, 2012, principally reflecting lower home entertainment revenues and consumer products licensing. Expenses Media Networks segment expenses were substantially flat at approximately $5.3 billion in the year ended September 30, 2012. Increases in operating expenses were substantially offset by decreases in SG&A expenses and depreciation and amortization. Operating Operating expenses increased $161 million, or 5%, to $3.186 billion in the year ended September 30, 2012. Programming expenses increased $144 million, or 5%, principally reflecting expenses associated with our continuing investment in programming. Distribution and other operating expenses, including participations related to digital distribution arrangements and integrated marketing expenses, increased $17 million, or 5%. Selling, General and Administrative SG&A expenses decreased $120 million, or 6%, to $1.975 billion in the year ended September 30, 2012, principally due to lower incentive-based compensation accruals, as well as savings from our 2011 restructuring actions. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization decreased $33 million, or 19%, to $144 million in the year ended September 30, 2012, principally resulting from lower intangible asset and capital lease amortization. Adjusted Operating Income Adjusted operating income increased $41 million, or 1%, to $3.889 billion in the year ended September 30, 2012, principally reflecting the net increase in revenues. 43 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Filmed Entertainment Year Ended September 30, Better/(Worse) (in millions) 2012 2011 $ % Revenues by Component Theatrical $ 1,310 $ 2,175 $ (865 ) (40 )% Home entertainment 1,662 1,890 (228 ) (12 ) Television license fees 1,394 1,417 (23 ) (2 ) Ancillary 454 441 13 3 Total revenues by component $ 4,820 $ 5,923 $ (1,103 ) (19 )% Expenses Operating $ 3,935 $ 4,997 $ 1,062 21 % Selling, general & administrative 473 496 23 5 Depreciation & amortization 87 89 2 2 Total expenses $ 4,495 $ 5,582 $ 1,087 19 % Adjusted Operating Income $ 325 $ 341 $ (16 ) (5 )% Revenues Worldwide revenues decreased $1.103 billion, or 19%, to $4.820 billion in the year ended September 30, 2012, principally driven by lower theatrical and home entertainment revenues. Domestic revenues were $2.135 billion, a decrease of $825 million, or 28%. International revenues were $2.685 billion, a decrease of $278 million, or 9%, with 2 percentage points of the decline resulting from the impact from foreign exchange. Theatrical Worldwide theatrical revenues decreased $865 million, or 40%, to $1.310 billion in the year ended September 30, 2012, principally reflecting the mix of our 2012 releases. During the year ended September 30, 2012, we released fifteen films, including Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol, DreamWorks Animation Madagascar 3: Europe Most Wanted and Puss in Boots and Paranormal Activity 3 , as compared to sixteen films in the prior year. Lower revenues from our current year releases were principally due to the difficult comparison against last year release of Transformers: Dark of the Moon and Marvel Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger . Domestic and international theatrical revenues decreased 43% and 37%, respectively. Foreign exchange had a 2-percentage point unfavorable impact on international theatrical revenues. Home Entertainment Worldwide home entertainment revenues decreased $228 million, or 12%, to $1.662 billion in the year ended September 30, 2012. Current year releases included Marvel Captain America: The First Avenger, DreamWorks Animation Puss in Boots and Kung Fu Panda 2, and Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol . Lower revenues from our current year releases were principally due to the difficult comparison against last year releases including lower revenues from our third-party distribution arrangements. Domestic and international home entertainment revenues decreased 19% and 3%, respectively. Foreign exchange had a 2-percentage point unfavorable impact on international home entertainment revenues. International home entertainment revenues also include the international release of Transformers: Dark of the Moon while the domestic release benefitted our 2011 results. Television License Fees Television license fees decreased $23 million, or 2%, to $1.394 billion in the year ended September 30, 2012, driven by the number and mix of available titles. 44 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Ancillary Ancillary revenues increased $13 million, or 3%, to $454 million in the year ended September 30, 2012. Higher digital revenues were partially offset by the comparison against the sale of the distribution rights to The Avengers and Iron Man 3 to Marvel in the prior year for approximately $115 million. Expenses Filmed Entertainment segment expenses decreased $1.087 billion, or 19%, to $4.495 billion in the year ended September 30, 2012 due to decreases in operating and SG&A expenses. Operating Operating expenses decreased $1.062 billion, or 21%, to $3.935 billion in the year ended September 30, 2012, principally due to the mix of theatrical releases. Film costs decreased $598 million, or 22%. Distribution and other costs, principally print and advertising expenses, decreased $464 million, or 20%. Selling, General and Administrative SG&A expenses decreased $23 million, or 5%, to $473 million in the year ended September 30, 2012, principally driven by savings from our 2011 restructuring actions and lower incentive compensation. Adjusted Operating Income Adjusted operating income decreased $16 million, or 5%, to $325 million in the year ended September 30, 2012, principally reflecting the difficult comparison against the benefit from the sale of the distribution rights to The Avengers and Iron Man 3 to Marvel in the prior year, partially offset by income attributable to this year increased digital revenues and cost savings from our 2011 restructuring actions. Year ended September 30, 2011 vs. 2010 Consolidated Results of Operations Our summary consolidated results of operations are presented below for the years ended September 30, 2011 and 2010. As previously noted, the year ended September 30, 2010 reflects our unaudited combined results for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 and the nine-month transition period from January 1, 2010 through September 30, 2010. Year Ended September 30, Better/(Worse) (in millions, except per share amounts) 2011 2010 $ % Revenues $ 14,914 $ 13,356 $ 1,558 12 % Operating income 3,710 3,348 362 11 Adjusted operating income 3,854 3,408 446 13 Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom 2,146 1,899 247 13 Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom 2,247 1,841 406 22 Diluted EPS from continuing operations 3.61 3.11 0.50 16 Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations $ 3.78 $ 3.02 $ 0.76 25 % See the section entitled Factors Affecting Comparability for a reconciliation of our adjusted measures to our reported results. Revenues Worldwide revenues increased $1.558 billion, or 12%, to $14.914 billion in the year ended September 30, 2011. Media Networks contributed $814 million of the increase reflecting higher advertising and affiliate revenues. Filmed Entertainment contributed $770 million of the increase, principally reflecting higher theatrical and ancillary revenues, partially offset by lower home entertainment revenues. 45 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Operating Income Adjusted operating income increased $446 million, or 13%, to $3.854 billion in the year ended September 30, 2011. Media Networks adjusted operating income increased $467 million, principally reflecting the increased revenues, partially offset by increased expenses. Filmed Entertainment was substantially flat. Adjusted results for the year ended September 30, 2011 exclude the impact of $144 million of restructuring charges, principally related to workforce reductions, while the adjusted results for the year ended September 30, 2010 exclude the impact of a $60 million asset impairment. Including the impact of the 2011 restructuring charges and the 2010 asset impairment, operating income increased $362 million, or 11%, in the year ended September 30, 2011. See the section entitled Segment Results of Operations for a more in-depth discussion of the revenues, expenses and adjusted operating income for each of the Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment segments. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Viacom Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom increased $406 million, or 22%, in the year ended September 30, 2011, principally due to the increase in tax-effected adjusted operating income described above and higher equity income principally due to EPIX generating equity income in 2011 as compared with losses in 2010. Our effective income tax rate was 34.3% in the year ended September 30, 2011, as compared with 35.9% in the year ended September 30, 2010, excluding the impact of discrete items. The reduction in this year effective rate is principally due to a change in mix of domestic and international income. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations increased $0.76 per diluted share to $3.78. Including the impact of the 2011 restructuring charges, loss on extinguishment of debt and discrete tax benefits, and the 2010 asset impairment and discrete tax benefits, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom increased $247 million, or 13%, in the year ended September 30, 2011. Diluted EPS from continuing operations increased $0.50 per diluted share to $3.61. See the section entitled Factors Affecting Comparability for a reconciliation of our adjusted measures to our reported results. Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax The loss from discontinued operations in both years was principally related to Harmonix. The $10 million loss in 2011 principally reflects the loss on the disposal of Harmonix and the Harmonix operating loss for the period through the date of sale, partially offset by the related tax benefit. The $351 million loss in 2010 principally reflects a $230 million impairment loss on Harmonix goodwill and other charges of approximately $30 million, principally related to unamortized development costs and other assets associated with legacy versions of the Rock Band game. 46 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Segment Results of Operations Media Networks Year Ended September 30, Better/(Worse) (in millions) 2011 2010 $ % Revenues by Component Advertising $ 4,997 $ 4,553 $ 444 10 % Affiliate fees 3,519 3,138 381 12 Ancillary 629 640 (11 ) (2 ) Total revenues by component $ 9,145 $ 8,331 $ 814 10 % Expenses Operating $ 3,025 $ 2,822 $ (203 ) (7 )% Selling, general and administrative 2,095 1,927 (168 ) (9 ) Depreciation and amortization 177 201 24 12 Total expenses $ 5,297 $ 4,950 $ (347 ) (7 )% Adjusted Operating Income $ 3,848 $ 3,381 $ 467 14 % Revenues Worldwide revenues increased $814 million, or 10%, to $9.145 billion in the year ended September 30, 2011, driven by increases in advertising and affiliate revenues.

The decline was principally driven by lower catalog sales and lower revenues from other third-party distribution arrangements. Domestic and international home entertainment revenues decreased 11% and 9%, respectively. Foreign exchange had a 3-percentage point favorable impact on international home entertainment revenues. Television License Fees Television license fees increased $34 million, or 2%, to $1.417 billion in the year ended September 30, 2011, driven by the number and mix of available titles. Ancillary Ancillary revenues increased $143 million, or 48%, to $441 million in the year ended September 30, 2011, principally driven by the sale of the distribution rights to The Avengers and Iron Man 3 to Marvel, as well as higher digital revenues.

Revenues Worldwide revenues increased $99 million, or 1%, to $9.337 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2010 driven by an increase at Media Networks of $405 million, principally reflecting higher affiliate fees and advertising revenues. Filmed Entertainment revenues decreased $329 million, principally reflecting lower home entertainment revenues, partially offset by higher theatrical revenues. The decrease in home entertainment revenues principally reflects fewer releases as compared with 2009 and lower catalog sales. The increase in theatrical revenues reflects the strength of our 2010 releases. Operating Income Adjusted operating income increased $270 million, or 14%, to $2.207 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2010. Media Networks contributed $192 million of the increase, principally reflecting the increased revenues, partially offset by our continuing investment in programming. Filmed Entertainment adjusted operating income was $38 million, compared with a $56 million operating loss in the comparable period of 2009, principally reflecting the improved profitability of our 2010 releases. Operating income increased $303 million, or 16%. See the section entitled Segment Results of Operations for a more in-depth discussion of the revenues, expenses and adjusted operating income (loss) for each of the Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment segments. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Viacom Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom increased $195 million, or 20%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2010, principally due to the increase in tax-effected adjusted operating income described above and lower foreign exchange losses, which are included in Other items, net . Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations increased $0.31 per diluted share to $1.88. Adjusted results exclude the impact of certain items identified as affecting comparability, including discrete tax benefits in both periods and restructuring charges and a loss on extinguishment of debt in 2009. See the section entitled Factors Affecting Comparability for a reconciliation of our adjusted measures to our reported results. Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom increased $221 million, or 23%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2010. Diluted EPS from continuing operations increased $0.35 per diluted share to $1.92. Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax The loss from discontinued operations, net of tax was $321 million and $37 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The loss in 2010 principally reflects a $230 million impairment loss on Harmonix goodwill and other charges of approximately $30 million, principally related to unamortized development costs and other assets associated with legacy versions of the Rock Band game. 50 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Segment Results of Operations Media Networks Nine Months Ended September 30, Better/(Worse) (in millions) 2010 2009 $ % Revenues by Component Advertising $ 3,251 $ 3,103 $ 148 5 % Affiliate fees 2,397 2,160 237 11 Ancillary 429 409 20 5 Total revenues by component $ 6,077 $ 5,672 $ 405 7 % Expenses Operating $ 2,097 $ 1,964 $ (133) (7 )% Selling, general and administrative 1,433 1,350 (83) (6 ) Depreciation and amortization 148 151 3 2 Total expenses $ 3,678 $ 3,465 $ (213) (6 )% Adjusted Operating Income $ 2,399 $ 2,207 $ 192 9 % Revenues Worldwide revenues increased $405 million, or 7%, to $6.077 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2010, primarily driven by increases in affiliate and advertising revenues.

International advertising revenues increased 7%, with a 1-percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange on international growth. Affiliate Fees Worldwide affiliate fees increased $237 million, or 11%, to $2.397 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2010, principally due to rate and subscriber growth. Domestic revenues also benefited from the availability of certain programming related to digital distribution arrangements. Domestic affiliate revenues increased 12% and international affiliate revenues increased 7%, with foreign exchange contributing 1 percentage point to international growth. Excluding the impact of digital distribution arrangements, domestic affiliate revenue growth was 10%. Ancillary Worldwide ancillary revenues increased $20 million, or 5%, to $429 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2010. Higher international revenues, reflecting growth in consumer products revenues and television license fees, were partially offset by lower domestic revenues. 51 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Expenses Media Networks segment expenses increased $213 million, or 6%, to $3.678 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2010, driven by higher programming costs, reflecting our continuing investment in programming, and incentive compensation costs.

Domestic revenues were $1.598 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2010, a decline of $328 million, or 17%. International revenues were substantially flat at $1.764 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2010, with a 3-percentage point favorable impact from foreign exchange on international revenues. Theatrical Worldwide theatrical revenues increased $55 million, or 4%, to $1.283 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2010, principally driven by the strength of our 2010 releases. During the nine months ended September 30, 2010, we released nine films, including Shrek Forever After , Iron Man 2 , How to Train Your 52 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Dragon, The Last Airbender and Shutter Island, as compared to thirteen films in 2009. Domestic theatrical revenues decreased 11% reflecting the particularly strong domestic performance of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and Star Trek in 2009, while international theatrical revenues increased 23%. Foreign exchange had a 5-percentage point favorable impact on international theatrical revenues. Home Entertainment Worldwide home entertainment revenues decreased $405 million, or 30%, to $951 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2010. The decrease principally reflects fewer releases as compared with 2009. During the nine months ended September 30, 2010, we released five titles, including Iron Man 2 and Shutter Island , as compared to twelve titles in the nine months ended September 30, 2009. Also contributing to the decline were lower catalog sales and lower revenues from other third-party distribution arrangements. Domestic and international home entertainment revenues decreased 32% and 28%, respectively, with a 3-percentage point favorable impact from foreign exchange on international home entertainment revenues. Television License Fees Television license fees were flat at $938 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2010, with an increase in syndication revenues offset by a decrease in pay and network TV revenues reflecting the number and mix of available titles in each window. Ancillary Ancillary revenues increased $21 million, or 12%, to $190 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, principally due to higher digital revenues. Expenses Filmed Entertainment segment expenses decreased $423 million, or 11%, to $3.324 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2010. The reduction in total expenses is principally due to fewer theatrical and home entertainment releases. Operating Operating expenses decreased $458 million, or 14%, to $2.888 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2010. Distribution and other costs, principally print and advertising expenses, decreased by $333 million, or 20%, primarily related to the fewer number of theatrical and home entertainment releases as well as cost savings initiatives. Film costs declined $125 million, or 7%, primarily reflecting lower amortization of film costs due to the number and mix of current releases. Selling, General and Administrative SG&A expenses increased $41 million, or 13%, to $367 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2010, principally driven by the timing of incentive compensation costs and severance costs associated with headcount reductions. Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) Adjusted operating income was $38 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared with an adjusted operating loss of $56 million in the comparable period of 2009, principally reflecting the improved profitability of our 2010 releases. FACTORS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY The consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended September 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010 and the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Results for the aforementioned periods, as discussed in the 53 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) section entitled Overview , have been affected by certain items identified as affecting comparability. Accordingly, when applicable, we use adjusted measures to evaluate our actual operating performance. The following tables reconcile our adjusted measures to our reported results for the years ended September 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010, and the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009.

Restructuring Restructuring charges are reflected within Restructuring in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. 2011 In the quarter ended September 30, 2011, we reviewed our cost structure and took certain actions to combine and increase the efficiency of various functions across the organization, which resulted in a restructuring charge of $130 million. The restructuring plan included workforce reductions and other exit activities across the Company operations, which were substantially completed as of September 30, 2012. As a result of these initiatives we expect annual pre-tax savings of approximately $140 million, the benefit of which began to phase in this year. In the quarter ended June 30, 2011, the Media Networks segment incurred employee separation costs, including accelerated vesting of certain equity-based compensation awards, of $14 million. The following table presents the components of the 2011 restructuring charges by segment: 2011 Restructuring Charges (in millions) Media Networks Filmed Entertainment Total Severance charges $ 84 $ 39 $ 123 Lease termination and other exit costs 7 14 21 September 30, 2011 $ 91 $ 53 $ 144 2009 In 2009, we took actions resulting in severance charges of $16 million in the Media Networks segment and $17 million in the Filmed Entertainment segment. Extinguishment of Debt 2012 In 2012, we redeemed all $750 million of our outstanding 6.850% Senior Notes due December 2055 (the 2055 Notes ) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of each 2055 Notes, plus accrued interest thereon. As a result of the redemption, we expensed the unamortized issuance costs associated with the 2055 Notes, which resulted in a pre-tax extinguishment loss of $21 million. 55 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) 2011 In 2011, we conducted a cash tender offer to repurchase a portion of the $1.5 billion aggregate principal of our 6.25% Senior Notes due 2016. Our repurchase of $582 million of principal at a purchase price of $1,153.50 per $1,000 pursuant to the tender offer resulted in a pre-tax extinguishment loss of $87 million. 2009 In 2009, we conducted a cash tender offer to repurchase a substantial portion of the $1.5 billion aggregate principal of our 5.75% Senior Notes due 2011. Our repurchase of $1.307 billion of principal at a purchase price of $1,061.25 per $1,000 pursuant to the tender offer resulted in a pre-tax extinguishment loss of $84 million. Asset Impairment 2009 In 2009, we recorded a $60 million non-cash impairment charge in the Media Networks segment related to certain broadcast licenses held by a 32%-owned consolidated entity. The impact to Net earnings attributable to Viacom was a reduction of $19 million, with the remaining $41 million allocated to the noncontrolling interest. Discrete Tax Items Our effective income tax rate was 34.0%, 34.3% and 35.9% for the year ended September 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, excluding the impact of discrete items. In 2012, discrete tax benefits of $94 million, taken together with the effective income tax rate impact of the 2012 loss on extinguishment of debt, contributed 2.7 percentage points of tax benefit, which reconciles to the reported effective rate of 31.3%. The benefits in 2012 include certain operating and capital loss carryforward benefits that are now more likely than not to be realized, as well as the release of tax reserves with respect to certain effectively settled tax positions. In 2011, discrete tax benefits of $52 million, taken together with the impact of restructuring charges and the 2011 loss on extinguishment of debt, contributed 1.6 percentage points of net tax benefit, which reconciles to the reported effective rate of 32.7%. In 2010, discrete tax benefits of $77 million, taken together with the impact of asset impairment, contributed 2.0 percentage points of tax benefit, which reconciles to the reported effective tax rate of 33.9%. The discrete tax benefits in 2011 and 2010 were principally due to reserve releases resulting from effectively settled audits. The benefit in 2010 also reflects the disposition of certain assets. Our effective income tax rate was 36.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, excluding the impact of discrete items. In 2010, discrete tax benefits of $27 million contributed 1.5 percentage points of tax benefit, which reconciles to the reported effective rate of 34.6%. In 2009, discrete tax benefits of $74 million contributed 5.4 percentage points of tax benefit, which reconciles to the reported effective rate of 30.7%. The benefit in the nine months ended September 30, 2010 principally reflects tax benefits from the disposition of certain assets. The benefit in the nine months ended September 30, 2009 principally reflects reserve releases resulting from effectively settled audits and the recognition of certain previously unrecognized capital losses from international operations. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Sources and Uses of Cash Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided through the operations of our businesses. Our principal uses of cash in operations include the creation of new programming and film content, acquisitions of third-party content, and interest and income tax payments. We also use cash for capital expenditures, acquisitions of businesses, 56 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) quarterly cash dividends and discretionary share repurchases under our stock repurchase program, as deemed appropriate. Our cash flows from operations, together with our credit facilities, provide us with adequate resources to fund our anticipated ongoing cash requirements. We have and may continue to access external financing from time to time depending on our cash requirements, assessments of current and anticipated market conditions and after-tax cost of capital. Our access to capital markets can be impacted by factors outside our control, including economic conditions; however, we believe that our strong cash flows and balance sheet, our credit facilities and our credit rating will provide us with adequate access to funding given our expected cash needs. Any new borrowing cost would be affected by market conditions and short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $173 million in the year ended September 30, 2012, and increased $184 million in the year ended September 30, 2011 and $539 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2010. The net change in cash and cash equivalents was attributable to the following: Cash Flows Year Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2012 2011 2010 2010 2009 Cash provided by operations $ 2,498 $ 2,644 $ 1,566 $ 1,147 $ 732 Net cash flow used in investing activities (256) (227) (325) (168) (117) Net cash flow used in financing activities (2,413) (2,227) (655) (436) (1,169) Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (2) (6) 2 (4) 11 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (173) $ 184 $ 588 $ 539 $ (543) Operating Activities Cash provided by operations was $2.498 billion for the year ended September 30, 2012, a decrease of $146 million compared with 2011. The decrease principally reflects the timing of annual incentive compensation payments as a result of our 2010 fiscal year end change and payments related to our 2011 restructuring actions, partially offset by the comparison against the payment of a premium on our debt extinguishment in the prior year. In addition, 2012 included $1 million of cash provided by discontinued operations as compared to $21 million of cash used in discontinued operations in 2011. The Media Networks segment consistently generates a significant percentage of our cash flow from operating activities. Advertising is generally purchased by large media buying agencies and our affiliate fees are principally earned from cable and satellite television operators. The Filmed Entertainment segment operational results and ability to generate cash flow from operations substantially depend on the number and timing of films in development and production, the level and timing of print and advertising costs and the public response to our theatrical film and home entertainment releases. Cash provided by operations was $2.644 billion for the year ended September 30, 2011, an increase of $1.078 billion compared with the same period in 2010. The increase principally reflects the comparison against a $775 million reduction in securitized receivables in 2010 and higher income, partially offset by increased production spending at the Filmed Entertainment segment, as well as the payment of the premium on our 2011 debt extinguishment. In addition, cash used in discontinued operations was $21 million in fiscal 2011 as compared with cash provided by discontinued operations of $121 million in 2010, principally due to a full year of activity in 2010 as compared with three months in 2011. 57 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Cash provided by operations was $1.147 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, an increase of $415 million compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2009. The increase principally reflects the increase in earnings, lower pension contributions, lower print and advertising expenses and the comparison against a $175 million reduction in securitized receivables and an $84 million payment of a premium on debt extinguishment in 2009, partially offset by higher income tax payments. Cash tax payments increased during the period primarily as a result of the 2009 tax benefits associated with our 2008 restructuring and other charges, the expiration at December 31, 2009 of certain federal income tax benefits related to programming and film investment and increased pre-tax earnings. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $256 million for the year ended September 30, 2012, compared with $227 million in 2011. The increase reflects a payment related to the earn-out dispute with the former shareholders of Harmonix and lower spending on acquisitions and investments. In 2011, cash used in investing activities included $72 million related to acquisitions and investments principally reflecting an investment in a European television programmer. In general, our segments require relatively low levels of capital expenditures in relation to our annual cash flow from operations which contributes to our ability to generate cash flow for future investment in our content and business operations, which we expect to be able to maintain over time. Cash used in investing activities was $227 million for the year ended September 30, 2011, compared with $325 million in the same period in 2010. The decrease is principally due to lower spending on acquisitions and investments. In fiscal year 2011, cash used in investing activities included $72 million related to acquisitions and investments principally reflecting an investment in a European television programmer. For the same period in 2010, the $154 million related to acquisitions and investments principally related to the acquisition of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and investment in EPIX. Cash used in investing activities was $168 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, compared with $117 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2009. The increase is primarily due to increased spending on capital expenditures and investments, principally related to Viacom 18 and EPIX, partially offset by cash acquired from DW Funding LLC ( DW Funding ). Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $2.413 billion for the year ended September 30, 2012, compared with $2.227 billion in 2011. The net outflow was primarily driven by the settlement of share repurchases and dividends. During 2012, we repurchased 59.9 million shares for an aggregate price of $2.8 billion, of which $2.759 billion of repurchases had settled as of September 30, 2012, and paid $554 million in dividends. The net impact of our issuance of $2.15 billion of senior notes and debentures and debt repayments of $1.315 billion contributed a partially offsetting inflow. In the prior year, cash used in financing activities was driven by share repurchases of $2.45 billion and dividends of $417 million, partially offset by the net impact of our senior notes issuances and debt repayments. Cash used in financing activities was $2.227 billion for the year ended September 30, 2011, compared with $655 million in the same period in 2010. The net outflow was primarily driven by share repurchases and dividends. During the year ended September 30, 2011, we repurchased 55.7 million shares for an aggregate price of $2.5 billion, of which $2.45 billion of repurchases had settled as of September 30, 2011, and paid $417 million in dividends. Our commercial paper borrowings of $423 million, taken together with the net impact of our issuance of $1.0 billion of senior notes, repurchase of $582 million principal amount of our 6.25% Senior Notes due 2016 58 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) and repayment of the remaining $193 million principal amount of our 5.75% Senior Notes due on April 30, 2011, contributed a partially offsetting inflow. In 2010, cash used in financing activities was driven by the repayment of long-term debt and commercial paper borrowings. Cash used in financing activities was $436 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, compared with $1.169 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. The net outflow in 2010 was primarily driven by the repayment of DW Funding debt and the dividends paid. The net outflow in 2009 was primarily driven by $750 million in payments related to the maturity of our floating rate senior notes which came due in the second quarter of 2009 and a decrease in amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. In 2009, we issued a total of $1.4 billion of senior notes and used the proceeds to repurchase $1.307 billion outstanding principal of our 5.75% Senior Notes due 2011. As of November 14, 2012, we had $4.420 billion remaining in our $10.0 billion stock repurchase program. The remaining share repurchases under the program are expected to be funded through a combination of cash generated by operations, borrowings under our credit facilities and external financing, as deemed appropriate. In May 2012, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.275 per share of Class A and Class B common stock from $0.25 per share, beginning with the dividend payable on July 2, 2012. Capital Resources Capital Structure and Debt At September 30, 2012, total debt was $8.149 billion, an increase of $784 million from $7.365 billion at September 30, 2011. The increase in debt reflects the impact of new issuances of senior notes and debentures, partially offset by repayments. Debt September 30, (in millions) 2012 2011 Senior notes and debentures $ 7,919 $ 6,536 Commercial paper - 423 Capital leases and other obligations 230 406 Total debt $ 8,149 $ 7,365 Senior Notes and Debentures During the year, we took advantage of favorable market conditions and issued a total of $2.15 billion of senior notes and debentures. In December 2011, we issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 2.500% Senior Notes due 2016 at a price equal to 99.366% of the principal amount and $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.875% Senior Notes due 2021 at a price equal to 98.361% of the principal amount. In February 2012, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 1.250% Senior Notes due 2015 at a price equal to 99.789% of the principal amount and $250 million aggregate principal amount of 4.500% Senior Debentures due 2042 at a price equal to 98.063% of the principal amount. In June 2012, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% Senior Notes due 2022 at a price equal to 98.553% of the principal amount and an additional $100 million aggregate principal amount of our 1.250% Senior Notes due 2015 at a price equal to 100.026% of the principal amount. We used the net proceeds from these offerings for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of shares under our stock repurchase program, and the redemption and repayment of debt. 59 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Our outstanding senior notes and debentures provide for certain covenant packages typical for an investment grade company. There is one acceleration trigger for certain of the senior notes and debentures in the event of a change in control under certain specified circumstances coupled with ratings downgrades due to the change in control. At September 30, 2012 and 2011, the total unamortized net discount related to the fixed rate senior notes and debentures was $49 million and $32 million, respectively. We anticipate that future debt maturities will be funded with cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operating activities and future access to capital markets, including our credit facilities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to access capital markets on terms and conditions that will be acceptable to us. Credit Facilities In December 2011, we entered into an amendment to our $2.0 billion three-year revolving credit agreement, dated as of October 8, 2010, which modified certain provisions of the original agreement to, among other things, (i) increase the amount of the credit facility from $2.0 billion to $2.1 billion, (ii) extend the maturity date of the credit facility from October 2013 to December 2015 and (iii) reduce the LIBOR-based borrowing rates under the credit facility to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.5% to 1.5% based on our current public debt rating. The facility has one principal financial covenant that requires the Company interest coverage, for the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters, to be at least 3.0x, which the Company met at September 30, 2012. In November 2011, we entered into two 364-day bank credit facilities for an aggregate amount of $600 million. The facilities are used for general corporate purposes. The facilities contain covenants that are substantially the same as those contained in our $2.1 billion revolving credit facility. Borrowing rates under the facilities are determined at the time of each borrowing and are generally based on LIBOR plus a margin. At September 30, 2012 and 2011, there were no amounts outstanding under our credit facilities. In November 2012, we further amended the revolving credit agreement to increase the amount of the facility from $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion and extended the maturity date from December 2015 to November 2017. At the same time, we also terminated all $600 million of the 364-day credit facilities. Commercial Paper At September 30, 2012, there was no commercial paper outstanding. At September 30, 2011, the outstanding commercial paper of $423 million had a weighted average interest rate of 0.41% and a weighted average maturity of less than 30 days. Current Portion of Debt Amounts classified in the current portion of debt consist of the portion of capital leases payable in the next twelve months. Film Financing Arrangements Historically we have entered into film financing arrangements that involve the sale of a partial copyright interest in a film to third-party investors. Since the investors typically have the risks and rewards of ownership proportionate to their ownership in the film, we generally record the amounts received for the sale of copyright interest as a reduction of the cost of the film and related cash flows are reflected in net cash flow from operating activities. We also have agreements with third parties, including other studios, to co-finance certain of our motion pictures. Stock Repurchase Program On November 9, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the funds available to purchase Class B common stock under the Company stock repurchase program to $10.0 billion from $4.0 billion. During 2012, 60 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) we repurchased 59.9 million shares for an aggregate price of $2.8 billion. From October 1, 2012 through November 14, 2012, we repurchased an additional 5.2 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $280 million. As of November 14, 2012, we had $4.420 billion remaining in our $10.0 billion stock repurchase program. During 2011, we repurchased 55.7 million shares under the program for an aggregate price of $2.5 billion. There were no repurchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2010. Commitments and Contingencies Our commitments primarily consist of programming and talent commitments, operating and capital lease arrangements, and purchase obligations for goods and services. These arrangements result from our normal course of business and represent obligations that may be payable over several years. Additionally, we are subject to a redeemable put option, payable in a foreign currency, with respect to an international subsidiary, which is classified as Redeemable noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The put option expires in January 2016. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the redeemable noncontrolling interest. In the course of our business, the Company both provides and receives the benefit of indemnities that are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, we may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification agreement. Guarantees Leases We have certain indemnification obligations with respect to leases associated with the previously discontinued operations of Famous Players Inc. ( Famous Players ) and Blockbuster Inc. ( Blockbuster ). In addition, we have certain indemnities provided by the acquirer of Famous Players. At September 30, 2012, these lease commitments, substantially all of which relate to Famous Players, amounted to approximately $575 million. The amount of lease commitments varies over time depending on expiration or termination of individual underlying leases, or of the related indemnification obligation, and foreign exchange rates, among other things. We may also have exposure for certain other expenses related to the leases, such as property taxes and common area maintenance. We have recorded a liability of $199 million with respect to such obligations. Based on our consideration of financial information available to us, the lessees historical performance in meeting their lease obligations and the underlying economic factors impacting the lessees business models, we believe our accrual is sufficient to meet any future obligations. Other We have indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. The outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds at September 30, 2012 were $52 million and are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company and its venture partner each have a commitment to guarantee up to approximately $60 million of bank debt of Viacom 18. There were no borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2012 subject to this guarantee. We also have a remaining equity funding commitment of $15 million as of September 30, 2012. Legal Matters Litigation is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on our understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, we believe that the legal matters described below and other litigation to which we are a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our results of continuing operations, financial position or operating cash flows. 61 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) In March 2007, we filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Google Inc. ( Google ) and its wholly-owned subsidiary YouTube, alleging that Google and YouTube violated and continue to violate the Company copyrights. We are seeking both damages and injunctive relief. In March 2010, we and Google filed motions for summary judgment, and in June 2010, Google motion was granted. In April 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the District Court decision and remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings. Our 2006 acquisition agreement with Harmonix, a developer of music-based games, including the Rock Band franchise, provided that to the extent financial results exceeded specific contractual targets against a defined gross profit metric for the calendar years 2007 and 2008, former Harmonix shareholders would be eligible for incremental earn-out payments. In 2008, we paid $150 million, subject to adjustment, under this earn-out agreement. A private dispute resolution process was commenced as provided in the acquisition agreement to determine the final amount of the earn-out. On December 19, 2011, the resolution accountants in the private dispute resolution process issued their determination, finding that we owe an additional $383 million under the agreement, as compared to the additional $700 million sought by the former shareholders. We recorded a reserve of $383 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2011, which is reflected in Other liabilities-current on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and paid $84 million of this amount in the quarter ended June 30, 2012, plus accrued interest of $3 million. Kraft Group LLC, an entity related to Robert Kraft, a member of our Board of Directors, was a beneficial holder of less than 1.8% of the Harmonix shares prior to, and at the time of, our 2006 acquisition of Harmonix. Kraft Group LLC acquired the shares several years prior to Mr. Kraft becoming a member of our Board of Directors. On December, 27, 2011, we commenced a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery to vacate the determination of the resolution accountants on the grounds that they improperly failed to consider arguments and evidence put before them. In responsive pleadings and motions, the shareholder representative has sought confirmation of the determination of the resolution accountants and has opposed our efforts to vacate that determination. Our motion to vacate the resolution accountants decision based on the resolution accountants determination not to consider the impact of inventory write-downs on the 2008 earn-out calculation was denied by the Delaware Chancery Court on August 9, 2012. The Court held that (i) the resolution accountants had the authority to, and did, determine what issues were and were not properly before them; (ii) there was no reason to vacate the determination under the applicable standards of the Federal Arbitration Act; and (iii) in any event, the resolution accountants made the correct decision in refusing to consider the impact of inventory write-downs on the 2008 earn-out calculation. On September 17, 2012, we appealed the decision of the Chancery Court to the Delaware Supreme Court. On September 21, 2012, the Chancery Court entered an order staying payment of the judgment pending the appeal. Approximately $13 million is being held in escrow to secure the former shareholders indemnification obligations to us under the acquisition agreement. We believe we are entitled to all the funds being held in escrow and that we are also entitled to reduce the earn-out payment to the extent the amount the Company is entitled to recover under the former shareholders indemnification obligations exceeds the amount held in escrow. In December 2010, the shareholder representative filed a lawsuit in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware seeking the release of the funds being held in escrow. The lawsuit also asserted certain other claims. In May 2011, we filed a motion to dismiss the portion of the shareholder representative amended complaint that related to the other claims as meritless, and in November 2011, the court dismissed those claims. We continue to vigorously oppose the remaining claims in the lawsuit regarding the funds held in escrow and to seek full indemnification under the acquisition agreement. In 2006, Paramount and DreamWorks L.L.C. (now known as DW Studios L.L.C.) entered into a Motion Picture Investment Agreement with Melrose Investors 2 LLC ( Melrose 2 ) in connection with the financing of a slate of 62 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) up to thirty motion pictures distributed by Paramount. In late November 2011, the Melrose 2 investors filed a lawsuit in state court in Los Angeles against Paramount and DW Studios alleging breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, and unfair competition in relation to Paramount accounting to the investors. The investors filed an amended complaint in October 2012 claiming that revenues received by Viacom and National Amusements Inc. ( NAI ) as part of certain transactions were misapplied to their detriment. Paramount and DW Studios deny these allegations, believe that their accounting has been substantially correct, and intend to vigorously defend against each of the claims. The case remains pending. On August 17, 2012, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware by a Viacom Class B stockholder against us and each member of our Board of Directors. The complaint purports to be a derivative action alleging that, between 2008 and 2011, the Company violated the terms of its 2007 Senior Executive Short-Term Incentive Plan (the 2007 Plan ) by allegedly using improper subjective criteria to determine the bonuses paid to Messrs. Redstone, Dauman and Dooley in each of those years, which according to the complaint, constituted a breach of fiduciary duty by the members of the Board of Directors. The plaintiff alleges that during this period Messrs. Redstone, Dauman and Dooley were overpaid and the plaintiff seeks to recover the amount of the overpayment, plus interest, for the Company. The plaintiff also alleges that adoption of the Company 2012 Senior Executive Short-Term Incentive Plan (the 2012 Plan ) required the vote of all Viacom stockholders and not simply holders of our voting Class A common stock. Accordingly, the plaintiff seeks to enjoin any overpayment under the 2012 Plan until a new vote on that plan, which includes Class B stockholders, occurs. We believe the claim is without merit and filed a motion to dismiss on October 22, 2012. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations include amounts reflected on our balance sheet, as well as off-balance sheet arrangements. At September 30, 2012, our significant contractual obligations, including payments due for the next five fiscal years and thereafter, were as follows: Contractual Obligations (in millions) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years After 5 years Off-balance Sheet Arrangements Programming and talent commitments (1) $ 1,426 $ 532 $ 566 $ 246 $ 82 Operating leases (2) 1,794 183 317 255 1,039 Purchase obligations (3) 786 370 342 74 - On-Balance Sheet Arrangements Capital lease obligations (4) 198 26 52 51 69 Debt 8,038 70 1,450 1,818 4,700 Interest payments 6,110 394 1,149 1,348 3,219 Other long-term obligations (5) $ 2,739 $ 1,565 $ 871 $ 287 $ 16 (1) Programming and talent commitments include $1.097 billion relating to media networks programming and $329 million for talent contracts. (2) Includes long-term non-cancelable operating lease commitments for office space, equipment, transponders, studio facilities and vehicles. (3) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders. (4) Includes capital leases for satellite transponders. (5) Other long-term obligations principally consist of participations, residuals and programming obligations for content that is available for airing. Note: Not included in the amounts above are payments which may result from our defined benefit pension plans of $563 million, unrecognized tax benefits of $273 million, including interest and penalties, $15 million of funding commitments to joint ventures, interest payments to be made under our credit facility, $179 million of redeemable noncontrolling interest and lease guarantees of approximately $575 million. The amount and timing of payments with respect to these items are subject to a number of uncertainties such that we are unable to make sufficiently reliable estimations of future payments. We do expect to make contributions of approximately $20 million in fiscal 2013 to our funded pension plan. 63 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We use or expect to use derivative financial instruments to modify exposure to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In accordance with our policy, we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure, and we do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Foreign Exchange Risk We conduct business in various countries outside the United States, resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. Dollar. In order to economically hedge anticipated cash flows and foreign currency balances in such currencies as the British Pound, the Australian Dollar, the Euro, the Japanese Yen, and the Canadian Dollar, foreign currency forward contracts are used. From time to time, we enter into forward contracts to hedge future production costs or programming obligations. The change in fair value of non-designated contracts is included in current period earnings as part of Other items, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. We manage the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally. The notional value of all foreign exchange contracts was $176 million and $89 million at September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In 2012, $120 million related to our foreign currency balances and $56 million related to future production costs and programming obligations. In 2011, $12 million related to our foreign currency balances and $77 million related to future production costs and programming obligations. Interest Rate Risk A portion of our interest expense is exposed to movements in short-term rates. Also, interest expense for future long-term debt issues is exposed to movements in long-term rates. Interest rate hedges may be used to modify both of these exposures at the discretion of the Company. There were no interest rates hedges outstanding at September 30, 2012. At September 30, 2011, the notional value of all interest rate hedges was $500 million. Since the majority of our debt is fixed rate, we do not expect that a 1% increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Viacom has issued senior notes and debentures that, at September 30, 2012, had an outstanding balance of $7.9 billion and an estimated fair value of $9.2 billion. A 1% increase or decrease in the level of interest rates, respectively, would decrease or increase the fair value of the senior notes and debentures by approximately $638 million and $726 million. Credit Risk We continually monitor our positions with, and credit quality of, our customers and the financial institutions which are counterparties to our financial instrument agreements. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonpayment by our customers and nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial instrument agreements. However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial instrument agreements and we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover any anticipated nonpayment by our customers. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, which are based on historical experience 64 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions. An appreciation of our critical accounting policies, those that are considered by management to require significant judgment and use of estimates and that could have a significant impact on our financial statements, is necessary to understand our financial results. Unless otherwise noted, we applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented, and have discussed such policies with our Audit Committee. Film Accounting Revenue Recognition Revenue we earn in connection with the exhibition of feature films by our Filmed Entertainment segment is recognized in accordance with the accounting guidance for producers or distributors of films. Our Filmed Entertainment segment principally earns revenue from the exhibition of feature film content based upon theatrical exhibition, home entertainment and various television markets (e.g., network, pay, syndication, basic cable). We recognize revenue from theatrical distribution of motion pictures upon exhibition. We recognize revenue from home entertainment product sales, net of anticipated returns, including rebates and other incentives, upon the later of delivery or the date that these products are made widely available for sale by retailers. We recognize revenue from the licensing of feature films and original programming for exhibition in television markets upon availability for airing by the licensee. We recognize revenue for video-on-demand and similar pay-per-view arrangements as the feature films are exhibited based on end-customer purchases as reported by the distributor. Original Production and Film Costs We capitalize original production, including original programming and feature film costs, on a title-specific basis, as Inventory, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We use an individual-forecast-computation method to amortize the costs over the applicable title life cycle based upon the ratio of current period to estimated remaining total gross revenues ( ultimate revenues ) for each title. We expense advertising costs as they are incurred and expense manufacturing costs, such as DVD manufacturing costs, on a unit-specific basis when we recognize the related revenue. Our estimated liabilities for residuals and participations are accrued using the individual-film-forecast-computation method based on ultimate revenues. Our estimate of ultimate revenues for feature films includes revenues from all sources that are estimated to be earned within ten years from the date of a film initial theatrical release. For acquired film libraries, our estimate of ultimate revenues is for a period within 20 years from the date of acquisition. Prior to the release of a feature film and throughout its life, we estimate the ultimate revenues based on the historical performance of similar content, as well as incorporating factors of the content itself, including, but not limited to, the expected number of theaters and markets in which the original content will be released, the genre of the original content and the past box office performance of the lead actors and actresses. We believe the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues for films intended for theatrical release is domestic theatrical exhibition, as subsequent markets have historically exhibited a high correlation to domestic theatrical performance. Upon a film release and determination of domestic theatrical performance, our estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimates for films subsequent to their initial release is the extent of home entertainment sales achieved. In addition to theatrical performance, home entertainment sales vary based on a variety of factors including demand for our titles, the volume and quality of competing home entertainment products, marketing and promotional strategies, as well as economic conditions. 65 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) For original programming, capitalized program costs are amortized over the projected useful life of the programming, depending on genre and historical experience, beginning with the month of initial exhibition. The most sensitive factor affecting ultimate revenues is the program rating. Program ratings, which are an indication of audience acceptance, directly impact the level of advertising revenues we will be able to generate during the airing of the programming. Poor ratings may result in abandonment of a program, which would require the immediate write-off of any unamortized production costs. The estimate of ultimate revenues impacts the timing of original production cost amortization. Upon a film initial release we update our estimate of ultimate revenues based on expected future and actual results. We also review and revise estimates of ultimate revenue and participation costs as of each reporting date to reflect the most current available information. If estimates for a film are revised, the difference between amortization expense determined using the new estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year are charged or credited to our Consolidated Statement of Earnings in the quarter in which the estimates are revised. If we believe that the release of our content will not be or has not been favorably received, then we would assess whether the fair value of such content is less than the unamortized portion of its capitalized costs and, if need be, recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the fair value. We utilize the individual-film-forecast-computation method (adjusted to incorporate revenue and related costs, including future exploitation costs, if any, expected to occur in periods beyond 10 years from the date of the film initial release) to develop the cash flows which are subsequently discounted to compute the fair value of a film at each reporting period. The discount rate utilized takes into account the time value of money as well as a risk premium. The risk premium reflects the uncertainties of realizing the expected cash flows of a film title which is impacted by a film title position within its product life cycle. Acquired Programming Rights We report an asset and liability for the rights acquired and obligations incurred at the commencement of the licensing period when the cost of the programming is known or reasonably determinable, the program material has been accepted and the programming is available for airing. We record the transaction using the gross liability provision. The asset is amortized to operating expenses over the license period or projected useful life of the programming, if shorter, commencing upon availability. Determining factors used in estimating the useful life of programming includes the expected number of future airings, which may differ from the contracted number of airings, the length of the license period and expected future revenues to be generated from the programming. The cost basis of acquired programming is the capitalized cost of each program and is equal to the cost of the programming pursuant to the license agreement less the cumulative amortization recorded for the program. Capitalized costs of rights to program materials are reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value. We evaluate net realizable value of acquired rights programming quarterly on a daypart basis. A daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or an aggregation of programs of a similar type. We aggregate similar programming based on the specific demographic targeted by each respective program service. Net realizable value is determined by estimating advertising revenues to be derived from the future airing of the programming within the daypart as well as an allocation of affiliate fee revenue to programming. An impairment charge may be necessary if our estimates of future cash flows of similar programming are insufficient or if programming is abandoned. Revenue Recognition Gross versus Net Revenue Recognition We earn and recognize revenues where we act as distributor on behalf of third parties. In such cases, determining whether revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis is based on management assessment of whether we act as the principal or agent in the transaction. To the extent we act as the principal in a transaction, we report 66 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) revenues on a gross basis. Determining whether we act as principal or agent in a transaction involves judgment and is based on an evaluation of whether we have the substantial risks and rewards of ownership under the terms of an arrangement. Our most significant distribution arrangements are in connection with certain exclusive distribution rights to and home video fulfillment services for the animated feature films produced by DreamWorks Animation, the distribution agreement with CBS Corporation ( CBS ) and the continuing distribution relationship with Marvel, now a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company, for the films we theatrically distributed. Under the terms of these agreements, we generally are responsible for all out-of-pocket costs, primarily comprised of distribution and marketing costs. For the provision of distribution services, we generally retain a fee based upon a percentage of gross receipts and recover expended distribution and marketing costs on a title-by-title basis prior to any participation payments to the contracting parties of the films, except as pertains to certain contractually agreed upon advance payments, if applicable. As primary obligor, revenue and related distribution and marketing costs for these arrangements are presented on a gross basis. Sales Returns, Allowances and Uncollectible Accounts In accordance with the accounting guidance related to revenue recognition when a right of return exists, revenue allowances are recorded to adjust amounts originally invoiced to the estimated net realizable value of a particular product. Upon the sale of home entertainment products to wholesalers and retailers, we record a reduction of revenue for the impact of estimated future returns, rebates and other incentives ( estimated returns ). In determining estimated returns, we consider numerous sources of qualitative and quantitative evidence including forecasted sales data, customers rights of return, units shipped and units remaining at retail, historical return rates for similar product, current economic trends, competitive environment, promotions and sales strategies. Forecasted sales data is determined by comparing a particular release to product that has similar characteristics where applicable, such as franchise, genre, box office levels and release patterns, using regression analysis, decay rates and other tools. Based on the results of this analysis and the sales strategies to be used for the release, we reserve an appropriate percentage of each dollar of product revenue on a title taking into consideration the qualitative and quantitative factors described above. Forecasted sales data is reviewed and updated throughout each quarter, and, with respect to home entertainment product, is consistent with the projections of ultimate revenues used in applying the individual-forecast-computation method to amortize our film costs. Accordingly, a change in forecasted sales affects both the revenue allowance and related expenses. Actual sell-through data is reviewed as it becomes available against the forecasted sales data to ensure that estimates continue to be consistent with actual sales performance. Our estimate of future returns affects reported revenue and operating income. If we underestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period, then we may record less revenue and related expenses in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amounts. If we overestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period, then we may record additional revenue and related expenses in later periods when returns are less than estimated. An incremental change of 1% in our estimated sales returns rate (i.e., provisions for returns divided by gross sales of related product) for home entertainment products would have a $23 million impact on our total revenue for the year ended September 30, 2012. This revenue impact would be partially offset by a corresponding impact on related expenses depending on the margin associated with a specific film and other factors. In computing our sales returns rate, sales include home entertainment revenues of our Filmed Entertainment and Media Networks segments. Home entertainment revenues of our Media Networks segment are included within Media Networks ancillary revenues. We also continually evaluate accounts receivable and establish judgments as to their ultimate collectability. Judgments and estimates involved include an analysis of specific risks on a customer-by-customer basis for 67 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) larger accounts and an analysis of actual historical write-off experience in conjunction with the length of time the receivables are past due. Using this information, management reserves an amount that is estimated to be uncollectible. An incremental change of 1% in our allowance for uncollectible accounts relative to our trade accounts receivables would have a $22 million impact on our operating results for the year ended September 30, 2012. Provision for Income Taxes As a global entertainment content company, we are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions where we have operations. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual provision for income taxes and evaluating our income tax positions. Our tax rates are affected by many factors, including our global mix of earnings, legislation, acquisitions and dispositions, as well as the tax characteristics of our income. In determining our income tax provisions on a jurisdiction basis, we are required to make judgments on the need to record deferred tax assets and liabilities, including the realizability of deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is established if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In evaluating uncertain tax positions, we make determinations of the application of complex tax rules, regulations and practices. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions quarterly based on many factors including, but not limited to, new facts, changes in tax law and information received from regulators. A change in any one of these factors could change our evaluation of an existing uncertain tax position, resulting in the recognition of an additional charge or benefit to our income tax provision in the period. As such, going forward, our effective tax rate may fluctuate. Additionally, our income tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our income tax provisions. The resolution of audit issues and income tax positions taken may take extended periods of time due to the length of examinations by tax authorities and the possible extension of statutes of limitations. A 1% change in our effective rate, excluding discrete items, would result in additional income tax expense of approximately $35 million for the year ended September 30, 2012. We permanently reinvest the earnings of substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries outside the United States. We do not provide for U.S. taxes on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries for which the earnings are permanently reinvested. Fair Value Measurements The performance of fair value measurements is an integral part of the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Selection of the appropriate valuation technique, as well as determination of assumptions, risks and estimates used by market participants in pricing the asset or liability requires significant judgment. Although we believe that the inputs used in our valuation techniques are reasonable, a change in one or more of the inputs could result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of certain assets and certain liabilities. Either instance would have an impact on both our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Provided below are those instances where the determination of fair value could have the most significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations: Goodwill . Goodwill at September 30, 2012 relates to our reporting units Music and Logo ($2.0 billion), Nickelodeon ($2.9 billion), Entertainment ($1.8 billion), BET Networks ($2.7 billion) and Paramount ($1.6 billion). The Company has elected to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step annual goodwill impairment test in 2012. Based on our qualitative assessments, including 68 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) but not limited to, the results of our most recent quantitative impairment test, consideration of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, cash flows, changes in key Company personnel and our share price, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is greater than their carrying value. Under the accounting rules in effect in 2010, we were required to perform the annual quantitative impairment test. The first step of a quantitative goodwill impairment test is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. The second step, if necessary, compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. The estimates of fair value of a reporting unit were determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions, including assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. Given the inherent uncertainty in determining these assumptions, actual results may differ from those used in our valuations. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates were based on the budget and long-term business plans of each operating segment. Such assumptions took into account numerous factors including historical experience, anticipated economic conditions, advertising sales and ratings trends, terms of affiliate license arrangements and anticipated terms of renewals, projected costs for production and programming, number and expected financial performance of films expected to be produced and distributed each year and changes in the reporting unit cost structures. Discount rate assumptions for each reporting unit took into account our assessment of the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and our weighted-average cost of capital. We also reviewed marketplace data to assess the reasonableness of our computation of Viacom overall weighted average cost of capital and, when available, the discount rates utilized for each of our reporting units. In connection with our 2010 goodwill impairment test, we recorded a $230 million goodwill impairment charge related to Harmonix and reflected the change in Discontinued operations , net of tax in our Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The estimated fair value of Harmonix was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions reflected in the analysis include the estimated future cash flows of the business and discount rate. A one percentage point change in the perpetual growth rate or discount rate would not have resulted in a significant change in the goodwill impairment charge. Finite-Lived Intangible Assets. In determining whether finite-lived intangible assets (e.g., customer lists, film libraries) are impaired, the accounting rules do not provide for an annual impairment test. Instead, they require that a triggering event occur before testing an asset for impairment. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. If the intent is to hold the asset for continued use, first a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows against the carrying value of the asset is performed. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, the asset would be written down to its fair value. If the intent is to hold the asset for sale, to the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred, the determination of the cash flows for the assets involved and the discount rate to be applied in determining fair value. 69 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) OTHER MATTERS Related Parties NAI, directly and through a wholly-owned subsidiary, is the controlling stockholder of both Viacom and CBS.

Shari Redstone, who is Sumner Redstone daughter, is the President and a director of NAI, and serves as non-executive Vice Chair of the Board of Directors of both Viacom and CBS. George Abrams, one of our directors, serves on the boards of both NAI and Viacom, and Frederic Salerno, another of our directors, serves on the boards of both Viacom and CBS. Philippe Dauman, our President and Chief Executive Officer, also serves on the boards of both NAI and Viacom. Transactions between Viacom and related parties are overseen by our Governance and Nominating Committee. Viacom and NAI Related Party Transactions NAI licenses films in the ordinary course of business for its motion picture theaters from all major studios, including Paramount. Paramount earned revenues from NAI in connection with these licenses in the aggregate amounts of $19 million in 2012, $44 million in 2011 and $21 million in 2010. Viacom and CBS Corporation Related Party Transactions In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in transactions with CBS and its various businesses that result in the recognition of revenues and expenses by Viacom. Transactions with CBS are settled in cash. Paramount earns revenues and recognizes expenses associated with the distribution of certain television products into the home entertainment market on behalf of CBS. Under the terms of the agreement, Paramount is entitled to retain a fee based on a percentage of gross receipts and is generally responsible for all out-of-pocket costs, which are recoupable prior to any participation payments to CBS. Paramount also earns revenues from CBS through leasing of studio space and licensing of certain film products. Additionally, the Media Networks segment recognizes advertising revenues from CBS. The Media Networks segment purchases television programming from CBS. The cost of such purchases is initially recorded as acquired program rights inventory and amortized over the estimated period that revenues will be generated. Both of our segments recognize advertising expenses related to the placement of advertisements with CBS. 70 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) The following table summarizes the transactions with CBS as included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. CBS Related Party Transactions Year Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2010 (in millions) 2012 2011 Consolidated Statements of Earnings Revenues $ 285 $ 341 $ 244 Operating expenses $ 347 $ 434 $ 318 September 30, 2012 2011 Consolidated Balance Sheets Accounts receivable $ 7 $ 6 Other assets 1 1 Total due from CBS $ 8 $ 7 Accounts payable $ 1 $ 1 Participants share and residuals, current 143 162 Program rights obligations, current 110 73 Program rights obligations, noncurrent 169 243 Other liabilities 24 37 Total due to CBS $ 447 $ 516 Agreements with CBS Corporation In connection with the separation, we and CBS entered into a Separation Agreement, a Transition Services Agreement and a Tax Matters Agreement, as well as certain other agreements to govern the terms of the separation and certain of the ongoing relationships between CBS and us after the separation. These related party arrangements are more fully described below. Indemnification Obligations. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, each company indemnified the other company and the other company officers, directors and employees for any losses arising out of its failure to perform or discharge any of the liabilities it assumed pursuant to the Separation Agreement, including with respect to certain legal matters, its businesses as conducted as of the date of the separation and its breaches of shared contracts. Limitations on Certain Acquisitions. Subject to limited exceptions, the Separation Agreement provides that none of Viacom, any subsidiary of Viacom or any person that is controlled by Viacom after the separation will own or acquire an interest in a radio or television broadcast station, television broadcast network or daily newspaper, if such ownership or acquisition would (i) cause CBS, any subsidiary of CBS or any entity controlled by CBS after the date of the separation to be in violation of U.S. federal laws limiting the ownership or control of radio broadcast stations, television broadcast stations and/or television broadcast networks or (ii) limit in any manner at any time under such laws CBS ability to acquire additional interests in a radio or television broadcast station and/or television broadcast network. These restrictions will terminate when none of Mr. Redstone, NAI, NAIRI Inc. or any of their successors, assigns or transferees are deemed to have interests in both CBS and Viacom that are attributable under applicable U.S. federal laws. The Separation Agreement also provides that neither Viacom, any subsidiary of Viacom or any person controlled by Viacom nor CBS, any subsidiary of CBS or any person controlled by CBS will acquire any asset, enter into 71 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) any agreement or accept or agree to any condition that purports to bind, or subjects to a legal order, the other company, its subsidiaries or any person it controls without such other party written consent. Tax Matters The Tax Matters Agreement sets forth Viacom responsibilities with respect to, among other things, liabilities for federal, state, local and foreign income taxes for periods before and including the merger, the preparation and filing of income tax returns for such periods, disputes with taxing authorities regarding income taxes for such periods and indemnification for income taxes that would become due if the merger were taxable. Viacom is generally responsible for federal, state and local, and foreign income taxes for periods before the merger relating to Viacom respective businesses. Income tax liabilities relating to discontinued operations and previously disposed businesses have been allocated in accordance with the principles applicable under the Separation Agreement for liabilities relating to those operations and businesses. Other income tax liabilities, including items that do not specifically relate to either business, will be shared equally. Viacom and CBS will generally be jointly responsible for managing any dispute relating to income taxes for which both parties may be responsible. Other Related Party Transactions In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in related party transactions with equity investees, principally related to investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities as more fully described in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. These related party transactions principally relate to the provision of advertising services, licensing of film and programming content, distribution of films and provision of certain administrative support services, for which the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements is as follows: Other Related Party Transactions Year Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2010 (in millions) 2012 2011 Consolidated Statements of Earnings Revenues $ 309 $ 239 $ 168 Operating expenses $ 120 $ 83 $ 53 Selling, general and administrative $ (16 ) $ (16 ) $ (24 ) September 30, 2012 2011 Consolidated Balance Sheets Accounts receivable $ 114 $ 88 Other assets 3 2 Total due from other related parties $ 117 $ 90 Accounts payable $ 8 $ 32 Other liabilities 17 10 Total due to other related parties $ 25 $ 42 All other related party transactions are not material in the periods presented. 72 Table of Contents
