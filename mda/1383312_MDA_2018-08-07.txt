BASIS OF PRESENTATION The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) in the United States of America ( U.S. ). These financial statements present the consolidated position of the Company and include the entities in which the Company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest as well as various entities in which the Company has investments recorded under either the cost or equity methods of accounting. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Amounts presented may not sum due to rounding. In presenting the Consolidated Financial Statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures. Management continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. The estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment, available information, and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. However, actual amounts and results could differ from those estimates made by management. In management opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported. The results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU No. 2016-09 ). ASU No. 2016-09 identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including presenting the excess tax benefits or deficits from the exercise or vesting of share-based payments in the income statement, classifying the excess tax benefits or deficits as an operating activity in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows rather than as a financing activity, a revision to the criteria for classifying an award as equity or liability and an option to recognize gross stock-based compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur. In addition, ASU No. 2016-09 eliminates the excess tax benefits from the assumed proceeds calculation under the treasury stock method for purposes of calculating diluted shares. As a result of this adoption, we recorded excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards of $40.9 million during the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 in the income tax provision on a prospective basis, whereas such benefits would previously have been recognized in equity. We also excluded the excess tax benefits from the assumed proceeds available to repurchase shares in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the twelve months ended June 30, 2018. We have not adjusted prior periods presented for the change in accounting for excess tax benefits in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also elected to apply the change in presentation of excess tax benefits in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows prospectively, and as a result, excess tax benefits are classified as operating activities when realized through reductions to subsequent tax payments. This adoption resulted in an increase to net cash provided by operating activities and a corresponding decrease to net cash provided by financing activities of $40.9 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2018. We have not adjusted prior periods presented for the change in classification of excess tax benefits on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. We also elected to continue our current practice of estimating expected forfeitures as permitted by ASU No. 2016-09. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2015-17 Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ( ASU No. 2015-07 ) on a prospective basis to all deferred tax liabilities and assets. The amendments in ASU No. 2015-17 require entities that present a classified balance sheet to classify all deferred tax liabilities and assets as a noncurrent amount. Our fiscal year 2017 Consolidated Balance Sheet has not been retrospectively adjusted for the adoption of ASU No. 2015-17. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. The estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment, available information, and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. However, actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below. Goodwill . We review the carrying value of all our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values. We are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible 31 impairment. When determining fair value of a reporting unit, we utilize the income approach which considers future cash flows using various assumptions, including projections of revenues based on assumed long-term growth rates, estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular reporting unit weighted-average cost of capital. The principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows, the weighted-average cost of capital and the terminal value growth rate assumptions. The weighted-average cost of capital takes into account the relative weight of each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and long-term debt). Our estimates of long-term growth and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of external sources, and are developed as part of our routine, long-range planning process. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. We had $1,254.9 million of goodwill as of June 30, 2018 . Given the significance of our goodwill, an adverse change to the fair value of one of our reporting units could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our earnings. The Company performs a sensitivity analysis under Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test assuming hypothetical reductions in the fair values of our reporting units. A 10% change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows, discount rates, or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would not result in an impairment of our goodwill. Income Taxes . The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). The Company is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the U.S. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $15.2 million as of June 30, 2018 of which $2.2 million are subject to expiration in the 2019 through 2027 period. The remaining $13.0 million of carryforwards has an indefinite utilization period. In addition, the Company has estimated U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $22.5 million which can be utilized through 2030 and a $1.1 million capital loss carryforward which will expire 2023. Since the U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards result from tax losses recognized prior to December 31, 2017, they are not subject to the new provision in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ) which provides for an indefinite carryforward period for net operating losses. Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the Company will not be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to net operating and capital loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings. The Company has recorded valuation allowances of $3.8 million and $9.3 million at June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be recognized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income, carryforward periods, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies. Projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned. The assumptions used to project future taxable income requires significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted. The estimated incremental income tax expense related to the Tax Act reflects assumptions based upon our interpretation of the Tax Act. The calculation of the estimated incremental income tax expense is based upon various estimates and assumptions and may be impacted by additional considerations, including, but not limited to, the final computation of 2017 and 2018 earnings and profits and tax pools of non-U.S. subsidiaries as of the relevant measurement dates. The ultimate impact of the Tax Act may differ from our estimates due to changes in our assumptions, additional regulatory clarification and guidance that may be issued, as well as the amount of our earnings before income taxes. Share-based Payments . Accounting for stock-based compensation requires the measurement of stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. We determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option-pricing model. The binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of our stock price and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk-free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. Determining these assumptions are subjective and complex, and therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options. A hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility 32 assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2018 stock option grants would result in approximately a $4.2 million change in total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2018 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. A hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2018 stock option grants would result in approximately a $1.7 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2018 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. A hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2018 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.2 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2018 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. A hypothetical one-half percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2018 stock option grants would result in approximately a $1.9 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2018 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussions of Analysis of Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Analysis of Reportable Segments refer to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 , and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 . The Analysis of Consolidated Statements of Earnings should be read in conjunction with the Analysis of Reportable Segments, which provides more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The following references are utilized in the discussions of Analysis of Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Analysis of Reportable Segments: Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property and Acquisition and Integration Costs represent certain non-cash amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets and purchased intellectual property assets, as well as certain transaction and integration costs associated with the Company acquisition activities, respectively. MAL investment gain represents a non-cash, nontaxable gain on investment from the Company acquisition of MAL in March 2017. Gain on Sale of Securities represents a non-operating gain on the sale of securities associated with our retirement plan obligations. Tax Act items represent a U.S. federal transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes with respect to the earnings deemed repatriated for U.S. tax purposes, and certain benefits related to the remeasurement of the Company net U.S. federal and state deferred tax liabilities attributable to the recording of the impact from the Tax Act, which was enacted into law on December 22, 2017. Net New Business refers to recurring revenue from closed sales less recurring revenue from client losses. The following definitions describe the Company Revenues: Fee revenues in the Investor Communication Solutions segment are derived from both recurring and event-driven activity. In addition, the level of recurring and event-driven activity we process directly impacts distribution revenues. While event-driven activity is highly repeatable, it may not recur on an annual basis. The types of services we provide that comprise event-driven activity are: Mutual Fund Proxy: The proxy and related services we provide to mutual funds when certain events occur requiring a shareholder vote including changes in directors, sub-advisors, fee structures, investment restrictions, and mergers of funds. Mutual Fund Communications: Mutual fund communications services consist primarily of the distribution on behalf of mutual funds of supplemental information required to be provided to the annual mutual fund prospectus as a result of certain triggering events such as a change in portfolio managers. In addition, mutual fund communications consist of notices and marketing materials such as newsletters. Proxy Contests and Specials, Corporate Actions, and Other: The proxy services we provide in connection with shareholder meetings driven by special events such as proxy contests, mergers and acquisitions, and tender/exchange offers. Event-driven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process. Event-driven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements, resulting in fluctuations 33 in the timing and levels of event-driven fee revenues. As such, the timing and level of event-driven activity and its potential impact on revenues and earnings are difficult to forecast. Generally, mutual fund proxy activity has been subject to a greater level of volatility than the other components of event-driven activity. During fiscal year 2018 , mutual fund proxy fee revenues were 28% higher than the prior fiscal year while during fiscal years 2017 and 2016 , mutual fund proxy revenues were 19% higher and 22% lower than the prior fiscal year, respectively. Although it is difficult to forecast the levels of event-driven activity, we expect that the portion of fee revenues derived from mutual fund proxy activity may continue to experience volatility in the future. Distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials, interim communications, transaction reporting, customer communications and fulfillment services as well as Matrix administrative services. Distribution cost of revenues consists primarily of postage-related expenses incurred in connection with our Investor Communication Solutions segment, as well as Matrix administrative services expenses. These costs are reflected in Cost of revenues. Closed sales represent an estimate of the expected annual recurring fee revenue for new client contracts that were signed by Broadridge in the current reporting period. Closed sales does not include event-driven or distribution activity. We consider contract terms, expected client volumes or activity, knowledge of the marketplace and experience with our clients, among other factors, when determining the estimate. Management uses Closed sales to measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs, as an indicator of expected future revenues and as a performance metric in determining incentive compensation. Closed sales is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue or other income statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Closed sales is a useful metric for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates our ongoing operational performance. The inherent variability of transaction volumes and activity levels can result in some variability of amounts reported as actual achieved Closed sales. For fiscal years prior to fiscal year 2017, we tracked actual revenues achieved during the first year that the client contract was fully implemented and compared this to the previously reported Closed sales amount, this process was used to calibrate metrics used in incentive compensation and will be used to estimate future allowance adjustments. Larger Closed sales can take up to 12 to 24 months or longer to convert to revenues, particularly for the services provided by our Global Technology and Operations segment. Beginning in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, we reported Closed sales net of a 3.5% allowance adjustment, in lieu of our previous practice of adjusting for actual performance in subsequent periods. For fiscal year 2018, we are reporting Closed sales net of a 4.0% allowance adjustment. Consequently, our reported Closed sales amounts are not adjusted for actual revenues achieved because these adjustments are estimated in the period the sale is reported. We assess the allowance amount at the end of each fiscal year to establish the appropriate allowance for the subsequent year using trailing five years actual data as the starting point, normalized for outlying factors, if any, to enhance the accuracy of the allowance. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 , 2017 and 2016, Closed sales, which includes contributions from NACC beginning in fiscal year 2017, were $214.9 million , $188.5 million and $150.9 million , respectively. The fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, are net of an allowance adjustment of $9.0 million and $6.8 million , respectively. 34 ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS Fiscal Year 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year 2017 The table below presents Consolidated Statements of Earnings data for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 , and the dollar and percentage changes between periods: Years Ended June 30, 2018 2017 Change ($) (%) (in millions, except for per share amounts) Revenues $ 4,329.9 $ 4,142.6 $ 187.3 5 Cost of revenues 3,169.6 3,109.6 60.0 2 Selling, general and administrative expenses 565.4 501.4 64.0 13 Total operating expenses 3,735.0 3,611.0 124.0 3 Operating income 594.9 531.6 63.3 12 Margin 13.7 % 12.8 % 0.9 pts Interest expense, net 38.6 42.7 (4.1 ) (10 ) Other non-operating (income) expenses, net (4.7 ) 0.8 (5.5 ) NM Earnings before income taxes 561.0 488.1 72.9 15 Provision for income taxes 133.1 161.4 (28.3 ) (18 ) Effective tax rate 23.7 % 33.1 % (9.4 ) pts Net earnings $ 427.9 $ 326.8 $ 101.2 31 Basic earnings per share $ 3.66 $ 2.77 $ 0.89 32 Diluted earnings per share $ 3.56 $ 2.70 $ 0.86 32 NM - Not Meaningful Revenues . Revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 were $4,329.9 million , an increase of $187.3 million , or 5% , compared to $4,142.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 . The $187.3 million increase was driven by higher recurring fee revenues of $159.2 million, or 6%, and higher event-driven fee revenues of $65.0 million, or 30%, partially offset by lower distribution revenues of $41.0 million, or 3%. The higher recurring fee revenues of $159.2 million reflected: gains from Net New Business (3pts), internal growth (2pts) and contributions from our recent acquisitions (1pt). The higher event-driven fee revenues were primarily from increased equity proxy contests and mutual fund proxy activity. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted revenues by $4.2 million. Total operating expenses . Total operating expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 were $3,735.0 million , an increase of $124.0 million , or 3% , compared to $3,611.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 . Cost of revenues increased $60.0 million , or 2% , and Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $64.0 million , or 13% . Cost of revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 were $3,169.6 million , an increase of $60.0 million , or 2% , compared to $3,109.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 . The increase primarily reflects higher proxy fulfillment expenses, higher operating costs from acquisitions, and higher depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by lower distribution cost of revenues driven by the decrease in distribution revenues. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates decreased cost of revenues by $5.7 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 were $565.4 million , an increase of $64.0 million , or 13% , compared to $501.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 . The increase was primarily due to higher spending on growth initiatives, higher selling and administrative expenses related in part to our record closed sales and higher operating costs from acquisitions. Operating income. Operating income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 was $594.9 million , an increase of $63.3 million , or 12% , compared to $531.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 . Operating income margins increased to 13.7% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 , compared to 12.8% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 , primarily due to the increase in recurring fee revenues and event-driven fee revenues. 35 Interest expense, net. Interest expense, net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 was $38.6 million , a decrease of $4.1 million , or 10% , compared to $42.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 . The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense of $2.3 million and a $1.8 million increase in interest income. Other non-operating (income) expenses, net. Other non-operating income, net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 was $4.7 million , an increase of $5.5 million , compared to $0.8 million of Other non-operating expenses, net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 . The increase was primarily due to lower expense of $6.8 million related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and lower losses related to minority equity investments of $2.5 million partially offset by a decrease of $3.8 million in investment gains. Earnings before income taxes . Earnings before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 were $561.0 million , an increase of $72.9 million , or 15% , compared to $488.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 .

The decrease in the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 is primarily due to the recognition of $40.9 million in excess tax benefits attributable to stock-based compensation as well as a reduced U.S. federal tax rate, partially offset by the $15.4 million of net tax charges relating to the enactment of the Tax Act. In the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018 , the Company federal corporate statutory income tax rate was subject to a full year blended tax rate of 28.1%. Notwithstanding the reduction in the federal corporate statutory income tax rate, the Tax Act required companies to pay a transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2017, which the Company has estimated to be $12.4 million. The Company also accrued $18.4 million of foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes with respect to the earnings deemed repatriated for U.S. tax purposes. Partially offsetting the $30.8 million of aggregate expense related to foreign earnings is a $15.3 million benefit related to the remeasurement of the Company net U.S. federal and state deferred tax liabilities. Beginning July 1, 2018, the Company will be subject to a U.S. federal corporate statutory income tax rate of 21.0%. Net earnings and Basic and Diluted earnings per share .

Excluding that investment gain, the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 was 33.7%. In addition to the tax benefit from the MAL investment gain, the effective tax rate also declined as a result of a $2.2 million increase in the current year accrual for the Section 199 domestic production activities deduction relating to prior tax years. The effective tax rate was also positively impacted by approximately 20 basis points due to a more favorable mix of geographical income. Net earnings and Basic and Diluted earnings per share .

ANALYSIS OF REPORTABLE SEGMENTS Broadridge has two reportable business segments: (1) Investor Communication Solutions and (2) Global Technology and Operations. The primary component of Other are certain gains, losses, corporate overhead expenses and non-operating expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, such as interest expense. Foreign currency exchange is a reconciling item between the actual foreign currency exchange rates and the constant foreign currency exchange rates used for internal management reporting. Certain corporate expenses, as well as certain centrally managed expenses, are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner. Because the Company compensates the management of its various businesses on, among other factors, segment profit, the Company may elect to record certain segment-related operating and non-operating expense items in Other rather than reflect such items in segment profit. In connection with an organizational change made in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, in order to further align and enhance our portfolio of services, certain discrete services that were previously reported in our Investor Communication Solutions reportable segment are now reported within the Global Technology and Operations reportable segment. As a result, our prior period segment results have been revised to reflect this change in reporting segments.

Explanation and Reconciliation of the Company Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company results in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP except where otherwise noted. In certain circumstances, results have been presented that are not generally accepted accounting principles measures ( Non-GAAP ). These Non-GAAP measures are Adjusted Operating income, Adjusted Operating income margin, Adjusted Net earnings, Adjusted earnings per share, and Free cash flow. These Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company reported results. The Company believes our Non-GAAP financial measures help investors understand how management plans, measures and evaluates the Company business performance. Management believes that Non-GAAP measures provide consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors understanding of the Company operating results and trends by providing an additional basis for comparison. Management uses these Non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. In addition, and as a consequence of the importance of these Non-GAAP financial measures in managing our business, the Company Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors incorporates Non-GAAP financial measures in the evaluation process for determining management compensation. Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Per Share These Non-GAAP measures reflect Operating income, Operating income margin, Net earnings, and Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. These adjusted measures exclude the impact of: (i) Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property, (ii) Acquisition and Integration Costs, (iii) Tax Act items, (iv) the Gain on Sale of Securities and (v) the MAL investment gain. Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property represents non-cash amortization expenses associated with the Company's acquisition activities. Acquisition and Integration Costs represent certain transaction and integration costs associated with the Company acquisition activities. Tax Act items represent the net impact of a U.S. federal transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes and certain benefits related to the remeasurement of the Company net U.S. federal and state deferred tax liabilities attributable to the Tax Act. The Gain on Sale of Securities represents a non-operating gain on the sale of securities associated with the Company retirement plan obligations. The MAL investment gain represents a non-cash, nontaxable gain on investment from the Company acquisition of MAL in March 2017. We exclude Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property, Acquisition and Integration Costs, Tax Act items, Gain on Sale of Securities and the MAL investment gain from our earnings measures because excluding such information provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business and these items do not reflect ordinary operations or earnings. Management believes these adjusted measures may be useful to an investor in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business. Free Cash Flows In addition to the Non-GAAP financial measures discussed above, we provide Free cash flow information because we consider Free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated that could be used for dividends, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions, other investments, as well as debt servicing. Free cash flow is a Non-GAAP financial measure and is defined by the Company as Net cash flows provided by operating activities less Capital expenditures as well as Software purchases and capitalized internal use software.

Total stockholders equity was $1,094.3 million and $1,003.8 million at June 30, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. At June 30, 2018 , net working capital was $213.8 million , compared to $244.6 million at June 30, 2017 . At the current time, and in future periods, we expect cash generated by our operations, together with existing cash, cash equivalents, and borrowing capacity, to be sufficient to cover cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, dividends and common stock repurchases. At June 30, 2018 , $103.6 million of the $263.9 million of Cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries, and $62.0 million of Cash and cash equivalents were held by regulated entities. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we may be required to pay additional foreign taxes to repatriate these funds. However, while we may do so at a future date, the Company does not need to repatriate future foreign earnings to fund U.S. operations.

The increase in cash used in financing activities of $420.3 million reflects (i) a $247.9 million net decrease in debt proceeds, net of debt payments, in the current year compared to the prior fiscal year (ii) a $223.0 million increase in the purchase of common stock, and (iii) a $14.0 million increase in dividends paid, partially offset by cash provided by: (i) a $36.2 million increase in the proceeds from stock option exercises, and (ii) a $19.2 million increase in excess tax benefits from the exercise and vesting of stock-based compensation awards. Income Taxes The Company, headquartered in the U.S., is routinely examined by the IRS and is also routinely examined by the tax authorities in the U.S. states and foreign countries in which it conducts business. The tax years under audit examination vary by tax jurisdiction. The Company regularly considers the likelihood of assessments in each of the jurisdictions resulting from examinations. To the extent the Company determines it has potential tax assessments in particular tax jurisdictions, the Company has established tax reserves which it believes are adequate in relation to the potential assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted when there is more information available, when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position has expired. The resolution of tax matters should not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or on the Company Consolidated Statements of Earnings for a particular future period.
