Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. GENERAL. Our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to individual and institutional investors in our U.S. sponsored mutual funds and other investment portfolios. The other investment portfolios include separately managed accounts, subadvised funds, and other sponsored investment portfolios including collective investment trusts, target-date retirement trusts and Luxembourg-based funds offered to investors outside the U.S. and portfolios offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the U.S. Investment advisory clients outside the U.S. account for 6.5% of our assets under management at December 31, 2013 . We manage a broad range of U.S., international and global stock, bond, and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios, which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors. Investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management. Accordingly, fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management affect our revenues and results of operations. We remain debt-free with substantial liquidity and resources that allow us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities; invest in key capabilities, including investment professionals, technologies, and new fund offerings; and, most importantly, provide our clients with strong investment management expertise and service both now and in the future. In the coming years, we expect to increase funding for long-term initiatives to sustain and deepen our investment talent, expand capabilities through enhanced technology, and broaden our distribution reach globally, including Italy and Germany. Page 20 Table of Contents BACKGROUND. U.S. stocks produced excellent returns in 2013, as the economy and the labor market strengthened despite federal tax increases and spending cuts that took effect in the first quarter. The Federal Reserve continued their purchase of Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities during the year to suppress long-term interest rates. The equity market also overcame a sharp increase in longer-term rates stemming from the concern over the Fed plans to curtail its asset purchases, as well as the October U.S. government shutdown and debt ceiling showdown. The mid-December announcement that the Fed would reduce its asset purchases starting in January 2014 did not dismay investors because the central bank pledged to keep short-term interest rates low as long as inflation remains contained. Equities in developed non-U.S. markets underperformed U.S. shares but still produced very good returns. Many parts of the eurozone emerged from recession, while Japan benefited from highly accommodative fiscal and monetary policies and a sharply weaker yen. Emerging markets equities fell slightly amid slowing economic growth in developing countries and fears that smaller Fed asset purchases would lead to reduced global liquidity. Results of several major equity market indexes for the full year 2013 are as follows: Index S&P 500 Index 32.4 % NASDAQ Composite Index (excluding dividends) 38.3 % Russell 2000 Index 38.8 % MSCI EAFE (Europe, Australasia, and Far East) Index 23.3 % MSCI Emerging Markets Index (2.3 )% Global bonds produced mostly negative returns in 2013. In the U.S., high yield bonds produced solid gains and significantly outperformed investment-grade issues amid favorable corporate fundamentals and strong demand for securities with a yield advantage. Investment-grade bonds declined; intermediate- and long-term Treasuries fared worst as longer-term interest rates rose sharply amid stronger growth and expectations for smaller Fed asset purchases. The 10-year Treasury note yield finished 2013 at 3.0% versus 1.8% at the end of 2012 . Government bonds in developed non-U.S. markets produced moderate losses in U.S. dollar terms. Emerging markets debt underperformed because of factors such as currency weakness and fears that the Fed tapering would decrease global liquidity. Results of several major bond market indexes for the full year 2013 are as follows: Index Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index (2.0 )% Credit Suisse High Yield Index 7.5 % Barclays Municipal Bond Index (2.6 )% Barclays Global Aggregate Ex-U.S. Dollar Bond Index (3.1 )% JPMorgan Emerging Markets Index Plus (8.3 )% Page 21 Table of Contents ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. Reflecting the strong growth in equity markets, our assets under management ended 2013 at a record $692.4 billion , an increase of $115.6 billion from the end of 2012 . Market appreciation drove this increase as $127.6 billion in market gains and income, net of distributions not reinvested, were reduced by net cash outflows of $12.0 billion in the 2013 year. Assets under management (in billions) at the end of the year and changes during each of the last three years are detailed below. Assets under management by investment portfolio December 31, 2011 2012 2013 Sponsored U.S. mutual funds $ 289.4 $ 346.9 $ 435.3 Other investment portfolios 200.1 229.9 257.1 Total $ 489.5 $ 576.8 $ 692.4 Assets under management by investment objective December 31, 2011 2012 2013 Stock and blended asset $ 352.4 $ 421.1 $ 537.0 Fixed income portfolios 137.1 155.7 155.4 Total $ 489.5 $ 576.8 $ 692.4 Components of changes in assets under management Year ended December 31, 2011 2012 2013 Assets under management at beginning of year $ 482.0 $ 489.5 $ 576.8 Net cash flows Sponsored U.S. mutual funds 11.0 15.7 10.2 Other investment portfolios 3.1 1.5 (22.2 ) 14.1 17.2 (12.0 ) Net market gains (losses) and income (5.8 ) 70.7 128.4 Distributions not reinvested (.8 ) (.6 ) (.8 ) Change during the period 7.5 87.3 115.6 Assets under management at end of year $ 489.5 $ 576.8 $ 692.4 Assets under management transferred from our sponsored U.S. mutual funds to our other investment portfolios $ 1.4 $ 4.5 $ 7.7 Our net cash flows in 2011 and 2012 and our sponsored U.S. mutual fund cash flows in 2013 were sourced primarily from third-party financial intermediaries. In 2013 , a vast majority of the net outflows from our other investment portfolios were concentrated among several large institutional clients outside the U.S. and intermediary clients that changed their investment objectives, repositioned their strategy allocations, or experienced investment performance challenges within their portfolio. The majority of the transfers from our sponsored mutual funds to our other investment portfolios disclosed in the table above in 2012 and 2013 were from our target-date retirement funds to our collective investment trusts and target-date retirement trusts. Our target-date retirement funds and trusts, which invest in a broadly diversified portfolio of other T. Rowe Price funds and T. Rowe Price collective investment trusts and automatically rebalance to maintain their specific asset allocation weightings, are a significant source of cash flows. Total net cash flows shown in the table above include $8.0 billion in 2011 , $10.1 billion in 2012 , and $11.5 billion in 2013 of net cash inflows that originated in these target-date portfolios. Assets under management at Page 22 Table of Contents December 31, 2013 , in these retirement portfolios totaled $121.2 billion , including $105.1 billion in target-date retirement funds and $16.1 billion in target-date retirement trusts. Strong investment performance and brand awareness is a key driver to attracting assets and to our long-term success. For 2013 , 76% of the T. Rowe Price U.S. mutual funds across their share classes outperformed their comparable Lipper averages on a total return basis for the three-year period ended December 31, 2013 , 77% outperformed for the five-year period, 82% outperformed for the 10-year period, and 71% outperformed for the one-year period. In addition, T. Rowe Price stock, bond and blended asset funds that were given an overall rating of four or five stars from Morningstar at December 31, 2013 , account for 78% of our rated funds' assets under management. The performance of our institutional strategies against their benchmarks was substantially similar. Our target-date retirement funds continue to deliver very attractive long-term performance, with 100% of these funds outperforming their comparable Lipper averages on a total return basis for the three- and five-year periods ended December 31, 2013 . We incur significant expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients. These efforts often involve costs that precede any future revenues that we may recognize from an increase to our assets under management. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 2013 versus 2012 . Year ended December 31, 2013 2012 Dollar Change Percent Change (in millions, except per-share data) Investment advisory fees $ 3,022.6 $ 2,592.0 $ 430.6 16.6 % Net revenues $ 3,484.2 $ 3,022.5 $ 461.7 15.3 % Operating expenses $ 1,846.8 $ 1,658.2 $ 188.6 11.4 % Net operating income $ 1,637.4 $ 1,364.3 $ 273.1 20.0 % Non-operating investment income $ 63.0 $ 70.8 $ (7.8 ) (11.0 )% Net income $ 1,047.7 $ 883.6 $ 164.1 18.6 % Diluted earnings per share $ 3.90 $ 3.36 $ .54 16.1 % Investment advisory fees in 2013 are up over 2012 as average assets under our management increase d $84.4 billion to $633.8 billion for the 2013 year. In addition, the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management increased to 47.7 basis points during 2013 from the 47.2 basis points earned in 2012 , due primarily to asset growth in higher than average fee rate strategies. We voluntarily waived $51.2 million in money market advisory fees in 2013 , an increase of $16.2 million from the $35.0 million waived in 2012 , in order to maintain a positive yield for fund investors. These fee waivers represent about 2% of total investment advisory revenues earned in 2013 . Fees were waived from each of our money market funds and trusts that have combined net assets at December 31, 2013 , of $16.3 billion , or 2.4% of our total assets under management. The firm expects that these fee waivers will continue in 2014 . Greater average assets under management and a higher annualized fee rate have increased our investment advisory revenues and helped lift our operating margin in 2013 to 47.0% compared to 45.1% in the 2012 period. Non-operating investment income in 2013 is down compared to 2012 , primarily because we sold fewer sponsored fund holdings in 2013 resulting in lower realized gains. Net revenues Investment advisory revenues earned from the T. Rowe Price mutual funds distributed in the U.S. were $2.1 billion in 2013 , an increase of 18.8% , or $335.8 million , on higher average mutual fund assets. Average mutual fund assets in 2013 were $391.2 billion , an increase of 19.8% from the 2012 average. Mutual fund assets at December 31, 2013 , were $435.3 billion , up $88.4 billion from the end of 2012 . Net inflows into the mutual funds during 2013 were $10.2 billion , including $5.8 billion into our stock and blended asset funds, $3.5 billion into our bond funds, and $.9 billion into the money market funds. These mutual fund net inflow amounts are Page 23 Table of Contents presented net of $7.7 billion that clients transferred to the other investment portfolios, primarily our collective investment trusts and target-date retirement trusts. Without these transfers, the mutual funds would have had net cash inflows of $17.9 billion in 2013 . Market appreciation and income, net of distributions not reinvested, added $78.2 billion to our mutual fund assets under management in 2013 . Investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increase d $94.8 million , or 11.8% , to $896.5 million . Average assets in these portfolios were $242.6 billion during 2013 , an increase of $19.8 billion , or 8.9% , from the 2012 year. Ending assets at December 31, 2013 , were $257.1 billion , an increase of $27.2 billion from the end of 2012 . Market appreciation and income of $49.4 billion was reduced by net outflows of $22.2 billion during 2013 . Net outflows during 2013 are presented net of the $7.7 billion assets that clients transferred in from the mutual funds. The vast majority of these net outflows were concentrated among several large institutional clients outside the U.S. and intermediary clients that changed their investment objectives, repositioned their strategy allocations, or experienced investment performance challenges within their portfolio. Administrative fees increase d $11.1 million to $343.7 million in 2013 . The increase is primarily attributable to our transfer agent servicing activities and defined contribution recordkeeping services for the mutual funds and their investors. Changes in administrative fee revenues are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors. Distribution and servicing fee revenues earned from 12b-1 plans of the Advisor, R, and variable annuity class shares of our sponsored portfolios were $117.2 million in 2013 , an increase of $21.1 million from the comparable 2012 period on greater average assets under management in these share classes. The 12b-1 fees earned are offset entirely by the costs paid to third-party intermediaries who source these assets. These costs are reported as distribution and servicing costs on the face of our consolidated income statements. Operating expenses Compensation and related costs increase d 10.4% from 2012 to about $1.2 billion . A significant part of the increase is attributable to a $45.4 million increase in our annual variable compensation program and a $37.2 million increase in salaries and related benefits. We increased our average staff size by 4.1% over 2012 to support both business growth and added capabilities. Higher temporary staff expenses, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and other employee costs account for the remainder of the increase in compensation and related costs in the 2013 period. At December 31, 2013 , we employed 5,668 associates, an increase of 5.5% from the end of 2012 . Advertising and promotion expenditures were $88.7 million in 2013 compared to $89.8 million in 2012 . The decrease in cost from the 2012 period is primarily attributable to process efficiencies realized through the realignment of certain marketing activities. We currently estimate that advertising and promotion expenditures for 2014 will be down about 5% from 2013 levels as we continue to realize the benefits of these process efficiencies. Occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increase d $20.8 million , or 10.1% , versus 2012 . The increase in costs is largely attributable to the expansion of our international facilities, the opening of two new buildings located at our Owings Mills campus, and continued investment in our technology capabilities, including related maintenance programs. The 2013 year also includes a non-recurring charge of $3.5 million related to the termination of certain facility leases. Other operating expenses were $257.6 million in 2013 , an increase of $38.5 million from the comparable 2012 period as increased business demands and our continued investment in our capabilities have increased our costs. These costs include consulting and professional fees, costs related to our defined contribution recordkeeping business, information services, and other third-party services. We also made a higher charitable contribution to the T. Rowe Price Foundation in 2013 than in 2012 . Non-operating investment income Our non-operating investment income, which includes the recognition of investment gains and losses, was down $7.8 million from the 2012 period. The decrease is due in part to the 2013 results including $13.5 million in gains realized on the sale of certain sponsored fund holdings compared with $35.1 million in gains realized in the comparable 2012 period. This reduction in realized gains was partially offset by $7.9 million in higher dividends received on our sponsored mutual fund holdings and $5.6 million in higher gains recognized on our other investments. The 2013 year also includes a $1.5 million gain recognized on the sale of our savings bank subsidiary. Page 24 Table of Contents Provision for income taxes Our 2013 effective tax rate of 38.4% is unchanged from the 2012 rate. The firm currently estimates its effective tax rate for 2014 will be about 38.4% . Our effective income tax rate reflects the relative contribution of pre-tax income generated by our non-U.S. subsidiaries that are subject to tax rates lower than our U.S. rates. Changes in the relative contribution of pre-tax income from U.S. and non-U.S. sources or changes in tax rates in relevant non-U.S. jurisdictions may affect our effective income tax rate and overall net income in the future. 2012 versus 2011 . Investment advisory revenues were up 10.3%, or $243.0 million, to nearly $2.6 billion in 2012, as average assets under our management increased $52.3 billion to $549.4 billion. The average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 47.2 basis points during 2012, virtually unchanged from the 47.3 basis points earned in 2011. We continued to voluntarily waive a portion of our money market advisory fees in 2012 in order to maintain a positive or zero yield for fund investors. These fees were waived from each of our money market funds and trusts and totaled $35.0 million, or about 1% of total investment advisory revenues earned in 2012, as compared to $36.4 million in 2011. Combined net assets at December 31, 2012 of the funds and trusts in which we waived fees in 2012 was $15.4 billion, or 2.7% of our total assets under management. Net revenues increased $275.4 million, or 10.0%, to $3.0 billion in 2012. Operating expenses were $1.7 billion in 2012, an increase of $138.0 million, or 9.1%. Overall, net operating income for 2012 increased $137.4 million, or 11.2%, to nearly $1.4 billion. The increase in our average assets under management and resulting advisory revenue lifted our operating margin for 2012 to 45.1% from 44.7% in 2011. Non-operating investment income of $70.8 million in 2012 included $32.6 million, or $.07 per share after income taxes, in gains realized from the sale of certain of our investments in sponsored funds to seed other sponsored funds in support of our distribution efforts outside the U.S. Net income, including these realized gains, increased $110.4 million, or 14.3%, to $883.6 million in 2012, and our diluted earnings per share on our common stock increased 15.1% to $3.36 from the $2.92 earned in 2011. Net revenues Investment advisory revenues earned from the T. Rowe Price mutual funds distributed in the U.S. were $1.8 billion in 2012, an increase of 11.4%, or $182.7 million, on higher average mutual fund assets. Average mutual fund assets in 2012 were $326.6 billion, an increase of 11.8% from the 2011 average. Mutual fund assets at December 31, 2012, were $346.9 billion, up $57.5 billion from the end of 2011. Net inflows to the mutual funds during 2012 were $15.7 billion, including $8.6 billion into our stock and blended asset funds and $7.5 billion into our bond funds. Our money market funds had net outflows of $.4 billion. Mutual fund net inflows include $6.4 billion that originated in our target-date retirement funds, which in turn invest in a broadly diversified portfolio of other Price funds, and automatically rebalance to maintain their specific asset allocation weightings. These fund net inflow amounts are presented net of $4.5 billion that was transferred to the other investment portfolios during the year. These transfers were primarily from our target-date retirement funds to our target-date retirement trusts. Market appreciation and income, net of distributions not reinvested, added $41.8 billion to our mutual fund assets under management in 2012. Investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increased $60.3 million, or 8.1%, to $801.7 million. Average assets in these portfolios were $222.8 billion during 2012, an increase of $17.8 billion, or 8.7%, from the 2011 year. Ending assets at December 31, 2012, were $229.9 billion, an increase of $29.8 billion from the end of 2011. Net inflows into these portfolios in 2012 were $1.5 billion, including $4.5 billion that was transferred from the mutual funds. Strong cash inflows in 2012 into our subadvised funds from third-party intermediaries were offset by outflows from institutional investors outside the U.S. These net outflows were primarily from institutional separate account portfolios that have experienced investment performance challenges or changes in the clients' investment objectives. Market appreciation and income increased assets under management in these portfolios by $28.3 billion. Administrative fees increased $11.4 million to $332.6 million in 2012. The increase is attributable to our mutual fund servicing activities and defined contribution recordkeeping services for the mutual funds and their investors. Changes in administrative fees are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors. Distribution and servicing fees earned from 12b-1 plans of the Advisor, R, and VIP II classes of our sponsored mutual funds were $96.1 million in 2012, an increase of $21.5 million from 2011. The increase includes $13.0 million recognized on greater assets under management in these share classes, and $8.5 million earned primarily on R class shares in the first quarter of 2012 Page 25 Table of Contents for which the comparable 2011 fees were netted against related distribution and servicing costs. The 12b-1 fees earned are offset entirely by the cost paid to third-party intermediaries who source these assets. These costs are reported as distribution and servicing costs on the face of the consolidated statements of income. Operating expenses Compensation and related costs were $1.0 billion, an increase of $77.8 million, or 8.0%, compared to 2011. The largest part of the increase is attributable to a $33.7 million increase in salaries and related benefits, which results from a modest increase in salaries at the beginning of 2012 combined with a 2.1% increase in our average staff size from 2011. The 2012 change also includes a $32.0 million increase in our annual variable compensation programs. The remainder of the change from 2011 is attributable to increased use of outside contractors to meet growing business demands, higher non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and other employee related costs. At December 31, 2012, we employed 5,372 associates, an increase of 2.2% from the end of 2011, to support both business growth and added capabilities. Advertising and promotion expenditures were $89.8 million in 2012 compared to $90.8 million in 2011. We vary our level of spending based on market conditions and investor demand as well as our efforts to expand our investor base globally. Distribution and servicing costs paid to third-party intermediaries who source assets into the Advisor, R, and VIP II classes of our sponsored mutual funds were $96.1 million in 2012, an increase of $21.5 million from 2011. The increase includes $13.0 million recognized on greater assets under management in these share classes, and $8.5 million incurred primarily on R class shares in the first quarter of 2012 for which the comparable 2011 costs were netted against related distribution and servicing fees. The costs are offset entirely by the 12b-1 fees we earn. These fees are reported as distribution and servicing fees on the face of the consolidated statements of income. Occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased $18.6 million, or 9.9%, versus 2011. The change includes the added costs incurred to expand our facilities around the world as well as update our technology capabilities, including related maintenance programs, to meet increasing business demands. Other operating expenses increased $21.1 million, or 10.7%, from 2011, including $16.4 million in certain third-party servicing costs incurred in 2012, for which the comparable 2011 costs were reported as reductions of advisory and administrative fee revenues. Non-operating investment income Our non-operating investment income, which includes interest income as well as the recognition of investment gains and losses, was up $47.1 million from the 2011 period. This increase includes $32.6 million in gains realized in the second half of 2012 from the sale of certain of our investments in sponsored funds to seed other sponsored funds in support of our distribution efforts outside the U.S. The balance of the change is primarily attributable to $8.4 million in higher net gains recognized on our cost-method investments and trading securities and $3.8 million in larger dividends earned on our mutual fund investments. Provision for income taxes Our effective tax rate for 2012 was 38.4% as compared to 38.2% in 2011. Our effective income tax rate reflects the relative contribution of pre-tax income generated by our non-U.S. subsidiaries that are subject to tax rates lower than our U.S. rates. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY. During 2013 , stockholders equity increase d from $3.8 billion to $4.8 billion . In 2013 , we paid $1.52 per share in regular dividends and expended $14.1 million to repurchase 200,000 common shares from existing cash balances and cash generated from operations. We generally repurchase shares of our common stock over time to offset the dilution created by our equity-based compensation plans. Tangible book value is $4.2 billion at December 31, 2013 , and our cash and fund investment holdings total $3.0 billion . Given the availability of these financial resources, we do not maintain an available external source of liquidity. At December 31, 2013 , we had outstanding commitments to make additional contributions totaling $40.7 million to various investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment. We currently expect total capital expenditures for property and equipment in 2014 to be approximately $145 million . These outstanding commitments, if called, and the capital expenditures will be funded from operating resources. Page 26 Table of Contents 2013 versus 2012 . Operating activities during 2013 provided cash flows of $1.2 billion , up $330.4 million from the 2012 period, including a $164.1 million increase in net income. Timing differences in the cash settlement of our accounts receivable and accrued revenues, payables and accrued liabilities, and other assets and liabilities increase d our operating cash flows by $62.4 million compared to the 2012 year. The increase from 2012 is also a result of a $63.7 million reduction in cash used to make net purchases of trading securities held by our consolidated sponsored investment portfolios and a $21.6 million reduction in the adjustment for gains realized from the sale of certain available-for-sale sponsored fund investments as less investments were sold in 2013 . Net cash used in investing activities totaled $437.5 million , up $127.4 million from 2012 . We made $60.1 million more net investments in our sponsored funds during 2013 compared with 2012 as we utilized more of our cash to make additional investments as compared to the rebalancing of the portfolio in 2012 . The 2012 year also included greater net cash proceeds of $40.1 million from the sale of debt securities held by our savings bank subsidiary as the bank was sold in early December 2013 . We spent $28.9 million more in property and equipment additions in 2013 compared to the 2012 period. The 2013 year also includes a net cash outflow of $11.7 million related to the sale of our savings bank subsidiary as the cash that was held by the bank on the closing date was greater than the $23.6 million in proceeds we received. Net cash used in financing activities was $276.8 million in 2013 , down $334.7 million from the comparable 2012 period. The decrease is primarily attributable to the repurchase of 2.1 million more shares of common stock and the payment of a $1.00 special dividend in 2012 . 2012 versus 2011 . Operating activities during 2012 provided cash flows of $902.8 million, down $45.6 million from 2011, due in part to the $92.7 million in net investments made by the consolidated sponsored funds we seeded during the first half of 2012 for which we have a controlling financial interest. Timing differences in the cash settlement of our accounts receivable and accrued revenues, payables and accrued liabilities, and other assets and liabilities decreased our operating cash flows by $42.5 million compared to the 2011 year. The cash flows from operating activities in 2012 also includes a reduction for the $35.1 million in gains recognized on the sale of certain fund investments as the related cash flow activity is reflected in net cash used in investing activities. These operating cash flow decreases are offset by a $110.4 million increase in net income and increases in non-cash expenses for depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation, which are added back to net income to determine cash from operations. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $310.1 million, up $145.1 million from 2011. We made $218.3 million more net investments in our sponsored funds during 2012 compared with 2011. This increase was offset by greater net cash proceeds of $73.4 million in 2012 from the sale of more debt securities held by our savings bank subsidiary. Net cash used in financing activities was $611.5 million in 2012, down $87.1 million from the comparable 2011 period. During 2011, we expended $344.5 million more for stock repurchases, including the repurchase of 6.4 million more shares than in 2012. This reduction in cash used was partially offset by the change in customer deposits at our savings bank subsidiary during 2012 compared to 2011 as well as a $285.5 million increase in dividends paid. The increase in dividends paid in 2012 is due to a $.03 increase in our quarterly per-share dividend and the payment of a $1.00 per share special dividend in December 2012. The balance of the decrease from 2011 in cash used is due to greater proceeds and tax benefits related to our stock-based compensation plans on increased exercise activity in late 2012. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. The following table presents a summary of our future obligations (in millions) under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at December 31, 2013 . Other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated, under certain conditions that may involve termination fees. Because these obligations are generally of a normal recurring nature, we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations. The information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2014 and future years. The information also excludes the $4.8 million of uncertain tax positions discussed in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements because it is not possible to estimate the time period in which a payment might be made to the tax authorities.

The vast majority of these additional contributions will be made to investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment. In addition to such amounts, a percentage of prior distributions may be called under certain circumstances. In January 2014, we renewed and extended our operating lease at our corporate headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland through 2027. This lease agreement increases the above disclosed total noncancelable operating lease commitments by an additional $133.0 million , the vast majority of which will be paid after 2018. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. The preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives. Further, significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, the revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of income, and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements. Making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time. Accordingly, actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements, significant accounting policies, and notes. We present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2013 Annual Report. In the following discussion, we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements. Other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities . We generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored funds as available-for-sale if we are not deemed to a have a controlling financial interest. At the end of each quarter, we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. We next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary. In determining whether a mutual fund holding is other-than-temporarily impaired, we consider many factors, including the duration of time it has existed, the severity of the impairment, any subsequent changes in value, and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value. Subject to the other considerations noted above, we believe a fund holding with an unrealized loss that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarter-ends is generally presumed to have an other-than-temporary impairment. We may also recognize an other-than-temporary loss of less than six months in our consolidated statements of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a near-term recovery is possible. We sold our savings bank subsidiary in December 2013. Through the date of the transaction, we generally classified the debt securities held by the bank as available-for-sale and would mark their carrying amount to fair value quarterly and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. We would review each individual security position that had an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment was other than temporary. The impairment was considered to be other-than-temporary if the impairment was caused by a change in credit quality that affected our ability to recover our amortized cost or if we intended to sell the security or believed it was more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security before recovering its cost. Minor impairments of 5% or less were generally considered temporary. Other-than-temporary impairments of equity method investments . We evaluate our equity method investments, including our investment in UTI, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value, and the decline in fair value is other than temporary. Page 28 Table of Contents Goodwill . We internally conduct, manage, and report our operations as one investment advisory business. We do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business. Accordingly, we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit our investment advisory business. We evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach. Goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business. Our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business (our market capitalization) exceeds our carrying amount (our stockholders equity) and, therefore, no impairment exists. Should we reach a different conclusion in the future, additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the non-cash impairment charge to be recognized. We must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred. The maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our consolidated balance sheets, $665.7 million . Stock options . We recognize stock option-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of income using a fair value based method. Fair value methods use a valuation model for shorter-term, market-traded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations, including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date, the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period, and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time. Our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted. Unlike most of our expenses, the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a non-cash charge that is never measured by, or adjusted based on, a cash outflow. Provision for income taxes . After compensation and related costs, our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense. We operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income, expenses, and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions. Accordingly, our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations. Annually, we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities. Each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations. From time to time, we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to, or in the process of, being audited by various tax authorities. Because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates, it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements. As a result, we recognize additions to, or reductions of, income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled. We recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined. NEWLY ISSUED BUT NOT YET ADOPTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. We have considered all newly issued accounting guidance that is applicable to our operations and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, including that which we have not yet adopted. We do not believe that any such guidance will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operation. FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION. From time to time, information or statements provided by or on behalf of T. Rowe Price, including those within this report, may contain certain forward-looking information, including information or anticipated information relating to: our revenues, net income, and earnings per share on common stock; changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management; our expense levels; our estimated effective income tax rate; and our expectations regarding financial markets, future transactions, dividends, investments, capital expenditures, and other conditions. Readers are cautioned that any forward-looking information provided by or on behalf of T. Rowe Price is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward-looking information because of various factors including, but not limited to, those discussed below and in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K Annual Report. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management. Such changes result from many factors including, among other things: cash inflows and outflows in the T. Rowe Price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios, fluctuations in global financial markets that result Page 29 Table of Contents in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management, our introduction of new mutual funds and investment portfolios, and changes in retirement savings trends relative to participant-directed investments and defined contribution plans. The ability to attract and retain investors assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence; the relative investment performance of the Price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios as compared to competing offerings and market indexes; the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels; competitive conditions in the mutual fund, asset management, and broader financial services sectors; and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business. Our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the Price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the Price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements. Non-operating investment income will also fluctuate primarily due to the size of our investments, changes in their market valuations, and any other-than-temporary impairments that may arise or, in the case of our equity method investments, our proportionate share of the investee net income. Our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: changes in the level of our advertising expenses in response to market conditions, including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the U.S. and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the U.S.; variations in the level of total compensation expense due to, among other things, bonuses, stock option and other equity grants, other incentive awards, changes in our employee count and mix, and competitive factors; any goodwill or other asset impairment that may arise; fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations; expenses and capital costs, such as technology assets, depreciation, amortization, and research and development, incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients; and disruptions of services, including those provided by third parties, such as facilities, communications, power, and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems. Our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation, and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax, and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results, including, but not limited to, effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in mutual funds and investing in general or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments.
