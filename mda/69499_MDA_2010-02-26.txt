ITEM 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis addresses material changes in the results of operations and financial condition of Mylan Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company , Mylan or we ) for the periods presented. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and our other SEC filings and public disclosures.

We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements for revisions or changes after the date of this Form 10-K. Executive Overview Mylan is the world third largest producer of generic and specialty pharmaceuticals, offering one of the industry broadest and highest quality product portfolios, a robust pipeline and a global commercial footprint that spans more than 140 countries and territories. Employing over 15,500 people, Mylan has attained leading positions in key international markets through its wide array of dosage forms and delivery systems, significant manufacturing capacity, global scale and commitment to customer service. Through its Matrix Laboratories Limited ( Matrix ) subsidiary, Mylan controls one of the world largest active pharmaceutical ingredient ( API ) manufacturers with respect to the number of drug master files ( DMFs ) filed with regulatory agencies. This relationship makes Mylan one of only two global generics companies with a comprehensive, vertically integrated supply chain. We hold a leading generics sales position in four of the world largest pharmaceutical markets, those being the United States ( U.S. ), France, the United Kingdom ( U.K. ) and Japan, and we also hold leading sales positions in several other key generics markets, including Australia, Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Spain. 49 Table of Contents Mylan previously had three reportable segments, Generics , Specialty and Matrix. The Matrix Segment had consisted of Matrix, which was previously a publicly traded company in India, in which Mylan held a 71.2% ownership stake. Following the acquisition of approximately 25% of the remaining interest in Matrix and its related delisting from the Indian stock exchanges, Mylan now has two reportable segments, Generics and Specialty. Mylan changed its segments to align with how the business is being managed after those changes. The former Matrix Segment is included within the Generics Segment. Information for earlier periods has been recast. Generics primarily develops, manufactures, sells and distributes generic or branded generic pharmaceutical products in tablet, capsule or transdermal patch form, as well as API. Specialty engages mainly in the manufacture and sale of branded specialty nebulized and injectable products. We also report in Corporate/Other certain research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses; litigation settlements; amortization of intangible assets and certain purchase-accounting items (such as the inventory step-up); impairment charges; and other items not directly attributable to the segments. Change in Fiscal Year Effective October 2, 2007, we changed our fiscal year end from March 31st to December 31st. We have defined various periods that are covered in the discussion below as follows: calendar year 2009 January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009; calendar year 2008 January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2008; calendar year 2007 January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007; transition period April 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007; and comparable nine-month period April 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The above periods include Matrix from January 8, 2007 and the former Merck Generics business from October 2, 2007. As a result of the change in year end, we believe that a comparison between calendar year 2008 and calendar year 2007 and a comparison between the transition period and the comparable nine-month period enhances a reader understanding of our results of operations and, as such, these are the comparisons which are presented below in the section titled Results of Operations . The financial and operational trends highlighted in the comparisons presented below are consistent with those that would result from a comparison of calendar year 2008 to the transition period. Acquisition of the Remaining Interest in Matrix Laboratories Limited On March 26, 2009, we announced plans to buy the remaining public interest in Matrix from its minority shareholders pursuant to a voluntary delisting offer. At the time, we owned approximately 71.2% of Matrix through a wholly-owned subsidiary, and controlled more than 76% of its voting rights. On June 1, 2009, Mylan announced that it had successfully completed the delisting offer and accepted the discovered price of 211 Rupees per share, which was established by the reverse book building process prescribed by Indian regulations. During the calendar year ended December 31, 2009, we completed the purchase of an additional portion of the remaining interest from minority shareholders of Matrix, for cash of approximately $182.2 million, bringing both our total ownership and control to over 96%. Matrix stock was delisted from the Indian stock exchanges effective August 21, 2009. Bystolic tm In January 2006, we announced an agreement with Forest Laboratories Holdings, Ltd. ( Forest ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Forest Laboratories, Inc., for the commercialization, development and distribution of Bystolic in the United States and Canada (the 2006 Agreement ). Under the terms of that agreement, Mylan received a $75.0 million up-front payment and $25.0 million upon approval of the product. Such amounts were being deferred until the commercial launch of the product and were to be amortized over the remaining term of the license agreement. Mylan also had the potential to earn future milestones and royalties on Bystolic sales and an option to co-promote the product, while Forest assumed all future development and selling and marketing expenses. 50 Table of Contents In February 2008, Mylan executed an agreement with Forest whereby Mylan sold to Forest its rights to Bystolic (the Amended Agreement ). Under the terms of the Amended Agreement, Mylan received a cash payment of $370.0 million, which was deferred along with the $100.0 million received under the 2006 Agreement, and retained its contractual royalties for three years, through 2010. Mylan obligations under the 2006 Agreement to supply Bystolic to Forest were unchanged by the Amended Agreement. Mylan believed that these supply obligations represented significant continuing involvement as Mylan remained contractually obligated to manufacture the product for Forest while the product was being commercialized. As a result of this continuing involvement, Mylan had been amortizing the $470.0 million of deferred revenue ratably through 2020 pending the transfer of manufacturing responsibility that was anticipated to occur in the second half of 2008. In September 2008, Mylan completed the transfer of all manufacturing responsibilities for the product to Forest, and Mylan supply obligations have therefore been eliminated. We believe that we no longer have significant continuing involvement and that the earnings process has been completed. As such, the deferred revenue of $468.1 million was recognized and included in other revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for calendar year 2008. Future royalties are considered to be contingent consideration and are recognized in other revenue as earned upon sales of the product by Forest. Such royalties are recorded at the net royalty rates specified in the Amended Agreement. Goodwill Impairment On February 27, 2008 we announced that we were reviewing strategic alternatives for our specialty business, Dey, including the potential sale of the business. This decision was based upon several factors, including a strategic review of the business, the expected performance of the Perforomist product, where anticipated growth was determined to be slower than expected and the timeframe to reach peak sales was determined to be longer than was originally anticipated. As a result of our ongoing review of strategic alternatives, we determined that it was more likely than not that the business would be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. Accordingly, a recoverability test of Dey long-lived assets was performed during the three months ended March 31, 2008. We included both cash flow projections and estimated proceeds from the eventual disposition of the long-lived assets. The estimated undiscounted future cash flows exceeded the book values of the long-lived assets and, as a result, no impairment charge was recorded. Upon the closing of the former Merck Generics business acquisition, Dey was defined as the Specialty Segment. Dey is also considered a reporting unit. Upon closing of the transaction, we allocated $711.2 million of goodwill to Dey. We test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis and at any other time events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired. As we had determined that it was more likely than not that the business would be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life, we were required, during the three months ended March 31, 2008, to assess whether any portion of its recorded goodwill balance was impaired. The first step of the impairment analysis consisted of a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including the goodwill. We performed extensive valuation analyses, utilizing both income and market-based approaches, in our goodwill assessment process. The following describes the valuation methodologies used to derive the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. Income Approach: To determine fair value, we discounted the expected future cash flows of the reporting unit. We used a discount rate, which reflected the overall level of inherent risk and the rate of return an outside investor would have expected to earn. To estimate cash flows beyond the final year of our model, we used a terminal value approach. Under this approach, we used estimated operating income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the final year of our model, adjusted to estimate a normalized cash flow, applied a perpetuity growth assumption, and discounted by a perpetuity discount factor to determine the terminal value. We incorporated the present value of the resulting terminal value into our estimate of fair value. 51 Table of Contents Market-Based Approach: To corroborate the results of the income approach described above, we estimated the fair value of our reporting unit using several market-based approaches, including the guideline company method which focused on comparing our risk profile and growth prospects to a select group of publicly traded companies with reasonably similar guidelines. Based on the step one analysis that was performed for Dey, we determined that the carrying amount of the net assets of the reporting unit was in excess of its estimated fair value. As such, we were required to perform the step two analysis for Dey, in order to determine the amount of any goodwill impairment. The step two analysis consisted of comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill, with an impairment charge resulting from any excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill based on a hypothetical allocation of the estimated fair value to the net assets. Based on the second step analysis, we concluded that $385.0 million of the goodwill recorded at Dey was impaired. As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $385.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2008, which represented our best estimate as of March 31, 2008. The allocation discussed above was performed only for purposes of assessing goodwill for impairment; accordingly, we have not adjusted the net book value of the assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, other than goodwill, as a result of this process. The determination of the fair value of the reporting unit required us to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting unit expected future cash flows. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, the discount rate, terminal growth rates, operating income before depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures forecasts. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. In addition, changes in underlying assumptions would have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting unit or the goodwill impairment charge. The hypothetical allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to individual assets and liabilities within the reporting unit also requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. The hypothetical allocation requires several analyses to determine the estimate of the fair value of assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. In September 2008, following the completion of the comprehensive review of strategic alternatives for Dey, we announced our decision to retain the Dey business. This decision included a plan to realign the business, which has resulted in the incurrence of severance and other exit costs. In addition, the comprehensive review resulted in an intangible asset impairment charge related to certain non-core, insignificant, third-party products. Product Opportunities On November 10, 2009, Mylan announced that Matrix received final approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for its Abbreviated New Drug Application ( ANDA ) for lansoprazole delayed-release (DR) capsules, 15 mg and 30 mg. Lansoprazole DR capsules are the generic version of Tap Pharmaceuticals proton pump inhibitor Prevacid DR Capsules. The brand product had U.S. sales of approximately $3.0 billion for the twelve months ended June 30, 2009, according to IMS Health. Mylan began shipment of its product immediately upon approval, and began selling it under the Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( MPI ) brand. On January 30, 2009, we announced that MPI received final approval from the FDA for our ANDA for divalproex sodium extended-release ( divalproex ER ) tablets, 250 mg and 500 mg. Divalproex ER tablets are the generic version of Abbott Laboratories Depakote ER and had U.S. sales of approximately $901.0 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2008, with $789.0 million for the 500 mg strength and $112.0 million for the 250 mg strength, according to IMS. Mylan began shipment of its 250 mg product immediately upon approval. Mylan was awarded 180 days of marketing exclusivity for the 500 mg strength, which it began to ship on February 2, 2009. Mylan began shipment of its 250 mg product immediately upon approval. On November 4, 2008, we announced that MPI received final approval from the FDA for our ANDA for levetiracetam tablets, 250 mg, 500 mg and 750 mg. Levetiracetam tablets are the generic version of UCB Pharma Keppra . Levetiracetam tablets had U.S. sales of approximately $1.0 billion for the twelve months ended September 30, 2008 for these three strengths, according to IMS. Pursuant to an agreement with UCB Societe Anonyme and UCB Pharma Inc. to settle pending litigation relating to levetiracetam tablets, Mylan began shipment of its product immediately upon approval. Additional generic competition entered the market in mid-January 2009. 52 Table of Contents Financial Summary For the year ended December 31, 2009, Mylan reported total revenues of $5.09 billion compared to $5.14 billion for 2008. Included in total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $468.1 million of previously deferred revenue related to our sale of the product rights of Bystolic tm . Excluding this, total revenues increased $423.3 million over the prior year. Consolidated gross profit for both periods remained consistent at $2.07 billion. Excluding Bystolic from the prior year, gross profit for 2009 increased by 29.5%. For the current year, operating income of $523.4 million was realized compared to $297.9 million in the prior year. Excluding Bystolic from the prior year, as well as an impairment charge of $385.0 million as further discussed below, operating income for 2008 was $214.8 million. The net earnings attributable to Mylan Inc. common shareholders for the current year were $93.5 million compared to a loss of $335.1 million in the comparable prior year period. This translates into earnings per diluted share attributable to Mylan Inc. of $0.30 for calendar year 2009, compared to a loss per diluted share of $1.10 in the calendar year 2008. Included in the results for calendar year 2009 and 2008 are the following items of note: Calendar year 2009: Charges consisting primarily of incremental amortization related to purchased intangible assets and the amortization of the inventory step-up associated with the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business of $282.5 million; Other revenue of approximately $28.5 million resulting from the cancellation of product development agreements for which the revenue had been previously deferred; Net litigation charges of $225.7 million consisting primarily of a charge of $160 million related to a settlement in principle to resolve certain claims relating to the Company outstanding pricing litigation and to reserve for the remaining pricing lawsuits to which the Company is a party, and a charge of $121.0 million related to the settlement of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice, concerning calculations of Medicaid drug rebates, partially offset by certain litigation related recoveries; Interest of $42.9 million relating to the accretion of the discounts on our convertible debt instruments; An upfront payment of $18.0 million made with respect to the execution of a co-development agreement; Rebranding costs associated with a migration to the Mylan brand for the former Merck Generics business totaling $21.4 million; Additional costs, primarily restructuring, related to the integration of recently acquired entities, and other costs, totaling $60.7 million; A tax effect of $207.5 million related to the above items and other taxes; and An income tax benefit of approximately $65.0 million related to losses recognized as a result of reorganizations among certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Calendar year 2008: Charges consisting primarily of incremental amortization related to purchased intangible assets and the amortization of the inventory step-up associated with the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business of $415.6 million; The recognition of $468.1 million of deferred revenue related to Mylan sale of the product rights of Bystolic; An impairment loss on the goodwill of the Dey business of $385.0 million; Intangible asset impairment charges of $72.5 million on certain non-core, insignificant, third-party products; Net litigation charges of $16.6 million related to the settlement of litigation, the majority of which relates to the awarding of attorney fees in a patent infringement case in which Mylan was the defendant; 53 Table of Contents Interest of $29.5 million relating to the accretion of the discounts on our convertible debt instruments; Rebranding costs associated with a migration to the Mylan brand for the former Merck Generics business totaling $42.9 million; Consulting and information technology ( IT ) costs directly associated with the integration of newly acquired businesses totaling approximately $38.7 million; Additional costs, other than consulting and IT, primarily restructuring, related to the integration of recently acquired entities, and other costs, totaling $77.2 million; and A tax effect of $30.6 million related to the above items and other taxes.

Total revenue includes both net sales to third parties and other revenue. Net sales for 2009 were $5.02 billion compared to $4.63 billion for 2008, representing an increase of $384.2 million, or 8%. Net sales were unfavorably impacted by the effect of foreign currency translation, primarily reflecting a stronger U.S. dollar in comparison to the functional currencies of Mylan other subsidiaries, primarily those in Europe, Australia and India. Translating current year revenues at prior year exchange rates would have resulted in year-over-year growth in net sales excluding foreign currency of $558.9 million, or approximately 12%. Other revenues for 2009 were $77.4 million compared to $506.3 million in 2008, a decrease of $429.0 million. Included in other revenue for the prior year is the recognition of $468.1 million of previously deferred revenue related to the sale of our rights of Bystolic. Excluding this item, other revenues increased in the current year mainly due to incremental revenue resulting from the cancellation of product development agreements for which the revenue had been previously deferred. Prior to the termination of these agreements, Mylan had been amortizing the previously received non-refundable payments over a period of several years. In arriving at net revenues, gross revenues are reduced by provisions for estimates, including discounts, customer performance, indirect rebates and promotions, price adjustments, returns and chargebacks. See the section titled Application of Critical Accounting Policies in this Item 7, for a thorough discussion of our methodology with respect to such provisions. For calendar year ended December 31, 2009, the most significant amounts charged against gross revenues were for chargebacks in the amount of $1.89 billion and promotions and indirect rebates in the amount of $1.08 billion. Gross profit for calendar year 2009 was $2.07 billion and gross margins were 40.7%. For calendar year 2008, gross profit was $2.07 billion and gross margins were 40.3%. Gross profit was impacted by certain purchase accounting related items recorded during calendar year 2009 of approximately $282.5 million, which consisted primarily of incremental amortization related to the purchased intangible assets and the amortization of the inventory step-up associated with the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business. Excluding these items, gross margins would have been approximately 46.3%. Prior year gross profit is also impacted by similar purchase accounting related items in the amount of $481.4 million, including certain intangible assets impairment charges. Excluding such items, as well as the Bystolic revenue, gross margins in the prior year would have been approximately 44.6%. The increase in gross margins, excluding the items noted above, can generally be attributed to the impact of the timing of significant product launches. Products generally contribute most significantly to gross margin at the time of their launch and even more so in periods of market exclusivity or limited generic competition. As discussed previously, during calendar year 2009, we launched divalproex ER and lansoprazole DR. Generics Segment For calendar year 2009, the Generics Segment reported total revenues of $4.70 billion compared to $4.29 billion in calendar year 2008, an increase of $413.0 million, or 9.6%. However, excluding the effect of foreign currency, calculated as described previously, the increase was approximately 13%. Generics Segment total revenues are derived from sales primarily in or from the U.S. and Canada (collectively North America ), Europe, Middle East and Africa (collectively, EMEA ) and India, Australia, Japan, and New Zealand (collectively, Asia Pacific ). Total revenues from North America were $2.18 billion for calendar year 2009 compared to $1.87 billion for calendar year 2008, representing an increase of $307.9 million, or 16.4%. The increase is due primarily to new product revenue in the U.S. and Canada. New products contributed net revenues of approximately $322.5 million, the majority of which were divalproex ER and lansoprazole DR. Year over year decreases from our existing products were driven by unfavorable pricing, largely offset by increased volume. Loss of exclusivity and increased competition on certain products drove price declines, while volumes were favorably impacted by Mylan ability to remain a source of stable supply as certain competitors experienced regulatory and supply issues. 55 Table of Contents Fentanyl, our AB-rated generic alternative to Duragesic , continued to contribute to both revenue and gross profit despite the entrance into the market of additional generic competition. Sales of fentanyl have remained relatively strong primarily due to Mylan ability to continue to be a stable and reliable source of supply to the market. As is the case in the generic industry, the entrance into the market of additional competition generally has a negative impact on the volume and pricing of the affected products. Competition on fentanyl in the future could continue to have an unfavorable impact on pricing and market share. Included in total revenues from North America are other revenues of $54.6 million in the current year versus $26.4 million in the prior year. This increase in other revenues is primarily the result of incremental revenue resulting from the cancellation of certain product development agreements of $28.5 million, as discussed previously. Total revenues from EMEA were $1.66 billion for calendar year 2009 compared to $1.64 billion for calendar year 2008, an increase of $18.5 million, or 1.1%. However, excluding the effect of foreign currency, calculated as described previously, the increase was approximately $136.0 million, or 8%. The increase was driven by new product launches, favorable market dynamics in certain countries, and a full year of revenue contribution from the Central and Eastern European businesses acquired in June 2008. The launch of new products and increased product volumes resulted in overall higher revenues in Spain, Italy and France, the latter of which also realized sales growth across all sectors, mainly as a result of a gain in market share. In Italy, the increase in revenues was also driven by regulatory changes that have had a significant favorable impact on pricing. In the U.K., prior year revenues were negatively impacted by excess supply in the market at that time. The increase in the current year is the result of such excess supply issues having since been resolved. Revenues in Germany were negatively affected by recently implemented tender systems. A number of markets in which we operate have implemented or may implement such tender systems for generic pharmaceuticals in an effort to lower prices. These measures have a negative impact on sales and gross profit in the affected markets. In Germany, current year revenues were negatively impacted by the price reductions as a result of these tenders, as well as general pricing pressure on its non-tender business and the loss of exclusivity on certain Statutory Health Insurance contracts. In Asia Pacific, total revenues were $1.0 billion for calendar year 2009 compared to $911.1 million for calendar year 2008, an increase of $90.3 million, or 9.9%. However, excluding the effect of foreign currency, calculated as described above, the increase was approximately $151.0 million, or 17%. Sales in Asia Pacific are derived from the sale of generic pharmaceuticals in Australia, India, Japan and New Zealand, as well as API by our Matrix subsidiary in India. Driving the year over year revenue increase was the sale of generics and API and increased sales in Japan. Certain markets in which we do business have recently undergone government-imposed price reductions, thereby increasing pricing pressures on pharmaceutical products. This is true in Australia as well as several European countries. Such measures, along with the tender systems discussed above, are likely to have a negative impact on sales and gross profit in these markets. However, some pro-generic government initiatives in certain markets could help to offset some of this unfavorability by potentially increasing generic substitution. In Australia, the impact of the government-imposed pricing reform was the primary reason for the overall decrease in revenues. Partially offsetting this decrease were favorable volumes when compared to 2008. In India, third party sales of both finished dosage form ( FDF ) generics and API drove year over year growth. The increase in FDF is primarily due to continued growth in anti-retroviral ( ARV ) products, including the awarding in the current year of several key contracts and tenders, while third party sales of API were driven by significant product launches in the U.S. and Europe. Additionally, during 2009, the Company acquired the remaining 50% of a joint venture that had been accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Subsequent to this acquisition, the revenues generated by this subsidiary are included in Matrix total revenues. Matrix also sells API to other Mylan subsidiaries in conjunction with our vertical integration strategy. In Japan, sales increased over the prior year due to Mylan growth in the Japanese market and the continued impact of certain pro-generic measures implemented by the Japanese government. 56 Table of Contents In addition to net sales, included in total revenues in Asia Pacific are other revenues of $56.4 million for 2009, compared to $46.0 million in 2008. Other revenues are realized primarily through intercompany product development agreements. Specialty Segment For calendar year 2009 the Specialty Segment reported total revenues of $455.7 million, of which $415.0 million represented sales to third-parties. For calendar year 2008, the Specialty Segment reported total revenues of $417.2 million, of which $386.0 million represented sales to third-parties. The most significant contributor to the Specialty Segment revenues is EpiPen Auto-injector, which is used in the treatment of severe allergic reactions. The EpiPen Auto-injector is the number one prescribed treatment for severe allergic reactions with a U.S. market share of 96%. In addition to the continued strong sales of the EpiPen Auto-injector, the increase in third-party revenues was driven by increased sales of Perforomist Solution, Dey maintenance therapy for patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Increased sales of the EpiPen Auto-injector and Perforomist Solution in the current year were partially offset by lower revenue from DuoNeb for which patent protection was lost in late 2007. The additional competition which followed the loss of patent protection has not only affected Dey sales of the branded product, but also impacted the profit share received from sales of the licensed generic. Operating Expenses Research and development ( R&D ) expense for calendar year 2009 was $275.3 million compared to $317.2 million for calendar year 2008, a decrease of $42.0 million or 13.2%. The decrease in R&D was driven by decreases in both Generics and Specialty, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by an increase in Corporate/Other. The decreases in Generics and Specialty are reflective of certain restructuring activities with respect to the previously announced rationalization and optimization of the global manufacturing and research and development platforms. The overall decreases in Generics and Specialty were partially offset by an increase in Corporate/Other driven by an up-front payment of $18.0 million made with respect to our execution of a co-development agreement. Selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expense for calendar year 2009 was flat year over year at $1.05 billion, with decreases in Generics and Specialty offset by an increase in Corporate/Other. The decrease in Generics was driven primarily by the effect of foreign exchange, partially offset by costs related to the restructurings referred to above. The cost savings as a result of these restructurings began to materialize in 2009, but is expected to have a more favorable impact on future periods. However, the benefit from the restructuring programs in Specialty was a driver, along with a decrease in professional fees, of lower SG&A in the current year in that segment These decreases in SG&A explained above were offset by an increase in Corporate/Other due primarily to an increase in legal and professional fees, as well as higher payroll and payroll-related costs. Litigation Settlements, net During calendar year 2009, we recorded net unfavorable litigation charges of $225.7 million. This amount consists primarily of a charge of $160 million related to a settlement in principle to resolve certain claims relating to the Company outstanding pricing litigation, and to reserve for the remaining pricing lawsuits to which the Company is a party, and a charge of $121 million related to the settlement of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice, concerning calculations of Medicaid drug rebates offset by certain litigation-related recoveries. Interest Expense Interest expense for calendar year 2009 totaled $318.5 million compared to $380.8 million for calendar year 2008. In March 2009, we pre-paid all of our required 2010 principal payments, and in December 2009 we pre-paid all of our required 2011 principal payments on our term debt, which, along with lower overall interest rates, drove 57 Table of Contents the decrease in interest expense. Included in interest expense for 2009 and 2008 are $42.9 million and $29.5 million of accretion of the discounts on our convertible debt instruments. Other Income, net Other income, net, was $22.1 million for calendar year 2009, compared to $11.3 million in calendar year 2008. Other income in 2009 included a favorable adjustment of $13.9 million to the restructuring reserve as a result of a reduction in the estimated remaining spending on accrued projects, a $10.4 million net gain realized on the termination of certain joint ventures by our Matrix subsidiary, and interest income of $6.7 million, partially offset by a $11.7 million loss on the sale, by Matrix, of a majority-owned subsidiary. In the prior year, other income was primarily comprised of interest and dividend income. Income Tax Expense For calendar year 2009, income taxes were a benefit of $20.8 million as compared to a $128.6 million expense for calendar year 2008. The current year included a $65.0 million tax benefit related to losses recognized as a result of reorganizations among certain of our foreign subsidiaries. In calendar year 2008, a pre-tax operating loss was offset by the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge related to Dey. The effective tax rate in the prior year was largely influenced by the gain on the sale of Bystolic as well. In addition to these items, the change in the provision year over year was driven primarily by the deductibility of certain foreign attributes, changes in unrecognized losses of certain foreign subsidiaries, different levels of income, and changes to our tax reserves as required by the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( Codification ) topic regarding income taxes. Calendar Year 2008 Compared to Calendar Year 2007 Total Revenues and Gross Profit For calendar year 2008, Mylan reported total revenues of $5.14 billion compared to $2.67 billion in the same prior year period. This represents an increase of $2.47 billion. In calendar year 2008, the former Merck Generics business contributed third-party revenues of $2.57 billion of which $2.19 billion are included in the Generics Segment and $386.0 million are included in the Specialty Segment. In calendar year 2007, for the three months following the date of acquisition, the former Merck Generics business contributed third-party revenues of $700.6 million of which $598.5 million are included in the Generics Segment and $102.1 million are included in the Specialty Segment. Also included in total revenues for the current year is $468.1 million of previously deferred revenue recognized related to the sale of our rights of Bystolic. Excluding revenue contributed by the former Merck Generics business for both years, and the Bystolic revenue in the current year, total sales for calendar year 2008 were $2.10 billion compared to $1.97 billion. This represents an increase of approximately 6.7% or $131.0 million over the comparable twelve-month period. In arriving at net revenues, gross revenues are reduced by provisions for estimates, including discounts, customer performance, indirect rebates and promotions, price adjustments, returns and chargebacks. See the section titled Application of Critical Accounting Policies in this Item 7, for a thorough discussion of our methodology with respect to such provisions. For calendar year ended December 31, 2008, the most significant amounts charged against gross revenues were for chargebacks in the amount of $1.46 billion and promotions and indirect rebates in the amount of $753.7 million. Gross profit for calendar year 2008 was $2.07 billion and gross margins were 40.3%. For calendar year 2007, gross profit was $1.11 billion and gross margins were 41.6%. Gross profit was impacted by certain purchase accounting related items recorded during calendar year 2008 of approximately $415.6 million, which consisted primarily of incremental amortization related to the purchased intangible assets and the amortization of the inventory step-up associated with the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business. In addition, gross profit is impacted by certain non-cash impairment charges of $65.7 million recorded during the calendar year ended December 31, 2008. Excluding these items, as well as the Bystolic revenue, gross margins would have been approximately 44.6%. Prior year gross profit is also impacted by similar purchase accounting related items recorded primarily with respect to the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business and the acquisition of Matrix in the 58 Table of Contents amount of $170.8 million. Excluding such items, gross margins in the prior year would have been approximately 48.0%. The decrease in gross margins, excluding the items noted above, can generally be attributed to the fact that, on average, the newly acquired former Merck Generics business, particularly in countries outside of the United States, contributes margins that are lower than those realized by Mylan U.S. subsidiaries. The impact of these lower margins was realized for a full twelve months in calendar year 2008 compared to only three months in calendar year 2007. Additionally, gross margin is impacted by the timing of significant product launches. Products generally contribute most significantly to gross margin at the time of their launch and even more so in periods of market exclusivity or limited generic competition. For a period of time during calendar year 2007, Mylan had exclusivity on both amlodipine and oxybutynin. In the calendar year 2008, Mylan had exclusivity on levetiracetam upon its launch of the product on November 4, 2008. Generics Segment For calendar year 2008, the Generics Segment reported total revenues of $4.29 billion compared to $2.56 billion in calendar year 2007. Total revenues from North America were $1.87 billion for calendar year 2008 compared to $1.68 billion for calendar year 2007, representing an increase of $195.3 million. Excluding revenue contributed from the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business from both periods, total North America revenues increased by $99.8 million or 6.2%. This increase is the result of new product revenue and favorable volume, as doses shipped during the twelve months, excluding the impact of the acquisition, increased by 6.6% to 16.7 billion, partially offset by unfavorable pricing. Fentanyl, Mylan AB-rated generic alternative to Duragesic , continued to contribute significantly to the financial results despite the entrance into the market of additional generic competition. As expected, the additional competition had an unfavorable impact on fentanyl pricing, and we expect that additional competition in the future could further impact pricing and market share. However, this was offset by increased volumes of fentanyl which Mylan was able to supply to the market as certain competitors experienced recall and supply issues. Additional generic competition resulted in unfavorable pricing on several other significant products in our portfolio. As is the case in the generic industry, the entrance into the market of additional competition generally has a negative impact on the volume and pricing of the affected products. For one product in particular, amlodipine, Mylan had market exclusivity for a portion of calendar year 2007. As a result, amlodipine accounted for approximately 7% of calendar year 2007 North American revenues (excluding the former Merck Generics business). Additional generic competition was especially heavy on amlodipine and, as a result, calendar year 2008 revenues were insignificant. In order to offset decreases in sales as a result of additional competition, generic pharmaceutical manufacturers must be able to successfully bring new products to market. Products launched in the U.S. during calendar year 2008 contributed revenues of $264.0 million, with paroxetine extended-release and levetiracetam accounting for the majority. Total revenues from EMEA were $1.64 billion for calendar year 2008 compared to $493.0 million for calendar year 2007. This increase is the result of a full year of revenues from the former Merck Generics business in 2008. Total revenues from Asia Pacific were $911.1 million for calendar year 2008 compared to $440.6 million for calendar year 2007. In 2008, $537.4 million of revenues were generated by the former Merck Generics business, compared to $170.9 million in 2007, which is the result of having a full year impact from the former Merck Generics business, compared to only three months post-acquisition in 2007. In 2008, Matrix revenues, included in Asia Pacific, totaled $334.0 million in total revenues, compared to $269.7 million during 2007. Matrix third-party net revenues are from the sale of both API and FDF ARV products. Matrix launched its FDF business in late calendar year 2007. In addition to its net revenue, Matrix realized other revenue of $44.9 million through intrasegment product development agreements. 59 Table of Contents Certain markets in which we do business have recently undergone, some for the first time, or will soon undergo, government-imposed price reductions or similar pricing pressures on pharmaceutical products. This is true in France and Australia, though this issue is not limited to solely these markets. In addition, a number of markets in which we operate have implemented or may implement tender systems for generic pharmaceuticals in an effort to lower prices. Such measures are likely to have a negative impact on sales and gross profit in these markets. However, some pro-generic government initiatives in certain markets could help to offset some of this unfavorability by potentially increasing generic substitution. Specialty Segment For calendar year 2008, the Specialty Segment reported total revenues of $417.2 million, of which $386.0 million represented sales to third-parties. For calendar year 2007, from the date of acquisition, the Specialty Segment reported total revenues of $105.5 million, of which $102.1 million represented sales to third-parties. The Specialty Segment consists of Dey, an entity acquired as part of the former Merck Generics business that focuses on the development, manufacturing and marketing of specialty pharmaceuticals in the respiratory and severe allergy markets. The most significant contributor to the Specialty Segment revenues is EpiPen Auto-injector, an epinephrine auto-injector, which is used in the treatment of severe allergies. EpiPen Auto-injector is the number one prescribed treatment for severe allergic reactions. Operating Expenses R&D expense for calendar year 2008 was $317.2 million compared to $182.9 million for calendar year 2007. Excluding R&D expense incurred by the former Merck Generics business for both years, R&D increased by $22.6 million or 16.3% primarily as a result of increased ANDA and other regulatory submissions, payments incurred with respect to product development agreements, and higher expenses associated with Matrix launch of its FDF franchise. During calendar year 2007, we recognized charges of $147.0 million to write-off acquired in-process R&D associated with the Matrix acquisition and $1.27 billion to write-off acquired in-process R&D associated with the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business. These amounts represent the fair value of purchased in-process technology for research projects that, as of the closing dates of the acquisitions, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. SG&A expense for calendar year 2008 was $1.05 billion compared to $512.4 million for the prior year, an increase of $541.1 million. Excluding SG&A expense incurred by the former Merck Generics business for both years, SG&A expense increased by $73.5 million or 20.5%. This increase was primarily realized by Corporate/Other and the Generics Segment. The increase in Corporate/Other SG&A expense is due primarily to an increase in professional and consulting fees as well as higher payroll and payroll related costs. The increase in professional and consulting fees is associated primarily with the ongoing integration of the former Merck Generics business. The increase in payroll and related costs is principally attributable to the build-up of additional corporate infrastructure as a direct result of the acquisition. The increase in SG&A in the Generics Segment is primarily due to costs incurred with respect to a restructuring of Matrix European distribution business, including the closure of several dormant entities. Litigation Settlements, net During calendar year 2008, we recorded net charges of $16.6 million related to the settlement of outstanding litigation. Of this amount, the majority relates to the awarding of attorneys fees in a patent infringement case in which Mylan was the defendant. Interest Expense Interest expense for calendar year 2008 totaled $380.8 million compared to $218.8 million for calendar year 2007. The increase is due to the additional debt incurred to finance the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business during the fourth quarter of calendar year 2007. 60 Table of Contents Other Income, net Other income, net, was $11.3 million for calendar year 2008, compared to $97.1 million in calendar year 2007. Calendar year 2007 included a $85.0 million non-cash mark-to-market unrealized gain on a deal-contingent foreign currency option contract that was entered into for the then pending acquisition of the former Merck Generics business, and a loss of $57.2 million on the early repayment of debt related to a tender offer made to holders of our Senior Notes and financing fees related to an interim term loan. Excluding these items, other income decreased in calendar year 2008 primarily due to lower interest and dividend income as a result of lower cash balances and available-for-sale securities. Income Tax Expense For calendar year 2008, income tax expense was $128.6 million as compared to $105.6 million for calendar year 2007. The effective tax rate in 2008 was largely influenced by the gain on the sale of Bystolic product rights and the non-deductible non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to Dey. The effective tax rate in the comparable twelve-month period was impacted by the write-off of acquired in-process research and development related to the Merck Generics acquisition and the acquisition of the controlling interest in Matrix. Transition Period Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Nine-Month Period Ended December 31, 2006 As noted above, transition period refers to the nine-month period from April 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007. In the discussion that follows, comparable nine-month period or prior period refers to the nine-month period from April 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. Total Revenues and Gross Profit For the transition period, Mylan reported total revenues of $2.18 billion compared to $1.12 billion in the comparable nine-month period. This represents an increase of $1.05 billion or 94%. The acquisition of the former Merck Generics business contributed revenues of $700.6 million, of which $598.5 million are included in the Generics Segment and $102.1 million are included in the Specialty Segment. Matrix contributed revenues of $264.2 million, all of which are included in the Generics Segment, and are incremental in the period ended December 31, 2007. The remaining increase is primarily due to growth in Mylan historical business. Other revenue for the transition period was $15.8 million compared to $21.3 million in the comparable nine-month period. The decrease is primarily the result of the recognition, in the prior period, of previously deferred amounts related to the sale of Apokyn , which was fully recognized by December 31, 2006. In arriving at net revenues, gross revenues are reduced by provisions for estimates, including discounts, customer performance and promotions, price adjustments, returns and chargebacks. See the section titled Application of Critical Accounting Policies in this Item 7, for a thorough discussion of our methodology with respect to such provisions. For the transition period, the most significant amounts charged against gross revenues were for chargebacks in the amount of $1.01 billion and customer performance and promotions in the amount of $199.7 million. For the comparable nine-month period, chargebacks of $893.3 million and customer performance and promotions of $122.9 million were charged against gross revenues. Customer performance and promotions include direct rebates as well as promotional programs. Gross profit for the transition period was $874.4 million and gross margins were 40.1%. Gross profit is impacted by certain purchase accounting related items recorded during the nine months ended December 31, 2007 of approximately $148.9 million, which consisted primarily of incremental amortization related to purchased intangible assets and the amortization of the inventory step-up associated with the acquisition of both the former Merck Generics business and Matrix. Excluding such items, gross margins were 47.0% compared to 54.1% for the nine months ended December 31, 2006. A significant portion of gross profit in the transition period, excluding amounts related to the acquisitions of the former Merck Generics business and Matrix, was comprised of fentanyl and new products, including amlodipine. Products generally contribute most significantly to gross margin at the time of their launch and 61 Table of Contents even more so in periods of market exclusivity or limited generic competition. As a result of multiple market entrants shortly after Mylan launch of amlodipine, Mylan did not realize all of the benefits of market exclusivity (less than 180 days) with respect to this product. As it relates to fentanyl, additional competitors entered the market during the current period which had a negative impact on pricing and volume. Additionally, the companies acquired during the period have lower overall gross margins, and, as such, Mylan consolidated gross margin was also unfavorably impacted by this incremental revenue and gross profit. Generics Segment For the transition period, the Generics Segment reported total revenues of $2.08 billion. Revenues from North America were $1.27 billion for the transition period compared to $1.12 billion for the comparable nine-month period, representing an increase of $143.8 million or 13%. Of this increase, $54.4 million is the result of the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, total North America revenues increased by $89.4 million or 8%. This increase is the result of new products and favorable volume, partially offset by unfavorable pricing. Products launched subsequent to December 31, 2006, contributed net revenues of $156.5 million, the majority of which was amlodipine. Fentanyl, Mylan AB-rated generic alternative to Duragesic, continued to contribute significantly to the financial results, accounting for nearly 10% of Generics Segment net revenues despite the entrance into the market of additional generic competition in August 2007. As expected, the additional competition had an unfavorable impact on fentanyl pricing. Additional generic competition, as well as the impact of continued consolidation among retail customers, negatively impacted pricing on other products in our portfolio. As is the case in the generic industry, the entrance into the market of additional competition generally has a negative impact on the volume and pricing of the affected products. Doses shipped during the transition period, excluding the impact of acquisitions, increased by over 15% to 11.8 billion. Revenues from EMEA were $460.9 million for the transition period, the majority of which was the result of the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business. Also included within EMEA for the transition period are revenues from the distribution of branded generic products in Europe through a wholly-owned subsidiary of Matrix. Revenues from Asia Pacific were $376.9 million for the transition period, $170.9 million of which were the result of the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business and $206.0 million of which were the result of the acquisition of Matrix. Specialty Segment For the transition period, the Specialty Segment reported total third-party revenues of $102.1 million. The Specialty Segment consists primarily of Dey, an entity acquired as part of the former Merck Generics business acquisition that focuses on the development, manufacturing and marketing of specialty pharmaceuticals in the respiratory and severe allergy markets. The majority of the Specialty Segment revenues are derived from two products; DuoNeb and EpiPen Auto-injector. DuoNeb is a nebulized unit dose formulation of ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate for treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. DuoNeb lost exclusivity in July 2007, at which time generic competition entered the market. The impact on sales of the generic competition was not as significant as expected during the transition period, however, sales did subsequently decline significantly as a result of the additional competition. EpiPen Auto-injector, which is used in the treatment of severe allergies, is an epinephrine auto-injector. EpiPen Auto-injector is the number one prescribed treatment for severe allergic reactions. Prescriptions for EpiPen Auto-injector have continued to grow and during the quarter ended December 31, 2007, have reached the highest prescription volume in the history of the brand. 62 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Research and development expense for the transition period was $146.1 million compared to $66.8 million in the comparable nine-month period. Transition period R&D includes approximately $71.2 million related to newly acquired entities, all of which was incremental to the comparable nine-month period. Excluding these amounts, R&D expense increased by $8.1 million or 12% as a result of increased clinical studies and higher R&D headcount related to a higher level of ANDA submission activity. Additionally, during the nine months ended December 31, 2007, we recognized a charge of $1.27 billion to write-off acquired in-process R&D associated with the former Merck Generics business acquisition. This amount represents the fair value of purchased in-process technology for research projects that, as of the closing date of the acquisition, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The acquisition of the former Merck Generics business and Matrix added $201.8 million of incremental selling, general and administrative expense to the current period. Excluding this amount, SG&A expense increased by $95.1 million or 62% to $247.8 million compared to $152.8 million in the comparable nine-month period. The majority of this increase was realized by Corporate/Other. The increase in Corporate/Other SG&A expense is due to an increase of approximately $60.0 million in both professional and consulting fees and payroll and related expenses, with the remainder due primarily to higher temporary services and depreciation. The increase in professional and consulting fees and temporary services is associated primarily with the integration of the former Merck Generics business. The increase in payroll and related costs is principally attributable to the build-up of additional corporate infrastructure as a direct result of the former Merck Generics business acquisition. Litigation, net Litigation settlements, net, in the transition period yielded income of $2.0 million compared to income of $46.2 million in the comparable nine-month period. These amounts are both due to the favorable settlement of outstanding litigation in the respective periods. Interest Expense Interest expense for the transition period totaled $196.3 million compared to $31.3 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2006. The increase is due to the additional debt incurred to finance the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion. Other Income, net Other income, net was income of $86.6 million in the transition period compared to $39.8 million in the comparable nine-month period. The most significant items in the current period are net foreign exchange gains consisting mainly of $85.0 million on a contract related to the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business and a loss of $57.2 million on the early repayment of certain debt and expensing certain financing fees, with the remainder of the other income attributable to interest and dividends. As the purpose of the foreign currency option contract was to mitigate exchange rate risk on the Euro-denominated purchase price, the settlement of this contract was included in current earnings. The $57.2 million loss relates to a tender offer made to holders of our Senior Notes and financing fees related to the Interim Term Loan. As part of its strategy to establish a new global capital structure related to the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business, Mylan refinanced its debt, including making a tender offer to holders of its Senior Notes. Included as part of this tender was a premium to holders of the Senior Notes in the amount of $30.8 million. In addition to this premium, approximately $12.1 million of deferred financing fees were written off and approximately $14.3 million for financing fees related to the Interim Term Loan were incurred. In the comparable nine-month period, we recorded a net gain of $17.5 million related to a foreign currency forward contract for the acquisition of Matrix. The remainder of the net other income realized in the prior period is the result of interest and dividend income and a $5.0 million payment received from an investee accounted for using the equity method in excess of its carrying amount. 63 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense Our provision for income taxes was $53.4 million in the nine-month period ending December 31, 2007 as compared to $155.3 million in the nine-month period ending December 31, 2006. The decrease in tax expense is attributable to a reduction in operating income, before the acquired in-process R&D charge, of $255.9 million. The effective tax rate was impacted by the $1.27 billion non-deductible charge related to in-process R&D acquired as part of the Merck transaction. The effective tax rate in 2007 was (4.9%) as compared to 35.0% for the comparable nine-month period in 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations, which were $605.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Included in this amount was a net after-tax cash outflow of approximately $52.0 million related to the settlement of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice discussed above. We believe that cash provided by operating activities will continue to allow us to meet our needs for working capital, capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on debt obligations, dividend payments and other cash needs over the next several years. Nevertheless, our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements and debt service obligations, or fund planned capital expenditures, will substantially depend upon our future operating performance (which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions), and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. We prepare our statement of cash flows using the indirect method. Under this method, we reconcile net income to cash flows from operating activities by adjusted net income for those items that impact net income but may not result in actual cash receipts or payments during the period. These reconciling items include depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, changes in estimated sales allowances, litigation settlements and changes in the consolidated balance sheet for working capital from the beginning to the end of the period. Working capital at December 31, 2009 was $1.57 billion compared to $1.63 billion at December 31, 2008, a decrease of $6.0 million, which includes the effect of foreign exchange. Excluding foreign exchange translation, increased working capital requirements during 2009 had an unfavorable impact on operating cash flows. This is due mainly to payments made for income taxes, and increased accounts receivable, primarily due to the timing of cash collections and the level of sales near the end of the period. In the prior year, working capital requirements also negatively impacted cash from operations, with increases in accounts receivable and inventory partially offset by increases in both accounts payable and accrued taxes payable. Cash used in investing activities was $335.0 million for calendar year 2009, driven primarily by cash paid for acquisitions and capital expenditures. Cash paid for acquisitions was $187.4 million, net, consisting primarily of a cash outflow of approximately $182.2 million related to the acquisition of the remaining interest of Matrix. During 2009, several other transactions were completed including the sale of a 50% interest in a joint venture, the purchase of the remaining 50% interest in a separate joint venture in which Matrix previously held a 50% stake, the sale of a majority-owned subsidiary by Matrix to the minority owner and the purchase of an API facility in India. These transactions resulted in a net cash outflow of $5.3 million. Capital expenditures were $154.4 million, and were made primarily for equipment, including a portion related to our previously announced planned expansions and integration plans surrounding the former Merck Generics business. Capital expenditures for 2010 are expected to increase to approximately $250.0 million. Cash used in financing activities was $454.4 million for calendar year 2009. During 2009, we made repayments on our long-term debt in the amount of $350.0 million, consisting primarily of prepayments on Senior Credit Agreement amounts due in 2010 and 2011. Additionally, we paid cash dividends of $139.0 million on our 6.5% mandatory convertible preferred stock. We are involved in various legal proceedings that are considered normal to its business. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of such proceedings, an adverse outcome in any of these proceedings could materially affect 64 Table of Contents our financial position and results of operations. Additionally, for certain contingencies assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business, Merck KGaA, the seller, has indemnified Mylan under the provisions of the Share Purchase Agreement. The inability or denial of Merck KGaA to pay on an indemnified claim, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2009 includes restructuring reserves of $39.3 million. Spending against this balance, which consists primarily of severance and related costs and costs associated with the previously announced rationalization and optimization of our global manufacturing and research and development platforms, is expected to occur over the next one to two years, with the majority in 2010. On May 7, 2009, at the annual shareholders meeting, our shareholders approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of Mylan common stock from 600,000,000 to 1,500,000,000. In addition, the shareholders approved an increase in shares that may be issued under our 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan as restricted shares, restricted units, performance shares and other stock-based awards from 5,000,000 to 8,000,000. During and subsequent to 2009, we declared quarterly dividends on our preferred stock of $16.25, based on the annual dividend rate of 6.5% and a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, as follows: To Holders of Preferred Stock of Date Declared: Date Payable: Record As of: January 29, 2009 February 17, 2009 February 1, 2009 April 16, 2009 May 15, 2009 May 1, 2009 July 20, 2009 August 17, 2009 August 1, 2009 October 20, 2009 November 16, 2009 November 1, 2009 January 10, 2010 February 16, 2010 February 1, 2010 Total dividends declared and paid during calendar year 2009 were $139.0 million. We are actively pursuing, and are currently involved in, joint projects related to the development, distribution and marketing of both generic and branded products. Many of these arrangements provide for payments by us upon the attainment of specified milestones. While these arrangements help to reduce the financial risk for unsuccessful projects, fulfillment of specified milestones or the occurrence of other obligations may result in fluctuations in cash flows. We are continuously evaluating the potential acquisition of products, as well as companies, as a strategic part of its future growth. Consequently, we may utilize current cash reserves or incur additional indebtedness to finance any such acquisitions, which could impact future liquidity. In addition, on an ongoing basis, we review our operations including the evaluation of potential divestitures of products and businesses as part of our future strategy. Any divestitures could impact future liquidity. At December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, we had $77.5 million and $83.6 million outstanding under existing letters of credit. Additionally, as of December 31, 2009, we had $44.3 million available under the $100.0 million subfacility on our Senior Credit Agreement for the issuance of letters of credit. 65 Table of Contents Mandatory minimum repayments remaining on the outstanding borrowings under the term loans and convertible notes at December 31, 2009, excluding the discounts and conversion features, are as follows for each of the periods ending December 31: U.S. Euro U.S. Euro Senior Cash Tranche A Tranche A Tranche B Tranche B Convertible Convertible Term Loans Term Loans Term Loans Term Loans Notes Notes Total (In thousands) 2010 $ $ $ $ $ $ $ 2011 2012 78,125 126,149 25,560 7,560 600,000 837,394 2013 78,125 126,149 25,560 7,560 237,394 2014 2,402,640 710,640 3,113,280 2015 575,000 575,000 Total $ 156,250 $ 252,298 $ 2,453,760 $ 725,760 $ 600,000 $ 575,000 $ 4,763,068 The Senior Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants for facilities of this type, including covenants pertaining to the delivery of financial statements, notices of default and certain other information, maintenance of business and insurance, collateral matters and compliance with laws, as well as customary negative covenants for facilities of this type, including limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness and liens, mergers and certain other fundamental changes, investments and loans, acquisitions, transactions with affiliates, dispositions of assets, payments of dividends and other restricted payments, prepayments or amendments to the terms of specified indebtedness (including the Interim Credit Agreement described below) and changes in lines of business. The Senior Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring maintenance of a minimum interest coverage ratio and a senior leverage ratio, both of which are defined within the agreement. We have been compliant with the financial covenants during the calendar year ended December 31, 2009. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2009 and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Less than One-Three Three-Five Total One Year Years Years Thereafter (in thousands) Operating leases $ 157,849 $ 30,334 $ 41,877 $ 22,466 $ 63,172 Total debt 4,780,506 6,348 845,884 3,353,092 575,182 Scheduled interest payments 709,950 159,092 310,026 219,263 21,569 Preferred dividends 139,035 139,035 $ 5,787,340 $ 334,809 $ 1,197,787 $ 3,594,821 $ 659,923 The chart above does not include short-term borrowings held by Matrix in the amount of approximately $184.3 million, which represent working capital facilities with several banks, which are secured first by Matrix current assets and second by Matrix property, plant and equipment and carry interest rates of 4.0%-14.5%. Additionally, due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority. As such, $237.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. We lease certain property under various operating lease arrangements that expire generally over the next five years. These leases generally provide us with the option to renew the lease at the end of the lease term. Total debt consists of the U.S. Tranche A Term Loans of $156.3 million, the Euro Tranche A Term Loans of 175.2 ($252.3) million, the U.S. Tranche B Term Loans of $2.45 billion, the Euro Tranche B Term Loans of 504.0 66 Table of Contents ($725.8) million, $600.0 million in the nominal value of the Senior Convertible Notes, $575.0 million in the nominal value of the Cash Convertible Notes and $17.4 million of other miscellaneous debt. At December 31, 2009, the $847.1 million of debt related to the Cash Convertible Notes reported in our financial statements consists of $436.5 million of debt ($575.0 million face amount, net of $138.5 million discount) and a liability with a fair value of $410.6 million related to the bifurcated conversion feature. As of December 31, 2009, the $575.0 million of Cash Convertible Notes was currently convertible. Although the Company experience is that convertible debentures are not normally converted by investors until close to their maturity date, it is possible that debentures could be converted prior to their maturity date if, for example, a holder perceives the market for the debentures to be weaker than the market for the common stock. Upon an investor election to convert, the Company is required to pay the full conversion value in cash. Any payment above the principal amount is matched by a convertible note hedge as described below. Should holders elect to convert, the Company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund any principal payments. The facility is an unsecured revolving credit agreement expiring in October 2013, with available capacity of $694.3 million at December 31, 2009. Scheduled interest payments represent the estimated interest payments on the U.S. Tranche A Term Loans, the Euro Tranche A Term Loans, the U.S. Tranche B Term Loans, the Euro Tranche B Term Loans, the Senior Convertible Notes, the Cash Convertible Notes and other debt. Variable debt interest payments are estimated using current interest rates. We have entered into various product licensing and development agreements. In some of these arrangements, we provide funding for the development of the product or to obtain rights to the use of the patent, through milestone payments, in exchange for marketing and distribution rights to the product. Milestones represent the completion of specific contractual events, and it is uncertain if and when these milestones will be achieved, hence, we have not attempted to predict the period in which such milestones would possibly be incurred. In the event that all projects are successful, milestone and development payments of approximately $33.8 million would be paid subsequent to December 31, 2009. The Company has entered into an exclusive collaboration on the development, manufacturing, supply and commercialization of multiple, high value generic biologic compounds for the global marketplace. Mylan has committed to provide funding related to the collaboration over the next several years and amounts could be substantial. Additionally, we have entered into product development agreements under which we have agreed to share in the development costs as they are incurred by our partners. As the timing of cash expenditures is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, it is difficult to forecast the amount of payments to be made over the next few years, which could be significant. We periodically enter into licensing agreements with other pharmaceutical companies for the manufacture, marketing and/or sale of pharmaceutical products. These agreements generally call for us to pay a percentage of amounts earned from the sale of the product as a royalty. The Company sponsors various defined benefit pension plans in several countries. Benefit formulas are based on varying criteria on a plan by plan basis. The Company funds non-domestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans, which typically results in these plans being unfunded. The amount accrued related to these benefits was $50.9 million at December 31, 2009. We are unable to determine when these amounts will require payment as the timing of cash expenditures is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control We have entered into employment and other agreements with certain executives and other employees that provide for compensation and certain other benefits. These agreements provide for severance payments under certain circumstances. 67 Table of Contents Impact of Currency Fluctuations and Inflation Because Mylan results are reported in U.S. Dollars, changes in the rate of exchange between the U.S. Dollar and the local currencies in the markets in which Mylan operates, mainly the Euro, Australian Dollar, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, and Pound Sterling, affect Mylan results. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). Included within these policies are certain policies which contain critical accounting estimates and, therefore, have been deemed to be critical accounting policies. Critical accounting estimates are those which require management to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and for which the use of different estimates, which reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. The Company has identified the following to be its critical accounting policies: the determination of net revenue provisions, intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes, and the impact of existing legal matters. Net Revenue Provisions Net revenues are recognized for product sales when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and when provisions for estimates, including discounts, rebates, promotional adjustments, price adjustments, returns, chargebacks and other potential adjustments are reasonably determinable. Accruals for these provisions are presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements as reductions in determining net revenues and in accounts receivable and other current liabilities. Accounts receivable are presented net of allowances relating to these provisions, which were $607.9 million and $496.5 million at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. Other current liabilities include $238.2 million and $238.9 million at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, for certain rebates and other adjustments that are paid to indirect customers. The following is a rollforward of the most significant provisions for estimated sales allowances during calendar year 2009: Current Provision Checks/Credits Related to Sales Effects of Balance at Issued to Third Made in the Foreign Balance at 12/31/2008 Parties Current Period Exchange 12/31/2009 (in thousands) Chargebacks $ 173,213 $ (1,824,957 ) $ 1,894,090 $ 376 $ 242,722 Promotions and indirect rebates $ 330,832 $ (1,028,135 ) $ 1,081,590 $ 15,246 $ 399,533 Returns $ 81,295 $ (66,408 ) $ 73,160 $ 1,684 $ 89,731 The accrual for chargebacks increased as a result of numerous factors including the addition of accruals for significant new products launched during the year and a shift in product mix in the U.S. to products with high volume sales and high chargeback rates. Provisions for estimated discounts, rebates, promotional and other credits require a lower degree of subjectivity and are less complex in nature yet, combined, represent a significant portion of the overall provisions. These provisions are estimated based on historical payment experience, historical relationships to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels and contract terms. Such provisions are determinable due to the limited number of assumptions and consistency of historical experience. Others, such as returns and chargebacks, require management to make more subjective judgments and evaluate current market conditions. These provisions are discussed in further detail below. Returns Consistent with industry practice, we maintain a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date. Although application of the policy varies from country to country in accordance with local practices, generally, product may be returned for a period beginning six months prior to its expiration date to up to one year after its expiration date. The majority of our product returns occur as a result of product dating, which falls within the range set by our policy, and are settled 68 Table of Contents through the issuance of a credit to our customer. Although the introduction of additional generic competition does not give our customers the right to return product outside of our established policy, we do recognize that such competition could ultimately lead to increased returns. We analyze this on a case-by-case basis, when significant, and make adjustments to increase our reserve for product returns as necessary. Our estimate of the provision for returns is based upon our historical experience with actual returns, which is applied to the level of sales for the period that corresponds to the period during which our customers may return product. This period is known by us based on the shelf lives of our products at the time of shipment. Additionally, we consider factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel, product dating, and expiration period, size and maturity of the market prior to a product launch, entrance into the market of additional generic competition, changes in formularies or launch of over-the-counter products, and make adjustments to the provision for returns in the event that it appears that actual product returns may differ from our established reserves. We obtain data with respect to the level of inventory in the channel directly from certain of our largest customers. A change of 5% in the estimated product return rate used in our calculation of our return reserve would have an effect on our reserve balance of approximately $4.5 million. Chargebacks The provision for chargebacks is the most significant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue. The Company markets products directly to wholesalers, distributors, retail pharmacy chains, mail order pharmacies and group purchasing organizations. The Company also markets products indirectly to independent pharmacies, managed care organizations, hospitals, nursing homes and pharmacy benefit management companies, collectively referred to as indirect customers. Mylan enters into agreements with its indirect customers to establish contract pricing for certain products. The indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to actually purchase the products at these contracted prices. Alternatively, certain wholesalers may enter into agreements with indirect customers that establish contract pricing for certain products, which the wholesalers provide. Under either arrangement, Mylan will provide credit to the wholesaler for any difference between the contracted price with the indirect party and the wholesaler invoice price. Such credit is called a chargeback, while the difference between the contracted price and the wholesaler invoice price is referred to as the chargeback rate. The provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through levels by our wholesaler customers to indirect customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels. For the latter, in most cases, inventory levels are obtained directly from certain of our largest wholesalers. Additionally, internal estimates are prepared based upon historical buying patterns and estimated end-user demand. Such information allows us to estimate the potential chargeback that we may ultimately owe to our customers given the quantity of inventory on hand. We continually monitor our provision for chargebacks and evaluate our reserve and estimates as additional information becomes available. A change of 5% in the estimated sell-through levels by our wholesaler customers and in the estimated wholesaler inventory levels would have an effect on our reserve balance of approximately $12.0 million. While we do not anticipate any significant changes to the methodologies that we use to measure chargebacks, customer performance and promotions or returns, the balances within these reserves can fluctuate significantly through the consistent application of our methodologies. Historically, we have not recorded in any current period any material amounts related to adjustments made to prior period reserves. Should any material amounts from any prior period be recorded in any current period such amounts will be disclosed. Intangible Assets and Goodwill We account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values. The cost to acquire a business has been allocated to the underlying net assets of the acquired business based on estimates of their respective fair values. Amounts allocated to acquired in-process research and development ( IPR&D ) had been expensed at the date of acquisition, but will be capitalized going forward. Intangible assets are amortized over the expected life of the asset. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations. Fair values and useful lives are determined based on, among other factors, the expected future period of benefit of the asset, the various characteristics of the asset and projected cash flows. Because this process involves management making estimates 69 Table of Contents with respect to future sales volumes, pricing, new product launches, anticipated cost environment and overall market conditions and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, these estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates. Goodwill and intangible assets, including IPR&D, are reviewed for impairment annually or when events or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles is determined to exist when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the net assets being tested. Impairment of definite-lived intangibles is determined to exist when undiscounted cash flows related to the assets are less than the carrying value of the assets being tested. Future events and decisions may lead to asset impairment and/or related costs. As discussed above with respect to determining an asset fair value and useful life, because this process involves management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, these estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates. The Company will continue to assess the carrying value of its goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. Income Taxes We compute our income taxes based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to the Company in the various jurisdictions in which we earn income. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company income taxes and in evaluating its tax positions. We establish reserves in accordance with Mylan policy regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The Company policy provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position be recognized in the Company financial statements, only if the position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the settlement of a tax audit. The Company provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to the Company provision for income taxes in the period of resolution. The Company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. When assessing the need for valuation allowances, the Company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, the Company would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or charge to income taxes. The resolution of tax reserves and changes in valuation allowances could be material to the Company results of operations or financial position. A variance of 5% between estimated reserves and actual resolution and realization of tax items would have an effect on our reserve balance of approximately $20.0 million. Legal Matters The Company is involved in various legal proceedings, some of which involve claims for substantial amounts. An estimate is made to accrue for a loss contingency relating to any of these legal proceedings if it is probable that a liability was incurred as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Because of the subjective nature inherent in assessing the outcome of litigation and because of the potential that an adverse outcome in a legal proceeding could have a material adverse effect on the Company financial position or results of operations, such estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates. A variance of 5% between estimated and recorded litigation reserves (excluding indemnified claims) and actual resolution of certain legal matters would have an effect on our litigation reserve balance of approximately $10.0 million. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2008, the FASB issued guidance about accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement), which was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2009. 70 Table of Contents Under the new rules, for convertible debt instruments (including the Company Senior Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion, entities now separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer economic interest cost. The effect of the new rules, as they apply to the Company Senior Convertible Notes, is that the equity component is included in the additional paid-in capital section of shareholders equity on the Company consolidated balance sheet and the value of the equity component is treated as an original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component. Higher interest expense results through the accretion of the discounted carrying value of the Senior Convertible Notes to their face amount over their term. This update requires retrospective application as disclosed below. In December 2007, the FASB issued guidance regarding noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements, which was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2009. This update amends previously issued guidance, to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This standard defines a noncontrolling interest, sometimes called a minority interest, as the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. This update requires, among other items, that a noncontrolling interest be included in the consolidated balance sheet within equity separate from the parent equity; consolidated net income to be reported at amounts inclusive of both the parent and noncontrolling interest shares and, separately, the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and noncontrolling interest all on the consolidated statement of operations; and if a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary be measured at fair value and a gain or loss be recognized in net income based on such fair value. The Company Consolidated Statements of Operations for the calendar year ended December 31, 2008 and the nine months ended December 31, 2007, as originally reported and as adjusted for the adoption of the aforementioned updates related to convertible debt instruments and noncontrolling interests, are as follows: Calendar Year Ended Nine Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2008 2008 2007 2007 (in thousands, except per share amounts) As Adjusted As Adjusted Interest expense $ 357,045 $ 380,779 $ 179,410 $ 196,335 Loss before income taxes and noncontrolling interest (47,823 ) (71,557 ) (1,081,064 ) (1,097,989 ) Income tax provision 137,423 128,550 60,073 53,413 Net loss (185,246 ) (200,107 ) (1,141,137 ) (1,151,402 ) Net loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest 4,031 4,031 3,112 3,112 Net loss attributable to Mylan Inc. common shareholders (320,250 ) (335,111 ) (1,154,024 ) (1,164,289 ) Loss per common share attributable to Mylan Inc.: Basic $ (1.05 ) $ (1.10 ) $ (4.49 ) $ (4.53 ) Diluted $ (1.05 ) $ (1.10 ) $ (4.49 ) $ (4.53 ) Weighted average common shares outstanding: Basic 304,360 304,360 257,150 257,150 Diluted 304,360 304,360 257,150 257,150 71 Table of Contents The Company Consolidated Balance Sheet, as originally reported and as adjusted for the adoption of the aforementioned updates related to convertible debt instruments and non controlling interests, is as follows: December 31, 2008 December 31, 2008 (in thousands) As Adjusted Liabilities and equity Liabilities Long-term debt $ 5,165,419 $ 5,078,937 Deferred income tax liability 545,121 577,379 Total liabilities 7,677,242 7,623,018 Minority interest 29,108 Equity Mylan Inc. shareholders equity Additional paid-in capital 3,873,743 3,955,725 Retained earnings 594,352 566,594 Noncontrolling interest 29,108 Total equity 2,703,509 2,786,841 In October 2009, the FASB issued revised accounting guidance for multiple-deliverable arrangements. The amendment requires that arrangement considerations be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method and provides for expanded disclosures related to such arrangements. It is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 72 Table of Contents
