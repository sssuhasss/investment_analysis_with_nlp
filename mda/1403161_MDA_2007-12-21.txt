ITEM 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview This management discussion and analysis covers fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, and provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of Visa U.S.A. Inc. and its subsidiaries and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Prior to the closing of the global reorganization in October 2007, Visa U.S.A. along with Visa International (comprising the operating regions of AP, LAC and CEMEA), Visa Canada and Visa Europe operated as one of five entities related by ownership and membership to Visa. After the reorganization, Visa U.S.A., Visa International and Visa Canada became subsidiaries of Visa Inc., a Delaware stock corporation. Visa U.S.A. is a leader in the electronic payments industry in the United States and is responsible for administering Visa payment programs in the United States. Visa U.S.A. provides products and services over a secure payments network to support payment programs offered by its member financial institutions to their consumer, commercial and merchant customers. Visa U.S.A. principal product platforms include consumer credit, consumer debit and cash access, prepaid and commercial programs. Visa U.S.A. primary customers are its member financial institutions participating in the payments network. Prior to the reorganization, Visa U.S.A. was a regional group member of Visa International and operated as a non-stock corporation with approximately 13,300 member financial institutions. Visa U.S.A. achieved 22% growth in operating revenues in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. This growth reflects a 10% increase in payments volume (as defined below) on Visa U.S.A. products for the fiscal year, with double-digit payments volume growth in commercial and consumer debit products, and an 11% increase in the number of transactions. Payments volume, which is the basis for service fees, and transactions, which drive data processing fees, are key drivers for Visa U.S.A. business. Payments volume is defined as the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased with Visa products, including PIN-based debit volume, and excluding cash disbursements obtained with Visa-branded cards, balance transfers and convenience checks, which Visa U.S.A. refers to as cash volume. Operating revenues increased at a higher rate than underlying payments volume growth primarily due to two new acceptance fees, which are included in service fees, introduced in April 2007. The two new fees include a debit acceptance fee on debit payments volume and a credit/commercial acceptance fee on all consumer credit and commercial payments volume. These fees supersede previously existing issuer programs used to support merchant acceptance and volume growth initiatives. These changes are designed to simplify the fee structure and improve overall program efficiencies for Visa U.S.A. and its issuers while continuing to support Visa U.S.A. acceptance growth initiatives. While Visa U.S.A. believes that these fee changes will generate ongoing benefits, Visa U.S.A. does not believe that the rate of growth in operating revenues during fiscal 2007 is representative of sustainable future revenue growth because it includes the impact in 2007 of the new service fees introduced in the second half of fiscal 2007. Growth in operating revenues was also attributable to adjustments from Visa U.S.A. estimates of performance for volume and support incentive agreements as part of its regular quarterly review of these agreements. Visa U.S.A. incurred an operating loss in fiscal 2007 as a result of recording a litigation provision of $2.7 billion, of which $1.9 billion was recorded in connection with the settlement of outstanding litigation with American Express. Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International entered into an agreement with American Express that became effective on November 9, 2007, to resolve all current litigation between American Express and Visa U.S.A. and Visa International, and the related litigation between American Express and five co-defendant banks. Under the settlement agreement, an initial payment of $1.13 billion will be made on or before March 31, 2008, including $945 million from Visa Inc. and $185 million from the five co-defendant banks. Beginning March 31, 2008, Visa Inc. will 72 Table of Contents pay American Express an additional amount of up to $70 million per quarter for 16 quarters, for a maximum total of $1.12 billion. Total future payments discounted at 4.72% over the payment term, or $1.9 billion, are reflected in the litigation provision on Visa U.S.A. consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2007 and in current and long-term accrued litigation on its consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2007. Visa U.S.A. intends to fund its payment obligations under the American Express settlement with amounts in the escrow account, in accordance with the retrospective responsibility plan. The remainder of the $2.7 billion litigation provision includes management liability estimate under the guidelines of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies , related to the Discover litigation, and various other litigation provisions for both settled and unsettled matters. See Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 20 Legal Matters to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. The effect of these litigation provisions on Visa U.S.A. earnings was partially offset by the impacts of the introduction of new service fees during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and the absence of substantial charges incurred in the prior year related to customer reimbursement for costs associated with Visa U.S.A. holographic magnetic card, impairment charges related to Visa U.S.A. Mini Card license and business expenses related to a 2006 litigation settlement. See Operating Revenues Service Fees and Operating Expenses Administrative and Other. In November 2006, Visa U.S.A. announced plans to outsource certain data processing and development support functions over the course of fiscal 2007. This action was intended to help Visa U.S.A. better align personnel and contract staffing levels with fluctuating project demand. As a result of this strategy, Visa U.S.A. reduced its total number of employees by approximately 5% of Visa U.S.A. total workforce at December 31, 2006. Visa U.S.A. incurred severance and related personnel costs of approximately $13 million during fiscal 2007 associated with this program. Approximately $1 million in additional charges are expected in fiscal 2008, based upon current assumptions for the timing of employee terminations. Although Visa U.S.A. believes that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of its plan, actual results may differ, thereby requiring Visa U.S.A. to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions. At September 30, 2007, the related liability in accrued compensation and benefits was $2 million. In August 2007, Visa U.S.A. completed the purchase of a parcel of land on the east coast of the United States and commenced construction of a new data center. The new data center is intended to support Visa U.S.A. technology objectives related to reliability, scalability, security and innovation. Visa U.S.A. anticipates that the data center will be completed in 2010 at an estimated total cost of $397 million. See Liquidity and Capital Resources . Results of Operations Operating Revenues Visa U.S.A. operating revenues consist of gross operating revenues reduced by payments made to customers and merchants under volume and support incentive arrangements. Gross operating revenues consist of service fees, data processing fees, international transaction fees and other revenues. Visa U.S.A. operating revenues are based upon aggregate payments volume reported by its members and transactional information accumulated by its transaction processing systems. Visa U.S.A. operating revenues are primarily generated from fees calculated on the payments volume of activity on Visa-branded cards, which Visa U.S.A. refers to as service fees, and from the fees charged for providing transaction processing, which Visa U.S.A. refers to as data processing fees. Pricing varies and may be modified on a customer-by-customer basis through volume and support incentive arrangements. Service fees and data processing fees combined represent 82%, 81% and 81% of Visa U.S.A. gross operating revenues in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Visa U.S.A. does not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest and fees paid by cardholders on Visa-branded cards. Issuing customers have the responsibility for issuing cards and determining 73 Table of Contents interest rates and fees paid by consumers and commercial establishments, and most other competitive card features. Nor does Visa U.S.A. earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for card acceptance, including the merchant discount rate. Acquiring customers, which are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, establish and earn these fees. Service Fees Service fees primarily reflect payments by customers for their participation in card programs carrying marks of the Visa brand. Current quarter service fees are assessed using a calculation of pricing applied to prior quarter payments volume as reported on customer quarterly operating certificates, exclusive of PIN-based debit volume. These payments volumes also do not include cash disbursements obtained with Visa-branded cards, balance transfers or convenience checks. Also included in service fees are acceptance fees which are used to support merchant acceptance and ongoing volume growth initiatives. Two new acceptance fees were introduced in April 2007, which apply to all consumer debit payments volume and all consumer credit and commercial payments volume. These fees supersede previously existing issuer programs. Prior period revenues associated with previously existing issuer fees have been reclassified from other revenues to this category for comparative purposes in Visa U.S.A. consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. Data Processing Fees Visa U.S.A. operates a proprietary network, VisaNet, a proprietary, secure, centralized processing platform which provides transaction processing and other payment services linking issuers and acquirers. Processing services are provided through Visa U.S.A. majority-owned subsidiary, Inovant, which operates VisaNet. Visa U.S.A. also provides processing services to Visa International, Visa Canada and Visa Europe, in accordance with service agreements with these entities. Data processing fees are based on information Visa U.S.A. accumulates from VisaNet. Data processing fees are recognized as revenue in the same period the related transaction occurs or services are rendered. Data processing fees are primarily driven by the number and type of transactions and represent fees for processing transactions that facilitate the following services: Authorization . Fees to route authorization requests to the issuer when a merchant, through its acquirer, requests approval of a cardholder transaction; Clearing and settlement. Fees for determining and transferring transaction amounts due between acquirers and issuers; Single Message System, or SMS, switching. Fees for use of the SMS for determining and transferring debit transaction amounts due between acquirers and issuers; Member processing . Fees for use of the Debit Processing Service, which provides processing and support for Visa debit products and services; Processing guarantee . Fees charged for network operations and maintenance necessary for ongoing system availability; and Other products and services. Fees for miscellaneous services that facilitate transaction and information management among Visa U.S.A. customers. Volume and Support Incentives Volume and support incentives are contracts with financial institutions, merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase card issuance and product acceptance 74 Table of Contents and increase Visa-branded transactions. These contracts, which range in term from one to 13 years, provide incentives based on payments volume growth or card issuance, or provide marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Visa U.S.A. provides cash and other incentives to certain customers in exchange for their commitment to generate certain payments volume using Visa-branded products for an agreed period of time. Pricing varies and may be modified on a customer-by-customer basis through volume and support incentive arrangements. In this regard, volume and support incentives represent a form of price reduction to these customers. Accordingly, we record these arrangements as a reduction to operating revenues. Certain incentives are estimated based on projected performance criteria and may change when actual performance varies from projections, resulting in adjustments to volume and support incentives. Management regularly reviews volume and support incentives and estimates of performance. Estimated costs associated with these contracts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect payments volume performance and projections that are higher or lower than management original expectation or to reflect contract amendments. International Transaction Fees International transaction fees are assessed to customers on non-U.S. transactions of U.S.-based issuing financial institutions and U.S. transactions of non-U.S.-based issuing financial institutions. International transaction fees are generally driven by cross-border payments volume, which include the settlement of currency exchange activities in connection with the settlement of multi-currency transactions. International transaction fees are influenced by levels of travel and the extent to which Visa-branded products are utilized for travel purposes. These fees are recognized as revenues in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed. Other Revenues Other revenues represent optional card enhancements, such as extended cardholder protection and concierge services, cardholder services, software development services and other services provided to Visa U.S.A. customers, Visa International, Visa Canada and Visa Europe. Software development services are provided on a time and materials basis primarily to Visa International, Visa Europe and Visa Canada. Prior period revenues associated with previous issuer fees, which were superseded by new issuer acceptance fees discussed above, have been reclassified to service fees for comparative purposes in Visa U.S.A. consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses consist of personnel; network, electronic data processing (EDP) and communications; advertising, marketing and promotion; professional and consulting fees; administrative and other, and litigation provision. Personnel Personnel expense consists of salaries, incentives and various fringe benefits. Network, EDP and Communications Network, EDP and communications represent expenses for the operation of our electronic payments network, including maintenance, depreciation and fees for other data processing services. 75 Table of Contents Advertising, Marketing and Promotion Advertising, marketing and promotion include expenses associated with advertising and marketing programs, sponsorships, promotions and other related incentives to promote the Visa brand. In connection with certain sponsorship agreements, Visa U.S.A. has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the terms of the agreements. Visa International Fees Visa U.S.A. pays fees to Visa International based on payments volumes, exclusive of PIN-based debit volume, for services primarily related to global brand management, global product enhancements, management of global system development and interoperability, and corporate support to the entire Visa enterprise. The fees are calculated based on Visa U.S.A. relative percentage of these payments volumes compared to other Visa regions. Professional and consulting fees Professional and consulting fees consist of fees for consulting, contractors, legal, and other professional services. Legal costs for third party services provided in connection with ongoing legal matters are expensed as incurred. Legal costs are included in professional and consulting fees on the consolidated statements of operations. Administrative and Other Administrative and other primarily consist of facilities costs, and other corporate and overhead expenses in support of our business, such as travel expenses. Litigation Provision Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on management understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate, and management best estimate of incurred loss at the balance sheet dates. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies , management records a charge to income for an estimated loss if such loss is probable and reasonably estimable. Visa U.S.A. will continue to review the litigation accrual and, if necessary, future adjustments to the accrual will be made. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) primarily consists of equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, interest expense, investment income, net and other non-operating income. Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates relates to investments in Visa International and joint ventures that own, lease, develop and operate all facilities and properties used jointly by Visa U.S.A. and Visa International. Interest Expense Interest expense primarily includes accretion associated with litigation settlements to be paid over periods longer than one year and interest incurred on outstanding debt. 76 Table of Contents Investment Income Investment income, net represents returns on our fixed-income securities and other investments. Fiscal 2007 compared to Fiscal 2006 Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $3.6 billion and $3.0 billion in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively, reflecting an increase of $0.6 billion, or 22%. The increase in operating revenues reflects increases in service fees and data processing fees due to growth in payments volume, exclusive of PIN-based debit volume, which increased 9%, and growth in transactions, which increased 11%. Growth in operating revenues exceeded growth in payments and transactions volumes primarily due to newly introduced service fees. While Visa U.S.A. believes that these changes in fee structure will generate ongoing benefits, Visa U.S.A. does not believe that the rate of growth in operating revenues is representative of sustainable future revenue growth because it includes the impacts in fiscal 2007 of the new service fees. Fiscal Year 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 $ Change % Change (in millions, except percentages) Service fees $ 1,945 $ 1,610 $ 335 21 % Data processing fees 1,416 1,248 168 13 % Volume and support incentives (505 ) (588 ) 83 (14 )% International transaction fees 454 398 56 14 % Other revenues 280 280 0 % Total Operating Revenues $ 3,590 $ 2,948 $ 642 22 % Service Fees Payments volume on Visa-branded cards for goods and services in the preceding quarter, exclusive of PIN-based debit volume, is the basis for service fees. Payments volume, exclusive of PIN-based debit volume, increased $105 billion, or 9%, to $1.3 trillion in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. Service fees outpaced the growth in underlying payments volume due primarily to the April 2007 introduction of two new acceptance fees including a debit acceptance fee on all consumer debit payments volume and a credit/commercial acceptance fee on all consumer credit and commercial payments volume. The increase in service fees from these new acceptance fees were offset by the corresponding elimination of previously existing issuer fees used to support merchant acceptance and volume growth initiatives. The net impact of the new acceptance fees and the elimination of the existing issuer fees resulted in an increase to service fees of $190 million, or 12%, in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. Data Processing Fees The increase in data processing fees is primarily due to the growth in number of transactions processed during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. Data processing fees increased 13%, broadly consistent with the growth in underlying transactions processed. Incremental revenues during fiscal 2007 from the introduction of an updated fraud detection product and additional revenues from Visa U.S.A. debit processing services related to non-Visa network transactions offset the continued impact of higher volume-based discounts resulting from consolidation and transaction growth among customers. Of the total data processing fees, $122 million, or 9%, was collectively earned from Visa International, Visa Canada and Visa Europe in each of fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. 77 Table of Contents Volume and Support Incentives The decrease in volume and support incentives was primarily due to the impact of lower revised estimates of performance under these agreements during management regular quarterly review of customer performance and due to amendments to volume and support incentives during the period. Performance adjustments reduced volume and support incentives cost by a total of $73 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $36 million in fiscal 2006. As the rate of payments volume growth has softened compared to the prior year, estimates of performance under volume and support incentives have been adjusted accordingly. We currently expect volume and support incentives to increase substantially during fiscal 2008 due to obligations assumed upon retirement of certain issuer programs during 2007. See Note 13 Restricted Assets and Liabilities and Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. The actual amount of volume and support incentives will vary based on modifications to performance expectations for these contracts, amendments to contracts, or new contracts entered into during 2008. The net liability of volume and support incentives changed as follows: 2007 (in millions) Beginning balance at October 1, 2006, net liability (1) $ (65 ) Provision Current year provision (588 ) Performance adjustments (2) 73 Contractual amendments (3) 10 Subtotal volume and support incentives (505 ) Payments 523 Ending balance at September 30, 2007, net liability (1) $ (47 ) (1) Balance represents the net of the current and long term asset and current liability portions of volume and support incentives as presented on the face of the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. (2) Amount represents adjustments resulting from management refinement of its estimate of projected sales performance as new information becomes available. (3) Amount represents adjustments resulting from amendments to existing contractual terms. International Transaction Fees The increase in international transaction fees was primarily driven by multi-currency payments volume, which increased by $10 billion, or 15%, during fiscal 2007, compared to fiscal 2006. The increase in international transaction fees was broadly in line with the growth in multi-currency payments volume, reflecting more cross-border transactions as overall global travel has increased. 78 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Total operating expenses increased by 127% to $5.0 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to $2.2 billion in fiscal 2006. The increase primarily reflects the $2.7 billion litigation provision, which represented 94% of that increase. Excluding the litigation provision, operating expenses increased $191 million, or 9%. Fiscal Year 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 $ Change % Change (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 721 $ 671 $ 50 7 % Network, EDP and communications 366 328 38 12 % Advertising, marketing and promotion 581 474 107 23 % Visa International fees 173 159 14 9 % Professional and consulting fees 334 291 43 15 % Administrative and other 211 272 (61 ) (22 )% Litigation provision 2,653 23 2,630 NM Total Operating Expenses $ 5,039 $ 2,218 $ 2,821 127 % Personnel Personnel expense increased 4% in fiscal 2007 due to a $26 million charge representing the first installment of a one-time special bonus program of $51 million associated with the establishment of Visa Inc. Half of the $51 million special bonus program vested during fiscal 2007. The other half is payable in stock or cash one year after the completion of an initial public offering if certain vesting requirements are met. The remaining increase of 3% reflects severance expense for certain executives, annual salary adjustments, which were broadly in line with economic price increases, offset by the impact of lower average headcount during fiscal 2007. Network, EDP and Communications The increase in Network, EDP and Communications expense for fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the following: a $29 million in crease in fees paid for debit processing services for charges related to processing transactions through non-Visa networks, and a $12 million increase in maintenance and equipment rental costs. Advertising, Marketing and Promotion The increase in advertising, marketing and promotion expense in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the following: a $67 million increase in expenditures for certain joint promotional campaigns with financial institution customers; and a $23 million increase in expenditures associated with Visa Extras, Visa U.S.A. point-based rewards program that enables enrolled cardholders to earn reward points on qualifying purchases. The remaining increase is attributable to additional promotional activity related to Visa Signature, Visa Small Business, and Consumer Debit products. These increases were offset by the absence of initial launch expenditures for Visa U.S.A. new brand mark and card design which began in January 2006 and the Life Takes Visa advertising campaign, which began in February 2006. 79 Table of Contents Visa International Fees Although Visa U.S.A. percentage of worldwide payments volumes decreased in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 due to global emerging markets experiencing higher payments volume growth rates than the more mature U.S. economy, fees paid to Visa International increased due to a one-time fee waiver of $13 million in fiscal 2006 that was not repeated in fiscal 2007. Professional and Consulting Fees Professional and consulting fees increased in fiscal 2007 primarily due to the following: a $23 million increase in contractors and outsourcing expense in connection with the outsourcing of certain data processing and development functions as described in the overview above, and additional contractors in connection with the support of other development and maintenance projects; and A $19 million increase in legal fees incurred to support ongoing litigation matters. See Note 20 Legal Matters to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements . Administrative and Other Administrative and other expenses decreased in fiscal 2007, primarily reflecting the absence of the following expenses incurred in fiscal 2006: a $24 million charge to reimburse customers for production and issuance costs related to discontinued use of Visa-branded cards with the holographic magnetic stripe design; a $13 million impairment charge for the net carrying value of an intangible asset associated with the patent and rights to market and distribute Mini Cards in the United States; and an $11 million charge to reflect expenses for business objectives related to a litigation settlement in fiscal 2006. The settlement required Visa U.S.A. to either meet certain joint business objectives or make cash payments in lieu of the business objectives over five years. Because Visa U.S.A. expects to make these related cash payments without receiving future benefits, Visa U.S.A. charged the present value of the total payments to its consolidated statements of operations in fiscal 2006. In addition, after a review of claims submitted, Visa U.S.A. reduced the accrual for reimbursement to customers for production costs related to the discontinued use of Visa-branded cards with the holographic magnetic stripe design by $11 million in fiscal 2007. Litigation Provision Litigation provision increased $2.6 billion reflecting a $1.9 billion provision related to settlement of outstanding litigation with American Express. Future payments under the settlement agreement were discounted at 4.72% over the payment term to determine the amount of the provision. The litigation provision also reflects management liability estimate under the guidelines of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, related to the Discover litigation. The American Express and Discover litigations are covered by our retrospective responsibility plan and we intend to fund any payment obligations with amounts in the escrow account, in accordance with our retrospective responsibility plan. The remainder of the increase in litigation provision includes various litigation provisions for both settled and unsettled matters. See Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 20 Legal Matters to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. Visa U.S.A. is a party to various other legal and regulatory proceedings. See Note 20 Legal Matters to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. 80 Table of Contents Total liabilities for legal matters changed as follows: (in millions) Balance at September 30, 2006 $ 1,000 Provision for settled legal matters 1,941 Provision for unsettled legal matters 714 Bank co-defendants obligation to American Express (1) 185 Insurance recovery (2 ) Interest accretion on settled matters 75 Payments on settled matters (231 ) Balance at September 30, 2007 $ 3,682 (1) Visa Inc. will consolidate the initial payment to American Express (see discussion below) on behalf of the five co-defendant banks. Visa U.S.A. has recorded a corresponding receivable in prepaid and other current assets on the Visa U.S.A. consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2007. Other Income (Expense) Other income was $62 million in fiscal 2007 compared to other expense of $8 million in fiscal 2006. The increase in other income primarily reflects an increase in Visa U.S.A. portion of equity earnings from Visa International as a result of an increase in net income for Visa International and an increase in interest income as the result of a shift in Visa U.S.A. investment portfolio from tax-exempt securities to higher yielding money market and auction rate securities. The following table sets forth the components of our other income (expense) for fiscal 2007 and 2006. Fiscal Year 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 $ Change % Change (in millions, except percentages) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates $ 40 $ 13 $ 27 208 % Interest expense (81 ) (89 ) 8 (9 )% Investment income, net 103 68 35 51 % Other Income (Expense) $ 62 $ (8 ) $ 70 NM Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates The increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in fiscal 2007 primarily reflected higher Visa International net income during fiscal 2007 compared to the prior fiscal year. Interest Expense The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2007 primarily reflected lower accretion expense on the declining litigation balance in the Retailers Litigation matter. Interest expense is expected to increase in fiscal 2008 as a result of the American Express Litigation , for which accretion will be recorded beginning in October 2008. See Note 20 Legal Matters to the Visa U.S.A fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. Investment Income, Net The increase in investment income, net in fiscal 2007 primarily reflects an increase in interest income due to a shift in the Visa U.S.A. investment strategy from tax-exempt municipal bonds to higher yield fixed-income investment securities and to higher average investment balances during the year. 81 Table of Contents Income Taxes Visa U.S.A. effective tax rate is a combination of federal and state statutory rates and allowable adjustments to taxable income. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 of 23% represented a tax benefit while the effective rate of 35% for the prior year represented a tax expense. The 23% effective tax rate benefit in fiscal 2007 resulted from the loss before income tax realized for the year. This benefit was less than would otherwise have been realized primarily as a result of an adjustment in a reserve related to litigation. The components impacting the effective tax rate are: Fiscal Year 2007 2006 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (in millions, except percentages) (Loss) income before income taxes and minority interest $ (1,387 ) $ 722 Minority interest expense 5 16 U.S. federal statutory tax (485 ) 35 % 253 35 % State tax effect, net of federal benefit (11 ) 1 % (11 ) (2 )% Reserve for tax uncertainties related to litigation 180 (13 )% Non-deductible expenses and other differences 2 % 15 3 % Minority interest not subject to tax (2 ) % (6 ) (1 )% Income Tax (Benefit) Expense $ (316 ) 23 % $ 251 35 % Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 statement of operations reflected a litigation provision of $2.7 billion associated with its outstanding and settled litigation. This provision primarily reflected the amount required to settle the American Express litigation and management liability estimate under the guidelines of SFAS No. 5 related to the Discover litigation and other matters. For tax purposes, the deduction related to these matters will be deferred until the payments are made and thus we established a deferred tax asset of $778 million related to these payments, which is net of a reserve to reflect Visa U.S.A. best estimate of the amount of the benefit to be realized. Minority Interest The decrease in minority interest for fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year reflects lower Inovant net income as a result of charges for severance and termination benefits related to Visa U.S.A. plans to outsource certain data processing and development support functions. See Note 16 Workforce Reduction to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements . Fiscal 2006 compared to Fiscal 2005 Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $3.0 billion and $2.7 billion in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively, reflecting an increase of $0.3 billion, or 11%. The increase in operating revenues was primarily driven by increases in service fees and data processing fees due to growth in payments volume and transactions, both of which increased 17% during fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2006, growth in consumer credit volume continued to favorably impact operating revenues, driven largely by Visa Signature, Visa U.S.A. premium credit platform, which generates higher fees. Operating revenues were also impacted by growth in debit volumes and transactions processed, reflecting the ongoing impact of certain member conversions to the debit Interlink platform. 82 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2006 vs. 2005 2006 2005 $ Change % Change (in millions, except percentages) Service fees $ 1,610 $ 1,447 $ 163 11 % Data processing fees 1,248 1,139 109 10 % Volume and support incentives (588 ) (524 ) (64 ) 12 % International transaction fees 398 360 38 11 % Other revenues 280 243 37 15 % Total Operating Revenues $ 2,948 $ 2,665 $ 283 11 % Service Fees The increase in service fees in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 of 11% was broadly in line with the growth in underlying payments volume exclusive of PIN-based debit volume, which increased $151.0 billion, or 15%, to $1.2 trillion in fiscal 2006, reflecting increased spending on all product platforms volumes. This increase was offset by a decrease in acceptance fees in fiscal 2006 primarily reflecting lower revenues of $36 million related to a merchant incentive program. The program collects fees from customers and the funds are intended to support various merchant programs designed to build payments volume and increase product acceptance. Beginning in fiscal 2006, the program was modified, requiring specific use of related revenues. Revenues related to the merchant incentive program were therefore deferred and recognized only when expended as designated for specific acceptance programs. Data Processing Fees Data processing fees increased 10% primarily due to a 17% increase in the number of transactions processed in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. The increase in transactions processed outpaced the increase in data processing fees in fiscal 2006 primarily due to higher volume-based discounts resulting from consolidations among financial institution customers. Despite solid growth in the mix of debit transactions during fiscal 2006, reflecting conversion of various member financial institutions to Interlink, Visa U.S.A. PIN-based debit platform, the impact of volume-based discounts across all product lines outpaced the impact of growth of debit transactions. Of the total data processing fees, $122 million and $121 million was earned from Visa International, Visa Canada and Visa Europe in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. Volume and Support Incentives Growth of volume and support incentives in fiscal 2006 was primarily due to the execution of new agreements in support of Visa U.S.A. partnership programs with existing customers, and co-branding programs with existing customers and new merchants. 83 Table of Contents The net asset (liability) of volume and support incentives changed as follows: 2006 (in millions) Beginning balance at October 1, 2005, net asset (1) $ 110 Provision Current year provision (635 ) Performance adjustments (2) 36 Contractual amendments (3) 11 Subtotal volume and support incentives (588 ) Payments 413 Ending balance at September 30, 2006, net liability (1) $ (65 ) (1) Balance represents the net of the current and long term asset and current liability portions of volume and support incentives as presented on the face of the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. (2) Amount represents adjustments resulting from management refinement of its estimate of projected sales performance as new information becomes available. (3) Amount represents adjustments resulting from amendments to existing contractual terms. International Transaction Fees International transaction fees increased 11% while multi-currency payments volume increased 9% or $4.4 billion, in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. The increase in international transaction fees was higher than the growth in multi-currency payments volume due to the differential between foreign and domestic interchange rates. Other Revenues The increase in other revenues in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected: revenue growth of $18 million for technology projects and services performed for Visa International, Visa Canada and Visa Europe; and revenue growth of $12 million from the Visa Extras loyalty program. Visa Extras is a platform for enrolled Visa cardholders to earn reward points toward qualifying purchases. Operating Expenses Total operating expenses were unchanged at $2.2 billion for both fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. Visa U.S.A. reduced its total operating expenses as a percentage of total operating revenues to 75% in fiscal 2006 compared to 83% in fiscal 2005 due to more effective expense management and the absence of certain charges associated with Visa U.S.A. litigation provision expense recorded in fiscal 2005. The charge to litigation provision expense in fiscal 2005 was primarily related to the multi-currency matter that was subsequently settled in fiscal 2006. See Note 20 Legal Matters to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. Fiscal Year 2006 vs. 2005 2006 2005 $ Change % Change (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 671 $ 619 $ 52 8 % Network, EDP and communications 328 338 (10 ) (3 )% Advertising, marketing and promotion 474 457 17 4 % Visa International fees 159 169 (10 ) (6 )% Professional and consulting fees 291 273 18 7 % Administrative and other 272 224 48 21 % Litigation provision 23 132 (109 ) (83 )% Total Operating Expenses $ 2,218 $ 2,212 $ 6 0 % 84 Table of Contents Personnel The increase in personnel expense in fiscal 2006 reflected annual salary adjustments, which were broadly in line with inflation, and a 4% increase in the number of employees in support of various corporate initiatives at Visa U.S.A. Network, EDP and Communications The decrease in network, EDP and communications expense in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected a decrease in software expense of $9 million due to Visa U.S.A. lowering its threshold for capitalizing software from a unit cost greater than $25,000 or an aggregate purchase cost greater than $250,000 to a unit cost or aggregate purchase cost greater than $10,000. Advertising, Marketing and Promotion The increase in advertising, marketing and promotion expense in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected higher expenditures for Visa U.S.A. new brand mark and card design launch which began in January 2006 and its Life Takes Visa advertising campaign, launched in February 2006. Visa International Fees The decrease in Visa International fees in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected reductions in Visa U.S.A. percentage of worldwide payments volumes, as global emerging markets experienced higher payments volume growth rates than the more mature U.S. economy. Professional and Consulting Fees Professional and consulting fees increased in fiscal 2006 primarily due to professional contracting fees incurred to provide analysis and support for various programs and projects including product development and innovation, call center operations and global processing and system development. Additional expenses for accounting and auditing services were incurred in conjunction with Visa U.S.A. review of its internal controls over financial reporting, and additional legal fees were incurred to support ongoing litigation matters. Administrative and Other Administrative and other expense increased in fiscal 2006, primarily reflecting the following non-recurring expenses: a $24 million charge to reimburse customers for production and issuance costs related to discontinued use of Visa-branded cards with the holographic magnetic stripe design; a $13 million impairment charge for the net carrying value of an intangible asset associated with the patent and rights to market and distribute Mini Cards in the United States; and an $11 million charge to reflect expenses for business objectives related to a litigation settlement in fiscal 2006. The settlement required Visa U.S.A. to either meet certain joint business objectives or make cash payments in lieu of the business objectives over five years. Because Visa U.S.A. expects to make these related cash payments without receiving future benefits, Visa U.S.A. charged the present value of the total payments to its consolidated statements of operations in fiscal 2006. 85 Table of Contents Litigation Provision The decrease in the litigation provision in fiscal 2006 compared to the prior year was driven by the following: absence of the litigation provision for the multi-currency matter of $94 million, which was charged in fiscal 2005 and settled in fiscal 2006; downward adjustment of $16 million to the litigation provision reflecting the settlement of two matters in July 2006; and an $11 million insurance recovery related to one of the matters settled in July 2006. The insurance recovery was received during the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2006. Total liabilities for legal matters changed as follows: (in millions) Balance at September 30, 2005 $ 1,208 Provision for legal matters 34 Insurance recovery (11 ) Interest accretion on settled matters 92 Payments on settled matters (323 ) Balance at September 30, 2006 $ 1,000 Other Income (Expense) Other expense was $8 million in fiscal 2006 compared to other income of $3 million in fiscal 2005. The decrease in other income primarily reflected the absence of a non-recurring gain-on-sale of a joint venture interest in Vital Processing Services LLC, a financial transaction processor for acquirers and merchants, which occurred in fiscal 2005 and lower equity in earnings related to Visa U.S.A. ownership in Visa International. Fiscal Year 2006 vs. 2005 2006 2005 $ Change % Change (in millions, except percentages) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates $ 13 $ 31 $ (18 ) (58 )% Interest expense (89 ) (109 ) 20 (18 )% Investment income, net 68 81 (13 ) (16 )% Other (Expense) Income $ (8 ) $ 3 $ (11 ) NM Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates The decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected lower Visa International net income and a decrease in Visa U.S.A. proportionate equity interest in Visa International earnings from the prior year, reflecting the fact that Visa U.S.A. comprised a lower percentage of total payments volume-based fees paid to Visa International. The decrease also reflected the absence of equity in earnings from Vital Processing Services LLC following the sale of Visa U.S.A. 50% equity interest in the joint venture during fiscal 2005. Interest Expense The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected the absence of accretion expense on litigation for certain merchants who opted not to participate in the plaintiff class in the Retailers Litigation matter. These litigation matters were settled in the first six months of fiscal 2005. See Note 20 Legal Matters to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. 86 Table of Contents Investment Income, Net The decrease in investment income, net in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected the absence of a $42 million gain on the sale of Visa U.S.A. 50% equity interest in Vital Processing Services LLC in fiscal 2005. The decrease was offset by higher earnings on fixed-income investment securities, due to higher average investment balances and higher market interest rates for current year periods compared to the prior year. Income Taxes Visa U.S.A. effective tax rate decreased to 35% in fiscal 2006 from 40% in fiscal 2005. The lower effective tax rate is primarily attributable to additional tax benefits granted by the state related to Visa U.S.A. tax filing methodology in fiscal 2006. The decrease also reflects the absence of a one-time remeasurement of deferred tax assets related to the adoption of a new state tax filing methodology, which occurred in 2005. The components impacting the effective tax rate are: Fiscal 2006 2005 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (in millions, except percentages) Income before income taxes, cumulative effect of accounting change and minority interest $ 722 $ 606 Cumulative effect of accounting change, gross (150 ) Income before income taxes and minority interest 722 456 Minority interest expense 16 8 U.S. federal statutory tax 253 35 % 160 35 % State tax effect, net of federal benefit (11 ) (2 )% 21 5 % Non-deductible expenses and other differences 15 3 % 5 1 % Minority interest not subject to tax (6 ) (1 )% (3 ) (1 )% Income Tax Expense $ 251 35 % $ 183 40 % Minority Interest In September 2005, Inovant, Inc. sold a 10% interest in Inovant to Visa Europe and a 6% interest to Visa International and its CEMEA region at a price equivalent to the founder cost, thereby reducing Visa U.S.A. ownership of Inovant from 85% to 69%. This increase in third party ownership had a full year impact in fiscal 2006 resulting in increased minority interest expense. Liquidity and Capital Resources Visa U.S.A. maintains comprehensive cash flow forecasts to project Visa U.S.A. short-term and long-term liquidity needs, and maintains controls and governance over spending and investment decisions. Visa U.S.A. corporate investment policy was approved by its board of directors and Visa U.S.A. Asset and Liability Committee oversees Visa U.S.A. treasury activity. Visa U.S.A. requires capital resources and liquidity to: enable uninterrupted settlement of debit transactions; fund development of new technology, payment products and services; fund payment obligations under volume and support incentives; 87 Table of Contents finance capital expenditures and future investments; service the payments of principal and interest on outstanding indebtedness; and pay the costs of litigation, including settlements. The objectives of Visa U.S.A. investment policy are to maintain integrity of principal, to provide adequate liquidity to cover settlement contingency scenarios and operating expenditures, including payments of principal and interest on its outstanding debt, inclusive of settled litigation, and to optimize investment income earned within acceptable risk criteria. Settlement of certain debit transactions due from customers participating in the Debit Processing Service and due to payment networks represents Visa U.S.A. most consistent liquidity requirement. These settlement receivables are generally collected on the business day following the day in which the transactions were processed, and settlement payables are typically satisfied two days following the processing day. Visa U.S.A. maintains a liquidity position sufficient to enable uninterrupted daily net debit settlement. During fiscal 2007, Visa U.S.A. funded average daily net settlement payable balances of $62 million, with the highest daily balance being $188 million. During fiscal 2006, Visa U.S.A. funded average daily net settlement payable balances of $62 million, with the highest daily balance being $221 million. Visa International is Visa U.S.A. settlement agent for credit and all other debit transactions. Sources of Liquidity Visa U.S.A. primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities and a fixed-income investment portfolio. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents, short-term available-for-sale investment securities, or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based on Visa U.S.A. estimates of when those funds will be needed. At September 30, 2007, September 30, 2006 and September 30, 2005, Visa U.S.A. total liquid assets, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investment securities, and long-term investment securities, were $1.8 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, as reflected in the following table: At September 30, 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 275 $ 270 $ 135 Short-term investments securities, available-for-sale 747 660 681 Total current assets 2,507 1,594 1,478 Long-term investments securities, available-for-sale 737 515 319 Total current liabilities 3,282 1,393 1,325 Current portion of long-term debt 41 32 32 Long-term debt 41 74 Current portion of accrued litigation 2,236 216 197 Long-term portion of accrued litigation 1,446 784 1,010 Total (deficit) equity (501 ) 583 126 Working capital (775 ) 201 153 On November 1, 2007, Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International entered into an agreement with American Express to resolve all current litigation between American Express and Visa U.S.A. and Visa International, and the related litigation between American Express and five co-defendant banks. Under the settlement agreement, an initial payment of $1.13 billion will be made on or before March 31, 2008, including $945 million from Visa Inc. and $185 million from the five co-defendant banks. Beginning March 31, 2008, Visa Inc. will pay American Express an additional amount of up to $70 million per quarter for 16 quarters, for a maximum total of $1.12 billion. Total future payments discounted at 4.72% over the payment term, or 88 Table of Contents $1.9 billion, are reflected in the litigation provision on Visa U.S.A. consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2007 and in current and long-term accrued litigation on its consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2007. Visa Inc. expects to fund future payments under the American Express settlement under its retrospective responsibility plan. The plan includes an escrow arrangement in which Visa Inc. will deposit a portion of the expected proceeds from an initial public offering, as determined by the Visa Inc. litigation committee (a committee established pursuant to a litigation management agreement among Visa Inc., Visa International, Visa U.S.A. and the members of the committee, all of whom are affiliated with, or acting for, certain Visa U.S.A. members), into an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, covered litigation will be payable. The plan also includes a loss sharing agreement in which Visa U.S.A. members that are parties to the agreement are responsible for covered litigation in proportion to the member ownership percentage, as calculated in accordance with Visa U.S.A. certificate of incorporation. This plan includes multi-step mechanisms to fund financial obligations of Visa U.S.A. and Visa International related to certain litigation, including the American Express litigation covered by this settlement agreement. See Business Retrospective Responsibility Plan . Visa U.S.A. has an uncommitted credit facility with Visa International whereby Visa U.S.A. or Visa International may provide each other short-term financing with a maximum term of five business days. Neither Visa U.S.A. nor Visa International has the obligation to lend to or to borrow from the other company. There were no outstanding balances at September 30, 2007 or September 30, 2006 under this arrangement. In July 2006, Visa U.S.A. board of directors approved a plan to build a new data center on the east coast of the United States at an estimated cost of $397 million, which Visa U.S.A. plans to fund with its existing liquid assets and projected cash flows. Visa U.S.A. completed the land purchase and began construction in fiscal 2007; construction is expected to continue through fiscal 2010. Upon completion, Visa U.S.A. will migrate its current east coast data center to this new facility. Visa U.S.A. assesses the estimated cost to build the new data center on a regular basis and the corresponding liquidity required during each stage of the building process. In March 2007, Visa U.S.A. executed two performance bond agreements with the county in which the east coast data center will be constructed to provide assurance that land development and construction will be completed as planned. The bonds have a total value of $2 million and become due in the event that land development and construction are not completed as planned. At September 30, 2007, Visa U.S.A. had remaining committed obligations of $186 million related to the new data center. Visa U.S.A. had negative working capital at September 30, 2007, primarily due to the financial statement impact of the American Express litigation. See Note 20 Legal Matters to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. Visa U.S.A. believes its existing liquid assets and projected cash flows will be sufficient to fund its business operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditures, future strategic developments and other commitments during fiscal 2008. Visa U.S.A. anticipates that future increases in its operating cash flows from new acceptance fees initiated in April 2007 will be offset by obligations assumed in connection with the retirement of two restricted liability programs. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. Visa U.S.A. ability to maintain these levels of liquidity could be adversely affected by several factors described under Risk Factors , including the adverse outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which Visa U.S.A. is a party. As part of Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. will continue to assess its liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of its operating performance and other relevant circumstances. Visa U.S.A. has certain off-balance sheet commitments and contingencies that may have significant future cash requirements. See Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations and Note 12 Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits , Note 14 Debt , Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies and Note 20 Legal Matters to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. 89 Table of Contents Cash Flow Data Fiscal 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 505 $ 434 $ 481 Net cash used in investing activities (463 ) (263 ) (473 ) Net cash used in financing activities (37 ) (36 ) (46 ) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 5 $ 135 $ (38 ) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased $71 million in fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year. The increase primarily reflected the absence of a substantial program payment in connection with Visa U.S.A. Visa Check card program in the prior year. See Note 13 Restricted Assets and Liabilities to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. The increase also reflects higher non-cash accruals for accrued compensation and benefits. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $47 million during fiscal 2006, primarily due to payments on litigation matters largely accrued for in fiscal 2005 but settled and paid for in fiscal 2006. In addition, lower levels of accounts payable and accrued liabilities in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 contributed to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities. These decreases were offset by increases in the liability position of volume and support incentives and higher net income, adjusted for non-cash items. Investing Activities The increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2007 is primarily driven by facilities and equipment purchases related to the new data center discussed above. In addition, investment securities purchasing activity, net of sales and maturities, was higher during fiscal 2007. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005 primarily reflects fewer funds available for the purchase of investment securities as a result of one-time litigation settlements, including the multi-currency matter. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 primarily reflects scheduled quarterly payments on Visa U.S.A. series A senior secured notes due December 2007 and series B senior secured notes due December 2012. See Note 14 Debt to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. Cash requirements remained stable as the outstanding debt decreased during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Under Visa U.S.A. bylaws in effect prior to the reorganization, Visa U.S.A. indemnified issuing and acquiring customers for settlement losses suffered by reason of the failure of any other issuing and acquiring customer to honor drafts, travelers cheques, or other instruments processed in accordance with its operating regulations. Visa International is Visa U.S.A. settlement agent. Visa U.S.A. partially indemnifies Visa International from losses due to the failure of a member. The term and the amount of the indemnity is not limited. Visa U.S.A. is responsible for losses up to $1.0 million plus .003% of Visa U.S.A. payments volume, excluding Interlink, for the year preceding the loss, or approximately $40 million in fiscal 2007. Currently settlement is guaranteed by members through the indemnification provisions in the bylaws of Visa U.S.A. and Visa 90 Table of Contents International and through separate member agreements with the individual members. Upon the closing of an initial public offering, members will no longer indemnify Visa for settlement obligations other than their own settlement obligations and those of certain other participants in the system sponsored by the member. In conjunction with Visa U.S.A. purchase of Inovant, Inc. from Visa International on January 1, 2003, Visa U.S.A. agreed to indemnify Visa International in the event of future tax liability in connection with an adverse determination by a taxing authority resulting from the sale of stock of Inovant, Inc. The indemnification is effective for 10 years and extends through 30 years or the statute of limitation in the event of a tax extension for the year of the stock repurchase. The maximum probability-weighted liability is considered immaterial and no liability has been accrued for this obligation. Visa U.S.A. has no special purpose entities or off-balance sheet debt, other than operating leases and purchase order commitments entered into in the ordinary course of business and reflected in the contractual obligations table below. Contractual Obligations Visa U.S.A. contractual commitments will have an impact on its future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on-and off-balance sheet transactions that represent material expected or contractually committed future obligations at the end of fiscal 2007. Visa U.S.A. believes that it will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and its existing cash balances. Payments due by period Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Total (in millions) Purchase orders (1) $ 529 $ 37 $ 8 $ $ 574 Operating leases (2 ) 9 15 6 30 Equipment and licenses (2) 22 24 1 47 Capital leases (3) 4 4 Volume and support incentives (4) : Financial institutions 459 887 578 347 2,271 Merchant 288 499 463 274 1,524 Sponsorships (5) 18 24 3 45 Litigation payments (6) 1,566 980 750 3,296 Debt (7) 42 42 Total $ 2,937 $ 2,466 $ 1,809 $ 621 $ 7,833 (1) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction. (2) Visa U.S.A. leases certain premises such as its data centers, certain regional offices and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases with varying expiration dates. (3) Visa U.S.A. entered into a capital lease for certain computer equipment in fiscal 2005. Visa U.S.A. is financing the acquisition of the underlying assets through the leases and accordingly they are recorded on Visa U.S.A. consolidated financial statements. (4) Visa U.S.A. generally has non-cancelable agreements with financial institutions and merchants for various programs designed to build payments volume and increase payment product acceptance. These agreements, which range in term from one to 13 years, provide card issuance, marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. (5) Visa U.S.A. is a party to long-term contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately 3 to 6 years. These contracts are designed to help Visa U.S.A. increase Visa-branded card usage and payments volumes. Over the life of these contracts, Visa U.S.A. is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa U.S.A. has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the contract terms. Visa U.S.A. maximum advertising and marketing commitment through June 2013 is $85.9 million. (6) Represents amounts due in accordance with settlement agreements in the Retailers Litigation, American Express Litigation and other litigation settlements. (7) Represents payments on Visa U.S.A. series A and series B senior secured notes. 91 Table of Contents See Note 14 Debt , Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies and Note 20 Legal Matters to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. Visa U.S.A. also has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement benefit plans, and other incentive plans. See Note 12 Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. Related Parties Prior to the closing of the reorganization during October 2007, Visa U.S.A. conducted business as a non-stock, non-assessable membership corporation. The principal members of Visa U.S.A. were approximately 1,600 financial institutions that participated directly in Visa U.S.A. payment programs. In addition, there were approximately 11,700 associate and participant members that participated in Visa U.S.A. payment programs through one or more principal members. At September 30, 2007, Visa U.S.A. board of directors was comprised of ex-officio directors, individuals who were also officers of various member financial institutions that are also Visa U.S.A. customers and independent directors. Visa U.S.A. generated total operating revenues of approximately $903 million, $808 million and $884 million from financial institutions with officers that also served on its board of directors in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, a significant portion of Visa U.S.A. operating revenues were generated from one customer with an officer that also served on the board of directors. Operating revenues from this customer were $454 million or 13%, $408 million or 14%, and $345 million or 13% of Visa U.S.A. total operating revenues in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Additionally, operating revenues generated from a customer which did not have an officer on the board were $384 million, or 11% in fiscal 2007. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of Visa U.S.A. total operating revenues in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005. See Note 18 Related Parties to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. The loss of these customers could adversely impact Visa U.S.A. operating revenues and operating income. Critical Accounting Estimates Visa U.S.A. consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of Visa U.S.A. consolidated financial statements. Visa U.S.A. has established policies and control procedures to seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. The following is a brief description of Visa U.S.A. current accounting policies involving significant management judgment. 92 Table of Contents Management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate Visa U.S.A. reported financial results, as they require management most subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Critical Estimates Assumptions and Judgment Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Revenue Recognition Visa U.S.A. enters into incentive agreements with financial institution customers, merchants and other business partners to build payments volume and increase product acceptance. Certain volume and support incentives are based on performance targets and are accrued based upon estimates of future performance. Other incentives are fixed payments and are deferred and amortized over the period of benefit. Volume and support incentives require significant management estimates. Estimation of volume and support incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, estimates of card issuance and conversion. Performance is estimated by using financial institution customer reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with Visa U.S.A. customers. If the customers actual performance is not consistent with Visa U.S.A. estimates, revenue discounts and incentives which are recorded as a reduction of revenue, including volume and support incentives, may be materially different than initially recorded. For fiscal 2007, performance adjustments to Visa U.S.A. volume and support accruals increased operating revenues by 2.0% due to slower growth in payments volume by Visa U.S.A. customers. For fiscal 2006 and 2005, performance adjustments increased operating revenues by 1.2% and 0.2%, respectively. Pension Pension assumptions are significant inputs to actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations. Two critical assumptions discount rate and expected return on assets are important elements of plan expense and asset/liability measurements. These critical assumptions are evaluated at least annually on a plan basis. Other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality and turnover are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect actual experience and expectations for the future. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors, and in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the impact of these differences are accumulated and amortized over future periods. Visa U.S.A. discount rate is based To reflect market interest rate conditions in calculating the projected benefit obligation, the pension discount rate was decreased from 6.2% at June 30, 2006 to 6.0% at September 30, 2007. An expected rate of return of 7.5% was utilized at both June 30, 2007 and 2006. A 25 basis point decrease or increase in the discount rate would increase or decrease annual pension expense, respectively, by $4.3 million. A 25 basis point decrease or increase in the expected return on assets would increase or decrease annual pension expense, respectively, by $1.2 million. 93 Table of Contents Critical Estimates Assumptions and Judgment Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions on matching the duration of corporate bond pools to the expected pension payment stream. The discount rate enables Visa U.S.A. to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows on the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on current and expected asset allocation, as well as the long-term historical risks and returns associated with each asset class within the plan portfolio. A lower expected rate of return on plan assets increases pension cost. Legal Matters Visa U.S.A. is a party to legal proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Except as described in Note 20 Legal Matters to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements, Visa U.S.A. does not believe that any legal proceeding to which Visa U.S.A. is a party would have a material adverse impact on Visa U.S.A. business. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Visa U.S.A. evaluates the likelihood of a potential loss from any claim or legal proceedings to which Visa U.S.A. is party in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS 5). Visa U.S.A. records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for claims and legal and regulatory proceedings when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In most cases, significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Visa U.S.A. judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of Visa U.S.A. defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which Visa U.S.A. operates, its judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse affects on Visa U.S.A. business, financial condition and results of operations. 94 Table of Contents Critical Estimates Assumptions and Judgment Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Credit and Debit Settlement Guarantee Subject to Visa U.S.A. bylaws and operating regulations, Visa U.S.A. indemnifies issuing and acquiring members for settlement losses suffered by reason of the failure of any other member to honor credit and debit drafts, travelers cheques, or other instruments processed in accordance with Visa U.S.A. operating regulations. The fair value of the associated settlement risk guarantee is based on estimates. Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements describes the methodology Visa U.S.A. uses to estimate Visa U.S.A. liability for this guarantee. Management estimates on a quarterly basis the value of the guarantee by applying the following formula: Settlement Risk Guarantee = Total Exposure multiplied by Failure Probability multiplied by Loss upon Failure Total exposure represents the average number of days to settle multiplied by the average daily transaction volume. Failure probability represents the probability of failure by individual financial institution customers based on assessed credit ratings. Loss upon failure represents the actual loss expected to be incurred in the event that a financial institution fails. For fiscal 2007, management internal estimates used in the above calculation were: Total Exposure = $14.8 billion Weighted Average Failure Probability = 0.006% Loss upon Failure = 45% The most critical assumption in estimating the settlement risk guarantee liability is the weighted average failure probability. Visa U.S.A. establishes this estimate by using actual loss history for the previous ten-year period and third party ratings of creditworthiness for Visa U.S.A. members. Visa U.S.A. estimate of total exposure changes period to period as a result of movement in overall volume of settlement transactions. Visa U.S.A. estimate of the weighted average failure probability changes as a result of changes in its assessment of the creditworthiness of Visa U.S.A. financial institution customers. Visa U.S.A. estimate of loss upon failure changes based on the U.S. bank standard for losses on commercial lending. A 25% increase in any of the assumptions used in the calculation of the settlement risk guarantee will have an immaterial impact on the liability recorded. However, if Visa U.S.A. experiences a significant increase in loss occurrences or significant actual losses occur in the future under this guarantee the impact to the estimated loss upon failure assumption could result in an increase to the obligation under the settlement risk guarantee that could be material to the consolidated financial statements. If the weighted average failure probability doubled, Visa U.S.A. estimated liability would increase by less than $1 million at September 30, 2007. 95 Table of Contents Critical Estimates Assumptions and Judgment Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Income Taxes In calculating its effective tax rate Visa U.S.A. makes judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Visa U.S.A. has various tax filing positions, with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of reserves for audit matters and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Visa U.S.A. has procedures to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns, and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only partially be sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Although Visa U.S.A. believes that its estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities, including Visa U.S.A. tax benefit of $778 million associated with the settlement of the American Express litigation and the recognition of a liability under the guidelines of SFAS No. 5 related to the Discover litigation and other matters. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. Seasonality Visa U.S.A. does not experience a pronounced seasonality in its business. No individual quarter of fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006 or fiscal 2005 has historically accounted for more than 30% of annual revenue. Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For the benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Visa U.S.A. expects the adoption of FIN 48 on October 1, 2007 will result in an increase to accumulated net income of approximately $6.3 million. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Visa U.S.A. is in the process of determining the effect, if any, of adopting SFAS 157 on its consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)) (SFAS 158), which amends FASB issued Statement No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS 87) and FASB issued Statement No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (SFAS 106) to require recognition of the over-funded or under-funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet. Under SFAS 158, 96 Table of Contents gains and losses, prior service costs and credits and any remaining transition amounts under SFAS 87 and SFAS 106 that have not yet been recognized through net periodic benefit cost will be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax effects, until they are amortized as a component of net periodic cost. In addition, SFAS 158 requires that the measurement date, the date at which the benefit obligation and plan assets are measured, be the company fiscal year end. Visa U.S.A. adopted the recognition provision of SFAS 158 at September 30, 2007. Visa U.S.A. adopted the measurement date provisions of SFAS 158 at October 1, 2006, using the 15-month approach. Under this approach, Visa U.S.A. recorded an additional 3 months of net periodic benefit cost covering the period between the previous measurement date of June 30, 2006 and September 30, 2006. The benefit expense of $8.7 million, net of tax, was recorded as a reduction to beginning accumulated net (loss) income at October 1, 2006. The effects to Visa U.S.A. of applying the recognition and measurement-date provision of SFAS 158 on individual line items in Visa U.S.A. consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2007 are as follows: Prior to application of SFAS 158 SFAS 158 application adjustments After application of SFAS 158 (in thousands) Current portion of deferred tax assets $ 794,925 $ 88 $ 795,013 Deferred tax assets 464,286 6,340 470,626 Total assets 4,383,689 6,428 4,390,117 Accrued compensation and benefits 240,079 4,235 244,314 Other liabilities 107,512 17,516 125,028 Total liabilities 4,831,083 21,751 4,852,834 Minority interest 42,928 (4,318 ) 38,610 Accumulated net loss (492,323 ) (8,676 ) (500,999 ) Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 2,001 (2,329 ) (328 ) Total deficit (490,322 ) (11,005 ) (501,327 ) Total liabilities, minority interest, and equity 4,383,689 6,428 4,390,117 In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to SFAS 115 (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 allows the measurement of many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis under a fair value option. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years that begin after November 15, 2007. Visa U.S.A. is in the process of determining the effect, if any, of adopting SFAS 159 on its consolidated financial statements. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices. Visa U.S.A. is exposed to two significant market risks that could affect its business including: changes in interest rates and equity prices. Visa U.S.A. does not hold or enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 97 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk A significant portion of Visa U.S.A. investment portfolio assets is held in fixed-income securities. These assets are reflected as cash equivalents, short-term available-for-sale investments and long-term available-for-sale investments. Visa U.S.A. does not consider its cash and cash equivalents or its auction rate securities to be subject to significant market risks from a fair value perspective, as amounts consist of liquid investments with original maturities or repricing characteristics of three months or less. The fair value balances of Visa U.S.A. short-term and long-term available-for-sale investments at September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006 include: September 30, 2007 2006 (in millions, except percentages) Government-sponsored entities 1,274 895 Tax-exempt municipal bonds 9 249 Total $ 1,283 $ 1,144 Percentage of Total Assets 29 % 39 % Visa U.S.A. manages its exposure to interest rate risk by investing primarily in rate-adjustable, or short-term securities, and a modest amount of fixed rate government agency securities to support longer term obligations. However, Visa U.S.A. efforts do not provide complete assurance that it will be protected from interest rate fluctuations. A sharp rise in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of Visa U.S.A. investment portfolio. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would impact the fair value of the investment portfolio by approximately $7 million or $2 million, respectively, at September 30, 2007 and approximately $12 million and $6 million, respectively, at September 30, 2006. Equity Price Risk Visa U.S.A. owns equity securities which are selected to offset obligations in connection with Visa U.S.A. long-term incentive and deferred compensation plans. Equity securities primarily consist of mutual fund investments related to various employee compensation plans. For these plans, employees bear the risk of market fluctuations. Gains and losses experienced on these equity investments are offset by increases or reductions in personnel expense, respectively. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in market value would have increased or decreased unrealized losses and personnel expense, respectively, by $5 million for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006.
