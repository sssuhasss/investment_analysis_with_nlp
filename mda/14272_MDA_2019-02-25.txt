Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Management discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this 2018 Form 10-K to enhance the understanding of our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Bristol-Myers Squibb Company is a global specialty biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases. Refer to the Summary of Abbreviated Terms at the end of this 2018 Form 10-K for terms used throughout the document. In 2018, we received 14 approvals for new medicines and additional indications and formulations of currently marketed medicines in major markets (the U.S., EU, Japan and China) including multiple regulatory milestone achievements for Opdivo and Opdivo+Yervoy combinations. We are committed to investigating Opdivo alone and in combination with Yervoy and other anti-cancer agents for a wide array of tumor types, including broad programs in lung, head & neck, liver, kidney, bladder and stomach. We continue to believe that the breadth and depth of our IO portfolio positions us well for the future. We have 17 new IO compounds in clinical development and studies across more than 35 different tumor types. In addition, we advanced certain other non-IO R&D programs in our pipeline, including TYK2 inhibitor for the treatment of psoriasis and other autoimmune diseases, Factor XIa inhibitor for the treatment of thrombosis (in collaboration with Janssen), and Pegbelfermin (PEG-FGF21) for the treatment of NASH. In 2018, our revenues increased 9% as a result of higher demand for our prioritized brands including Opdivo and Eliquis partially offset by increased competition for established brands, primarily HIV brands and Daklinza . The $2.40 increase in GAAP EPS was primarily due to 2017 tax charges attributed to tax reform and higher revenues. These items were partially offset by higher losses on equity investments. After adjusting for the impact of tax reform, equity investment losses and other specified items, non-GAAP EPS increased $0.97 primarily as a result of higher revenues, higher royalties and licensing income and a lower effective tax rate. Cost savings resulting from our transformation initiatives continue to be redeployed in R&D and other areas of higher priorities. On January 3, 2019, we announced that we have entered into a definitive merger agreement with Celgene under which we will acquire Celgene. For further discussion on our pending acquisition with Celgene and on our other acquisitions, divestitures and licensing arrangements, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 4 . Acquisitions, Divestitures, Licensing and Other Arrangements and Note 19 . Subsequent Event. In 2017, our revenues increased 7% as a result of higher demand for our prioritized brands including Opdivo and Eliquis partially offset by increased competition for established brands, primarily Daklinza . The $2.04 decrease in GAAP EPS was due to tax charges attributed to tax reform ( $1.76 per share) and to a lesser extent higher license, asset acquisition and restructuring related charges and lower divestiture- related income. These items were partially offset by higher revenues, royalties and licensing income and a patent-infringement settlement. After adjusting for the impact of tax reform and other specified items, non-GAAP EPS increased $0.18 primarily as a result of higher revenues partially offset by product mix and higher R&D expenses supporting Opdivo and other IO programs. Highlights The following table summarizes our financial information: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions, except per share data 2018 2017 2016 Total Revenues $ 22,561 $ 20,776 $ 19,427 Diluted Earnings Per Share GAAP $ 3.01 $ 0.61 $ 2.65 Non-GAAP 3.98 3.01 2.83 Our non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information, are adjusted to exclude specified items that represent certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other items impacting the comparability of financial results. For a detailed listing of all specified items and further information and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures. 29 Significant Product and Pipeline Approvals The following is a summary of the 14 significant approvals received in 2018 .

Our strategy is to combine the resources, scale and capability of a pharmaceutical company with the speed and focus on innovation of the biotech industry. Our four strategic priorities are to drive business performance, continue to build a leading franchise in IO, maintain a diversified portfolio both within and outside of IO, and continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation, including establishing partnerships, collaborations and in-licensing or acquiring investigational compounds as an essential component of successfully delivering transformational medicines to patients. We are developing new medicines in the following core therapeutic areas: (1) oncology with a priority in certain tumor types; (2) immunoscience with priorities in psoriasis, lupus, RA and inflammatory bowel disease; (3) cardiovascular with a priority in heart disease and; (4) fibrotic disease with priorities in lung and liver. We continue to advance the next wave of innovative medicines by investing significantly in our pipeline both internally and through business development activities. We expect that our planned acquisition of Celgene will further position us as a leading biopharmaceutical company, expanding our oncology and immunoscience portfolios with several near-term assets and additional external partnerships. We continue to invest in our IO portfolio by pursuing both monotherapy and combination approaches, and advancing our next wave of early assets. We entered into several new collaboration agreements across our therapeutic areas of focus and expanded others to research and develop Opdivo and other approved or investigational oncology agents in combination regimens. We remain focused and well-resourced in our cancer development programs and seek to broaden the use of Opdivo in earlier lines of therapy, expand into new tumors, accelerate next wave IO mechanisms and develop treatment options for refractory IO patients. Beyond cancer, we continue to advance our early stage portfolio in immunoscience, cardiovascular and fibrotic diseases and strengthen our partnerships with a diverse group of companies and academic institutions in new and expanded research activities. We believe our differentiated internal and external focus contributes to the advancing of our pipeline of potentially transformational medicines. Our commercial model has been evolving and revenues from our prioritized brands continue to grow which demonstrates strong execution of our strategy. We continue to drive growth of Opdivo by expanding into additional indications and tumor types both as a monotherapy and in combination with Yervoy and other anti-cancer agents. Eliquis continues to grow, leveraging its best in class clinical profile and extensive real world data and is now the number one novel oral anticoagulant in total prescriptions in the U.S. We are building on the continued success of our other prioritized brands and remain strongly committed to Orencia and Sprycel . Through our operating model transformation, our commercial infrastructure is uniquely leveraged for potential growth. Our operating model continues to evolve and we have been successful in focusing commercial, R&D and manufacturing resources on prioritized brands and markets, strengthening our R&D capabilities in tumor biology, patient selection and new biomarkers, delivering leaner administrative functions and streamlining our manufacturing network to reflect the importance of biologics in our current and future portfolio. The evolution in our operating model, which focuses on maintaining a disciplined approach in marketing, selling and administrative expenses, will enable us to deliver the necessary strategic, financial and operational flexibility to invest in the highest priority opportunities within our portfolio. Looking ahead, we will continue to implement our biopharma strategy by driving the growth of prioritized brands, executing product launches, investing in our diverse and innovative pipeline, aided by strategic business development, focusing on prioritized markets, increasing investments in our biologics manufacturing capabilities and maintaining a culture of continuous improvement. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Licensing and Collaboration Arrangements Acquisitions, divestitures, licensing and collaboration arrangements allow us to focus our resources behind our growth opportunities that drive the greatest long-term value. We are focused on the following core therapeutic areas: oncology, including IO, immunoscience, cardiovascular and fibrosis.

(b) Foreign exchange impacts were derived by applying the prior period average currency rates to the current period sales. U.S. revenues in 2018 were impacted by higher demand for Opdivo and Eliquis partially offset by lower demand for established brands due to increased competition, primarily HIV brands and Daklinza . The higher growth rate in the U.S. was due to additional indication approvals for Opdivo . Average U.S. net selling prices in 2018 were unchanged after charge-backs, rebates and discounts. Refer to Product Revenues Commentary for additional information. Europe revenues in 2018 were impacted by higher demand for Eliquis and Opdivo and foreign exchange, partially offset by lower demand for established brands due to increased competition and lower average net selling prices. Rest of the World revenues in 2018 were impacted by lower demand for established brands due to increased competition, lower average net selling prices and foreign exchange, partially offset by higher demand for Opdivo and Eliquis . U.S. revenues in 2017 were impacted by higher demand for Eliquis and Opdivo partially offset by lower demand for established brands due to increased competition, primarily Daklinza and HIV brands. Average U.S. net selling prices were approximately 2% higher after charge-backs, rebates and discounts. Refer to Product Revenues Commentary for additional information. Europe revenues in 2017 were impacted by higher demand for Opdivo and Eliquis partially offset by lower demand for Daklinza due to increased competition and lower average net selling prices. Rest of the World revenues in 2017 were impacted by lower demand for established brands, including Daklinza , due to increased competition and out-licensing of a mature brand product, partially offset by higher demand for Opdivo and Eliquis and lower average net selling prices. No single country outside the U.S. contributed more than 10% of total revenues in 2018, 2017 and 2016. 33 GTN Adjustments We recognize revenue net of GTN adjustments that are further described in Critical Accounting Policies. The activities and ending reserve balances for each significant category of GTN adjustments were as follows: Dollars in Millions Charge-Backs and Cash Discounts Medicaid and Medicare Rebates Other Rebates, Returns, Discounts and Adjustments Total Balance at January 1, 2017 $ 126 $ 520 $ 1,160 $ 1,806 Provision related to sale made in: Current period 2,087 2,090 2,135 6,312 Prior period (3 ) (4 ) (64 ) (71 ) Payments and returns (2,004 ) (1,810 ) (2,107 ) (5,921 ) Foreign currency translation and other 3 104 107 Balance at December 31, 2017 $ 209 $ 796 $ 1,228 $ 2,233 Provision related to sale made in: Current period 2,738 3,258 2,693 8,689 Prior period (3 ) (33 ) (60 ) (96 ) Payments and returns (2,695 ) (2,960 ) (2,424 ) (8,079 ) Assets/related liabilities held-for-sale (28 ) (28 ) Foreign currency translation and other (4 ) (53 ) (57 ) Balance at December 31, 2018 $ 245 $ 1,061 $ 1,356 $ 2,662 The reconciliation of gross product sales to net product sales by each significant category of GTN adjustments was as follows: Year Ended December 31, % Change Dollars in Millions 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Gross product sales $ 30,174 $ 25,499 $ 22,364 18 % 14 % GTN Adjustments Charge-backs and cash discounts (2,735 ) (2,084 ) (1,582 ) 31 % 32 % Medicaid and Medicare rebates (3,225 ) (2,086 ) (1,382 ) 55 % 51 % Other rebates, returns, discounts and adjustments (2,633 ) (2,071 ) (1,698 ) 27 % 22 % Total GTN Adjustments (8,593 ) (6,241 ) (4,662 ) 38 % 34 % Net product sales $ 21,581 $ 19,258 $ 17,702 12 % 9 % GTN adjustments percentage 28 % 24 % 21 % 4 % 3 % U.S. 36 % 31 % 26 % 5 % 5 % Non-U.S. 13 % 13 % 13 % GTN adjustments are primarily a function of product sales volume, regional and payer channel mix, contractual or legislative discounts and rebates. GTN adjustments are increasing at a higher rate than gross product sales due to higher U.S. Eliquis gross product sales, which has a relatively high GTN adjustment percentage as a result of competitive pressures to maintain its position on healthcare payer formularies allowing patients continued access through their medical plans. 34 Product Revenues Year Ended December 31, % Change Dollars in Millions 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Prioritized Brands Opdivo $ 6,735 $ 4,948 $ 3,774 36 % 31 % U.S. 4,239 3,102 2,664 37 % 16 % Non-U.S. 2,496 1,846 1,110 35 % 66 % Eliquis 6,438 4,872 3,343 32 % 46 % U.S. 3,760 2,887 1,963 30 % 47 % Non-U.S. 2,678 1,985 1,380 35 % 44 % Orencia 2,710 2,479 2,265 9 % 9 % U.S. 1,875 1,704 1,532 10 % 11 % Non-U.S. 835 775 733 8 % 6 % Sprycel 2,000 2,005 1,824 10 % U.S. 1,091 1,105 969 (1 )% 14 % Non-U.S. 909 900 855 1 % 5 % Yervoy 1,330 1,244 1,053 7 % 18 % U.S. 941 908 802 4 % 13 % Non-U.S. 389 336 251 16 % 34 % Empliciti 247 231 150 7 % 54 % U.S. 164 151 133 9 % 14 % Non-U.S. 83 80 17 4 % ** Established Brands Baraclude 744 1,052 1,192 (29 )% (12 )% U.S. 32 53 66 (40 )% (20 )% Non-U.S. 712 999 1,126 (29 )% (11 )% Reyataz Franchise 427 698 912 (39 )% (23 )% U.S. 157 327 484 (52 )% (32 )% Non-U.S. 270 371 428 (27 )% (13 )% Sustiva Franchise 283 729 1,065 (61 )% (32 )% U.S. 27 622 901 (96 )% (31 )% Non-U.S. 256 107 164 ** (35 )% Hepatitis C Franchise 17 406 1,578 (96 )% (74 )% U.S. (16 ) 109 827 ** (87 )% Non-U.S. 33 297 751 (89 )% (60 )% Other Brands 1,630 2,112 2,271 (23 )% (7 )% U.S. 316 390 379 (19 )% 3 % Non-U.S. 1,314 1,722 1,892 (24 )% (9 )% Total Revenues 22,561 20,776 19,427 9 % 7 % U.S. 12,586 11,358 10,720 11 % 6 % Non-U.S. 9,975 9,418 8,707 6 % 8 % ** Change in excess of 100% 35 Opdivo (nivolumab) a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 on T and NKT cells that has been approved for several anti-cancer indications including bladder, blood, colon, head and neck, kidney, liver, lung, melanoma and stomach and continues to be investigated across other tumor types and disease areas. U.S. revenues increased in both periods due to higher demand. The higher growth rate in 2018 was primarily due to the approvals for the treatment of adjuvant melanoma, liver cancer and the Opdivo+Yervoy combination for kidney cancer, which is partially offset by the decline in lung cancer indication. International revenues increased in both periods due to higher demand as a result of approvals for additional indications and launches in new countries. The lower growth rate in 2018 was primarily due to additional competition for Opdivo in the NSCLC indication. Eliquis (apixaban) an oral Factor Xa inhibitor, targeted at stroke prevention in adult patients with NVAF and the prevention and treatment of VTE disorders. U.S. revenues increased in both periods due to market share gains partially offset by lower average net selling prices. International revenues increased in both periods due to higher demand attributed to market share gains and growth of the novel oral anticoagulants market. Orencia (abatacept) a fusion protein indicated for adult patients with moderate to severe active RA and PsA and is also indicated for reducing signs and symptoms in certain pediatric patients with moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA. U.S. revenues increased in both periods due to higher demand and higher average net selling prices. International revenues increased in both periods due to higher demand. We may experience additional competition in Europe from biosimilars of competitor products in future periods. Sprycel (dasatinib) an oral inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinase indicated for the first-line treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML in chronic phase and the treatment of adults with chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy, including Gleevec* (imatinib mesylate). U.S. revenues decreased in 2018 due to inventory workdown offset by higher average net selling prices. U.S. revenues increased in 2017 due to higher demand and higher average net selling prices. International revenues remained unchanged in 2018. International revenues increased in 2017 due to higher demand. We may experience a decline in European revenues in the event that generic datasinib product enters the market. Yervoy (ipilimumab) a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. U.S. revenues increased in both periods due to higher demand. Revenue growth rate in 2018 decreased due to lower demand resulting from other IO products being used in the adjuvant treatment of patients with melanoma, including Opdivo . International revenues increased in both periods due to higher demand primarily in Europe following the approval of the Opdivo+Yervoy combination therapy for melanoma. Baraclude (entecavir) an oral antiviral agent for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. International revenues decreased in both periods due to lower demand resulting from increased competition. Reyataz (atazanavir sulfate) Franchise Includes Reyataz - a protease inhibitor for the treatment of HIV and Evotaz (atazanavir 300 mg and cobicistat 150 mg) - a combination therapy containing Reyataz and Tybost* (cobicistat). The LOE for Reyataz in the U.S. occurred in December 2017, as a result revenues will continue to decline. International revenues decreased in both periods due to lower demand resulting from increased competition. Sustiva (efavirenz) Franchise a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV, which includes Sustiva , an antiretroviral drug, and bulk efavirenz, which is also included in the combination therapy, Atripla*. The LOE for Sustiva in the U.S. occurred in December 2017. Gilead terminated BMS's participation in the U.S. and Canada joint venture following the launch of a generic version of Sustiva in the U.S. As a result, BMS's share of Atripla * revenues will further decline during the next two years. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements Note 3. Alliances for further discussion. International revenues for 2018 include $ 204 million of U.S. Atripla * royalty revenue. 36 Hepatitis C Franchise Daklinza (daclatasvir) - an NS5A replication complex inhibitor; Sunvepra (asunaprevir) - an NS3 protease inhibitor; and beclabuvir - an NS5B inhibitor. U.S. and international revenues decreased in both periods due to lower demand resulting from increased competition. Other Brands includes all other brands, including those which have lost exclusivity in major markets, OTC brands and royalty revenue. International revenues decreased in 2018 primarily due to lower Plavix* royalties as a result of the adoption of amended revenue guidance, the expiration of rights to Abilify* in Canada, lower diabetes product supply sales and continued generic erosion. The revenue decrease in 2017 was due to out-licensing and divestiture of certain other brands and continued generic erosion. Estimated End-User Demand Pursuant to the SEC Consent Order described under SEC Consent Order , we monitor the level of inventory on hand in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel and outside of the U.S. in the direct customer distribution channel. We are obligated to disclose products with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception. Estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel in excess of one month on hand for the following products were not material to our results of operations as of the dates indicated. At December 31, 2018 , Daklinza had 6 months of inventory on hand in the U.S. as a result of minimum required stock levels to support patient demand. We expect inventory on hand levels of Daklinza to exceed one month over the near term. Below are international products that had estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel in excess of one month on hand at September 30, 2018 . Dafalgan , an analgesic product sold principally in Europe, had 1.2 months of inventory on hand internationally at direct customers compared to 1.3 months of inventory on hand at June 30, 2018. The level of inventory on hand was primarily due to the ordering patterns of pharmacists in France. Efferalgan , an analgesic product sold principally in Europe, had 1.7 months of inventory on hand internationally at direct customers compared to also 1.4 months of inventory on hand at June 30, 2018. The level of inventory on hand was primarily due to the ordering patterns of pharmacists in France. Fervex , a cold and flu product, had 1.3 months of inventory on hand at direct customers compared to 1.5 months of inventory on hand at June 30, 2018. The level of inventory on hand was primarily due to the ordering patterns of pharmacists in France. Daklinza , a Hepatitis C product, had 1.2 months of inventory on hand internationally at direct customers compared to 1.4 months of inventory on hand at June 30, 2018. The level of inventory on hand was attributable to low volume in-market sales in Canada. Perfalgan , an analgesic product, had 1.3 months of inventory on hand internationally at direct customers compared to 1.5 months of inventory on hand at June 30, 2018. The level of inventory on hand was primarily in the Gulf Countries due to extended delivery lead time. Sustiva , an HIV product, had 1.1 months of inventory on hand internationally at direct customers compared to 1.0 months of inventory on hand at June 30, 2018. The level of inventory on hand was attributable to low volume in-market sales in Canada. In the U.S., we generally determine our months on hand estimates using inventory levels of product on hand and the amount of out-movement provided by our three largest wholesalers, which account for approximately 97% of total gross sales of U.S. products. Factors that may influence our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, wholesaler purchases in light of increases in wholesaler list prices, new product launches, new warehouse openings by wholesalers and new customer stockings by wholesalers. In addition, these estimates are calculated using third-party data, which may be impacted by their recordkeeping processes. 37 Our non-U.S. businesses have significantly more direct customers. Information on available direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information varies widely. We limit our direct customer sales channel inventory reporting to where we can influence demand. When this information does not exist or is otherwise not available, we have developed a variety of methodologies to estimate such data, including using historical sales made to direct customers and third-party market research data related to prescription trends and end-user demand. Given the difficulties inherent in estimating third-party demand information, we evaluate our methodologies to estimate direct customer product level inventory and to calculate months on hand on an ongoing basis and make changes as necessary. Factors that may affect our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, price increases, new product launches, new warehouse openings by direct customers, new customer stockings by direct customers and expected direct customer purchases for governmental bidding situations. As such, all of the information required to estimate months on hand in the direct customer distribution channel for non-U.S. business for the year ended December 31, 2018 is not available prior to the filing of this 2018 Form 10-K. We will disclose any product with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception, in the next quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Expenses % Change Dollar in Millions 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Cost of products sold $ 6,547 $ 6,094 $ 4,969 7 % 23 % Marketing, selling and administrative 4,551 4,751 4,979 (4 )% (5 )% Research and development 6,345 6,482 5,012 (2 )% 29 % Other income (net) (850 ) (1,682 ) (1,448 ) (49 )% 16 % Total Expenses $ 16,593 $ 15,645 $ 13,512 6 % 16 % Cost of products sold Cost of products sold include material, internal labor and overhead costs from our owned manufacturing sites, third-party product supply costs and other supply chain costs managed by our global manufacturing and supply organization. Cost of products sold also includes royalties and profit sharing, certain excise taxes, foreign currency hedge settlement gains and losses and the amortization of acquired developed technology costs. Cost of products sold typically vary between periods as a result of product mix and volume (particularly royalties and profit sharing), and to a lesser extent changes in foreign currency, price, inflation and costs attributed to manufacturing site exits. Cost of products sold increased in 2018 due to higher royalties and profit sharing of $905 million resulting primarily from higher Eliquis sales partially offset by product cost improvements, a $146 million impairment charge in 2017 to reduce the carrying value of the small molecule active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing operations in Swords, Ireland, and lower inventory charges. Cost of products sold increased in 2017 due to higher royalties and profit sharing of $753 million resulting primarily from higher Eliquis sales and a $146 million impairment charge as discussed above. The remaining increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, inventory charges, manufacturing startup costs and foreign currency. Marketing, selling and administrative Marketing, selling and administrative expenses primarily include salary and benefit costs, third-party professional and marketing fees, outsourcing fees, shipping and handling costs, advertising and product promotion. Expenses are managed through regional commercialization organizations or global enabling functions such as finance, legal, information technology and human resources. Certain expenses are shared with alliance partners based upon contractual agreements. Expenses typically vary between periods due to new product launch promotional activities. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses decreased in 2018 due to lower advertising, promotion and marketing expenses, lower costs attributed to transformation initiatives and lower branded prescription drug fee, partially offset by higher BMS foundation grants. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses decreased in 2017 due to lower advertising, promotion and sales-force expenses supporting Daklinza and other established brands and lower BMS foundation grants. 38 Research and development Research and development activities include discovery research, preclinical and clinical development, drug formulation and medical support of marketed products. Expenses include salary and benefit costs, third-party grants and fees paid to clinical research organizations, supplies, upfront and contingent milestone payments for licensing and asset acquisitions of investigational compounds, IPRD impairment charges and proportionate allocations of enterprise-wide costs. The allocations include facilities, information technology, employee stock compensation costs and other appropriate costs. Certain expenses are shared with alliance partners based upon contractual agreements. Expenses typically vary between periods for a number of reasons, including the timing of license and asset acquisition charges and IPRD impairment charges. Research and development expense decreased in 2018 due to lower site exit costs and IPRD impairment charges, partially offset by expansion of Opdivo and other IO development programs, including NKTR-214. Research and development expense increased in 2017 due to higher license and asset acquisition charges, site exit charges, IPRD impairment charges and expansion of Opdivo and other IO development programs. Significant charges included in R&D expense were as follows: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions 2018 2017 2016 Nektar $ 1,050 (a) $ $ Cormorant 60 (b) 35 (a) IFM 25 (b) 311 (a) CytomX 200 (a) 25 (a) Halozyme 105 (a) Flexus 324 (b) 100 (b) Cardioxyl 100 (b) PsiOxus 50 (a) Ono 40 (a) Padlock 139 (a) Nitto Denko 100 (a) Other 40 License and asset acquisition charges 1,135 1,130 439 F-Star 75 Other 13 IPRD impairments 75 13 Site exit costs 79 383 83 Research and development significant charges $ 1,214 $ 1,588 $ 535 (a) Upfront payment (b) Milestone payment License and asset acquisition charges resulted from strategic transactions to acquire or license certain investigational oncology, cardiovascular, immunoscience and fibrotic disease compounds (or options to acquire or license) as disclosed in Acquisitions, Divestitures, Licensing and Collaboration Arrangements. IPRD impairment charges includes the discontinued development of an investigational compound which was part of our alliance with F-Star in 2017. Site exit costs resulted from the expected exit of R&D sites in the U.S. through 2020 primarily due to the reduction in the estimated useful lives of the related assets and an impairment charge in 2017 to reduce the carrying value of an R&D facility in Wallingford, Connecticut. 39 Other income (net) Other income (net) decreased in 2018 primarily due to losses on equity investments related to Nektar and a patent infringement settlement in 2017 partially offset by lower restructuring and debt redemption charges. Other income (net) increased in 2017 primarily due to a patent infringement settlement and out-licensing income partially offset by lower divestiture gains and related service fees and higher restructuring and debt redemption charges. Components of other income (net) were as follows: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions 2018 2017 2016 Interest expense $ 183 $ 196 $ 167 Investment income (173 ) (126 ) (97 ) Loss/(gain) on equity investments 512 (23 ) 37 Provision for restructuring 131 293 109 Litigation and other settlements 76 (487 ) 47 Equity in net income of affiliates (93 ) (75 ) (77 ) Divestiture gains (178 ) (164 ) (576 ) Royalties and licensing income (1,353 ) (1,351 ) (719 ) Transition and other service fees (12 ) (37 ) (238 ) Pension and postretirement (27 ) (1 ) (72 ) Intangible asset impairment 64 15 Loss on debt redemption 109 Other 20 (16 ) (44 ) Other income (net) $ (850 ) $ (1,682 ) $ (1,448 ) Loss/(gain) on equity investments includes a fair value adjustment of $534 million related to the Company's equity investment in Nektar in 2018. Restructuring charges relate to changes to the Company's operating model to drive continued success in the near- and long-term through a more focused investment in commercial opportunities for key brands and markets, a competitive and more agile R&D organization that can accelerate the pipeline, streamline operations and realign manufacturing capabilities that broaden biologics capabilities to reflect the current and future portfolio as well as streamline and simplify our small-molecule supply network. The new operating model is expected to enable the Company to deliver the strategic, financial and operational flexibility necessary to invest in the highest priorities across the Company. Aggregate restructuring charges of $268 million and $826 million have been incurred in 2018 and 2017, respectively, for all actions including accelerated depreciation and impairment charges resulting from early site exits. Litigation and other settlements include $481 million for BMS's share of a patent-infringement settlement related to Merck's PD-1 antibody Keytruda* in 2017 and $70 million related to intellectual property and product liability settlements in 2018, including $42 million recognized subsequent to the Company's earnings release for the fourth quarter of 2018. Divestiture gains includes divestiture of multiple mature global product lines in oncology and infectious therapy in 2018, additional contingent consideration for the diabetes business in 2017 and certain OTC brands and investigational HIV medicines businesses in 2016. Royalties and licensing income includes Keytruda* royalties in 2018 and 2017, upfront licensing fees from Biogen and Roche in connection with the out-licensing of certain investigational genetically defined disease compounds in 2017 and contingent consideration from the Erbitux* and diabetes business divestitures in 2018, 2017 and 2016, including the transfer of certain royalty rights pertaining to diabetes product sales. A $50 million fee for amending a royalty rate and $25 million sales-based milestone was also included in 2018. Transition and other service fees included fees resulting from the divestiture of the diabetes and investigational HIV medicines businesses in 2017 and 2016. Pension and postretirement includes the interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization components of the net periodic benefit cost (credit) as well as net charges for settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits of $121 million in 2018, $162 million in 2017 and $92 million in 2016. Intangible asset impairment includes $64 million in 2018 for an out-licensed asset obtained in the 2010 acquisition of ZymoGenetics, Inc., which did not meet its primary endpoint in a Phase II clinical study. A debt redemption loss of $109 million resulted from the early redemption of certain long-term debt obligations in 2017. 40 Income Taxes Dollars in Millions 2018 2017 2016 Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 5,968 $ 5,131 $ 5,915 Provision for Income Taxes 1,021 4,156 1,408 Effective Tax Rate 17.1 % 81.0 % 23.8 % Impact of Specified Items 60.0 % 1.8 % Changes in the effective tax rate was primarily due to new U.S. tax reform legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Act) enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act moved from a worldwide tax system to a quasi-territorial tax system and was comprised of broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code including, but not limited to, (1) reduced the U.S. tax rate from 35% to 21%; (2) added a deemed repatriation transition tax on certain foreign earnings and profits; (3) generally eliminated U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) included certain income of controlled foreign companies in U.S. taxable income (GILTI); (5) created a new minimum tax referred to as a base erosion anti-abuse income tax; (6) limited certain research-based credits; and (7) eliminated the domestic manufacturing deduction. Although many aspects of the Act were not effective until 2018, additional tax expense of $2.9 billion was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 upon enactment of the Act. The additional expense increased the effective tax rate by 56.7% and included a $2.6 billion one-time deemed repatriation transition tax on previously untaxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits (including related tax reserves). Those earnings were effectively taxed at a 15.5% rate to the extent that the specified foreign corporations held cash and certain other assets and an 8.0% rate on the remaining earnings and profits. The remaining $285 million of additional tax expense included an adjustment to measure net deferred tax assets at the new U.S. tax rate of 21%. The accounting for the reduction of deferred tax assets to the 21% tax rate was complete as of December 31, 2017. The provisional tax charge for the deemed repatriation transition tax was reduced by $56 million in 2018 upon completion of the accounting which reduced the effective tax rate by 0.9% . In addition, the tax impact attributed to specified items, including non-deductible R&D charges, valuation allowances for certain tax assets resulting from equity investment losses and other jurisdiction tax rates increased the effective tax rate by 0.9% in 2018, 3.3% in 2017 and 1.8% in 2016. After considering the impact of specified items including the transitional impacts of the Act discussed above, the effective tax rate decreased by 3.9% in 2018 primarily due to the on-going impact of the Act and tax reserve releases partially offset by taxes attributed to internal cash repatriations and earnings mix between high and low tax jurisdictions. After considering the impact of specified items, the effective tax rate decreased by 1.0% in 2017 primarily due to the adoption of amended income tax accounting guidance related to share-based payments and the early adoption of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory partially offset by earnings mix between high and low tax jurisdictions. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 7 . Income Taxes for further information. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Our non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information, are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that are evaluated on an individual basis. These items are adjusted after considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects and typically have one or more of the following characteristics, such as being highly variable, difficult to project, unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of future operating results. Similar charges or gains were recognized in prior periods and will likely reoccur in future periods including restructuring costs, accelerated depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, R&D charges in connection with the acquisition or licensing of third-party intellectual property rights, divestiture gains or losses, pension, legal and other contractual settlement charges and debt redemption gains or losses, among other items. Deferred and current income taxes attributed to these items are also adjusted for considering their individual impact to the overall tax expense, deductibility and jurisdictional tax rates. Non-GAAP information is intended to portray the results of our baseline performance, supplement or enhance management, analysts and investors' overall understanding of our underlying financial performance and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods. For example, non-GAAP earnings and EPS information is an indication of our baseline performance before items that are considered by us to not be reflective of our ongoing results. In addition, this information is among the primary indicators we use as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets and planning and forecasting for future periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP. 41 Specified items were as follows: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions 2018 2017 2016 Impairment charges $ 17 $ 146 $ Accelerated depreciation and other shutdown costs 41 3 21 Cost of products sold 58 149 21 Marketing, selling and administrative 2 1 License and asset acquisition charges 1,135 1,130 439 IPRD impairments 75 13 Site exit costs 79 383 83 Research and development 1,214 1,588 535 Loss/(gain) on equity investments (a) 512 Provision for restructuring 131 293 109 Litigation and other settlements 70 (481 ) 40 Divestiture gains (177 ) (126 ) (559 ) Royalties and licensing income (75 ) (497 ) (10 ) Pension and postretirement 121 162 91 Intangible asset impairment 64 15 Loss on debt redemption 109 Other income (net) 646 (540 ) (314 ) Increase to pretax income 1,920 1,198 242 Income taxes on items above (268 ) (87 ) 51 Income taxes attributed to U.S. tax reform (56 ) 2,911 Income taxes (324 ) 2,824 51 Increase to net earnings 1,596 4,022 293 Noncontrolling interest (59 ) Increase to net earnings used for Diluted Non-GAAP EPS calculation $ 1,596 $ 3,963 $ 293 (a) Specified items included these amounts upon adoption of amended guidance for the recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities in 2018. The reconciliations from GAAP to Non-GAAP were as follows: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions, except per share data 2018 2017 2016 Net Earnings Attributable to BMS used for Diluted EPS Calculation GAAP $ 4,920 $ 1,007 $ 4,457 Specified Items 1,596 3,963 293 Net Earnings Attributable to BMS used for Diluted EPS Calculation Non-GAAP $ 6,516 $ 4,970 $ 4,750 Average Common Shares Outstanding Diluted 1,637 1,652 1,680 Diluted EPS Attributable to BMS GAAP $ 3.01 $ 0.61 $ 2.65 Diluted EPS Attributable to Specified Items 0.97 2.40 0.18 Diluted EPS Attributable to BMS Non-GAAP $ 3.98 $ 3.01 $ 2.83 42 Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources Our net cash position was as follows: Dollars in Millions 2018 2017 Cash and cash equivalents $ 6,911 $ 5,421 Marketable securities current 1,973 1,391 Marketable securities non-current 1,775 2,480 Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 10,659 9,292 Short-term debt obligations (1,703 ) (987 ) Long-term debt (5,646 ) (6,975 ) Net cash position $ 3,310 $ 1,330 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in the U.S. were approximately $9.3 billion at December 31, 2018. Most of the remaining $1.4 billion is held primarily in our international affiliates for local operating needs. We are subject to a one-time deemed repatriation transition tax in which $2.1 billion will be payable over the next eight years as a result of U.S. tax reform. We expect to have more flexibility in accessing cash and future cash that may be generated in foreign subsidiaries. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash generated from operations and issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. will be sufficient to satisfy our normal cash requirements for at least the next few years, including dividends, capital expenditures, milestone payments, working capital, deemed repatriation transition tax and $1.3 billion of debt maturing in 2019. Management continuously evaluates the Company capital structure to ensure the Company is financed efficiently, which may result in the repurchase of common stock and debt securities, termination of interest rate swap contracts prior to maturity and issuance of debt securities. The average amount of commercial paper outstanding was $19 million at a weighted-average rate of 1.27% during 2018. The maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding was $300 million with no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2018 . Dividend payments were $2.6 billion in 2018 and 2017 and $2.5 billion in 2016. Dividend decisions are made on a quarterly basis by our Board of Directors. Annual capital expenditures were approximately $1.0 billion in 2018, $ 1.1 billion in 2017 and $1.2 billion in 2016 and are expected to be approximately $800 million in 2019 and $600 million in 2020. We continue to expand our biologics manufacturing capabilities and other facility-related activities. For example, we constructed a new large-scale biologics manufacturing facility in Ireland that will produce multiple therapies for our growing biologics portfolio when approved for commercial use in early 2020. We also paid $1.85 billion to Nektar in 2018 for certain collaboration rights and 8.3 million shares of its common stock representing a 4.8% ownership interest. Our investment portfolio includes non-current marketable securities, which are subject to changes in fair value as a result of interest rate fluctuations and other market factors. Our investment policy establishes limits on the amount and time to maturity of investments with any institution. The policy also requires that investments are only entered into with corporate and financial institutions that meet high credit quality standards. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 9 . Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements for further information. As of December 31, 2018, we had three revolving credit facilities totaling $5.0 billion , which consisted of a 364-day $2.0 billion facility that was scheduled to expire in March 2019 and two five-year $1.5 billion facilities that were extended to September 2022 and July 2023, respectively. All of these facilities provide for customary terms and conditions with no financial covenants and our two $1.5 billion revolving facilities are extendable annually by one year on the anniversary date with the consent of the lenders. No borrowings were outstanding under any of these revolving facilities as of December 31, 2018 or 2017. In connection with our pending acquisition of Celgene, in January 2019 we entered into a bridge commitment letter that provides for up to $33.5 billion in a 364-day senior unsecured bridge loan facility. We also entered into an $8 billion term loan credit agreement consisting of a $1 billion 364-day tranche, a $4 billion three-year tranche and a $3 billion five-year tranche. The term loan reduced the commitments under the bridge facility to $25.5 billion . If we obtain additional funding by issuing securities or obtaining other loans, the amount of the bridge facility will be correspondingly reduced. The bridge loan and the term loan are subject to customary terms and conditions and do not have any financial covenants. No amounts will be borrowed under either the bridge loan or the term loan prior to the closing of the pending acquisition of Celgene. In January 2019, we also entered into two new revolving credit facilities totaling $3.0 billion : a 364-day $2.0 billion facility expiring in January 2020 and a three-year $1.0 billion facility expiring in January 2022. The 364-day $2.0 billion facility replaced our existing 364-day $2.0 billion revolving facility, which was terminated concurrently upon the effectiveness of the new 364-day facility, and supports our commercial paper borrowings, if any. Each of these facilities provide for customary terms and conditions with no financial covenants. 43 No borrowings were outstanding under these two revolving facilities or on our two $1.5 billion revolving facilities as of February 25, 2019. Following the announcement of our pending acquisition of Celgene, we also entered into forward starting interest rate swap option contracts (swaptions), with a total notional value of $7.6 billion , to hedge future interest rate risk associated with the anticipated issuance of long-term debt to fund the acquisition. The swaptions provide us with the right to enter into forward starting interest rate swap contracts for periods of 10 and 30 years through January 2020. Additional regulations in the U.S. could be passed in the future including additional healthcare reform initiatives, further changes to tax laws, additional pricing laws and potential importation restrictions which may reduce our results of operations, operating cash flow, liquidity and financial flexibility. We continue to monitor the potential impact of the economic conditions in certain European and other countries and the related impact on prescription trends, pricing discounts and creditworthiness of our customers. We believe these economic conditions will not have a material impact on our liquidity, cash flow or financial flexibility. The UK voted to depart from the EU during June 2016. Similar to other companies in our industry, certain regulatory, trade, labor and other aspects of our business will likely be affected over time. However, we currently do not believe that these matters and other related financial effects will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Our sales in the UK represent less than 3% of our consolidated revenues. Credit Ratings In January 2019, Moody's placed BMS under review for downgrade and Standard & Poor's placed BMS on CreditWatch with negative implications, each following the announcement to acquire Celgene. BMS's current long-term and short-term credit ratings assigned by Moody's Investors Service are A2 and Prime-1, respectively, and BMS's current long-term and short-term credit ratings assigned by Standard & Poor's are A+ and A-1+, respectively. The long-term ratings reflect the agencies' opinion that we have a low default risk but are somewhat susceptible to adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions. The short-term ratings reflect the agencies' opinion that we have good to extremely strong capacity for timely repayment. Any credit rating downgrade may affect the interest rate of any debt we may incur, the fair market value of existing debt and our ability to access the capital markets generally. The current long-term and short-term ratings do not reflect any impact from the proposed acquisition of Celgene. Cash Flows The following is a discussion of cash flow activities: Dollars in Millions 2018 2017 2016 Cash flow provided by/(used in): Operating activities $ 5,940 $ 5,275 $ 3,058 Investing activities (874 ) (66 ) 1,480 Financing activities (3,535 ) (4,077 ) (2,653 ) Operating Activities Cash flow from operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements from all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting net earnings for noncontrolling interest, non-cash operating items, gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities and changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting from timing differences between the receipts and payments of cash and when the transactions are recognized in our results of operations. As a result, changes in cash from operating activities reflect the timing of cash collections from customers and alliance partners; payments to suppliers, alliance partners and employees; customer discounts and rebates; and tax payments in the ordinary course of business. For example, annual employee bonuses are typically paid in the first quarter of the subsequent year. In addition, cash collections continue to be impacted by longer payment terms for certain biologic products in the U.S., primarily our newer oncology products including Opdivo , Yervoy and Empliciti (90 days to 120 days). The longer payment terms are used to more closely align with the insurance reimbursement timing for physicians and cancer centers following administration to the patients. 44 The $700 million change in cash flow from operating activities compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to: Higher cash collections and timing of payments in the ordinary course of business of approximately $2.2 billion . Partially offset by: Higher R&D licensing and collaboration payments of approximately $600 million primarily due to the Nektar transaction in 2018; Lower litigation settlement proceeds of approximately $500 million primarily due to the Merck settlement in 2017; and Lower out-license proceeds of approximately $400 million primarily due to the Biogen and Roche transactions in 2017. The $2.2 billion change in cash flow from operating activities compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to: Higher cash collections and timing of payments in the ordinary course of business of approximately $400 million ; Lower income tax payments of approximately $1.5 billion ; Litigation settlement proceeds of approximately $500 million primarily due to the Merck settlement; and Out-licensing proceeds of $500 million primarily due to the Biogen and Roche transactions. Partially offset by: Higher R&D licensing payments of approximately $400 million primarily due to the CytomX, Halozyme and Nitto Denko transactions; and Higher contributions to pension plans of approximately $300 million . Investing Activities Cash requirements from investing activities include cash used for acquisitions, manufacturing and facility-related capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities with original maturities greater than 90 days at the time of purchase reduced by proceeds from business divestitures (including royalties) and the sale and maturity of marketable securities. The $800 million change in cash flow from investing activities compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to: Lower net sales and maturities of marketable securities with maturities greater than 90 days of approximately $900 million ; and Higher net acquisition and other payments of approximately $500 million primarily due to the purchase of 8.3 million shares of Nektar common stock in 2018. Partially offset by: Higher business divestiture proceeds of approximately $500 million primarily due to the divestiture of manufacturing operations in Swords, Ireland and certain mature brands. The $1.5 billion change in cash flow from investing activities compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to: Lower net sales of marketable securities with maturities greater than 90 days of approximately $700 million ; Lower business divestiture proceeds of approximately $600 million primarily due to certain OTC brands and investigational HIV medicines businesses in 2016; and Higher asset acquisition payments of approximately $300 million primarily due to the acquisition of IFM in 2017. Financing Activities Cash requirements from financing activities include cash used to pay dividends, repurchase common stock and repay long-term debt and other borrowings reduced by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of long-term debt and other borrowings. The $500 million change in cash flow from financing activities compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to: Lower repurchases of common stock of $2.1 billion primarily due to the accelerated share repurchase agreements in 2017. Partially offset by: Lower net borrowings of $1.5 billion primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt used to repurchase common stock in 2017. The $1.4 billion change in cash flow from financing activities compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to: Higher repurchase of common stock of $2.2 billion primarily due to the accelerated share repurchase agreements. Partially offset by: Higher net borrowing activity of $900 million primarily to fund the repurchase of common stock. 45 Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Payments due by period for our contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 were as follows: Obligations Expiring by Period Dollars in Millions Total 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Later Years Short-term borrowings $ 454 $ 454 $ $ $ $ $ Long-term debt 6,776 1,250 750 817 3,959 Interest on long-term debt (a) 2,832 192 183 183 183 167 1,924 Operating leases 663 122 92 77 69 61 242 Purchase obligations 3,074 1,087 620 430 353 291 293 Uncertain tax positions (b) 72 72 Deemed repatriation transition tax 2,119 79 101 196 196 299 1,248 Total (c) $ 15,990 $ 3,256 $ 996 $ 886 $ 1,551 $ 1,635 $ 7,666 (a) Includes estimated future interest payments and periodic cash settlements of derivatives. (b) Includes only short-term uncertain tax benefits because of uncertainties regarding the timing of resolution. (c) Excludes pension and other liabilities because of uncertainties regarding the timing of resolution. In addition to the above, we are committed to an aggregated $14.0 billion of potential future research and development milestone payments to third parties for in-licensing, asset acquisitions and development programs including early-stage milestones of $5.5 billion (milestones achieved through Phase III clinical studies) and late-stage milestones of $8.5 billion (milestones achieved post Phase III clinical studies). Payments generally are due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental and regulatory milestones for which the specific timing cannot be predicted. Some of these agreements also provide for sales-based milestones aggregating $4.4 billion that we would be obligated to pay to alliance partners upon achievement of certain sales levels in addition to royalties. We also have certain manufacturing, development and commercialization obligations in connection with alliance arrangements. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of these obligations. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 3 . Alliances for further information regarding our alliances. We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our financial condition or results of operations. SEC Consent Order / FCPA Settlement As previously disclosed, on August 4, 2004, we entered into a final settlement with the SEC, concluding an investigation concerning certain wholesaler inventory and accounting matters. The settlement was reached through a Consent, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 10 to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2004. Under the terms of the Consent, we agreed, subject to certain defined exceptions, to limit sales of all products sold to our direct customers (including wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, retail outlets, pharmacies and government purchasers) based on expected demand or on amounts that do not exceed approximately one month of inventory on hand, without making a timely public disclosure of any change in practice. We also agreed in the Consent to certain measures that we have implemented including: (a) establishing a formal review and certification process of our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC; (b) establishing a business risk and disclosure group; (c) retaining an outside consultant to comprehensively study and help re-engineer our accounting and financial reporting processes; (d) publicly disclosing any sales incentives offered to direct customers for the purpose of inducing them to purchase products in excess of expected demand; and (e) ensuring that our budget process gives appropriate weight to inputs that come from the bottom to the top, and not just from the top to the bottom, and adequately documenting that process. We have established a company-wide policy to limit our sales to direct customers for the purpose of complying with the Consent. This policy includes the adoption of various procedures to monitor and limit sales to direct customers in accordance with the terms of the Consent. These procedures include a governance process to escalate to appropriate management levels potential questions or concerns regarding compliance with the policy and timely resolution of such questions or concerns. In addition, compliance with the policy is monitored on a regular basis. 46 We maintain DSAs with our U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers, which account for nearly 100% of our gross U.S. revenues. Under the current terms of the DSAs, our wholesaler customers provide us with weekly information with respect to months on hand product-level inventories and the amount of out-movement of products. The three largest wholesalers currently account for approximately 97% of our gross U.S. revenues. The inventory information received from our wholesalers, together with our internal information, is used to estimate months on hand product level inventories at these wholesalers. We estimate months on hand product inventory levels for our U.S. business wholesaler customers other than the three largest wholesalers by extrapolating from the months on hand calculated for the three largest wholesalers. In contrast, our non-U.S. business has significantly more direct customers, limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information, where available, varies widely. Accordingly, we rely on a variety of methods to estimate months on hand product level inventories for these business units. We believe the above-described procedures provide a reasonable basis to ensure compliance with the Consent. Recently Issued Accounting Standards For recently issued accounting standards, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 . Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our critical accounting policies are those that significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Because of this uncertainty, actual results may vary from these estimates. Revenue Recognition Our accounting policy for revenue recognition has a substantial impact on reported results and relies on certain estimates. Revenue is recognized following a five-step model: (1) identify the customer contract; (2) identify the contract's performance obligation; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation; and (5) recognize revenue when or as a performance obligation is satisfied. Revenue is also reduced for GTN sales adjustments discussed below, all of which involve significant estimates and judgment after considering legal interpretations of applicable laws and regulations, historical experience, payer channel mix (e.g. Medicare or Medicaid), current contract prices under applicable programs, unbilled claims and processing time lags and inventory levels in the distribution channel. Estimates are assessed each period and adjusted as required to revise information or actual experience. GTN Adjustments The following categories of GTN adjustments involve significant estimates, judgments and information obtained from external sources. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 . Revenue. for further discussion and analysis of each significant category of GTN sales adjustments. Charge-backs and cash discounts Our U.S. business participates in programs with government entities, the most significant of which are the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and other parties, including covered entities under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, whereby pricing on products is extended below wholesaler list price to participating entities. These entities purchase products through wholesalers at the lower program price and the wholesalers then charge us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower program price. Accounts receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of unprocessed charge-back claims attributable to a sale (typically within a two to four week time lag). In the U.S. and certain other countries, cash discounts are offered as an incentive for prompt payment, generally approximating 2% of the sales price. Accounts receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of unprocessed cash discounts (typically within a one month time lag). Medicaid and Medicare rebates Our U.S. business participates in state government Medicaid programs and other qualifying Federal and state government programs requiring discounts and rebates to participating state and local government entities. All discounts and rebates provided through these programs are included in our Medicaid rebate accrual. Medicaid rebates have also been extended to drugs used in managed Medicaid plans. The estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates is presented as a liability. 47 Rebates and discounts are offered to managed healthcare organizations in the U.S. managing prescription drug programs and Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans covering the Medicare Part D drug benefit. We also pay a 50% point of service discount to the CMS when the Medicare Part D beneficiaries are in the coverage gap ( donut hole ). The estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates and discounts is presented as a liability. Other rebates, returns, discounts and adjustments Other GTN sales adjustments include sales returns and all other programs based on applicable laws and regulations for individual non-U.S. countries as well as rebates offered to managed healthcare organizations in the U.S. to a lesser extent. The non-U.S. programs include several different pricing schemes such as cost caps, volume discounts, outcome-based pricing schemes and pricing claw-backs that are based on sales of individual companies or an aggregation of all companies participating in a specific market. The estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates and discounts is presented as a liability. Estimated returns for established products are determined after considering historical experience and other factors including levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product recalls, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, introductions of generic products, introductions of competitive new products and lower demand following the LOE. Estimated returns for new products are determined after considering historical sales return experience of similar products, such as those within the same product line, similar therapeutic area and/or similar distribution model and estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and projected demand. The estimated amount for product returns is presented as a liability. Use of information from external sources Information from external sources is used to estimate GTN adjustments. Our estimate of inventory at the wholesalers are based on the projected prescription demand-based sales for our products and historical inventory experience, as well as our analysis of third-party information, including written and oral information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and sell-through to customers and third-party market research data, and our internal information. The inventory information received from wholesalers is a product of their recordkeeping process and excludes inventory held by intermediaries to whom they sell, such as retailers and hospitals. We have also continued the practice of combining retail and mail prescription volume on a retail-equivalent basis. We use this methodology for internal demand forecasts. We also use information from external sources to identify prescription trends, patient demand and average selling prices. Our estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third-party information, as certain third-party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations including lags between the date as of which third-party information is generated and the date on which we receive third-party information. Pension Benefits Accounting for pension and postretirement benefit plans requires actuarial valuations based on significant assumptions for discount rates and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. In consultation with our actuaries, these significant assumptions and others such as salary growth, retirement, turnover, lump sum election rates, healthcare trends and mortality rates are evaluated and selected based on expectations or actual experience during each remeasurement date. Pension expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings, projected benefit obligations and future cash funding. Actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors. The yield on high quality corporate bonds that coincides with the cash flows of the plans estimated payouts is used in determining the discount rate. The Citi Pension Discount curve is used for the U.S. plans. The present value of benefit obligations at December 31, 2018 for the U.S. pension plans was determined using a 4.1% discount rate. If the assumed discount rate used in determining the U.S. pension plans projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2018 was reduced by an additional 1%, the projected benefit obligation would increase by approximately $500 million. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is estimated considering expected returns for individual asset classes with input from external advisors. We also consider long-term historical returns including actual performance compared to benchmarks for similar investments. The Bristol-Myers Squibb Retirement Income Plan's pension expense for 2018 was determined using an average 6.6% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Other U.S. Plans' pension expense was determined using a 7.8% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining the U.S. plans pension expense for 2018 was reduced by 1%, such expense would increase by $42 million . For a more detailed discussion on retirement benefits, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 16 . Retirement Benefits. 48 Long-lived Assets Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets were $ 1.1 billion at December 31, 2018 , including licenses ( $192 million of which $84 million is allocated to unapproved products), developed technology rights ( $501 million ), capitalized software ( $366 million ) and IPRD ( $32 million ). Intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever current facts or circumstances warrant a review, although IPRD is assessed at least annually. Intangible assets are highly vulnerable to impairment charges, particularly newly acquired assets for recently launched products or IPRD. These assets are initially measured at fair value and therefore any reduction in expectations used in the valuations could potentially lead to impairment. Some of the more common potential risks leading to impairment include competition, earlier than expected LOE, pricing pressures, adverse regulatory changes or clinical study results, delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval and additional development costs, inability to achieve expected synergies, higher operating costs, changes in tax laws and other macro-economic changes. The complexity in estimating the fair value of intangible assets in connection with an impairment test is similar to the initial valuation. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is tested for impairment whenever current facts or circumstances require a review including whether it is more likely than not that the asset will be disposed of prior to its estimated remaining useful life. Additionally, these long-lived assets are periodically reviewed to determine if any change in facts or circumstances would result in a change to the estimated useful life of the asset, possibly resulting in the acceleration of depreciation. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists at its lowest level of identifiable cash flows. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset fair value and its carrying value. Expectations of future cash flows are subject to change based upon the near and long-term production volumes and margins generated by the asset as well as any potential alternative future use. Accelerated depreciation, impairment and other related charges for certain manufacturing and R&D facilities were $137 million in 2018 , $533 million in 2017 and $104 million in 2016 . Additional charges will continue to occur as a result of the Company restructuring actions announced in 2016. Assets Held-for-Sale The following criteria is considered before concluding assets are classified as held-for-sale; (1) management commitment to a plan to sell, (2) availability for immediate sale in its present condition, (3) initiation of an active program to identify a buyer, (4) probability of a completed sale within one year, (5) actively marketed for sale at a reasonable price in relation to its current fair value, and (6) likelihood of significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. If all of the criteria is met as of the balance sheet date, the assets and liabilities are presented separately in the balance sheet as held-for-sale at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated or amortized while classified as held-for-sale. We have classified $479 million of assets and $152 million of liabilities as held-for-sale at December 31, 2018 which are related to the planned sale of the UPSA consumer health business, a division of BMS which manufactures and markets pain treatment and other OTC products for domestic sale in France and export sales outside of France. Income Taxes Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including long-range forecasts of future taxable income and evaluation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made. Our deferred tax assets were $2.1 billion at December 31, 2018 (net of valuation allowances of $3.2 billion ) and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2017 (net of valuation allowances of $2.8 billion ). The U.S. Federal net operating loss carryforwards were $206 million at December 31, 2018 . These carryforwards were acquired as a result of certain acquisitions and are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2022. The foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards expired in varying amounts beginning in 2018 (certain amounts have unlimited lives). As discussed more fully in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 7 . Income Taxes , a provisional tax charge of $2.6 billion attributable to the one-time deemed repatriation transition tax on certain foreign earnings was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017. The accounting for the reduction of deferred tax assets to the 21% tax rate was complete as of December 31, 2017, and the tax charge for the deemed repatriation transition tax is complete as of December 31, 2018. The provisional tax charge for the deemed repatriation transition tax was reduced by $56 million in 2018. 49 Prior to the Mead Johnson split-off in 2009, the following transactions occurred: (i) an internal spin-off of Mead Johnson shares while still owned by us; (ii) conversion of Mead Johnson Class B shares to Class A shares; and (iii) conversion of Mead Johnson & Company to a limited liability company. These transactions as well as the split-off of Mead Johnson through the exchange offer should qualify as tax-exempt transactions under the Internal Revenue Code based upon a private letter ruling received from the Internal Revenue Service related to the conversion of Mead Johnson Class B shares to Class A shares, and outside legal opinions. Certain assumptions, representations and covenants by Mead Johnson were relied upon regarding the future conduct of its business and other matters which could affect the tax treatment of the exchange. For example, the current tax law generally creates a presumption that the exchange would be taxable to us, if Mead Johnson or its shareholders were to engage in transactions that result in a 50% or greater change in its stock ownership during a four year period beginning two years before the exchange offer, unless it is established that the exchange offer were not part of a plan or series of related transactions to effect such a change in ownership. If the internal spin-off or exchange offer were determined not to qualify as a tax exempt transaction, the transaction could be subject to tax as if the exchange was a taxable sale by us at market value. In addition, a negative basis or excess loss account (ELA) existed in our investment in stock of Mead Johnson prior to these transactions. We received an opinion from outside legal counsel to the effect that it is more likely than not that we eliminated the ELA as part of these transactions and do not have taxable income with respect to the ELA. The tax law in this area is complex and it is possible that even if the internal spin-off and the exchange offer is tax exempt under the Internal Revenue Code, the IRS could assert that we have additional taxable income for the period with respect to the ELA. We could be exposed to additional taxes if this were to occur. Based upon our understanding of the Internal Revenue Code and opinion from outside legal counsel, a tax reserve of $244 million was established reducing the gain on disposal of Mead Johnson included in discontinued operations in 2009. We agreed to certain tax related indemnities with Mead Johnson as set forth in the tax sharing agreement, including certain taxes related to its business prior to the completion of the IPO and created as part of the restructuring to facilitate the IPO. Mead Johnson has also agreed to indemnify us for potential tax effects resulting from the breach of certain representations discussed above as well as certain transactions related to the acquisition of Mead Johnson stock or assets. Liabilities are established for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known tax exposures including, but not limited to, transfer pricing matters, tax credits and deductibility of certain expenses. Such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid and may need to be adjusted over time as more information becomes known. For discussions on income taxes, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 . Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards Income Taxes and Note 7 . Income Taxes. Contingencies In the normal course of business, we are subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others, government investigations, shareholder lawsuits, product and environmental liability, contractual claims and tax matters. We recognize accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These estimates are subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, as such, actual results could vary from these estimates. For discussions on contingencies, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 . Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards Contingencies, Note 7 . Income Taxes and Note 18 . Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. 50 Product and Pipeline Developments Our R&D programs are managed on a portfolio basis from early discovery through late-stage development and include a balance of early-stage and late-stage programs to support future growth. Our late stage R&D programs in Phase III development include both investigational compounds for initial indications and additional indications or formulations for marketed products. Spending on these programs represent approximately 35-45% of our annual R&D expenses in the last three years. Opdivo was the only investigational compound or marketed product that represented greater than 10% of our R&D expenses in the last three years. Our late-stage development programs could potentially have an impact on our revenue and earnings within the next few years if regulatory approvals are obtained and products are successfully commercialized. The following are the developments in our marketed products and our late-stage pipeline: Product Indication Date Developments Opdivo Melanoma August 2018 Approval in Japan for treatment of adjuvant melanoma. July 2018 EC approval for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with involvement of lymph nodes or metastatic disease who have undergone complete resection. June 2018 Announced results from the Phase III CheckMate-238 trial evaluating Opdivo versus Yervoy in patients with stage IIIB/C or stage IV melanoma who are at high risk of recurrence following complete surgical resection demonstrated statistically longer recurrence-free survival for Opdivo , the primary endpoint of the study, versus Yervoy at a minimum follow-up of 24 months across key subgroups, including disease stages and BRAF mutation status. Multiple Myeloma June/August 2018 Announced in June 2018 that the FDA lifted a partial clinical hold placed on CheckMate-602, a randomized, open-label Phase III study evaluating the addition of Opdivo to pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.
