Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following management discussion and analysis (MD&A) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen business. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our results of operations discussed in MD&A are presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Amgen operates in one business segment: human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis.

A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be one of the world leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential. Our principal products (those products with the most significant annual commercial sales) include ENBREL, Neulasta , Aranesp , Prolia , Sensipar /Mimpara , XGEVA and EPOGEN . We also market a number of other products, including KYPROLIS , Vectibix , Nplate , NEUPOGEN , Repatha , BLINCYTO , IMLYGIC , Corlanor and Parsabiv . For additional information about our products, see Part I, Item 1. Business Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products. Six therapeutic areas form the core of our business oncology/hematology, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, bone health, nephrology and neuroscience. Our strategy to execute in these therapeutic areas is multifaceted as we engage in a series of integrated activities to strengthen our competitive position in the industry focused on seven strategic priorities: In 2017, we made substantial progress on our strategic priorities. Our innovative pipeline continued to advance with the addition of cardiovascular outcomes data to the Repatha label in the United States. The FDA also approved Parsabiv for secondary hyperparathyroidism in hemodialysis patients and Vectibix , in combination with chemotherapy, for use in wild-type RAS metastatic colorectal cancer, and expanded the BLINCYTO indication to include the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL in adults and children. We submitted the U.S. regulatory filing for Aimovig for the prevention of migraine in patients experiencing four or more migraines per month. We also made U.S. and EU regulatory filings to include overall survival data in the KYPROLIS label for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patients and to expand the XGEVA indication to include the prevention of SREs in patients with multiple myeloma. We announced positive phase 3 results for a weekly regimen of KYPROLIS for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and positive phase 2b results with tezepelumab, which has now advanced into Phase 3 for the treatment of severe, uncontrolled asthma. Throughout the course of the year, we invested in external early-stage innovation to augment our internal research efforts. Our biosimilars also continued to advance as the FDA approved MVASI for the treatment of five types of cancer, and the EC approved AMGEVITA for the treatment of certain inflammatory diseases. We also gained clarity on the launch timing of AMGEVITA , which is now expected in Europe later this year and we submitted U.S. and EU regulatory filings for ABP 980. We continued to build the foundation for long-term growth through our product launches in new parts of the world, as seen by our ability to secure 80 country product launches, leveraging our global presence to deliver the potential of our products to patients. 44 We continued to provide an uninterrupted supply of medicines for patients around the world while responding to natural disasters and investing for the future. In September 2017, Hurricane Maria made landfall on the island of Puerto Rico. The hurricane caused widespread damage to the island, however, the critical manufacturing areas of our site in Juncos were not significantly impacted and we have resumed our full manufacturing operations. We made investments in next-generation biomanufacturing that build on our expertise in human biology and protein manufacturing. This next-generation biomanufacturing dramatically reduces the scale and costs of making biologics while retaining a reliable, high-quality, compliant supply of medicines. In 2017, our new Singapore facility that uses our next-generation biomanufacturing technology was approved for certain commercial production by multiple regulatory agencies, including the FDA and the EMA. We continued to innovate with delivery systems to differentiate our products, as seen by our development of the AutoTouch reusable auto-injector to be used with Enbrel Mini single-dose prefilled cartridges (50 mg/mL), which was approved by the FDA in September 2017. This device was ergonomically designed to meet the needs of rheumatoid arthritis patients. We also launched our Repatha automated mini-doser with pre-filled cartridge in Europe. This hands-free device provides Repatha in a single injection for administration monthly. Further, the use of the Neulasta Onpro On-body Injector continues to increase, exiting 2017 with over 60% share of Neulasta sales. Cash flows from operating activities grew 8% to $ 11.2 billion, enabling us to invest for the future and return capital to shareholders, consistent with our expectations for long-term growth. We increased our dividend 15% to $1.15 per share of common stock in each of the four quarters of 2017. In December 2017, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $1.32 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 15% for this period, to be paid in March 2018. We also repurchased 18.5 million shares of our common stock throughout 2017 at an aggregate cost of $3.1 billion . We further optimized our business and operating model through significant transformation and process improvement efforts. Our transformation has established a foundation for growth and we are approaching the development of promising new medicines with greater understanding, speed and confidence. Our 2017 financial results also reflect the impact of the 2017 Tax Act. We now have global access to our $41.7 billion balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which unlocks additional financial flexibility. While 2017 execution was strong, we expect 2018 will be another important year as we continue to invest in the pipeline, build our global business and support new product growth. In preparation for 2018, we expanded our transformation activities and savings initiatives to enable investment in new products and the defense of existing products to optimize long- and short-term growth. Our long-term success depends, to a great extent, on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. We must develop new products over time in order to provide for revenue growth and to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity or competing products are launched. Certain of our products will face increasing pressure from competition, including biosimilars and generics. For additional information, including information on the expiration of patents for various products, see Part I, Item 1. Business Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products Patents and see Part I, Item 1. Business Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products Competition. We devote considerable resources to R&D activities. However, successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain. We are also confronted by increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy both before and after products launch. Rising healthcare costs and economic conditions also continue to pose challenges to our business, including continued pressure by third-party payers, such as governments and private payers, to reduce healthcare expenditures. As a result of public and private health care provider focus, the industry continues to experience significant pricing pressures and other cost containment measures. Finally, wholesale and end-user buying patterns can affect our product sales. These effects can cause fluctuations in quarterly product sales and have generally not been significant when comparing full-year product performance to the prior year. See Part I, Item 1. Business Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the factors that could impact our future product sales. 45 Selected Financial Information The following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per share data): Year ended December 31, 2017 Change Year ended December 31, 2016 Product sales: U.S. $ 17,131 (1 )% $ 17,325 Rest of world (ROW) 4,664 2 % 4,567 Total product sales 21,795 % 21,892 Other revenues 1,054 (4 )% 1,099 Total revenues $ 22,849 (1 )% $ 22,991 Operating expenses $ 12,876 (2 )% $ 13,197 Operating income $ 9,973 2 % $ 9,794 Net income $ 1,979 (74 )% $ 7,722 Diluted EPS $ 2.69 (74 )% $ 10.24 Diluted shares 735 (3 )% 754 In the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to unit demand growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Total product sales for 2017 decreased slightly as a decline in U.S. product sales was offset partially by an increase in ROW product sales. The U.S. decrease was driven primarily by lower unit demand resulting from competition, offset partially by increases in net selling prices and favorable changes in inventory. The increase in ROW product sales for 2017 was driven primarily by higher unit demand, offset partially by unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates and declines in net selling prices. Operating expenses for 2017 decreased 2%. All expense categories benefited from savings resulting from our transformation and process improvement efforts. Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material in 2017 , 2016 or 2015 . 46 Results of Operations Product sales Worldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2017 Change Year ended December 31, 2016 Change Year ended December 31, 2015 ENBREL $ 5,433 (9 )% $ 5,965 11 % $ 5,364 Neulasta 4,534 (2 )% 4,648 (1 )% 4,715 Aranesp 2,053 (2 )% 2,093 7 % 1,951 Prolia 1,968 20 % 1,635 25 % 1,312 Sensipar /Mimpara 1,718 9 % 1,582 12 % 1,415 XGEVA 1,575 3 % 1,529 9 % 1,405 EPOGEN 1,096 (15 )% 1,282 (31 )% 1,856 Other products 3,418 8 % 3,158 8 % 2,926 Total product sales $ 21,795 % $ 21,892 5 % $ 20,944 Total U.S. $ 17,131 (1 )% $ 17,325 5 % $ 16,523 Total ROW 4,664 2 % 4,567 3 % 4,421 Total product sales $ 21,795 % $ 21,892 5 % $ 20,944 Future sales of our products will depend, in part, on the factors discussed in the Overview, Part I, Item 1. Business Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products Competition, in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, and any additional factors discussed in the individual product sections below. In addition, for a list of our products significant competitors, see Part I, Item 1. Business Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products Competition. ENBREL Total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2017 Change Year ended December 31, 2016 Change Year ended December 31, 2015 ENBREL U.S. $ 5,206 (9 )% $ 5,719 12 % $ 5,099 ENBREL Canada 227 (8 )% 246 (7 )% 265 Total ENBREL $ 5,433 (9 )% $ 5,965 11 % $ 5,364 The decrease in ENBREL sales for 2017 was driven primarily by lower unit demand and net selling price, offset partially by an increase in inventory. For 2018, we expect the trends of lower unit demand and net selling price to continue. The increase in ENBREL sales for 2016 was driven primarily by an increase in net selling price, offset partially by the impact of competition. Neulasta Total Neulasta sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2017 Change Year ended December 31, 2016 Change Year ended December 31, 2015 Neulasta U.S. $ 3,931 % $ 3,925 1 % $ 3,891 Neulasta ROW 603 (17 )% 723 (12 )% 824 Total Neulasta $ 4,534 (2 )% $ 4,648 (1 )% $ 4,715 The decreases in global Neulasta sales for 2017 and 2016 were driven primarily by lower unit demand, offset partially by an increase in net selling price in the United States. As of the end of December 2017 , utilization of the Neulasta Onpro kit continues to grow in the United States. 47 Our final material U.S. patent for Neulasta expired in October 2015. Therefore, we expect to face competition in the United States, which over time may have a material adverse impact on future sales of Neulasta . Multiple companies have announced applications to the FDA for proposed biosimilar versions of Neulasta . While a number of these companies have announced receipt of Complete Response Letters from the FDA regarding their applications, certain of these companies may receive approval in 2018. For discussion of ongoing patent litigations with these and other companies developing proposed biosimilar versions of Neulasta , see Part IV Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, supplementary protection certificates issued by certain countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, relating to our European patent for Neulasta expired in August 2017. For further information regarding our patents, see Part I, Item 1. Business Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products Patents. Neulasta sales have been and will continue to be impacted by the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new treatment alternatives that have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of myelosuppressive regimens in some patients. Aranesp Total Aranesp sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2017 Change Year ended December 31, 2016 Change Year ended December 31, 2015 Aranesp U.S. $ 1,114 3 % $ 1,082 20 % $ 900 Aranesp ROW 939 (7 )% 1,011 (4 )% 1,051 Total Aranesp $ 2,053 (2 )% $ 2,093 7 % $ 1,951 The decrease in global Aranesp sales for 2017 was driven primarily by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, offset partially by higher unit demand, including a shift of some U.S. dialysis centers from EPOGEN . The increase in global Aranesp sales for 2016 was driven primarily by higher unit demand, including a shift of some U.S. dialysis centers from EPOGEN , offset partially by a decrease in net selling price in ROW. For 2018, we expect Aranesp to face increasing competition from branded products. We could also face competition from biosimilar versions of EPOGEN in 2018 if they launch in the United States. Prolia Total Prolia sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2017 Change Year ended December 31, 2016 Change Year ended December 31, 2015 Prolia U.S. $ 1,272 21 % $ 1,049 25 % $ 837 Prolia ROW 696 19 % 586 23 % 475 Total Prolia $ 1,968 20 % $ 1,635 25 % $ 1,312 The increases in global Prolia sales for 2017 and 2016 were driven primarily by higher unit demand. Sensipar /Mimpara Total Sensipar /Mimpara sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2017 Change Year ended December 31, 2016 Change Year ended December 31, 2015 Sensipar U.S. $ 1,374 11 % $ 1,240 16 % $ 1,069 Sensipar /Mimpara ROW 344 1 % 342 (1 )% 346 Total Sensipar /Mimpara $ 1,718 9 % $ 1,582 12 % $ 1,415 The increases in global Sensipar /Mimpara sales for 2017 and 2016 were driven primarily by an increase in net selling price in the United States and, to a lesser extent, higher unit demand. 48 Our U.S. composition of matter patent relating to Sensipar , a small molecule, expires in March 2018. We are also involved in a number of litigation matters relating to Sensipar , including patent litigations with a number of companies seeking to market generic versions of Sensipar and litigation regarding our request for pediatric exclusivity for Sensipar . See Part IV Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. XGEVA Total XGEVA sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2017 Change Year ended December 31, 2016 Change Year ended December 31, 2015 XGEVA U.S. $ 1,157 4 % $ 1,115 11 % $ 1,006 XGEVA ROW 418 1 % 414 4 % 399 Total XGEVA $ 1,575 3 % $ 1,529 9 % $ 1,405 The increases in global XGEVA sales for 2017 and 2016 were driven primarily by higher unit demand. EPOGEN Total EPOGEN sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2017 Change Year ended December 31, 2016 Change Year ended December 31, 2015 EPOGEN U.S. $ 1,096 (15 )% $ 1,282 (31 )% $ 1,856 The decrease in EPOGEN sales for 2017 was driven primarily by a decline in net selling price due to contractual terms negotiated with DaVita (see Part I, Item 1. Business Business Relationships) and, to a lesser extent, a shift in some U.S. dialysis centers to A ranesp . The decrease in EPOGEN sales for 2016 was driven by a decline in unit demand resulting from competition and a shift in some U.S. dialysis centers to A ranesp . Our final material U.S. patent for EPOGEN expired in May 2015. We face competition in the United States, which has had, and will continue to have, a material adverse impact on sales of EPOGEN . Multiple companies are developing proposed biosimilar versions of EPOGEN and certain of these companies may receive approval in 2018. For discussion of ongoing patent litigation with this company, see Part IV Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Other products Other product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2017 Change Year ended December 31, 2016 Change Year ended December 31, 2015 KYPROLIS U.S. $ 562 1 % $ 554 19 % $ 467 KYPROLIS ROW 273 98 % 138 * 45 Vectibix U.S. 251 10 % 229 12 % 204 Vectibix ROW 391 2 % 382 11 % 345 Nplate U.S. 392 12 % 350 10 % 317 Nplate ROW 250 7 % 234 13 % 208 NEUPOGEN U.S. 369 (31 )% 534 (33 )% 793 NEUPOGEN ROW 180 (22 )% 231 (10 )% 256 Repatha U.S. 225 * 101 * 7 Repatha ROW 94 * 40 * 3 BLINCYTO U.S. 114 34 % 85 27 % 67 BLINCYTO ROW 61 * 30 * 10 Other U.S. 68 13 % 60 * 10 Other ROW 188 (1 )% 190 (2 )% 194 Total other product sales $ 3,418 8 % $ 3,158 8 % $ 2,926 Total U.S. other products $ 1,981 $ 1,913 $ 1,865 Total ROW other products 1,437 1,245 1,061 Total other product sales $ 3,418 $ 3,158 $ 2,926 * Change in excess of 100% Operating expenses Operating expenses were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2017 Change Year ended December 31, 2016 Change Year ended December 31, 2015 Operating expenses: Cost of sales $ 4,069 (2 )% $ 4,162 (2 )% $ 4,227 % of product sales 18.7 % 19.0 % 20.2 % % of total revenues 17.8 % 18.1 % 19.5 % Research and development $ 3,562 (7 )% $ 3,840 (6 )% $ 4,070 % of product sales 16.3 % 17.5 % 19.4 % % of total revenues 15.6 % 16.7 % 18.8 % Selling, general and administrative $ 4,870 (4 )% $ 5,062 4 % $ 4,846 % of product sales 22.3 % 23.1 % 23.1 % % of total revenues 21.3 % 22.0 % 22.4 % Other $ 375 * $ 133 * $ 49 * Change in excess of 100% 50 Transformation and process improvement During 2014, we announced transformation and process improvement efforts that we continue to execute. As part of these efforts, we committed to a more agile and efficient operating model. Our transformation and process improvement efforts across the Company are enabling us to reallocate resources to fund many of our innovative pipeline and growth opportunities that deliver value to patients and stockholders. The transformation includes a restructuring plan that we continue to estimate will result in pre-tax accounting charges in the range of $825 million to $900 million . As of December 31, 2017 , restructuring costs incurred to date were $797 million. During 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , we incurred restructuring costs of $88 million, $37 million and $114 million, respectively. We expect that we will incur most of the remaining estimated costs in 2018 in order to support our ongoing transformation and process improvement efforts. Since 2014, we have realized approximately $1.5 billion of transformation and process improvement savings. Net savings have not been significant as savings were reinvested in product launches, clinical programs and external business development. Additional information required for our restructuring plan is incorporated herein by reference to Part IV Note 2, Restructuring, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Puerto Rico operations In September 2017, Hurricane Maria made landfall on the island of Puerto Rico. The hurricane caused widespread damage to the island and some damage to our facility in Juncos. Critical manufacturing areas of our facility were not significantly affected, and we have resumed our full manufacturing operations. Further recovery efforts on the island are ongoing. We have continued to provide an uninterrupted supply of medicines for patients around the world. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors We perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and substantially all of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California; significant disruptions or production failures at these facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials. We incurred $146 million of pre-tax expenses in 2017 related to Hurricane Maria. At this time, we do not expect significant pre-tax expenses in 2018. Cost of sales Cost of sales decreased to 17.8% of total revenues for 2017 , driven primarily by lower amortization of intangible assets, lower royalties and favorable manufacturing costs, offset partially by expenses related to Hurricane Maria, unfavorable product mix and other inventory costs. Cost of sales decreased to 18.1% of total revenues for 2016 , driven primarily by certain manufacturing efficiencies. Research and development The Company groups all of its R&D activities and related expenditures into three categories: (1) Discovery Research and Translational Sciences (DRTS), (2) later-stage clinical programs and (3) marketed products. These categories include the Company R&D activities as set forth in the following table: Category Description DRTS R&D expenses incurred in activities substantially in support of early research through the completion of phase 1 clinical trials. These activities encompass our DRTS functions, including drug discovery, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism, and process development. Later-stage clinical programs R&D expenses incurred in or related to phase 2 and phase 3 clinical programs intended to result in registration of a new product or a new indication for an existing product in the United States or the EU. Marketed products R&D expenses incurred in support of the Company marketed products that are authorized to be sold in the United States or the EU. Includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the United States or the EU has been obtained. 51 R&D expense by category was as follows (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 DRTS $ 972 $ 1,039 $ 997 Later-stage clinical programs 879 1,054 1,876 Marketed products 1,711 1,747 1,197 Total R&D expense $ 3,562 $ 3,840 $ 4,070 The decrease in R&D expenses for 2017 was driven by decreased costs associated with later-stage clinical program support, lower external business development expense in DRTS and lower marketed-product support. All categories of R&D spend benefited from savings from transformation and process improvement efforts and we continue to advance our pipeline. The decrease in R&D expenses for 2016 was driven primarily by decreased costs associated with later-stage clinical programs support of $822 million, offset partially by increased costs associated with marketed-products support of $550 million. All categories of R&D spend benefited from savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. The decrease was offset partially by reinvestment for the long-term benefit of the company, including an increase in DRTS for up-front milestone payments related to several collaboration transactions. Prior to approval, costs related to our launch products were categorized largely as later-stage clinical programs. Selling, general and administrative The decrease in Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense for 2017 was driven primarily by the expiration of the ENBREL residual royalty payments on October 31, 2016, offset partially by investments in product launch and marketed product support. The increase in SG&A expense for 2016 was driven primarily by further investments in product launches, offset partially by the expiration of the ENBREL residual royalty payments on October 31, 2016. The ENBREL co-promotion term expired in October 2013, and we were required to pay Pfizer residual royalties on a declining percentage of net ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada. Effective November 2016, there were no further residual royalty payments. The residual royalty percentage ranged from 10% to 11% in 2016 and 2015. Other Other operating expenses for 2017 included $284 million of net charges associated with the discontinuance of the internal development of AMG 899 and $83 million of certain net charges related to our restructuring plan. See Part IV Note 3, Business combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other operating expenses for 2016 included $105 million of charges related to legal proceedings. Other operating expenses for 2015 included $91 million of charges related to legal proceedings; certain charges related to our restructuring initiatives, including separation costs of $49 million; $31 million of write-offs of non-key assets acquired in a prior-year business combination; and $111 million of gains from the sale of assets related to our site closures. Non-operating expenses, income and provision for income taxes Non-operating expenses, income and provision for income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Years ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Interest expense, net $ 1,304 $ 1,260 $ 1,095 Interest and other income, net $ 928 $ 629 $ 603 Provision for income taxes $ 7,618 $ 1,441 $ 1,039 Effective tax rate 79.4 % 15.7 % 13.0 % Interest expense, net The increases in interest expense, net in 2017 and 2016 were due primarily to a higher average amount of debt outstanding compared with the respective prior year. 52 Interest and other income, net The increase in interest and other income, net for 2017 compared with 2016 was due primarily to higher interest income that resulted from higher average investment balances and higher gains on strategic investments. The increase in interest and other income, net for 2016 compared with 2015 was due primarily to higher interest income as a result of higher average investment balances in 2016 , offset partially by higher gains on strategic equity investments in 2015 . Income taxes The increase in our effective tax rate for 2017 compared with 2016 was due primarily to impacts of the 2017 Tax Act, including the repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings, offset partially by the remeasurement of certain net deferred and other tax liabilities. The increase in our effective tax rate for 2016 compared with 2015 was due primarily to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in jurisdictional mix of income and expenses, offset partially by the adoption of a new accounting standard that amends certain aspects of the accounting for employee share-based compensation payments. One aspect of the standard requires that excess tax benefits and deficiencies that arise upon vesting or exercise of share-based payments be recognized as an income tax benefit and expense in the income statement. On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the 2017 Tax Act that imposes a repatriation tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, implements a territorial tax system together with a current tax on certain foreign earnings and lowers the general corporate income tax rate to 21%. On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) that allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. We currently are analyzing the 2017 Tax Act, and in certain areas, have made reasonable estimates of the effects on our consolidated financial statements and tax disclosures, including the amount of the repatriation tax and changes to our existing deferred tax balances. The repatriation tax is based primarily on our accumulated foreign earnings and profits that we previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. We recorded an estimated amount for our repatriation tax liability of $7.3 billion as of December 31, 2017. We no longer reinvest our undistributed earnings of our foreign operations indefinitely outside the United States. In addition, we remeasured certain net deferred and other tax liabilities based on the tax rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future. The estimated amount recorded related to the remeasurement of these balances was a net benefit of $1.2 billion. The net estimated impact of the 2017 Tax Act is $6.1 billion. We consider the key estimates on the repatriation tax, net deferred tax remeasurement and the impact on our unrealized tax benefits to be incomplete due to our continuing analysis of final year-end data and tax positions. Our analysis could affect the measurement of these balances and give rise to new deferred tax assets and liabilities. Since the 2017 Tax Act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017, and further guidance and accounting interpretation is expected over the next 12 months, our review is still pending. We expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period. As previously disclosed, we received a RAR from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. The RAR proposes to make significant adjustments that relate primarily to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. On November 29, 2017, we received a modified RAR that revised their calculation but continued to propose substantial adjustments. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and are pursuing resolution through the IRS administrative appeals process, which we believe will likely not be concluded within the next 12 months. Final resolution of the IRS audit could have a material impact on our results of consolidated operations and cash flows if not resolved favorably, however, we believe our income tax reserves are appropriately provided for all open tax years. See Summary of Critical Accounting Policies Income taxes, and Part IV Note 5, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 53 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Selected financial data was as follows (in millions): December 31, 2017 2016 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 41,678 $ 38,085 Total assets $ 79,954 $ 77,626 Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt $ 1,152 $ 4,403 Long-term debt $ 34,190 $ 30,193 Stockholders equity $ 25,241 $ 29,875 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities We now have global access to our $41.7 billion balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as we no longer reinvest our undistributed foreign earnings indefinitely outside the United States. Under the 2017 Tax Act, we owe a repatriation tax on undistributed earnings generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions estimated at $7.3 billion that will be paid over eight years. See Contractual Obligations below. We will also have access to global cash generated from operations in the future. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer. Capital allocation Consistent with the objective to optimize our capital structure, we will seek to deploy our accumulated cash balances in an efficient manner and will consider several alternatives such as share repurchases, payment of cash dividends, repayment of debt, and strategic transactions that expand our portfolio of products in areas of therapeutic interest. In addition to deploying our cash balances, we intend to continue to invest in our business and return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and agreements of the Company. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by the stock price and blackout periods, during which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions. The Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.79 per share of common stock in 2015 , increased our quarterly cash dividend by 27% to $1.00 per share of common stock in 2016 , and increased our quarterly cash dividend by 15% to $1.15 per share of common stock in 2017 . In December 2017 , the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $1.32 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 15% for this period, to be paid in March 2018. We have also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During 2017 , we repurchased $3.1 billion of common stock and had cash settlements of $3.2 billion . In 2016 and 2015, we repurchased $3.0 billion and $1.9 billion of our common stock, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 , $4.4 billion remained available under the stock repurchase program. In January 2018, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $10.0 billion under our stock repurchase program. Based on our confidence in the long-term outlook for our business, enhanced by the 2017 Tax Act, and consistent with our ongoing objective to return capital to our stockholders, on February 5, 2018, we announced a tender offer to purchase up to $10.0 billion of our common stock at a price not greater than $200 per share nor less than $175 per share. The tender offer expires at 12:00 Midnight, New York City time, at the end of Monday, March 5, 2018, unless the offer is extended. We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt 54 markets and equity markets. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business . Financing arrangements The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2017 , were $ 1.2 billion and $ 34.2 billion, respectively. The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2016 , were $ 4.4 billion and $ 30.2 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 , Standard & Poor Financial Services LLC (S&P), Moody Investors Service, Inc. (Moody s) and Fitch Ratings Inc. (Fitch) assigned credit ratings to our outstanding senior notes of A with a stable outlook, Baa1 with a stable outlook and BBB with a stable outlook, respectively, which are considered investment grade. Unfavorable changes to these ratings may have an adverse impact on future financings. During 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , we issued debt with aggregate principal amounts of $4.5 billion, $7.3 billion and $3.5 billion , respectively. During 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , we repaid debt of $4.4 billion , $3.7 billion and $2.4 billion , respectively. To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR)-based coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap contracts qualified and are designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we had interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $9.45 billion and $6.65 billion, respectively. To hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts qualified and are designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we had cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $5.6 billion . As of December 31, 2017 , we had a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working-capital needs. During 2017 , we issued and repaid an aggregate of $12.3 billion commercial paper and had a maximum outstanding balance of $1.5 billion under our commercial paper program. During 2016 and 2015 , we did not issue any commercial paper. No commercial paper was outstanding as of December 31, 2017 or 2016. In 2014, we entered into a $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $500 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank which is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. We extended this term by one year during 2016 and may extend the term for an additional year with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.09% of the unused portion of the facility based on our current credit rating. Generally, we would be charged interest at LIBOR plus 1% for any amounts borrowed under this facility. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , no amounts were outstanding under this facility. In 2017, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depositary shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires in February 2020. Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under this arrangement as of December 31, 2017 . See Part IV Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 55 Cash flows A summary of our cash flow activity was as follows (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 11,177 $ 10,354 $ 9,731 Net cash used in investing activities $ (4,024 ) $ (8,658 ) $ (5,547 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (6,594 ) $ (2,599 ) $ (3,771 ) Operating Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2017 due primarily to a higher operating margin and the timing of payments to vendors and receipts from customers, offset partially by higher payments to taxing authorities. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2016 due primarily to an improved operating margin and the timing of customer payments, offset partially by inventory build, the monetization of foreign currency forward contracts in 2015 and the timing of tax payments. Investing Cash used in investing activities during 2017, 2016 and 2015 was due primarily to net cash outflows related to marketable securities of $3.2 billion , $7.7 billion and $4.4 billion , respectively. Capital expenditures, which were associated primarily with site development costs, including our Thousand Oaks campus, as well as manufacturing capacity expansions in Puerto Rico, Singapore and Ireland, were $664 million , $738 million and $594 million in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. We currently estimate 2018 spending on capital projects to be approximately $750 million. Financing Cash used in financing activities during 2017 was due primarily to the repayment of debt of $4.4 billion , the payment of dividends of $3.4 billion , repurchases of our common stock of $3.2 billion and withholding taxes arising from shares withheld for share-based payments of $191 million , offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of debt of $4.5 billion . Cash used in financing activities during 2016 was due primarily to the repayment of debt of $3.7 billion , the payment of dividends of $3.0 billion , repurchases of our common stock of $3.0 billion and withholding taxes arising from shares withheld for share-based payments of $260 million , offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of debt of $7.3 billion . Cash used in financing activities during 2015 was due primarily to the repayment of debt of $2.4 billion , the payment of dividends of $2.4 billion , repurchases of our common stock of $1.9 billion , withholding taxes arising from shares withheld for share-based payments of $401 million and the settlement of contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with the acquisition of a business of $253 million , offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of debt of $3.5 billion . See Part IV Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 15, Stockholders equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. 56 The following table represents our contractual obligations aggregated by type (in millions): Payments due by period as of December 31, 2017 Contractual obligations Total Year 1 Years 2 and 3 Years 4 and 5 Years 6 and beyond Long-term debt obligations (1) (2) (3) (4) $ 56,763 $ 2,530 $ 9,964 $ 9,705 $ 34,564 Operating lease obligations (5) 650 158 242 159 91 Purchase obligations (6) 1,343 605 346 150 242 U.S. repatriation tax (7) 7,316 585 1,170 1,170 4,391 Unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) (8) Total contractual obligations $ 66,072 $ 3,878 $ 11,722 $ 11,184 $ 39,288 (1) Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments on our fixed-rate obligations at the contractual coupon rates. To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. We used an interest rate forward curve as of December 31, 2017 , in computing net amounts to be paid or received under our interest rate swap contracts which resulted in an aggregate net increase in future interest payments of $22 million. See Part IV Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments on our LIBOR-based variable-rate obligations. We used an interest rate forward curve as of December 31, 2017 , in computing the LIBOR-based portion of interest payments on these debt obligations. See Part IV Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Long-term debt obligations include contractual interest payments and principal repayment of our foreign-denominated debt obligations. In order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our euro, pound sterling and Swiss franc denominated long-term debt, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts that effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment on this debt from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. For purposes of this table, we used the contracted exchange rates in the cross-currency swap contracts to compute the net amounts of future interest payments and principal repayments on this debt. See Part IV Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (4) Interest payments and the repayment of principal on our 4.375% 2018 euro Notes were translated into U.S. dollars at the foreign currency exchange rate in effect as of December 31, 2017 . See Part IV Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (5) Operating lease obligations exclude $205 million of future receipts under noncancelable subleases of abandoned facilities. (6) Purchase obligations relate primarily to: (i) R&D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (ii) capital expenditures; and (iii) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. (7) Under the 2017 Tax Act, we will elect to pay the repatriation tax primarily related to our prior indefinitely invested earnings of our foreign operations in eight annual installments beginning April 2018. See Part IV Note 5, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (8) Liabilities for UTBs (net of foreign tax credits and federal tax benefit of state taxes) and related accrued interest and penalties of $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2017 , are not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities. In addition to amounts in the table above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts, which in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred in the acquisition of BioVex Group Inc. (BioVex). These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above, and, except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2017 , the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is $7.0 billion, including $325 million of contingent consideration payments in connection with the acquisition of BioVex. Contingent consideration with respect to the acquisition of Dezima Pharma B.V. was excluded due to the discontinuation of the development of AMG 899, upon which payments are based. See Part IV Note 16, Fair value measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 57 Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Product sales and sales deductions Revenues from sales of our products are recognized when the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, cash discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns, which are established at the time of sale. We analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions): Rebates Chargebacks Other deductions Total Balance as of December 31, 2014 $ 1,120 $ 196 $ 63 $ 1,379 Amounts charged against product sales 2,734 4,275 732 7,741 Payments (2,735 ) (4,198 ) (701 ) (7,634 ) Balance as of December 31, 2015 1,119 273 94 1,486 Amounts charged against product sales 3,479 5,270 905 9,654 Payments (3,181 ) (5,201 ) (884 ) (9,266 ) Balance as of December 31, 2016 1,417 342 115 1,874 Amounts charged against product sales 4,909 6,098 992 11,999 Payments (4,459 ) (6,168 ) (999 ) (11,626 ) Balance as of December 31, 2017 $ 1,867 $ 272 $ 108 $ 2,247 For the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , total sales deductions were 35%, 31% and 27% of gross product sales, respectively. Included in the amounts are immaterial net adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. Such amounts represent less than 1% of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales in each of the three years ended December 31, 2017 . In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in Europe are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the product is sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales deductions and returns. Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold. Rebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which vary by product, by payer and by individual payer plans. As we sell product, we estimate the amount of rebate we will pay based on the product sold, contractual terms, estimated patient population, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels and accrue these rebates in the period the related sale is recorded. We then adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect actual claims experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part because of the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances, but actual results may differ. Wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase price and the contractual price 58 between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers, and we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks. Product returns Returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. In each of the past three years, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior-year sales return provisions have historically been insignificant. Income taxes We provide for income taxes based on pretax income and applicable tax rates available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements on a particular tax position is measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense. Certain items are included in our tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements and cause temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Such temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either: (i) tax expenses recognized in the consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred; (ii) expenses for which we have already taken a deduction on the tax return, but have not yet recognized the expense in the consolidated financial statements; or (iii) liabilities for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible assets acquired in many business combinations, as future expenses associated with these assets most often will not be tax deductible. We are a vertically integrated enterprise with operations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdictions where we conduct activities based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and the functions, risks and activities performed therein. Our pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed and risks assumed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, we conduct significant operations in Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States that is treated as a foreign jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes, pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet our worldwide product demand. Income from our operations in Puerto Rico is subject to tax incentive grants through 2035. On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued SAB 118 to address the accounting implications of the 2017 Tax Act. The effects of the 2017 Tax Act are recognized upon enactment, however, SAB 118 permits a company to recognize provisional amounts when it does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the change in tax law. The measurement period to finalize our calculations cannot extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Key provisions that have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and where we have recognized estimated amounts include the recognition of liabilities for taxes on repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings and the remeasurement of certain net deferred and other tax liabilities. Furthermore, the 2017 Tax Act permits a company, upon election, to pay the repatriation tax over eight years on an interest-free basis, which we expect to do. In January 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board staff issued Staff Q&A, Topic 740, No. 2, Whether to Discount the Tax Liability on Deemed Repatriation, which notes that the repatriation tax liability should not be discounted. See Part IV Note 5, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries, including the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability . 59 Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, governmental investigations and class action suits which are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Part IV Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinations We have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPR&D product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in a business combination. See Part IV Note 3, Business combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to: determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date; projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates; estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows. Significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the acquisition date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of contingent consideration obligations incurred or assumed in the acquisitions of businesses were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included, but were not limited to, the probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations. For example, during 2017, we discontinued the internal development of AMG 899 and consequently reduced the related contingent consideration liabilities. See Part IV Note 16, Fair value measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates. Impairment of long-lived assets We review the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment and our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset fair value and its carrying value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, composed of IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination which have not reached technological feasibility or lack regulatory approval at the time of acquisition, are reviewed for impairment annually, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and upon establishment of technological feasibility or regulatory approval. We determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the 60 asset carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference and its carrying value is reduced accordingly. Estimating future cash flows of an IPR&D product candidate for purposes of an impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of costs to complete the project and the amount, timing and probability of achieving revenues from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project was determined, as described above. There are often major risks and uncertainties associated with IPR&D projects as we are required to obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to market these products. Such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&D project may vary from its fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPR&D impairment charges may occur in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, during 2017, we discontinued the internal development of AMG 899 and consequently recorded an IPR&D asset impairment charge. See Part IV Note 12, Goodwill and other intangible assets, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe our estimations of future cash flows used for assessing impairment of long-lived assets are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments.
