Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY About the Company Bristol-Myers Squibb is a worldwide pharmaceutical and related healthcare products company whose mission is to extend and enhance human life. The Company is engaged in the discovery, development, licensing, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare related products. The Company employs approximately 43,000 people. In 2004, the Company reported annual global sales from continuing operations of $19.4 billion. Sales increased 4% from the prior year level due to the favorable impact from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. U.S. sales remained constant at $10.6 billion, as increased sales of key brands and newer products were offset by exclusivity losses on older brands, while international sales increased 10%, to $8.8 billion including an 8% favorable foreign exchange impact. In 2004, two product lines achieved sales of over $2.5 billion each PLAVIX* and PRAVACHOL. PLAVIX* sales grew 35%, including a 2% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $3.3 billion, while PRAVACHOL sales decreased 7%, including a 4% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $2.6 billion. An additional 44 product lines achieved more than $50 million each in annual sales, including 30 product lines with more than $100 million each in annual sales, of which 7 had annual sales in excess of $500 million each. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company signed a definitive agreement to sell its Oncology Therapeutics Network (OTN) business, a distributor of pharmaceutical products to office-based oncologists. Further, in January 2005, the Company announced that it intends to divest its U.S. and Canadian Consumer Medicines businesses. In support of its mission to extend and enhance human life by developing the highest-quality products, in 2004, the Company invested $2.5 billion in research and development, a 10% growth over 2003, and expects to increase spending on drug development in 2005 to accelerate the development of its late-stage pipeline. Research and development dedicated to pharmaceutical products, including milestone payments for in-licensing and development programs, was $2.3 billion and as a percentage of Pharmaceutical sales was 14.8% compared to 14.2% in 2003. In August 2004, the Company announced it entered into a settlement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), concluding the SEC investigation regarding wholesaler inventory and accounting matters. The settlement was reached through a Consent Order under which the Company is currently operating. The SEC investigation arose from the Company announcement in April 2002 that the Company experienced a substantial buildup of wholesaler inventories in its U.S. pharmaceuticals business over several years, primarily in 2000 and 2001, and that the buildup was primarily due to sales incentives offered by the Company, as well as the Company subsequent restatement (2002 Restatement) of its consolidated financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2002 and prior periods in March 2003. For a discussion of these matters, see Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statement and SEC Consent Order below. To help ensure the circumstances that led to the need for financial restatement do not recur, the Company has taken steps to enhance the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures, including internal control over financial reporting. After completing the 2002 Restatement, the Company continued to identify and implement actions to improve the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. These actions contributed significantly to the Company identifying additional errors relating to prior periods not reflected in the 2002 Restatement and accordingly, the Company restated its consolidated financial statements in 2004 to correct these errors for the years 2001 and 2002. The Company continues to strengthen disclosure controls and procedures surrounding internal controls over financial reporting, specifically with respect to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. These actions include the establishment of policies and procedures to enhance compliance and focus on risk management. Business Environment The pharmaceutical industry in which the Company conducts its business is highly competitive and subject to numerous government regulations. Sales of the Company products can be affected significantly by many competitive factors, including product efficacy, safety, price and cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, product labeling, quality control and quality assurance of its manufacturing, operating and research and development of new products. To successfully compete for business in the healthcare industry, the Company must not only demonstrate that its products offer medical benefits, but also cost advantages. Currently, most of the new products introduced by the Company must compete with other products in the same therapeutic category already on the market. The Company manufactures branded products, which are subject to higher prices than generic products. Generic competition is one of the Company biggest challenges globally. 37 Table of Contents In the pharmaceutical industry, the majority of an innovative product commercial value is usually realized during the period in which the product has market exclusivity. When a product loses exclusivity, it is no longer protected by a patent and is subject to new competing products in the form of generic brands. Upon exclusivity loss of a product, the Company can lose a major portion of that product sales in a short period of time. For further discussion on product exclusivity, see Item 1. Business Intellectual Property and Product Exclusivity. Both in the U.S. and internationally, the healthcare industry is subject to various government-imposed regulations which authorize prices or price controls which could have an impact on the Company sales. In the U.S., Congress and some state legislatures have considered a number of proposals and have enacted laws that could effect major changes in the healthcare system, either nationally or at the state level. Driven in part by budget concerns, Medicaid access and reimbursement restrictions have been implemented in some states and proposed in many others. For example, in December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act (MMA) was enacted to provide outpatient prescription drug coverage to senior citizens in the United States. The Company cannot predict the potential impact that this legislation will have on its business; however it could have a negative impact on the Company U.S. pharmaceutical business as greater federal involvement and budget constraints may increase the likelihood of pricing pressures or controls in the future. In many markets outside the United States, the Company operates in environments of government-mandated, cost-containment programs. Most European countries, except the United Kingdom and Germany, do not provide market pricing for new medicines. Pricing freedom is limited in the United Kingdom by the operation of a profit control plan and in Germany by the operation of a reference price system. Companies also face significant delays in market access for new products, and more than two years can elapse before new medicines become available on some national markets. The growth of Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) in the U.S. has played a large role in the competition that surrounds the healthcare industry. MCOs seek to reduce healthcare expenditures for participants by making volume purchases and entering into long-term contracts to negotiate discounts with various pharmaceutical providers. Because of the market potential created by the large pool of participants, marketing prescription drugs to MCOs has become an important part of the Company strategy. Companies compete for inclusion in an MCO formulary and the Company has generally been successful in having its major products included. Pharmaceutical production processes are complex, highly regulated and vary widely from product to product. Shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures and regulatory approvals. Biologics manufacturing involves more complex processes than those of traditional pharmaceutical operations. Although the Company does have the capacity to manufacture biologics for clinical trials and commercial launch, its current capacity to manufacture larger commercial volumes of these products is limited. The Company has maintained a competitive position in the market and strives to uphold this position, which is dependent on its success in discovering and developing innovative, cost-effective products that serve unmet medical needs. Strategy The Company is implementing a new strategy to discover and develop innovative, cost-effective medicines that address significant unmet medical needs in ten critical disease areas. These areas are: Affective (psychiatric) disorders, Alzheimer s/dementia, atherosclerosis/thrombosis, diabetes, hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus/auto-immune immunodeficiency virus (HIV/AIDS), obesity, oncology, rheumatoid arthritis and related diseases and solid organ transplant. The Company continuously strives to create better treatments for patients by building a high quality drug discovery and development pipeline. Since 2003, the Company has undergone a transition in its pharmaceutical product portfolio as older product lines, including the GLUCOPHAGE* franchise, MONOPRIL, TAXOL and PARAPLATIN, have experienced exclusivity loss. With the successful launches of newer products including ABILIFY* for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, REYATAZ for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and ERBITUX* for cancer, the portfolio is being refocused on growth brands which fall within the ten critical disease areas targeting specialists and high value primary care physicians. Sales of products within the ten disease areas have been increasing steadily, and are expected to comprise about half of pharmaceutical product sales by the end of 2005. The Company is making significant investments behind its new product launches, and re-deploying marketing and promotional spending from older products to its newer products. In 2004, the Company submitted two New Drug Applications (NDAs) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for regulatory approval, including entecavir for hepatitis B and muraglitazar for type 2 diabetes. A rolling Biologics License Application (BLA) for abatacept for the potential treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is also expected to be completed in early 2005. The successful launch of these investigational compounds will further enhance the Company strategy to transition its product portfolio to cover all of the ten disease areas discussed above. While internal growth is vital to the Company future success, the Company is continually evaluating and pursuing external possibilities through alliances and other collaborative agreements. The Company has a notable record of executing successful 38 Table of Contents licensing arrangements to supplement its own pipeline, and many of these arrangements have led to fruitful codevelopment, copromotion and comarketing agreements. The Company expects to continue to complement its pipeline in 2005 with additional licensed products. Another component of the Company strategy includes entry into the biologics business, which requires increased investments in manufacturing facilities and third-party manufacturing arrangements to meet future commercial demand expected to be generated from new product launches. In addition, the Company continues to maintain collaborations with major biotechnology and research institutions to enhance the life cycle of the Company product portfolio beyond initial approval/commercialization, such as offering combination therapy and product extensions. Another major aspect of the Company strategy relates to how it does business, specifically in marketing and sales approaches. Specialists are playing an even greater role in decisions related to patient treatment and care, particularly in the ten critical disease areas where the Company is focusing its efforts. For this reason, the Company is recasting its business model to focus on specialists as well as with those primary care physicians who are involved in treating patients in these select disease areas. In order to achieve its strategic objectives, the Company also plans to moderate selling, general and administrative spending for the next several years, through the customer model noted above, as well as the elimination of organizational inefficiencies. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of the Company results of continuing operations excludes the results related to the OTN business, which have been segregated from continuing operations and are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Discontinued Operations below. % Change 2004 2003 2002 2004 to 2003 2003 to 2002 (dollars in millions) Net Sales $ 19,380 $ 18,653 $ 16,208 4 % 15 % Earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income tax $ 4,418 $ 4,680 $ 2,748 (6 )% 70 % % of net sales 22.8 % 25.1 % 17.0 % Provision on income taxes $ 1,519 $ 1,210 $ 386 26 % * * Effective tax rate 34.4 % 25.9 % 14.0 % Earnings from continuing operations $ 2,378 $ 3,097 $ 2,059 (23 )% 50 % % of net sales 12.3 % 16.6 % 12.7 % ** Change is in excess of 200% Net Sales Net sales from continuing operations for 2004 increased 4% to $19.4 billion due to the favorable impact from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. U.S. net sales in 2004 remained constant at $10.6 billion compared to 2003, with growth in prescription demand for key brands including PLAVIX*, AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* and SUSTIVA, and new product introductions including ABILIFY*, REYATAZ and ERBITUX*, offset by lower sales of other products as a result of exclusivity losses for MONOPRIL, PARAPLATIN and the GLUCOPHAGE* franchise. U.S. net sales increased 13% in 2003 from $9.4 billion in 2002 while international net sales increased 18% to $8.0 billion in 2003 from $6.8 billion in 2002, or 8% excluding favorable foreign exchange. International net sales increased 10% to $8.8 billion in 2004, or 2% excluding favorable foreign exchange. This 2% growth in sales was primarily attributable to increased sales of PLAVIX*, AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* and the launch of REYATAZ and ABILIFY* in Europe, offset by a decline in PRAVACHOL. In 2003, net sales from continuing operations increased 15% to $18.7 billion, including a 4% favorable impact from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The composition of the net increase in sales is as follows: 2004 2003 Volume 9 % Selling prices, net 2 % Foreign exchange 4 % 4 % Increase in sales 4 % 15 % 39 Table of Contents In general, the Company business is not seasonal. For information on U.S. pharmaceuticals prescriber demand, reference is made to the table within Business Segments under the Pharmaceuticals section below, which sets forth a comparison of changes in net sales to the estimated total prescription growth (for both retail and mail order customers) for certain of the Company primary care pharmaceutical products. The Company operates in three reportable segments Pharmaceuticals, Nutritionals and Other Healthcare. In 2004, the Company signed a definitive agreement to sell OTN, which was previously presented as a separate segment. As such, the results of operations for OTN are presented as part of the Company results from discontinued operations in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Accordingly, OTN results of operations in prior periods have been reclassified to discontinued operations to conform with current year presentations. The percent of the Company sales by segment were as follows: Net Sales % Change 2004 2003 2002 2004 to 2003 2003 to 2002 (dollars in millions) Pharmaceuticals $ 15,482 $ 14,925 $ 12,814 4 % 16 % % of net sales 80 % 80 % 79 % Nutritionals 2,001 2,023 1,821 (1 )% 11 % % of net sales 10 % 11 % 11 % Other Healthcare 1,897 1,705 1,573 11 % 8 % % of net sales 10 % 9 % 10 % Total $ 19,380 $ 18,653 $ 16,208 4 % 15 % The Company recognizes revenue for sales when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer, which generally occurs on the date of shipment. When substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership do not transfer, the Company uses a consignment model to recognize the revenue. Under this model, the Company does not recognize revenue upon shipment of product. Rather, upon shipment of product the Company invoices the wholesaler, records deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price and classifies the inventory held by the wholesalers as consignment inventory at the Company cost of such inventory. The Company recognizes revenue (net of the gross to net sales adjustments discussed below, all of which involve significant estimates and judgments) when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, which is not later than when such inventory is sold through to the wholesalers customers, on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. The Company aggregate cost of pharmaceutical products that were accounted for using the consignment model (and accordingly, were reflected as consignment inventory on the Company consolidated balance sheet) were not significant at December 31, 2004 and 2003. The deferred revenue related to the inventory of pharmaceutical products accounted for using the consignment model was fully worked down by December 31, 2004. Deferred revenue recorded at gross invoice sales price was approximately $12 million at December 31, 2003. Approximately $10 million, $321 million and $1,397 million of deferred revenue was recognized in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The corresponding effect on earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes was an increase of $8 million, $237 million and $1,095 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 40 Table of Contents The Company recognizes revenue on a gross sales basis and deducts various sales adjustments to arrive at net sales as reported on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. These adjustments are referred to as gross-to-net sales adjustments and are further described in Critical Accounting Policies below. The following table summarizes the Company gross-to-net sales adjustments for each significant category: For the Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (dollars in millions) Gross Sales $ 23,896 $ 22,992 $ 20,117 Gross-to-Net Sales Adjustments Prime Vendor Charge-Backs (1,319 ) (1,228 ) (1,028 ) Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Rebates (846 ) (854 ) (993 ) Managed Health Care Rebates and Other Contract Discounts (660 ) (710 ) (503 ) Medicaid Rebates (673 ) (523 ) (490 ) Cash Discounts (311 ) (319 ) (281 ) Sales Returns (276 ) (348 ) (345 ) Other Adjustments (431 ) (357 ) (269 ) Total Gross-to-Net Sales Adjustments (4,516 ) (4,339 ) (3,909 ) Net Sales $ 19,380 $ 18,653 $ 16,208 In 2004, the increase from 2003 for prime vendor charge-backs and Medicaid rebates were primarily due to a shift in sales to products with higher discounts in prime vendor and Medicaid programs while the decrease in sales returns were primarily attributable to higher sales returns in 2003 resulting from discontinued products and product conversions. The overall increase in gross-to-net sales adjustments in 2003 from 2002 was primarily due to sales growth and increases in managed care rebates principally due to a shift in sales to products with higher discounts, partially offset by a decrease in WIC rebates due to a decline in state WIC contracts. The following table sets forth the activities and ending balances of each significant category of gross-to-net sales adjustments: Prime Vendor Charge- Backs Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Rebates Managed Healthcare Rebates and Other Contract Discounts Medicaid Rebates Cash Discounts Sales Returns Other Adjustments Total (dollars in millions) Balance at December 31, 2002 $ 134 $ 282 $ 230 $ 220 $ 16 $ 165 $ 87 $ 1,134 Provision related to sales made in current period 1,228 849 710 522 319 335 360 4,323 Provision related to sales made in prior periods 5 1 13 (3 ) 16 Returns and payments (1,261 ) (928 ) (692 ) (510 ) (305 ) (246 ) (322 ) (4,264 ) Impact of foreign currency translation 1 1 2 4 Balance at December 31, 2003 101 208 249 233 30 268 124 1,213 Provision related to sales made in current period 1,314 843 646 618 311 270 463 4,465 Provision related to sales made in prior periods 5 3 14 55 6 (32 ) 51 Returns and payments (1,314 ) (820 ) (711 ) (534 ) (308 ) (316 ) (385 ) (4,388 ) Impact of foreign currency translation 1 6 7 Balance at December 31, 2004 $ 106 $ 234 $ 198 $ 372 $ 33 $ 229 $ 176 $ 1,348 In 2004, the Company recorded charges of $55 million for Medicaid rebates related to sales made in prior periods. These charges include $34 million for rebate claims from prior years by certain states, primarily in relation to Medicaid utilization of oncology products not previously reported to the Company, and other revisions resulting from the availability of additional information. In addition, the Company recorded $32 million for other adjustments as a result of lower than expected rebates to foreign governments. No other significant revisions were made to the estimates for gross-to-net sales adjustments in 2004 and 2003. 41 Table of Contents Pharmaceuticals The composition of the net increase in pharmaceutical sales is as follows: Analysis of % Change Total Change Volume Price Foreign Exchange 2004 vs. 2003 4 % 1 % (1 )% 4 % 2003 vs. 2002 16 % 9 % 2 % 5 % In 2004, worldwide Pharmaceuticals sales increased 4% to $15,482 million due to favorable foreign exchange impact. Domestic sales in 2004 remained constant at $8,446 million compared to $8,431 million in 2003. Domestic sales were negatively affected by increased competition for PRAVACHOL, and exclusivity losses of PARAPLATIN and the GLUCOPHAGE* franchise, offset by increased sales of PLAVIX* and newer products, including ABILIFY*, REYATAZ and ERBITUX*. International sales in 2004 increased 8% to $7,036 million, or a decrease of 1% excluding favorable foreign exchange impact, primarily due to generic competition for PRAVACHOL and TAXOL , partially offset by the launches of ABILIFY*, REYATAZ and continued growth in PLAVIX* and AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*. In 2003, worldwide Pharmaceuticals sales increased 16% to $14,925 million, or 11% excluding favorable foreign exchange impact. Domestic sales in 2003 increased 16% to $8,431 million primarily due to increased sales of PLAVIX*, PRAVACHOL, ABILIFY*, GLUCOVANCE* and PARAPLATIN and partly due to the impact on 2002 sales from the workdown of non-consignment wholesaler inventory, and the launch of REYATAZ in July 2003, partially offset by decreased sales of GLUCOPHAGE* IR and TAXOL primarily due to generic competition. International sales in 2003 increased 17% to $6,494 million, including an 11% favorable foreign exchange impact, primarily due to increased sales of PRAVACHOL, TAXOL , PLAVIX*, AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* and Analgesic products in Europe partially offset by price declines principally in Germany and Italy. Key pharmaceutical products and their sales, representing 79%, 78% and 74% of total pharmaceutical sales in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, are as follows: % Change 2004 2003 2002 2004 to 2003 2003 to 2002 (dollars in millions) Cardiovascular PLAVIX* $ 3,327 $ 2,467 $ 1,890 35 % 31 % PRAVACHOL 2,635 2,827 2,266 (7 )% 25 % AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* 930 757 586 23 % 29 % MONOPRIL 274 470 426 (42 )% 10 % COUMADIN 255 303 300 (16 )% 1 % Virology SUSTIVA 621 544 455 14 % 20 % REYATAZ 414 88 * * VIDEX/VIDEX EC 274 267 262 3 % 2 % ZERIT 272 354 443 (23 )% (20 )% Infectious Diseases CEFZIL 270 327 287 (17 )% 14 % TEQUIN 169 208 184 (19 )% 13 % Oncology TAXOL 991 934 857 6 % 9 % PARAPLATIN 673 905 727 (26 )% 24 % ERBITUX* 261 Affective (Psychiatric) Disorders ABILIFY* (total revenue) 593 283 25 110 % * * Metabolics GLUCOVANCE* 169 424 246 (60 )% 72 % GLUCOPHAGE* IR 68 118 220 (42 )% (46 )% GLUCOPHAGE* XR 67 395 297 (83 )% 33 % ** Change is in excess of 200% Sales of PLAVIX*, a platelet aggregation inhibitor sold by the Company primarily in the U.S., increased 35%, including a 2% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $3,327 million in 2004 from 2003, primarily due to strong prescription growth of 24% in the U.S. market. Sales in 2003 were $2,467 million, an increase of 31%, including a 3% favorable foreign exchange impact, from $1,890 million in 2002, primarily due to strong prescription growth of 29% in the U.S. PLAVIX* is a cardiovascular product launched from the alliance between the Company and Sanofi-Aventis (Sanofi). Market exclusivity for PLAVIX* is expected to expire in 2011 in the U.S. and 2013 in the EU. Statements on exclusivity are subject to any adverse determination that may occur with respect to the PLAVIX* patent litigation. For additional information on the PLAVIX* patent litigation, see Item 1. Financial Statements Note 21. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. 42 Table of Contents Sales of the PRAVACHOL, an HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor, decreased 7%, including a 4% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $2,635 million in 2004. Domestic sales decreased 12% to $1,420 million in 2004, as total U.S. prescription demand decreased 10%. International sales decreased 1%, including a 10% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $1,215 million due to exclusivity loss in select European markets, including Germany and the UK. Sales for PRAVACHOL increased 25% to $2,827 million in 2003 from $2,266 million in 2002 primarily due to wholesaler workdown of inventory in the U.S. in 2002 and continued growth in Europe, particularly in France, the UK and Italy. Market exclusivity protection for PRAVACHOL is expected to expire in April 2006 in the U.S. Market exclusivity in the EU expired in 2004, with the exception of France and Sweden, for which expiration will occur in August and March 2006, respectively, and in Italy, for which expiration will occur in January 2008. Sales of AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*, an angiotensin II receptor blocker for the treatment of hypertension, increased 23%, including a 5% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $930 million in 2004 driven by increased sales in Europe and strong U.S. prescription growth of approximately 15%. Sales increased 29%, including a 6% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $757 million in 2003 from $586 million in 2002, primarily due to strong U.S. prescription growth and price increases. AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* are cardiovascular products launched from the alliance between the Company and Sanofi. Market exclusivity for AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* (known in the EU as APROVEL/KARVEA) is expected to expire in 2011 in the U.S. and 2012 in countries in the EU; AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* is not currently marketed in Japan. Sales of MONOPRIL, a second generation angiotesin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor for the treatment of hypertension, decreased 42%, including a 4% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $274 million due to the impact of market exclusivity loss. Sales in 2003 were $470 million, an increase of 10%, including a 5% favorable foreign exchange impact, from $426 million in 2002, resulting from the introduction of a branded generic product and a new government contract. Market exclusivity protection for MONOPRIL expired in 2003 in the U.S. and has expired or is expected to expire between 2001 and 2008 in countries in the EU. MONOPRIL is not currently marketed in Japan. Sales of COUMADIN, an oral anti-coagulant used predominately in patients with atrial fibrillation or deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, decreased 16% to $255 million in 2004 compared to 2003 sales, due to increased generic competition. Sales in 2003 increased 1% to $303 million from $300 million in 2002. Market exclusivity for COUMADIN expired in the U.S. in 1997. Sales of SUSTIVA, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV, increased 14%, including a 5% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $621 million in 2004 from the prior year primarily due to increased demand in 2004 and higher prices. U.S. sales increased 9% to $364 million in 2004, while total U.S. prescription growth increased by 4% in 2004. International sales of SUSTIVA increased 22%, including a 13% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $257 million in 2004 driven by increased sales in Spain, the UK, France and Italy. In 2003, SUSTIVA sales increased 20% to $544 million from $455 million in 2002, primarily due to the workdown of U.S. wholesaler inventory in the third quarter of 2002. Market exclusivity protection for SUSTIVA is expected to expire in 2013 in the U.S. and in countries in the EU; the Company does not (but others do) market SUSTIVA in Japan. Sales of REYATAZ, a protease inhibitor for the treatment of HIV, which was launched in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2003 and in Europe in the second quarter of 2004, were $414 million compared with $88 million in 2003. REYATAZ has achieved a weekly new prescription share of the U.S. protease inhibitors market of approximately 28%. Market exclusivity for REYATAZ is expected to expire in 2017 in the U.S., in countries in the EU and Japan. Sales of VIDEX/VIDEX EC, an antiretroviral agent used in the treatment of HIV, increased 3%, or decreased 3% excluding a 6% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $274 million in 2004. VIDEX/VIDEX EC sales increased 2% to $267 million in 2003 from $262 million in 2002, due to increased sales in Europe, partially offset by sales declines in the U.S. The Company has a licensing arrangement with the U.S. Government for VIDEX/VIDEX EC, which by its terms became non-exclusive in 2001. The U.S. Government method of use patent expires in 2007 in the U.S. (which includes an earned pediatric extension) and in Japan, and between 2006 and 2009 in countries in the EU. The license to the Company is non-exclusive, which has allowed another company to obtain a license from the U.S. Government and receive approval for marketing. With respect to VIDEX/VIDEX EC, the Company has patents covering the reduced mass formulation of VIDEX/VIDEX EC that expire in 2012 in the U.S., the EU and Japan. However, these patents apply only to the type of reduced mass formulation specified in the patent. Other reduced mass formulations may exist. There is currently no issued patent covering the VIDEX EC formulation. 43 Table of Contents Sales of ZERIT an antiretroviral agent used in the treatment of HIV, decreased 23%, including a 4% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $272 million in 2004, primarily as a result of continued decrease in demand due to potential adverse side effects. ZERIT sales decreased 20%, including a 5% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $354 million in 2003 from $443 million in 2002, primarily as a result of decreased demand due to potential adverse side effects. Market exclusivity protection for ZERIT is expected to expire in 2008 in the U.S., between 2007 and 2011 in countries in the EU and 2008 in Japan. Sales of CEFZIL, an antibiotic for the treatment of mild to moderately severe bacterial infections, decreased 17%, including a 2% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $270 million in 2004, primarily due to decreased domestic demand, partially offset by higher international sales. CEFZIL sales increased 14% to $327 million in 2003 from $287 million in 2002. Market exclusivity is expected to expire in 2005 in the U.S., between 2007 and 2009 in the EU and expired in 2004 in Japan. TEQUIN, an antibiotic used for the treatment of respiratory tract infections, had sales of $169 million in 2004, a decrease of 19% compared 2003 sales. In 2003, sales increased 13% to $208 million from $184 million in 2002. TEQUIN is a seasonal product with sales increasing during the flu season. The sales fluctuations from 2002 to 2004 were due to a strong flu season in 2003 and a weak flu season in 2004. The basic U.S. patent expires in 2007; however, it is expected that the patent will be eligible for a statutory patent term extension until 2009. Sales of TAXOL , the Company leading anti-cancer agent, were $991 million in 2004 compared to $934 million in 2003. Sales of TAXOL , which are almost exclusively international, increased 6%, or decreased 3% excluding favorable foreign exchange, primarily as a result of generic competition in Europe. Generic competition for TAXOL in a majority of the major European markets began in the second quarter of 2004 and increased in the second half of 2004. In 2003, TAXOL sales increased 9% or decreased 3% excluding favorable foreign exchange to $934 million from $857 million in 2002, primarily due to generic competition in the U.S., partially offset by strong sales in Japan and France. Market exclusivity protection for TAXOL expired in 2002 in the U.S., in 2003 in the EU and is expected to expire between 2003 and 2013 in Japan. Sales of PARAPLATIN, an anticancer agent, decreased 26%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $673 million due to generic competition in the U.S. which began in mid-2004 and increased with the entry of multiple generic competitors in the fourth quarter. Domestic sales of PARAPLATIN decreased 30% to $537 million. In 2003, PARAPLATIN sales increased 24%, with no significant foreign exchange impact, to $905 million from $727 million in 2002, primarily due to the introduction of a new formulation of PARAPLATIN in 2003 and price increases. Market exclusivity protection for PARAPLATIN expired in October 2004 in the U.S., in 2000 in the EU and in 1998 in Japan. ERBITUX*, an injection used in combination with irinotecan in the treatment of patients with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-expressing metastatic colorectal cancer who are refractory to irinotecan-based chemotherapy and as a single agent in the treatment of patients with EGFR-expressing metastatic colorectal cancer who are intolerant to irinotecan-based chemotherapy, was approved by the FDA in February 2004. Sales of ERBITUX*, which is sold almost exclusively in the U.S., were $261 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. A patent relating to combination therapy with ERBITUX* expires in 2017. The Company right to market ERBITUX* in North America and Japan expires in September 2018. The Company does not, but others do, market ERBITUX* in countries in the EU. Total revenue for ABILIFY*, which is primarily domestic alliance revenue for the Company 65% share of net sales in copromotion countries with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Otsuka), was $593 million in 2004, compared with $283 million and $25 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, due to continued growth in prescription demand since its launch. The schizophrenia agent was introduced in the United States in November 2002 and by December 2004, had achieved more than a 10% weekly new prescription share of the U.S. antipsychotic market. The European Commission granted marketing authorization for ABILIFY* in June 2004 and total revenue has reached $26 million since public sales commenced in June 2004. In September 2004, the FDA approved ABILIFY* for the treatment of acute bipolar mania in the U.S. Market exclusivity protection for ABILIFY* is expected to expire in 2009 in the U.S. (and may be extended until 2014 if a pending patent term extension is granted). The Company also has the right to copromote ABILIFY* in several European countries (the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Spain) and to act as exclusive distributor for the product in the rest of the European Union (EU). Market exclusivity protection for ABILIFY* is expected to expire in 2009 for the EU (and may be extended until 2014 if pending supplemental protection certificates are granted). The Company right to market ABILIFY* expires in November 2012 in the U.S. and Puerto Rico and, for the countries in the EU where the Company has the exclusive right to market ABILIFY* in June 2014. For additional information on revenue recognition of ABILIFY*, see Item 8. Financial Statements-Note 2. Alliances and Investments. GLUCOPHAGE* franchise sales decreased 65% to $336 million in 2004, compared to a 22% increase to $948 million in 2003 from $778 million in 2002. The decrease in sales in 2004 primarily resulted from increased generic competition. 44 Table of Contents GLUCOPHAGE* IR, an oral medication for treatment of non-insulin dependent (type 2) diabetes, experienced a sales decrease of 42% to $68 million. Sales decreased 46% to $118 million in 2003 from $220 million in 2002. GLUCOVANCE*, an oral combination drug, and GLUCOPHAGE* XR (Extended Release) tablets had sales in 2004 of $169 million and $67 million, respectively, compared with sales in 2003 of $424 million and $395 million, respectively, and sales in 2002 of $246 million and $297 million, respectively. Market exclusivity protection expired in March 2000 for GLUCOPHAGE* IR, in October 2003 for GLUCOPHAGE* XR, and in January 2004 for GLUCOVANCE*. The Company does not (but others do) market these products in the EU and Japan. In most instances, the basic exclusivity loss date indicated above is the expiration date of the patent that claims the active ingredient of the drug or the method of using the drug for the approved indication. In some instances, the basic exclusivity loss date indicated is the expiration date of the data exclusivity period. In situations where there is only data exclusivity without patent protection, a competitor could seek regulatory approval by submitting its own clinical trial data to obtain marketing approval. The Company assesses the market exclusivity period for each of its products on a case-by-case basis. The length of market exclusivity for any of the Company products is difficult to predict with certainty because of the complex interaction between patent and regulatory forms of exclusivity and other factors. There can be no assurance that a particular product will enjoy market exclusivity for the full period of time that the Company currently anticipates. For further discussion of market exclusivity protection, including a chart showing net sales of key products together with the year in which basic exclusivity loss occurred or is expected to occur in the U.S., the EU and Japan, see Item 1. Business Products and Intellectual Property and Product Exclusivity. The following table sets forth a comparison of reported net sales changes and the estimated total U.S. prescription growth (for both retail and mail order customers) for certain of the Company U.S. pharmaceutical prescription products. The estimated prescription growth amounts are based on third-party data provided by IMS Health, a supplier of market research to the pharmaceutical industry. A significant portion of the Company domestic pharmaceutical sales is made to wholesalers. Where changes in reported net sales differ from prescription growth, this change in net sales may not reflect underlying prescriber demand. 2004 2003 2002 % Change in U.S. Net Sales (a) % Change in U.S. Total Prescriptions (b) % Change in U.S. Net Sales (a) % Change in U.S. Total Prescriptions (b) % Change in U.S. Net Sales (a) % Change in U.S. Total Prescriptions (b) PLAVIX* 36 24 27 29 63 35 PRAVACHOL (12 ) (10 ) 22 2 1 5 AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* 19 15 24 15 16 13 MONOPRIL (85 ) (77 ) 16 (16 ) 2 (8 ) COUMADIN (18 ) (17 ) 1 (15 ) ** (16 ) SUSTIVA 9 4 13 17 ** 16 VIDEX/VIDEX EC (3 ) (4 ) (11 ) 3 15 13 ZERIT (32 ) (29 ) (29 ) (25 ) (13 ) (11 ) CEFZIL (31 ) (30 ) 14 (4 ) (7 ) (14 ) GLUCOVANCE* (61 ) (51 ) 72 3 (9 ) 48 GLUCOPHAGE*XR (83 ) (78 ) 33 (3 ) 29 81 ** In excess of 200%.

(b) Reflects change in total prescriptions in unit terms, based on third-party data. The following table sets forth for each of the Company key pharmaceutical products sold by the Company U.S. Pharmaceuticals business, the amount of the U.S. Pharmaceuticals business net sales of the applicable product for the year ended December 31, 2004 and the estimated number of months on hand of the applicable product in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel as of December 31, 2004. Net Sales (in millions) Months on Hand PLAVIX* $ 2,833 0.8 PRAVACHOL 1,420 0.8 AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* 562 0.7 ABILIFY 554 0.7 PARAPLATIN 537 1.2 SUSTIVA 364 0.6 GLUCOPHAGE* Franchise 315 0.9 REYATAZ 305 0.6 COUMADIN 228 0.8 TEQUIN 124 0.6 ZERIT 119 0.7 VIDEX/VIDEX EC 106 0.6 MONOPRIL 34 0.8 45 Table of Contents The Company determines the above months on hand estimates by dividing the estimated amount of the product in the wholesaler distribution channel by the estimated amount of out-movement of the product over a period of four weeks calculated as described below. Factors that may influence the Company estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, wholesaler purchases in light of increases in wholesale list prices, new product launches, new warehouse openings by wholesalers and new customer stockings by wholesalers. PARAPLATIN lost exclusivity in October 2004 and demand has since decreased significantly, resulting in the estimated months on hand of greater than one month. The value of PARAPLATIN inventory over one month on hand at December 31, 2004 was approximately $4 million. The Company plans to continue to monitor PARAPLATIN sales with the intention of working down wholesaler inventories to less than one month on hand. The Company maintains inventory management agreements (IMAs) with most of its U.S. wholesalers which account for nearly 100% of total gross sales of U.S. Pharmaceutical products. Under the current terms of the IMAs, these wholesalers provide the Company with information with respect to inventory levels of product on hand and the amount of out-movement of products. The inventory information received from wholesalers is a product of their record-keeping process and excludes inventory held by intermediaries to whom they sell, such as retailers and hospitals. The Company determines the amount of out-movement of a product over a period of one month by using the most recent prior four weeks of out-movement of a product as provided by these wholesalers. The Company also determines months on hand estimates by using such factors as historical sales made to those wholesalers and from third-party market research data related to prescription trends and patient demand. Nutritionals The composition of the net increase in nutritional sales is as follows: Analysis of % Change Total Change Volume Price Foreign Exchange 2004 vs. 2003 (1 )% (7 )% 6 % 2003 vs. 2002 11 % 7 % 5 % (1 )% Key Nutritional product lines and their sales, representing 94%, 84% and 85% of total Nutritional sales in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, are as follows: % Change 2004 2003 2002 2004 to 2003 2003 to 2002 (dollars in millions) Infant Formulas $ 1,405 $ 1,284 $ 1,172 9 % 10 % Toddler/Children Nutritionals 468 421 383 11 % 10 % Worldwide Nutritional sales decreased 1% to $2,001 million in 2004 from 2003. Excluding the impact of the Adult Nutritional business that was divested during the first quarter of 2004, worldwide sales increased 9% to $1,973 million from $1,817 million in 2003. International sales, excluding the impact of the Adult Nutritional business, increased 15%, primarily due to increased sales of infant formula and children nutritional products. The increase in international sales is primarily due to a 15% increase in ENFAGROW, a toddler and children nutritional product, and a 15% increase in ENFAMIL, the Company largest-selling infant formula, including a 2% favorable foreign exchange impact. Domestic sales, excluding the impact of the Adult Nutritional business, increased 3% to $945 million in 2004 from $920 million in 2003, primarily due to increased sales of ENFAMIL. In 2003, Nutritionals sales were $2,023 million, an increase of 11%, including a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, over 2002. International sales increased 9%, including a 2% unfavorable foreign exchange impact, to $938 million from $862 million in 2002 while domestic sales increased 13% to $1,085 million from $959 million in 2002. Worldwide infant formula sales increased 46 Table of Contents 10% to $1,284 million in 2003, primarily due to increased sales of ENFAMIL. International sales of ENFAMIL increased 5% to $239 million in 2003 from $228 million in 2002 and domestic sales of ENFAMIL increased 10% to $569 million in 2003 from $518 million in 2002. Worldwide toddler and children nutritionals sales increased 10%, including a 5% unfavorable foreign exchange impact, to $421 million in 2003 from $383 million in 2002, as a result of a 29% increase in sales of ENFAGROW, primarily throughout the Pacific region, to $156 million in 2003. Other Healthcare The Other Healthcare segment includes ConvaTec, the Medical Imaging business and Consumer Medicines in the United States and Japan. The composition of the net increase in other healthcare sales is as follows: Analysis of % Change Total Change Volume Price Foreign Exchange 2004 vs. 2003 11 % 6 % 1 % 4 % 2003 vs. 2002 8 % 2 % 1 % 5 % Other Healthcare sales by business and their key products for the years ended December 31, were as follows: % Change 2004 2003 2002 2004 to 2003 2003 to 2002 (dollars in millions) ConvaTec $ 954 $ 843 $ 734 13 % 15 % Ostomy 551 512 453 8 % 13 % Wound Therapeutics 391 319 273 23 % 17 % Medical Imaging 589 508 462 16 % 10 % CARDIOLITE 406 324 299 25 % 8 % Consumer Medicines 354 354 377 (6 )% In 2004, the increase in ConvaTec sales was due to a 6% increase in volume, an 8% increase due to foreign exchange partially offset by a 1% decrease from changes in selling prices. The increase over 2003 was a result of increased worldwide sales of wound therapeutics products, which increased 23%, including an 8% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $391 million. Ostomy sales were flat, excluding an 8% increase due to foreign exchange impact. In 2003, the increase in ConvaTec sales over 2002 was due to a 13% increase in worldwide sales of ostomy products to $512 million and strong growth of worldwide wound therapeutics products, which increased 17% to $319 million. Foreign exchange contributed 9% to the sales increase in 2003. In 2004, the increase in Medical Imaging sales was due to a 9% increase in volume, a 6% increase from changes in selling prices and a 1% increase due to foreign exchange. The increase in Medical Imaging sales in 2004 and 2003 were primarily driven by increased sales of CARDIOLITE. This increase was partially due to a change in the timing of revenue recognition as a result of new distribution agreements entered into in January 2004. Consumer Medicines sales remained flat at $354 million in 2004 compared to 2003 and declined from $377 million in 2002. In 2004, the sales increase in the U.S., primarily driven by higher sales of EXCEDRIN, was offset by decreased sales in Japan, primarily due to lower sales of BUFFERIN and other over-the-counter medicines. The sales decline in 2003 was in part due to distributors reducing U.S. inventory levels to more desirable levels. 47 Table of Contents Geographic Areas At least some of the Company products are available in most countries in the world. The largest markets are in the United States, France, Japan, Spain, Germany, Italy, Canada, and the UK The Company sales by geographic areas were as follows: % Change 2004 2003 2002 2004 to 2003 2003 to 2002 (dollars in millions) United States $ 10,613 $ 10,656 $ 9,450 13 % % of Total 55 % 57 % 58 % Europe, Middle East and Africa 5,470 4,985 4,041 10 % 23 % % of Total 28 % 27 % 25 % Other Western Hemisphere 1,425 1,333 1,215 7 % 10 % % of Total 7 % 7 % 8 % Pacific 1,872 1,679 1,502 11 % 12 % % of Total 10 % 9 % 9 % Total $ 19,380 $ 18,653 $ 16,208 4 % 15 % Sales in the United States remained constant in 2004, with growth in prescription demand for key brands including PLAVIX*, AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*, and SUSTIVA, and newer products including ABILIFY*, REYATAZ, and ERBITUX*, offset by lower sales of other products as a result of exclusivity losses for MONOPRIL, PARAPLATIN, and the GLUCOPHAGE* franchise. In 2003, sales in the United States increased 13%, primarily due to increased sales of PLAVIX*, PRAVACHOL, ABILIFY*, GLUCOVANCE* and PARAPLATIN. These sales increases were partially offset by the continued impact of generic competition in the United States on GLUCOPHAGE* IR and TAXOL and the result of loss of exclusivity and a label change indicating a potential serious side effect of SERZONE. Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa increased 10%, or decreased 1% excluding the impact from foreign exchange, as a result of sales decline of PRAVACHOL due to exclusivity loss in select markets, including Germany and the UK, and TAXOL , where generic competition in a majority of the major European markets began in the second quarter of 2004. This decrease in sales was mostly offset by increased sales of PLAVIX* in Germany and Spain, AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* in Italy and Spain, and SUSTIVA in the majority of the major markets. In 2003, sales increased 23%, including a 16% increase from foreign exchange, as a result of sales growth of PRAVACHOL in France, TAXOL in France, Germany, Spain and Italy, analgesics in France, PLAVIX* in Germany and Spain, AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* in Italy and SUSTIVA in Spain. Sales in the Other Western Hemisphere countries increased 7%, including a 2% increase from foreign exchange, primarily due to increased sales of PLAVIX* and AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* in Canada. In 2003, sales increased 10%, including a 5% decrease from foreign exchange, primarily due to increased sales of PLAVIX* in Canada. Pacific region sales increased 11%, including a 5% increase from foreign exchange in 2004, as a result of increased sales of TAXOL and PARAPLATIN in Japan, and PLAVIX* and AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* in Australia. In 2003, sales increased 12%, including a 6% increase from foreign exchange, as a result of increased sales of TAXOL in Japan and increased sales of ENFAGROW throughout the region.

The increase is primarily due to an increase in accelerated depreciation of $36 million to $100 million, a $75 million increase in product liability reserves and the unfavorable impact of U.S. Pharmaceutical sales mix due to the impact of generic competition in the U.S. for the GLUCOPHAGE* franchise and PARAPLATIN and launch of lower margin ERBITUX*, partially offset by sales growth of ABILIFY*, REYATAZ, and PLAVIX*. Cost of products sold also included $26 million of commercial litigation expense and $25 million of product liability insurance recovery. In 2003, cost of products sold included $53 million of accelerated depreciation of assets in manufacturing facilities in North America expected to be closed by the end of 2006 and a $14 million charge for asset impairment and other restructuring expenses. Cost of products sold in 2002 included a $15 million reversal of prior period reserves for inventory write-offs related to cancelled actions. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 25.9% in 2004, 24.8% in 2003, and 25.2% in 2002. In 2004, marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 9% to $5,016 million from 2003, primarily due to increased sales and marketing support for newer products, including additional sales representatives supporting ABILIFY*. In addition, the increase was also related to costs associated with the compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and unfavorable foreign exchange driven by the strengthening of the euro. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 13% to $4,620 million in 2003 from $4,081 million in 2002, primarily due to increased sales support for ABILIFY* and AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*, higher pension costs, higher charges related to system infrastructure, higher insurance premiums, and unfavorable foreign exchange impact, principally related to the Euro. Advertising and product promotion expenditures remained constant at $1.4 billion as compared to 2003, with increased investments in ABILIFY*, REYATAZ and PLAVIX*, offset by lower spending on in-line and non-exclusive products. In 2003, advertising and promotion expenses increased 24% to $1,415 million from $1,142 million in 2002, primarily as a result of promotional support for the ABILIFY* and REYATAZ launches and PLAVIX* in the U.S., and additional support for in-line products and unfavorable foreign exchange impact in Europe. The Company investment in research and development totaled $2,500 million in 2004, an increase of 10% over 2003 and an increase from 2003 of 3% over 2002, and as a percentage of sales were 12.9% in 2004 compared with 12.2% in 2003 and 13.6% in 2002. In 2004, the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher spending on new development projects, including investments in late-stage development, including muraglitazar, a dual PPAR agonist for diabetes; abatacept for the potential treatment of rheumatoid arthritis; and entecavir for hepatitis B, and investments in the area of biologics, partially offset by Merck share of codevelopment costs related to muraglitazar. Research and development costs also included $58 million consisting primarily of upfront and milestone payments in 2004, $102 million of charges related to the upfront payments for licensing agreements in 2003 and $69 million of accelerated depreciation on research facilities in 2002. In 2004, research and development spending dedicated to pharmaceutical products increased to 14.8% of Pharmaceuticals sales compared with 14.2% in 2003 and decreased compared with 16.5% in 2002. The increase reflects the Company strategic focus on ten critical disease areas affective (psychiatric) disorders, Alzheimer s/dementia, atherosclerosis/thrombosis, diabetes, hepatitis, HIV/AIDS, obesity, oncology, rheumatoid arthritis and related diseases and solid organ transplant. The Company is focusing its research and development activities so that it can fully realize the value of its research and development pipeline. The new priorities include rebalancing drug discovery and development to increase support for the Company full late-stage development pipeline and closing unnecessary facilities. They also include devoting greater resources to ensuring successful near-term product launches and increasing the Company efforts on in-licensing opportunities. In 2004, the $63 million charge for acquired in-process research and development was related to the purchase of Acordis, a UK-based company which is expected to strengthen the Company leadership position in wound therapeutics. In 2002, the charges related to acquired in-process research and development were $169 million, primarily related to milestone payments to ImClone Systems Incorporated (ImClone) for ERBITUX*. Of the $200 million milestone payment to ImClone, $160 million was expensed as acquired in-process research and development in the first quarter of 2002. The 49 Table of Contents remaining $40 million was recorded as an additional equity investment to eliminate the income statement effect of the portion of the milestone payment for which the Company has an economic claim through its ownership interest in ImClone. Restructuring programs have been implemented to downsize, realign and streamline operations in order to increase productivity, reduce operating expenses and to rationalize the Company manufacturing network, research facilities, and the sales and marketing organizations. Actions under the 2004 restructuring program are expected to be complete by 2006 while actions under the 2003 restructuring programs have been substantially completed, and actions under the 2002 restructuring programs were completed at December 31, 2004. As a result of these actions, the Company expects the future annual benefit to earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes to be approximately $186 million, $64 million and $150 million for the 2004, 2003 and 2002 programs, respectively. For additional information on restructuring, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 3. Restructuring and Other Items. Litigation charges, net of settlement income, were $420 million in 2004, compared to $199 million in 2003 and $659 million in 2002. The $420 million in 2004 consisted of $336 million related to private litigation and governmental investigations related to wholesaler inventory issues and accounting matters, $50 million related to the Platinol litigation settlement and $34 million related to pharmaceutical pricing and sales practices. In 2003, the Company established reserves for liabilities in the total amount of $250 million, comprised of $150 million in relation to wholesaler inventory issues and certain other accounting matters, and $100 million in relation to pharmaceutical pricing and sales and marketing practices. In addition, the Company recorded charges of $31 million for other litigation matters and recognized income of $82 million. The $82 million income consists primarily of $30 million of income for patent defense cost reimbursement, $27 million in litigation settlement income and $21 million from the settlement of anti-trust litigation involving vitamin manufacturers. The 2002 charges of $659 million primarily related to BUSPAR and TAXOL settlements. For additional information on litigation, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 21. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Equity in net income of affiliates for 2004 was $273 million, compared with $151 million and $80 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Equity in net income of affiliates principally related to the Company joint venture with Sanofi and investment in ImClone. In 2004 and 2003, the increases in equity in net income of affiliates primarily reflects higher net income in the Sanofi joint venture. For additional information on equity in net income of affiliates, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 2. Alliances and Investments. Other expenses, net of income were $52 million, $179 million and $229 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Other expenses include net interest expense, foreign exchange gains and losses, income from third-party contract manufacturing, royalty income, and gains and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment. The favorability in 2004 was primarily due to higher income from third-party contract manufacturing, lower net interest expense and lower net foreign exchange losses. The decrease in expenses in 2003 from 2002 was primarily due to net gains from interest rate swaps. During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded several items that affected the comparability of results of the periods presented herein, which are set forth in the following table. For a discussion of these items, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 2. Alliances and Investments, Note 3. Restructuring and Other Items, Note 4. Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 5.

Contributing to the decrease in 2004 were increases in costs of products sold as a result of a change in product mix, products losing exclusivity, increased investment in research and development, and income and expenses that affected the comparability of results as discussed above, partially offset by higher international sales. Net earnings from continuing operations decreased 23% in 2004 to $2,378 million from $3,097 million in 2003. In 2004, basic earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 23% to $1.23 from $1.60 in 2003, while diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 24% to $1.21 from $1.59 in 2003. In 2003, earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes increased 70% to $4,680 million from $2,748 million in 2002. The increase was primarily a result of increased sales and charges of $1,207 million recorded in 2002 for litigation settlements, asset impairments and write-offs for in-process research and development. This increase was partially offset by increased investment in advertising and promotion, and in marketing, selling and administrative expenses. Earnings from continuing operations increased 50% in 2003 to $3,097 million from $2,059 million in 2002. In 2003, basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 50% each to $1.60 and $1.59, respectively, from $1.07 and $1.06 in 2002, respectively. The effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes was 34.4% in 2004 compared with 25.8% in 2003 and 14.0% in 2002. The higher effective tax rate in 2004 is attributable primarily to a $575 million charge for estimated deferred taxes taken in the fourth quarter in anticipation of repatriating in 2005 approximately $9 billion in special dividends from the Company non-U.S. subsidiaries, pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, an increase in estimates for contingent tax matters in 2004 compared to 2003, and a charge related to the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain charitable contribution carryforwards. This increase was partially offset by the favorable resolution of certain tax refund claims, increased foreign tax credits, and in 2003, the effect of certain litigation reserves as non-deductible in 2003. The Company estimate of the tax cost related to the dividend repatriation at December 31, 2004 was based on tax laws then in effect. The estimate may be revised as a result of additional guidance or clarifying language that may be issued by Congress and/or the Department of the Treasury, or any changes in the Company factual assumptions that may occur. The increase in the 2003 effective tax rate over the 2002 effective tax rate was primarily due to the decrease in effective tax rate benefit from operations in Ireland, Puerto Rico and Switzerland, the treatment of provisions for certain litigation reserves as non-deductible, and an increase in estimates for contingent tax matters in 2003 compared to 2002. The Company has recorded valuation allowances for certain state net deferred tax assets, state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and charitable contribution carryforwards. The Company currently believes that the state net deferred tax assets, state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and charitable contribution carryforwards for which valuation allowances have been provided, more likely than not, will not be realized in the future. Pharmaceutical Earnings before minority interest and income taxes of $4,257 million in 2004 decreased from $4,369 million in 2003 primarily driven by gross margin erosion due to generic competition and product mix, additional sales representatives supporting ABILIFY*, increased spending on research and development, higher non-clinical grants and litigation settlement income in 2003, partially offset by higher sales. Earnings before minority interest and income taxes in 2002 were $3,187 million. The increase in 2003 from 2002 was primarily due to increased sales, partially offset by increased advertising and product spending on new and existing in-line products. Nutritional Earnings before minority interest and income taxes increased to $586 million in 2004 from $542 million in 2003. This increase is primarily due to increased global infant formula sales, a price increase in the infant formula line, favorable manufacturing variances and tight operating expense management. In 2003, earnings before minority interest and income taxes in the Nutritionals segment increased from $486 million in 2002 as a result of increased sales of ENFAMIL. Other Healthcare Earnings before minority interest and income taxes in the Other Healthcare segment increased to $573 million in 2004 from $408 million in 2003, primarily due to sales growth in the ConvaTec and Medical Imaging businesses, in addition to favorable pricing and product mix. In 2003, earnings before minority interest and income taxes in this segment decreased from $427 million in 2002, primarily as a result of unfavorable product mix and inventory write-offs for EXCEDRIN QUICKTABS in the Consumer Medicines business. Discontinued Operations In December 2004, the Company committed to a plan to sell OTN and entered into a definitive sale agreement with One Equity Partners LLC. OTN was formerly reported as a distinct operating segment. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2005. The sale price will be equal to $210 million, plus certain price adjustments based on OTN excess of current assets 52 Table of Contents over current liabilities on the closing date. The sale will result in a pre-tax gain of $40 to $50 million, subject to certain price adjustments and other post-closing matters. The gain from the sale of OTN will be recognized on the closing date. For further discussions of OTN, see Item 8. Financial Statements-Note 5. Discontinued Operations. The following amounts related to the OTN business have been segregated from continuing operations and are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented: Year ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (dollars in millions) Net sales $ 2,506 $ 2,241 $ 1,898 Earnings before income taxes 15 14 13 Net earnings from discontinued operations 10 9 8 The net earnings from discontinued operations of $40 million reflected in the 2002 statement of earnings primarily reflects a reduction of $32 million in the tax contingency reserve related to the spin-off of Zimmer Holdings, Inc. in 2001. Developments In January 2005, the Company announced that it intends to divest its U.S. and Canadian Consumer Medicines business. The Company primary consumer medicine brands in the U.S. and Canada are EXCEDRIN, KERI, CHOICE and COMTREX. For the year ended December 31, 2004, sales of consumer medicines brands in the U.S. and Canada totaled approximately $270 million. The Company consumer medicines businesses in Japan, Asia Pacific, Latin America, Europe, Middle East and Africa are not included in this divestiture. In December 2004, the Company provided an update on the rolling BLA for abatacept submitted under the provisions of FDA Continuous Marketing Application, Pilot 1. Abatacept is an investigational biologic drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and its development program was granted Fast Track status by the FDA. Complete Non-Clinical and Clinical sections of the BLA have already been submitted to the FDA and the remaining section is expected to be submitted early this year. In December 2004, the Company and Somerset Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Somerset), a joint venture between Mylan Laboratories Inc. and Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc., entered into an agreement for the commercialization and distribution of Somerset EMSAM (selegiline transdermal system), an investigational monoamine oxidase inhibitor administered as a transdermal patch for the acute and maintenance treatment of patients with major depressive disorder. Somerset received an Approvable letter from the FDA for EMSAM in February 2004, and if approved by the FDA, EMSAM would be the first transdermal treatment for major depressive disorder. In December 2004, the Company and Corgentech Inc. announced top-line results from the first of two Phase 3 clinical trials for edifoligide (E2F Decoy). In a trial involving patients undergoing peripheral artery vein grafts, the primary and secondary endpoints failed to show a benefit in the edifoligide-treated group compared to the placebo group as defined as the rate of vein graft failure over the 12 months following surgery. Edifoligide is an investigational product to prevent vein graft failure in the coronary and peripheral arteries. In December 2004, the Company and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) entered into a joint venture to develop and commercialize a fixed-dose combination of the Company SUSTIVA and Gilead TRUVADA* (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) in the United States. If approved, the new product would be the first complete Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) treatment regimen for HIV available in a fixed-dose combination taken once daily. In November 2004, the Company and Medarex, Inc. (Medarex) entered into a worldwide collaboration to develop and commercialize MDX-010, a fully human antibody investigational product targeting the CTLA-4 receptor. MDX-010 was developed by Medarex and is currently in Phase III clinical development for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. The collaboration agreement became effective in January 2005, at which time the Company made a cash payment of $25 million to Medarex which was expensed as research and development, and an additional $25 million equity investment in Medarex. In September 2004, the Company completed the submission of a NDA to the FDA for entecavir, an investigational antiviral agent under development for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis B. In addition, the FDA granted the Company a priority review for entecavir. The Company also submitted a marketing authorization application for entecavir to the European Medicines Evaluation Agency. 53 Table of Contents In August 2004, the FDA approved the Company supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to include new long-term virologic and clinical data from BMS Study 006 in its prescribing information related to SUSTIVA (efavirenz). The new data demonstrate the long-term durability of virologic response in people living with HIV-1 who are naive to protease inhibitors, lamivudine (3TC) and non-nucleoside reverse transriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) through more than three years of treatment on a combination regimen containing SUSTIVA. In July 2004, the FDA approved the Company sNDA to include new scientific data and dosing in its package insert or labeling related to REYATAZ. With the sNDA, the REYATAZ labeling now includes data indicating that combination HIV treatments containing REYATAZ/ritonavir and Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir; Abbott Laboratories, Inc.) were similar for the primary efficacy outcome measurement of time-averaged difference in change from baseline in HIV RNA level in HIV-infected patients previously taking anti-HIV medicines. In June 2004, the Company and Otsuka announced that the European Commission granted marketing authorization for ABILIFY*, an antipsychotic medication, for the treatment of schizophrenia. Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd., Otsuka European holding company, holds the marketing authorization for ABILIFY* in Europe. The Company and Otsuka currently copromote ABILIFY* in the United Kingdom and Germany, and will also copromote it in France and Spain. In addition, the Company also has an exclusive right to sell ABILIFY* in a number of other countries in Europe. In the U.S., the FDA approved ABILIFY* for the treatment of acute bipolar mania in September 2004, and in December 2004, the Company and Otsuka received approval from the FDA for an oral solution formulation of ABILIFY*. The oral solution became available in U.S. pharmacies in February 2005. In May 2004, the Company entered into a worldwide codevelopment and cocommercialization agreement with Solvay Pharmaceuticals (Solvay) to codevelop and copromote the investigational compound SLV319 which is currently in Phase I development with potential for use in treating obesity and other metabolic disorders. The Company may also elect to develop and market two additional investigational compounds selected from Solvay pool of eligible compounds. The Company paid Solvay an upfront milestone payment of $10 million in July 2004, which was expensed as research and development. Further milestone payments are expected to be made upon the successful outcome of certain development and regulatory stages. In April 2004, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement with Merck for worldwide codevelopment and copromotion for muraglitazar, the Company dual PPAR (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor) agonist, currently in Phase III clinical development for use in treating Type 2 diabetes. An NDA for muraglitazar was submitted to the FDA in December 2004 for U.S. regulatory approval. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company received a $100 million upfront payment in May 2004, and received an additional $55 million milestone payment in January 2005 for the filing of the NDA. The Company is entitled to receive $220 million in additional payments upon achievement of certain regulatory milestones. The Company and Merck will jointly develop the clinical and marketing strategy for muraglitazar, share equally in future development and commercialization costs and copromote the product to physicians on a global basis, with Merck to receive payments based on net sales levels. In April 2004, the Company and Pierre Fabre Medicament S.A. (Pierre Fabre), entered into an agreement to develop and commercialize JAVLOR* * (vinflunine), a novel investigational anti-cancer agent. JAVLOR* is currently in Phase III clinical trials in Europe for the treatment of bladder and non-small cell lung cancer, and Phase II clinical trials in breast and ovarian cancer. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company received an exclusive license to JAVLOR* in the United States, Canada, Japan, Korea, and select Southeast Asian markets. Pierre Fabre will be responsible for the development and marketing of JAVLOR* in all other countries, including Europe. Under the agreement, the Company made and expensed upfront and milestone payments of $35 million in 2004, with the potential for an additional $175 million in milestone payments over time. In April 2004, the Company announced the completion of the acquisition of Acordis for $158 million. Acordis is a privately held company based in the U.K. that licenses patent rights and supplies materials to ConvaTec for its Wound Therapeutics line. The acquired business was incorporated as part of the Company ConvaTec division. This acquisition will enable ConvaTec to strengthen its position in the field of wound care management and continue to provide new treatment options for patients with acute or chronic wound care needs. See Item 1. Financial Statements Note 4. Acquisitions and Divestitures. In March 2004, the Company announced that its Medical Imaging business entered into an agreement with Kereos, Inc. (Kereos) for the development and commercialization of novel molecular imaging agents. Under the terms of the agreement, the companies will work together to develop molecular imaging agents for cardiovascular diseases and cancer using Kereos core technology. Medical Imaging has obtained exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize select cardiovascular molecular imaging agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Kereos has obtained exclusive worldwide rights to use a family of Medical Imaging targeting molecules with Kereos core technology to develop and commercialize molecular cancer imaging agents and targeted therapeutics, including KI-001 Kereos lead candidate for early MRI detection of tumors. In February 2004, the FDA approved the BLA for ERBITUX*, the anticancer agent that the Company is developing in partnership with ImClone. ERBITUX* Injection is for use in combination with irinotecan in the treatment of patients with Epidermal 54 Table of Contents Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-expressing, metastatic colorectal cancer who are refractory to irinotecan-based chemotherapy and for use as a single agent in the treatment of patients with EGFR-expressing, metastatic colorectal cancer who are intolerant to irinotecan-based chemotherapy. In accordance with the agreement, the Company paid ImClone $250 million in March 2004 as a milestone payment for the approval of ERBITUX* by the FDA. The FDA also approved ImClone Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls supplemental BLA for licensure of its BB36 manufacturing facility for ERBITUX* in June 2004. Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $7.5 billion at December 31, 2004, compared with $5.6 billion at December 31, 2003. The Company continues to maintain a high level of working capital, which was $5.0 billion at December 31, 2004, increasing from $4.5 billion at December 31, 2003. In 2005, the Company expects cash generated by its U.S. operations, together with borrowings from the capital markets, to sufficiently cover cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures, milestone payments and dividends paid in the United States. Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, the conversion of other working-capital items and borrowings are expected to fund near-term operations. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had approximately $16.9 billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Company accrued a provision for $575 million of estimated deferred taxes in the fourth quarter of 2004 which is expected to be paid in 2005, in anticipation of repatriating approximately $9 billion of the undistributed earnings in 2005 pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). Taxes were not provided on the balance of undistributed earnings of approximately $7.9 billion, as the Company has invested or expects to invest these undistributed earnings permanently offshore. If in the future these earnings are repatriated to the United States, or if the Company determines such earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future, additional tax provisions would be required. Due to complexities in the tax laws and the assumptions that would have to be made, it is not practicable to estimate the amounts of income taxes that would have to be provided. The AJCA, which President Bush signed into law on October 22, 2004, provides for a temporary 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain cash distributions of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The deduction would result in a federal tax rate of approximately 5.25% on the repatriated earnings (assuming a marginal federal tax rate of 35% on those earnings). To qualify for the deduction, the repatriated earnings must be reinvested in the United States pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan approved by a company chief executive officer and subsequently by its board of directors. In January 2005, the Department of Treasury issued guidelines for permitted investments under the plan. The Company expects to meet the requirements and criteria to qualify for the deduction. However, several provisions in the AJCA require further clarification which may be addressed in the coming months by the Treasury or Congress. The Company estimate of the tax cost related to the repatriation at December 31, 2004 was based on tax laws then in effect. To the extent the tax laws and guidance changes, the estimate will be revised. The Company estimate may also be revised as a result of any changes in the Company factual assumptions that may occur. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2004 primarily consisted of U.S. dollar denominated bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. Marketable securities at December 31, 2004 primarily consisted of U.S. dollar denominated floating rate instruments with a AAA/aaa credit rating. Due to the nature of these instruments, the Company considers it reasonable to expect that their fair market values will not be significantly impacted by a change in interest rates, and that they can be liquidated for cash at short notice. The average interest yield on cash and cash equivalents was 2.3% and 1.2% at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, while interest yields on marketable securities averaged 2.5% and 1.3%, respectively. Long-term debt at December 31, 2004 was denominated primarily in U.S. dollars but also included Japanese yen debt of $187 million. Long-term debt remained constant at $8.5 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003. A majority of the Company debt is fixed rate. The Company, however, has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps for $6.2 billion of its long-term debt. Interest expense, net of interest swap gains, was $310 million, $277 million, and $364 million, in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in interest expense in 2004 over 2003 was primarily due to increased short-term borrowings and higher interest rates; the decrease in 2003 over 2002 was driven by the net gains from interest rate swaps. U.S. commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2004 was $1.6 billion with an average interest rate of 2.3%. There was no U.S. commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2003. The average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, on international short-term borrowings were 9.3% and 8.0%, respectively, and on current installments of long-term debt were 2.8% and 1.3%, respectively. In December 2004, the Company replaced its prior $1 billion revolving credit facilities with a new $2 billion five year revolving credit facility from a syndicate of lenders, which is extendable on the anniversary date with the consent of the lenders. The availability of the facility is subject to the Company ability at the time of borrowing to meet certain conditions, including a financial covenant in which net debt to capital cannot exceed 50%. This facility does not contain a material adverse change representation in the Company business as a condition to borrowing. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had a ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated capital of 14%, and has been in compliance with this covenant since the inception of the facility. Changes in public 55 Table of Contents credit ratings will not affect the availability of the credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2004 and 2003. The Company also had unused short-term lines of credit with foreign banks of $158 million and $363 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In April 2003, Moody Investors Service (Moody s) lowered the Company long-term credit rating from Aa2 to A1 and in March 2003, affirmed the Prime-1 short-term credit rating for the Company. In July 2003, Standard & Poor (S&P) lowered its long-term credit rating on the Company from AA to AA- and affirmed its A-1+ short-term rating. In March 2004, S&P placed both long-term and short-term ratings of the Company on watch with negative implications. In August 2004, S&P downgraded the short-term credit rating for the Company to A1 and the long-term credit rating of the Company to A+. Both Moody and S&P long-term credit rating remains on negative outlook. The following is a discussion of working capital and cash flow activities: 2004 2003 2002 (dollars in millions) Working capital $ 4,958 $ 4,536 $ 1,573 Cash flow from: Operating activities 3,176 3,512 945 Investing activities (1,622 ) (2,419 ) (2,030 ) Financing activities (463 ) (1,031 ) (1,033 ) The increase in working capital of $422 million from 2003 was primarily due to: increased receivables resulting from higher sales and higher foreign withholding taxes expected to be refunded; higher inventories resulting from new product introductions and higher demand for existing key brands; partially offset by higher accounts payable due to higher purchasing activities in 2004; and higher accrued expenses, rebates and returns mainly due to increases in royalties, higher unrealized losses from derivatives and Medicaid rebates. Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.2 billion in 2004, $3.5 billion in 2003 and $0.9 billion in 2002. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for 2004 is mainly attributable to lower earnings and higher usage of working capital. The significant changes in operating assets and liabilities between 2004 and 2003 are: a $260 million increase in inventory primarily due to the introduction of new products including REYATAZ and ERBITUX* and higher demand for key brands including PLAVIX*, AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* and SUSTIVA; a $350 million decrease in deferred revenue on consigned inventory due to the workdown of the consignment inventory in 2003; and a $146 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses including advertising and promotion, deferred revenue for ABILIFY* and milestone payments. The increase in 2003 over 2002 was primarily due to income tax payment in 2002 related to the gain arising from the sale of the Clairol business, increase in earnings, higher rate of decrease in deferred revenue on consigned inventory due to the workdown of the consignment inventory, higher accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by reduction in accounts receivable and increased litigation settlement payments. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.6 billion in 2004 compared to $2.4 billion in 2003 and $2.0 billion in 2002. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities is mainly attributable to $364 million cash proceeds from the sale of the Company Adult Nutritional business, lower purchases in marketable securities and $261 million of lower capital spending, partially offset by a milestone payment of $250 million to ImClone, $150 million payment for the Acordis acquisition and increased purchases of trademarks, patents and licenses. Net cash used in financing activities was $0.5 billion in 2004, and $1.0 billion in both 2003 and 2002. The decrease in 2004 from 2003 was mainly attributable to an increase in short-term borrowings in 2004 partially offset by the proceeds received from the issuance of convertible debt in 2003. Cash provided from operations and borrowings were primarily used over the past three years to pay dividends of $6.5 billion. The Company has also invested $2.7 billion over the past three years in capital expansion to improve plant efficiency and maintain superior research facilities. During 2004 and 2003, the Company did not repurchase any of its common stock. The Company repurchased 5 million shares of common stock at a cost of $164 million in 2002, bringing the total shares acquired since the share repurchase program inception to 372 million shares. The share repurchase program authorizes the Company to purchase common stock from time to time in the open market or through private transactions as market conditions permit. This program is intended to reduce the increase in shares outstanding from option exercises and to obtain shares for general corporate purposes. 56 Table of Contents Dividends declared per common share were $1.12 for each of 2004, 2003, and 2002. In December 2004, the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $.28 per common share and indicated a dividend for the full year 2005 of $1.12 per share. Dividend decisions are made on a quarterly basis by the Board of Directors. The Company financial condition and liquidity could be affected by obligations to make milestone or other one-time payments and by the outcome of pending litigations and investigations, including the challenge to the PLAVIX* patent. For more information, see Item 1. Business Strategic Alliances and Arrangements, Item 8. Financial Statements Note 2. Alliances and Investments and Note 21. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Contractual Obligations Payments due by period for the Company contractual obligations at December 31, 2004, are as follows: Obligations Expiring by Period Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Later Years (dollars in millions) Short-term borrowings $ 1,883 $ 1,883 $ $ $ $ $ Long-term debt (1) 8,463 2,512 2 1,735 1 4,213 Operating leases 485 123 99 78 65 62 58 Purchase obligations 1,237 364 230 185 129 115 214 Stand-by letters of credit 61 61 Other liabilities 1,300 191 241 209 199 198 262 Total $ 13,429 $ 2,622 $ 3,082 $ 474 $ 2,128 $ 376 $ 4,747 (1) 2005 long-term debt obligations are included in short-term borrowings on the Company consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004 and all balances represent the outstanding nominal long-term debt values. The contractual obligations table above excludes interest payment obligations. In addition to the above, the Company has committed to make potential future milestone payments to third-parties as part of in-licensing and development programs. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on the Company consolidated balance sheet. For a discussion of contractual obligations, reference is made to Item 8. Financial Statements Note 15. Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt, Note 17. Financial Instruments, Note 19. Leases and Note 20. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans. Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements As previously disclosed, the Company experienced a substantial buildup of wholesaler inventories in its U.S. pharmaceuticals business in 2000 and 2001. This buildup was primarily due to sales incentives offered by the Company to its wholesalers. These incentives were generally offered towards the end of a quarter in order to incentivize wholesalers to purchase products in an amount sufficient to meet the Company quarterly sales projections established by the Company senior management. In April 2002, the Company disclosed this substantial buildup, and developed and subsequently undertook a plan to work down in an orderly fashion these wholesaler inventory levels by reducing the amount of sales made by the Company to wholesalers relative to the amount of sales made by wholesalers to customers, thereby reducing the inventories of the Company products held by wholesalers. In October 2002, based on further review and consideration of the previously disclosed buildup of wholesaler inventories in the Company U.S. pharmaceuticals business and the incentives offered to certain wholesalers, and on advice from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), an independent registered public accounting firm, the Company determined that it was required to restate its sales and earnings to correct errors in timing of revenue recognition for certain sales made to the two largest wholesalers of the U.S. pharmaceuticals business. The Company determined that these sales should be accounted for under the consignment model, based, in part, on the relationship between the amount and nature of incentives offered to these wholesalers and the amount of inventory held by these wholesalers. Following that determination, the Company also determined that it would correct its historical accounting policies to conform the accounting to GAAP and known errors made in the application of GAAP that were previously not recorded because in each such case the Company believed the amount of any such error was not material to the Company consolidated financial statements. In addition, as part of the restatement process, the Company investigated its accounting practices in areas that involved significant judgment and determined to restate additional items with respect to which the Company concluded errors were made in the application of GAAP, including revisions of inappropriate accounting. 57 Table of Contents In March 2003, the Company completed the restatement of its financial statements for these items and restated its financial statements for the three years ended December 31, 2001 (2002 Restatement). After completing the 2002 Restatement, the Company continued to identify and implement actions to improve the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. In connection with this effort, the Company (i) has substantially strengthened the organization and personnel of the senior financial and control functions, (ii) adopted more rigorous policies and procedures with respect to its balance sheet review process, (iii) focused its internal audit function on financial reporting controls, (iv) engaged a consultant to assist in the evaluation and documentation of certain financial reporting and disclosure processes throughout the Company, in particular with respect to designing standard operating procedures and implementing tools to ensure that disclosure issues are effectively identified, managed and controlled globally and (v) engaged a consultant to assist the Company personnel to conduct a comprehensive and detailed review of certain of the Company tax reporting and accounting, in particular with respect to developing more effective processes for establishing and monitoring deferred income taxes, valuation allowances and the Company annual effective tax rate. In addition, at the request of the Company Audit Committee, an independent registered public accounting firm performed more extensive procedures with respect to the Company interim financial information during 2003 and, based on the auditors assessment of the Company risk profile, expanded the scope and amount of field work to be performed for certain areas in connection with its audit of the Company for 2003. These actions contributed significantly to the Company identifying additional errors relating to prior periods not reflected in the 2002 Restatement. In March 2004, the Company corrected these errors by restating its financial statements for the two years ended December 31, 2002. SEC Consent Order As previously disclosed, on August 4, 2004, the Company entered into a final settlement with the SEC, concluding an investigation concerning certain wholesaler inventory and accounting matters. The settlement was reached through a Consent, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 10s to the Company quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2004. In the Consent, the Company agreed, without admitting or denying any liability, not to violate certain provisions of the securities laws. The Company also agreed to establish a $150 million fund for a class of shareholders to be distributed under the court supervision. The $150 million fund, which included a $100 million civil penalty, will be distributed to certain Company shareholders under a plan of distribution established by the SEC. Under the terms of the Consent, the Company has agreed, subject to certain defined exceptions, to limit sales of all products sold to its direct customers (including wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, retail outlets, pharmacies and government purchasers) based on expected demand or on amounts that do not exceed approximately one month of inventory on hand, without making a timely public disclosure of any change in practice. The Company has established a company-wide policy to limit its sales to direct customers for the purpose of complying with the Consent. This policy includes the adoption of various procedures to monitor and limit sales to direct customers in accordance with the terms of the Consent. These procedures include a governance process to escalate to appropriate management levels any potential questions or concerns regarding compliance with the policy and timely resolution of such questions or concerns. In addition, compliance with the policy will be monitored on a regular basis. The Company maintains inventory management agreements (IMAs) with most of its U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers which account for nearly 100% of total gross sales of U.S. pharmaceuticals products. Under the current terms of the IMAs, these wholesalers provide the Company with information about the inventory levels of product on hand and the amount of out-movement of products. The information received from these wholesalers is a product of their own record-keeping process and excludes inventory held by intermediaries to whom they sell, such as retailers and hospitals. The Company determines the outmovement of a product over a period of one-month by using the most recent prior four weeks of out-movement of a product as provided by these wholesalers. The Company also determines the months on hand estimates for its U.S Pharmaceuticals business by using such factors as historical sales made to those wholesalers and from third party market research data related to prescription trends and patient demand. In contrast, for the Company pharmaceuticals business outside of the United States, nutritionals and other healthcare business units around the world, the Company has significantly more direct customers, limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out movement information and the reliability of third party demand information, where available, varies widely. Accordingly, the Company relies on a variety of methods to estimate direct customer product level inventory and to calculate months on hand for these business units. The Company expects to complete its analysis of direct customer inventory levels in these businesses in the first quarter of 2005 and will provide additional disclosure of information with respect to direct customer inventory levels. The Company has and will continue to enhance its methods to estimate direct customer product level inventory and months on hand for these business units, taking into account the complexities described above. The Company will continue to disclose for each of its key pharmaceutical products sold by the U.S. Pharmaceutical business the amount of net sales and the estimated number of months on hand in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel as of the end of the immediately preceding quarter and as of the end of the applicable quarter in its quarterly and annual reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K. For all other business units, the Company expects to disclose on a quarterly basis the key product level inventories. The information 58 Table of Contents required to estimate months on hand in the direct customer distribution for the non-U.S. Pharmaceuticals business is not available prior to the time the Company is required to file quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, the Company expects to disclose this information on its website approximately 60 days after the end of each quarter. In addition to the foregoing quarterly disclosure, the Company will include all the foregoing information for all business units for each quarter in its Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company believes the above-described procedures provide a reasonable basis to ensure compliance with the Consent Order and provides sufficient information to comply with disclosure requirements. The Company has agreed in the Consent to certain measures that it has implemented or will implement including: (a) establishing a formal review and certification process of its annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC; (b) establishing a business risk and disclosure group; (c) retaining an outside consultant to comprehensively study and help re-engineer the Company accounting and financial reporting processes (d) publicly disclosing any sales incentives offered to direct customers for the purpose of inducing them to purchase products in excess of expected demand; and (e) ensuring that the Company budget process gives appropriate weight to inputs that come from the bottom to the top, and not just those that come from the top to the bottom, and adequately documenting that process. The Company also agreed in the Consent to retain an Independent Adviser through the date that the Company Form 10-K for the year ended 2005 is filed with the SEC. The Consent defines certain powers and responsibilities of the Independent Adviser. The Consent includes a process for the Independent Adviser to make recommendations regarding the Company compliance with applicable federal securities laws and corporate obligations. The Company has agreed in the Consent to adopt the Independent Adviser recommendations regarding compliance with applicable federal securities laws and corporate obligations. The settlement does not resolve the ongoing investigation by the SEC of the activities of certain current and former members of the Company management in connection with the wholesaler inventory issues and other accounting matters, which investigation is ongoing. In addition, an investigation by the U.S. Attorney Office for the District of New Jersey concerning the inventory and accounting matters covered by the Company settlement with the SEC is continuing. The Company is continuing to cooperate with those investigations. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a revised Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (SFAS No. 123R), Share-Based Payment . This standard eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value-based method under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees , and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. SFAS No. 123R is effective for financial statements issued for the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2005. Currently, the Company discloses the pro forma net income and related pro forma income per share information in accordance with SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation , and SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Costs Transition and Disclosure . The Company is evaluating the impact of this statement which could have a material impact on its results of operations. In December 2004, the FASB issued a final staff position (FSP) No. 109-1 Application of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The effect of the adoption of FSP No. 109-1 is not material to the Company consolidated financial statements. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies-Income Taxes. In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets. The provisions of this Statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The provisions of this Statement should be applied prospectively, and eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph 21(b) of APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions, and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. The standard requires abnormal amounts of idle facility and related expenses to be recognized as current period charges and also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company is evaluating the impact that this statement will have on its financial position and results of operations. In June 2004, the FASB issued FSP No. 106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Medicare Act). The Medicare Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. FSP No. 106-2 requires that the effects of the new law be accounted for under SFAS No. 59 Table of Contents 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. The Company adopted FSP No. 106-2 in the third quarter of 2004, retroactive to January 1, 2004. There was a reduction in net periodic benefit cost for other benefits of $8 million for 2004, based on the re-measurement of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of January 1, 2004. The effect of the adoption of FSP No. 106-2 was not material to the Company consolidated financial statements. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 20. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans. In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on Issue No. 03-06, Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method Under FAS 128 , which requires the use of the two-class method of computing earnings per share for those enterprises with participating securities or multiple classes of common stock. The consensus is effective for fiscal periods beginning after March 31, 2004. The adoption of EITF No. 03-06 did not affect the Company consolidated financial statements. In December 2003, the FASB revised Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). FIN 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity residual returns or both. FIN 46 also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46 (as revised) apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and to existing entities in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after March 15, 2004. Certain of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity was established. This accounting pronouncement did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies The Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, including disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the Company financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in their application, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Because of the uncertainty of factors surrounding the estimates or judgments used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, actual results may vary from these estimates. The Company believes that the following discussion represents its critical accounting policies. Management and the Company independent registered public accounting firm have discussed the Company critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, as amended by SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition. The Company accounting policy for revenue recognition has a substantial impact on its reported results and relies on certain estimates that require difficult, subjective and complex judgments on the part of management. The Company recognizes revenue for sales when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer, which generally occurs on the date of shipment, with the exceptions described below. In previous years, certain transactions with the Company U.S. Pharmaceuticals wholesalers were accounted for using the consignment model. In the case of sales made to wholesalers (1) as a result of incentives, (2) in excess of the wholesaler ordinary course of business inventory level, (3) at a time when there was an understanding, agreement, course of dealing or consistent business practice that the Company would extend incentives based on levels of excess inventory in connection with future purchases, and (4) at a time when such incentives would cover substantially all, and vary directly with, the wholesaler cost of carrying inventory in excess of the wholesaler ordinary course of business inventory level, substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership do not transfer upon shipment, and accordingly, such sales should be accounted for using the consignment model. The determination of when, if at all, sales to a wholesaler meet the foregoing criteria involves evaluation of a variety of factors and a number of complex judgments. Under the consignment model, the Company did not recognize revenue upon shipment of product. Rather, upon shipment of product the Company invoiced the wholesaler, recorded deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price, and classified the inventory held by the wholesalers as consignment inventory at the Company cost of such inventory. The Company recognized revenue (net of the gross to net sales adjustments discussed below, all of which involve significant estimates and judgments) when the consignment inventory is no longer subject to the incentive arrangements described above, but not later than when such inventory is sold through to the wholesalers customers, on a FIFO basis. In the case of new products for which the product introduction is not an extension of an existing line of product or where the Company determines that there are not products in a similar therapeutic category, such that the Company cannot reliably estimate 60 Table of Contents expected returns of the new product, the Company defers recognition of revenue until the right of return no longer exists or until the Company has developed sufficient historical experience to estimate sales returns. For discussions on revenue recognition, see Item 8. Financial Statements-Note 1. Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition, -Sales Rebate and Return Accruals and Note 11. Consignment. Gross to Net Sales Adjustments The Company has the following significant categories of gross to net sales adjustments which impact the Company three reportable segments: prime vendor charge-backs, WIC rebates, managed health care rebates and other contract discounts, Medicaid rebates, cash discounts, sales returns, and other adjustments, all of which involve significant estimates and judgments and require the Company to use information from external sources. The Company accounts for these gross to net sales adjustments in accordance with EITF Issue No. 01-9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor Products) , and SFAS 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists (SFAS 48), as applicable. See Net Sales section above for reconciliations of the Company gross sales to net sales by each significant category of gross-to-net sales adjustments. Prime vendor charge-backs The Company U.S. businesses participate in prime vendor programs with government entities, the most significant of which are the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and other parties whereby pricing on products is extended below wholesaler list price to participating entities. These entities purchase products through wholesalers at the lower prime vendor price, and the wholesalers charge the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower prime vendor price back to the Company. The Company accounts for prime vendor charge-backs by reducing accounts receivable in an amount equal to the Company estimate of charge-back claims attributable to a sale. The Company determines its estimate of the prime vendor charge-backs primarily based on historical experience regarding prime vendor charge-backs and current contract prices under the prime vendor programs. The Company considers prime vendor payments, levels of inventory in the distribution channel, and the Company claim processing time lag and adjusts the reduction to accounts receivable periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. WIC rebates The Company U.S. Nutritionals business participates on a competitive bidding basis in nutrition programs sponsored by states, tribal governments, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Territory of Guam for women, infants, and children (WIC). Under these programs, the Company reimburses these entities for the difference between wholesaler list price and the contract price on eligible products. The Company accounts for WIC rebates by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to the Company estimate of WIC rebate claims attributable to a sale. The Company determines its estimate of the WIC rebate accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding WIC rebates and current contract prices under the WIC programs. The Company considers levels of inventory in the distribution channel, new WIC contracts, terminated WIC contracts, changes in existing WIC contracts, and WIC participations and adjusts the accrual periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. Managed health care rebates and other contract discounts The Company offers rebates and discounts to managed health care organizations in the U.S. and globally to other contract counterparties such as hospitals and group purchasing organizations. The Company accounts for managed health care rebates and other contract discounts by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to the Company estimate of managed health care rebates and other contract discounts attributable to a sale. The Company determines its estimate of the managed health care rebates and other contract discounts accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding these rebates and discounts and current contract prices. The Company considers the sales performance of products subject to managed health care rebates and other contract discounts and levels of inventory in the distribution channel and adjusts the accrual periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. Medicaid rebates The Company U.S. businesses participate in state government-managed Medicaid programs as well as certain other qualifying federal and state government programs whereby discounts and rebates are provided to participating state and local government entities. Discounts and rebates provided through these latter programs are included in the Company Medicaid rebate accrual and are considered Medicaid rebates for the purposes of this discussion. The Company accounts for Medicaid rebates by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to the Company estimate of Medicaid rebate claims attributable to a sale. The Company determines its estimate of the Medicaid rebates accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding Medicaid rebates, as well as any expansion on a prospective basis of its participation in the non-mandatory aspects of the qualifying federal and state government programs, legal interpretations of the applicable laws related to the Medicaid and qualifying 61 Table of Contents federal and state government programs, and any new information regarding changes in the Medicaid programs regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the rebates. The Company considers outstanding Medicaid claims, Medicaid payments, and levels of inventory in the distribution channel and adjusts the accrual periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. Cash Discounts In the U.S. and certain other countries, the Company offers cash discounts, generally approximately 2% of the sales price, as an incentive for prompt payment. The Company accounts for cash discounts by reducing accounts receivable by the full amount of the discounts. The Company considers payment performance and adjusts the accrual to reflect actual experience. Sales Returns The Company accounts for sales returns in accordance with SFAS 48 by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to the Company estimate of sales recorded for which the related products are expected to be returned. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, provision for sales returns were $276 million, $348 million and $345 million, respectively, or 1%, 2% and 2%, respectively, of gross sales. For returns of established products, the Company determines its estimate of the sales return accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding sales returns but also considers other factors that could impact sales returns. These factors include levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product recalls, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, introductions of generic products and introductions of competitive new products. The Company considers all of these factors and adjusts the accrual periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. The Company considers the level of inventory in the distribution channel and determines whether it believes an adjustment to the sales return accrual is appropriate. For example, if levels of inventory in the distribution channel increase, the Company analyzes the reasons for the increase and if the reasons indicate that sales returns will be larger than expected, the Company adjusts the sales return accrual, taking into account historical experience, the Company returned goods policy and the shelf life of the Company products, which ranges, on average, from approximately 12 to 48 months. In situations where the Company is aware of products in the distribution channel nearing their expiration date, the Company analyzes the situation and if the analysis indicates that sales returns will be larger than expected, the Company adjusts the sales return accrual, taking into account historical experience, the Company returned goods policy, and levels of inventory in the distribution channel. In the event of a product recall or product discontinuance, the Company considers the reasons for and impact of such actions and adjusts the sales return accrual as appropriate, taking into account historical experience, levels of inventory in the distribution channel and, for product discontinuances, estimates of continuing demand. Although the Company considers price changes of competitive products, introductions of generic products and introductions of competitive new products, the Company generally does not believe that these factors impact sales returns based on historical experience and the Company returned goods policy. Returns from new products are significantly more difficult for the Company to assess. The Company determines its estimate of the sales return accrual primarily based on the historical sales returns experience of similar products, such as those within the same line of product or those within the same or similar therapeutic category. In limited circumstances, where the new product is not an extension of an existing line of product or where the Company has no historical experience with products in a similar therapeutic category, such that the Company cannot reliably estimate expected returns of the new product, the Company defers recognition of revenue until the right of return no longer exists or until the Company has developed sufficient historical experience to estimate sales returns. The Company also considers the shelf life of new products and determines whether it believes an adjustment to the sales return accrual is appropriate. The shelf life in connection with new products tends to be shorter than the shelf life for more established products because the Company may still be developing an optimal manufacturing process for the new product that would lengthen its shelf life, or an amount of launch quantities may have been manufactured in advance of the launch date to ensure sufficient supply exists to satisfy market demand. In those cases, the Company assesses the reduced shelf life, together with levels of inventory in the distribution channel and projected demand, and determines whether it believes an adjustment to the sales return accrual is appropriate. Other adjustments In addition to the significant gross to net sales adjustments described above, the Company makes other gross to net sales adjustments. For example, the Company offers sales discounts, most significantly in its non-U.S. businesses, and also offers consumer coupons and rebates, most significantly in its U.S. Nutritionals, Consumer Medicines and Pharmaceuticals businesses. In addition, in a number of countries outside the U.S., including major European countries, the Company provides rebates to government entities. 62 Table of Contents The Company generally accounts for these other gross to net adjustments by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to the Company estimate of the adjustments attributable to a sale. The Company generally determines its estimates of the accruals for these other gross to net sales adjustments primarily based on historical experience, performance on commitments to government entities and other relevant factors, including levels of inventory in the distribution channel in some cases, and adjusts the accruals periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. Use of Information from External Sources The Company uses information from external sources to estimate its significant gross to net sales adjustments. The Company estimates of inventory at the wholesalers and deferred revenue on consigned inventory are based on the projected prescription demand-based sales for its products and historical inventory experience, as well as the Company analysis of third-party information, including written and oral information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and sell-through to customers and third-party market research data, and the Company internal information. The inventory information received from wholesalers is a product of their record-keeping process and excludes inventory held by intermediaries to whom they sell, such as retailers and hospitals. The Company receives information from IMS Health, a supplier of market research to the pharmaceutical industry, which it uses to project the prescription demand-based sales for many of its U.S. Pharmaceutical products. The Company also uses information from external sources to identify prescription trends, patient demand and average selling prices. The Company estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third-party information, as certain third-party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations including lags between the date as of which third-party information is generated and the date on which the Company receives third-party information. Retirement Benefits The Company pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations required by SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions , and SFAS No. 106 , Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions . The Company considers accounting for retirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, salary growth, long-term return on plan assets, retirement, turnover, health care cost trend rates, and mortality rates. Depending on the assumptions and estimates used, the pension and postretirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. In addition, the assumptions can materially affect accumulated benefit obligations and future cash funding. Plan Description The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans for regular full-time employees. The principal defined benefit pension plan is the Bristol-Myers Squibb Retirement Income Plan and the principal defined contribution plan is the Bristol-Myers Squibb Savings and Investment Program. Approximately 80% of total Company defined benefit pension plan assets and liabilities are held in U.S. plans. The assets for the U.S. plans are held in a single trust with a common asset allocation. Unless specified otherwise, the references in this section are to total Company plans (i.e., U.S. plans together with international plans). Benefits under the Company defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of credited service and on participants compensation. Assets under the Company defined benefit plans consist primarily of equity and fixed-income securities. At December 31, 2004, the fair market value of plan assets for the Company defined benefit plans increased to $4,602 million from $4,085 million at December 31, 2003. For the U.S. plans, assets were allocated 70% to equity securities (compared to 71% at the end of 2003), 23% to fixed income securities (compared to 23% at the end of 2003) and 7% to private equity and other investments (compared to 6% at the end of 2003). Bristol-Myers Squibb common stock represented less than 1% of assets for the U.S. plans at the end of 2004 and 2003. The Company provides comprehensive medical and group life benefits for substantially all U.S. retirees who elect to participate in the Company comprehensive medical and group life plans. The asset allocation for these postretirement plans is identical to the asset allocation described above for the U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Accrual Accounting and Significant Assumptions Consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions , the Company accounts for pension benefits using the accrual method, recognizing pension expense before the payment of benefits to retirees. The accrual method of accounting for pension benefits necessarily requires actuarial assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit payments. 63 Table of Contents The Company key assumptions used in calculating its cost of pension benefits are the discount rate, the rate of compensation increase, and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The Company, in consultation with its actuaries, evaluates the key actuarial assumptions and other assumptions used in calculating its cost of pension benefits, such as retirement, turnover and mortality rates, based on expectations or actual experience, as appropriate, and determines such assumptions on December 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension expense for the following year. Depending on the assumptions used, the pension expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. In addition, the assumptions can materially affect accumulated benefit obligations and future cash funding. Actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors. The assumed discount rate used by the Company for determining future pension obligations under the U.S. plans is based on indice of AA-rated corporate bonds. The indices of high quality corporate bonds selected reflect the weighted-average remaining period of benefit payments. The assumed rate of compensation increase used by the Company for determining future pension obligations reflects an estimate of the change in actual future compensation levels due to general price levels, productivity, seniority and other factors. In 2004, net pension expense for the Company defined benefit pension plans included in earnings before minority interest and income taxes was $276 million compared to $136 million in 2003. The U.S. plans pension expense for 2004 was determined using a 6.25% assumed discount rate and a 3.56% assumed rate of compensation increase. The present value of benefit obligations at December 31, 2004 for the U.S. plans was determined using a 5.75% assumed discount rate and the same salary increase rate. If the assumed discount rate used in determining the U.S. plans pension expense for 2004 had been reduced by 0.5%, such expense would have increased by approximately $30.2 million. If the assumed rate of compensation increase used in determining the U.S. plans pension expense for 2004 had been reduced by 0.25%, such expense would have decreased by approximately $8.5 million. If the assumed discount rate used in determining the accumulated benefit obligation at December 31, 2004 had been reduced by 0.5%, the accumulated benefit obligation would have increased by $251.9 million. The U.S. plans pension expense for 2004 was determined using a 9% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining the U.S. plans pension expense for 2004 had been reduced by 1%, such expense would have increased by $33 million. Actual rates of return earned on U.S. plan assets for each of the last ten years were as follows: Year Return Year Return 2004 12.6 % 1999 18.2 % 2003 25.0 % 1998 13.3 % 2002 (13.4 )% 1997 22.2 % 2001 (6.1 )% 1996 17.0 % 2000 3.5 % 1995 23.0 % As discussed below, GAAP provides that differences between expected and actual returns are recognized over the average future service of employees. At December 31, 2004, the Company lowered its assumed discount rate for U.S. plans from 6.25% to 5.75% and maintained its assumed rate of compensation increase at 3.56%. Compensation is assumed to increase on a scale with different rates for different ages. The 3.56% rate disclosed at December 31, 2004 is the single rate which, if used at each age, would produce the same present value of benefit obligations. The reduction in the discount rate had the effect of increasing the present value of benefit obligations and, accordingly, will have the effect of increasing pension expense for 2005. In addition, the Company revised, based upon a review of experience, its assumption for lump sum utilization. This revision had the effect of increasing the present value of benefit obligations, and accordingly, will have the effect of increasing pension expense for 2005. Following many years of strong performance, the global equity market fell sharply in 2000 through 2002 (e.g., the S&P 500 declined by a cumulative 37.6%). This was reversed in 2003-2004 (e.g., the S&P 500 rose by a cumulative 42.7%). The Company reduced the expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets from 9% in 2004 to 8.75% for 2005. This revision will have the effect of increasing pension expense for 2005. The Company expects that the net pension expense for its defined benefit pension plans included in earnings before minority interest and income taxes will be approximately $75 million higher in 2005 than the $276 million in 2004, reflecting, among other things, the decrease in the assumed discount rate. 64 Table of Contents The Company has used the same assumed discount rates and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets in calculating its cost of pension benefits and its cost of other postretirement benefits for U.S. plans except in the case of the discount rates at December 31, 2004 and 2003. Rates of 5.75% and 6.25% were used for pension benefits versus 5.50% and 6.00%, respectively, for other postretirement benefits to reflect the shorter duration of the other postretirement liabilities. U.S. health care costs for the retiree population are assumed to increase 9.0% in 2005 and then trend down to an expected increase of 4.5% per year by 2012. If actual costs are higher than those assumed, this will likely put significant upward pressure on the Company expense for retiree health care. On December 8, 2003, President Bush signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. The effects of the Medicare Act are reflected in 2004 net periodic postretirement benefit cost (a reduction of $8 million) and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2004 (a reduction of $58 million). Delayed Recognition of Actuarial Gains and Losses At December 31, 2004 and 2003, unrecognized net actuarial losses for the Company defined benefit plans were $2,017 million and $1,676 million, respectively, based on the fair market value of plan assets. These unrecognized net actuarial losses reflect in large part the steady reduction of the weighted-average discount rate over the years. SFAS No. 87 provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses, including amounts arising from changes in the estimated plan benefit obligations due to changes in the assumed discount rate, differences between the actual and expected returns on plan assets, and other assumption changes. SFAS No. 87 requires that unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss, determined based on the market-related value of plan assets (which differs from fair market value and is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years), be amortized in pension income or expense for the year to the extent that such unrecognized net actuarial loss or gain exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year. These net gains and losses are recognized as pension income or expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans (approximately 10 years) to the extent that they are not offset by losses and gains in subsequent years. At December 31, 2004, the unrecognized net actuarial loss, determined based on the market-related value of plan assets, was $2,278 million. This amount exceeded 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets by $1,730 million. Unless offset by future unrecognized gains from higher discount rates or higher than expected returns on plan assets, amortization of this unrecognized loss is expected to increase pension expense for each of the following ten years by approximately $173 million per year, which amount is reflected in the higher expense expected in 2005. At December 31, 2003, the unrecognized net actuarial loss, determined based on the market-related value of plan assets, was $1,717 million. This amount exceeded 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets by $1,241 million. In the event the fair market value of pension plan assets of a particular plan is less than the accumulated benefit obligation for such plan at year-end, GAAP may require an additional minimum liability, and in such circumstances, a reduction in stockholders equity or an establishment of an intangible asset. At December 31, 2004, the fair market value of the Company defined benefit pension plan assets was $4,602 million and the related accumulated benefit obligation was $4,828 million. The Company recognized an additional minimum liability of $146 million (cumulatively $349 million) at December 31, 2004, which was offset by a $153 million charge in other comprehensive income included in stockholders equity and a $7 million reduction in the intangible asset. At December 31, 2003, the fair market value of the Company defined benefit pension plan assets was $4,085 million and the related accumulated benefit obligation was $4,154 million. The Company recognized an additional minimum liability of $53 million (cumulatively $203 million) at December 31, 2003, which was offset by a $53 million charge in other comprehensive income included in stockholders equity. Plan Funding The Company funding policy for defined benefit plans is to contribute amounts to provide for current service and to fund past service liability. The Company contributed $367 million and $332 million to the defined benefit plans in 2004 and 2003, respectively. For discussions on retirement benefits, see Item 8. Financial Statements-Note 20. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans. Acquired In-Process Research and Development The fair value of in-process research and development acquired in a business combination is determined by independent appraisal based on the present value of each research project projected cash flows. An income approach is utilized that is consistent with guidance in the practice aid issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants entitled, Assets Acquired in a 65 Table of Contents Business Combination to Be Used in Research and Development Activities: A Focus on Software, Electronic Devices and Pharmaceutical Industries . Future cash flows are predominately based on the net income forecast of each project, consistent with historical pricing, margins, and expense levels of similar products. Revenues are estimated based on relevant market size and growth factors, expected industry trends, individual project life cycles, and the life of each research project underlying patent. In determining the fair value of each research project, expected revenues are first adjusted for technical risk of completion. The resulting cash flows are then discounted at a rate approximating the Company weighted average cost of capital. For discussions on acquired in-process research and development, see Item 8. Financial Statements-Note 1. Accounting Policies-Acquired In-Process Research and Development. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , the Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset fair value is based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including a discounted value of estimated future cash flows. The Company reports an asset to be disposed of at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated net realizable value. Goodwill is evaluated at least annually for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment using a two-step process. The first step is to identify a potential impairment, and the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss, if any. Goodwill is deemed to be impaired if the carrying amount of a reporting unit goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value. SFAS No. 142 requires that indefinite-lived intangible assets be tested for impairment using a one-step process, which consists of a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the intangible asset. Such intangible assets are deemed to be impaired if their net book value exceeds their estimated fair value. The estimates of future cash flows, based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management judgment. Any changes in key assumptions about the Company businesses and their prospects, or changes in market conditions, could result in an impairment charge. For discussions on impairment of long-lived assets, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Equity Investments The Company reviews its equity investments for impairment based on its determination of whether the decline in market value of the investment below the Company carrying value is other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock and related interpretations, which set forth factors to be evaluated in determining whether a loss in value should be recognized, including the Company ability to hold its investment, the market price and market price fluctuations of the investment publicly traded shares and inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity, which would justify the carrying amount of the investment. The Company investment in ImClone is subject to this accounting. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 2. Alliances and Investments for a discussion of the Company investment in ImClone. For discussions on equity investments, see Item 8. Financial Statements-Note 1. Accounting Policies Investments and Note 2. Alliances and Investments. Restructuring To downsize and streamline operations and rationalize manufacturing facilities, the Company has periodically recorded restructuring charges. As a result, the Company has made estimates and judgments regarding its future plans, including future termination benefits and other exit costs to be incurred when the restructuring actions take place. Actual results could vary from these estimates, resulting in an adjustment to earnings. For discussions on restructuring, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Restructuring and Note 3. Restructuring and Other Items. 66 Table of Contents Contingencies In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its business, that cover a wide range of matters, including government investigations, shareholder lawsuits, product and environmental liability. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies , the Company records accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. For discussions on contingencies, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Income Taxes, Contingencies, Note 8. Income Taxes and Note 21. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Income Taxes As of December 31, 2004, the Company had approximately $16.9 billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Company accrued a provision for $575 million of estimated deferred taxes in the fourth quarter of 2004 in anticipation of repatriating approximately $9 billion of these earnings in 2005 pursuant to the AJCA. Taxes were not provided on the balance of undistributed earnings of approximately $7.9 billion, as the Company has invested or expects to invest these undistributed earnings permanently offshore. If in the future these earnings are repatriated to the United States, or if the Company determines such earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future, additional tax provisions would be required. Due to complexities in the tax laws and the assumptions that would have to be made, it is not practicable to estimate the amounts of income taxes that would have to be provided. The Company evaluates the need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance by assessing whether it is more likely than not that it will realize its deferred tax assets in the future. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including the forecast of future taxable income and the evaluation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $1,713 million, net of a valuation allowance of $507 million. In addition, the Company conducts business in various countries throughout the world and is subject to tax in numerous jurisdictions. As a result of its business activities, the Company files a significant number of tax returns that are subject to audit by various tax authorities. Tax audits are often complex as tax authorities may disagree with the treatment of items reported by the Company and may require several years to resolve. The Company has recorded accruals for tax contingencies related to potential audit exposures, including, but not limited to, transfer pricing, certain tax credits, and various state and foreign tax matters. Such accruals are based on management judgment and best estimate as to the ultimate outcome of tax audits. Actual audit results could vary from these estimates. For discussions on income taxes, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Income Taxes and Note 8. Income Taxes. 67 Table of Contents Outlook As previously disclosed, although anticipated sales declines due to continued exclusivity losses during 2005 and 2006 are expected to be more or less offset by growth in sales of the Company in-line, recently launched and potential new products during the same period, changes in product mix will adversely impact gross margins because the products that have lost or are expected to lose exclusivity generally have higher margins. In addition, earnings will be adversely affected by the Company investments to support the introduction of new products and the development and launch of additional new compounds. In 2007, based on management current estimates of growth of the Company in-line and recently launched products and a risk-adjusted assessment of potential new product launches, the Company expects earnings growth will resume. The Company has and will continue to rationalize its cost base in line with its strategy to increase its sales and marketing emphasis on specialists and high value primary care physicians. As previously disclosed, the Company has experienced substantial revenue losses in the last few years due to the expiration of market exclusivity protection for certain of its products. The Company expects substantial incremental revenue losses in each of 2005, 2006 and 2007 representing continuing declines in revenues of those products as well as declines in revenues of certain additional products that will lose market exclusivity primarily in 2005 and 2006. For 2005, the Company estimates reductions of net sales in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion from the 2004 levels for products which have lost or will lose exclusivity protection in 2003, 2004 or 2005, specifically MONOPRIL in the United States, Canada and Europe, GLUCOPHAGE * XR and GLUCOVANCE * in the United States, CEFZIL in the United States, PARAPLATIN in the United States, VIDEX EC in the United States, TAXOL in Europe and PRAVACHOL in Europe. The Company also expects substantial incremental revenue losses in each of 2006 and 2007 representing continuing declines in net sales of the products that lost exclusivity protection in 2002, 2003 and 2004 and additional declines attributable to products that will lose exclusivity protection primarily in 2005 and 2006. These products (and the years in which they lose exclusivity protection) include GLUCOPHAGE * /GLUCOVANCE * /GLUCOPHAGE * XR in the United States (2002 to 2004), TAXOL in Europe and Japan (2003), PRAVACHOL in the United States (2006) and in Europe (2002 to 2007), PARAPLATIN in the United States (2004), MONOPRIL in the United States (2003), Canada (2003) and Europe (2001 to 2008), ZERIT in the United States (2008) and in Europe (2007 to 2011), CEFZIL in the United States (2005) and in Europe (2004 to 2009) and VIDEX /VIDEX EC (2004 to 2009). The timing and amounts of sales reductions from exclusivity losses, their realization in particular periods and the eventual levels of remaining sales revenues are uncertain and dependent on the levels of sales at the time exclusivity protection ends, the timing and degree of development of generic competition (speed of approvals, market entry and impact) and other factors. PRAVACHOL, an HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor (statin), had net sales of $2.6 billion in 2004. During 2004, the Company experienced increased competition for PRAVACHOL from established brands and new entrants. U.S. prescriptions for PRAVACHOL declined 10% in 2004 compared to 2003. While the product has begun to lose exclusivity in some markets, between now and its anticipated loss of U.S. exclusivity in April 2006, its expected rate of decline in sales and in market share could be accelerated by increased competition from established brands and new entrants. The Company expectations for future sales growth include substantial expected increases in sales of PLAVIX * , which had net sales of $3.3 billion for 2004, and is currently the Company largest product ranked by net sales. The composition of matter patent for PLAVIX * , which expires in 2011, is currently the subject of litigation in the United States. Similar proceedings involving PLAVIX * have been instituted outside the United States. The Company continues to believe that the patent is valid and that it is infringed, and with its alliance partner and patent-holder Sanofi, is vigorously pursuing these cases. It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the outcome of these litigations, or if there were an adverse determination in these litigations, the timing of potential generic competition for PLAVIX * . However, if generic competition were to occur, the Company believes it is very unlikely to occur before the second half of 2005. The Company and its subsidiaries are the subject of a number of significant pending lawsuits, claims, proceedings and investigations. It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the final outcome of these investigations or litigations. Management continues to believe, as previously disclosed, that during the next few years, the aggregate impact, beyond current reserves, of these and other legal matters affecting the Company is reasonably likely to be material to the Company results of operations and cash flows, and may be material to its financial condition and liquidity. The Company expectations for the next several years described above do not reflect the potential impact of litigation on the Company results of operations. Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results This annual report on Form 10-K (including documents incorporated by reference) and other written and oral statements the Company makes from time to time contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the fact they use words such as should , expect , anticipate , estimate , target , may , will , project , guidance , intend , plan , believe and other words and terms of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. One can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, 68 Table of Contents including factors that could delay, divert or change any of them, and could cause actual outcomes to differ materially from current expectations. These statements are likely to relate to, among other things, the Company goals, plans and projections regarding its financial position, results of operations, cash flows, market position, product development, product approvals, sales efforts, expenses, performance or results of current and anticipated products and the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and financial results, which are based on current expectations that involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including internal or external factors that could delay, divert or change any of them in the next several years. Although it is not possible to predict or identify all factors, they may include but are not limited to the following: New government laws and regulations, such as (i) health care reform initiatives in the United States at the state and federal level and in other countries; (ii) changes in the FDA and foreign regulatory approval processes that may cause delays in approving, or preventing the approval of, new products; (iii) tax changes such as the phasing out of tax benefits heretofore available in the United States and certain foreign countries; (iv) new laws, regulations and judicial decisions affecting pricing or marketing within or across jurisdictions; and (v) changes in intellectual property law. Competitive factors, such as (i) new products developed by competitors that have lower prices or superior performance features or that are otherwise competitive with the Company current products; (ii) generic competition as the Company products mature and patents expire on products; (iii) technological advances and patents attained by competitors; (iv) problems with licensors, suppliers and distributors; and (v) business combinations among the Company competitors or major customers. Difficulties and delays inherent in product development, manufacturing and sale, such as (i) products that may appear promising in development but fail to reach market or be approved for additional indications for any number of reasons, including efficacy or safety concerns, the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and the difficulty or excessive cost to manufacture; (ii) failure of any of our products to achieve or maintain commercial viability; (iii) seizure or recalls of pharmaceutical products or forced closings of manufacturing plants; (iv) the failure to obtain, the imposition of limitations on the use of, or loss of patent and other intellectual property rights; (v) failure of the Company or any of its vendors or suppliers to comply with Current Good Manufacturing Practices and other application regulations and quality assurance guidelines that could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns, product shortages and delays in product manufacturing; and (vi) other manufacturing or distribution problems including changes in manufacturing production sites and manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes in types of products produced, such as biologics, or physical limitations that could impact continuous supply. Legal difficulties, including lawsuits, claims, proceedings and investigations, any of which can preclude or delay commercialization of products or adversely affect operations, profitability, liquidity or financial condition, including (i) intellectual property disputes; (ii) adverse decisions in litigation, including product liability and commercial cases; (iii) the inability to obtain adequate insurance with respect to this type of liability; (iv) recalls of pharmaceutical products or forced closings of manufacturing plants; (v) the failure to fulfill obligations under supply contracts with the government and other customers which may result in liability; (vi) government investigations including those relating to wholesaler inventory, financial restatement and product pricing and promotion; (vii) claims asserting violations of securities, antitrust, federal and state pricing and other laws; (viii) environmental, health and safety matters; and (ix) tax liabilities.
