Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY About the Company Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS, the Company or Bristol-Myers Squibb) is a worldwide pharmaceutical and related health care products company whose mission is to extend and enhance human life by providing the highest quality pharmaceutical and related health care products. The Company is engaged in the discovery, development, licensing, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of pharmaceuticals and related health care products. The Company has three reportable segments Pharmaceuticals, Nutritionals and Other Health Care. The Pharmaceuticals segment is comprised of the global pharmaceutical and international consumer medicines business and accounted for approximately 77% of the Company 2006 net sales. The Nutritionals segment consists of Mead Johnson Nutritionals (Mead Johnson), primarily an infant formula and children nutritionals business, which accounted for approximately 13% of the Company 2006 net sales. The Other Health Care segment consists of the ConvaTec and Medical Imaging businesses, which accounted for approximately 10% of the Company 2006 net sales. 2006 Financial Highlights The Company has made progress with its long-range strategy, despite some significant challenges that occurred during the year, including the at-risk launch of generic clopidogrel bisulfate product, which adversely impacted PLAVIX* sales, the loss of exclusivity of PRAVACHOL in the United States (U.S.) and in certain European markets, and an increase in litigation reserves. The Company launched several important products in 2006, including ORENCIA, SPRYCEL and with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead), ATRIPLA*. ORENCIA and SPRYCEL continue to gain market share and, along with double digit sales growth in 2006 for ABILIFY*, REYATAZ, ERBITUX*, the SUSTIVA Franchise and BARACLUDE, are key components of a strong product line for long-term growth. The Company continues to invest in its late stage compounds and the development of new products. With the growing importance of biologics, in February 2007, the Company completed the land purchase for its major new biologics facility in Devens, Massachusetts, along with expansion of existing facilities in Syracuse, New York, and Manati, Puerto Rico. Construction on the Devens facility is scheduled to begin in early 2007. Worldwide net sales from continuing operations for 2006 decreased 7% to $17.9 billion compared to 2005. Worldwide net sales of the products that the Company views as growth drivers increased by 6% in 2006 as compared to the same period in 2005. Excluding PLAVIX*, worldwide net sales of the other growth drivers increased 32% in 2006 as compared to the same period in 2005. Products that the Company considers to be growth drivers are PLAVIX*, AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*, ABILIFY*, REYATAZ and ERBITUX*. Net income was $1.6 billion in 2006 compared with $3.0 billion in 2005. The 2006 results include a $353 million increase in reserves for a pricing and sales litigation settlement and $220 million in early debt retirement costs. The 2005 results included $370 million gain on the sale of the Consumer Medicines business. PLAVIX* The Company largest product ranked by net sales is PLAVIX* (clopidogrel bisulfate) with U.S. sales of $2.7 billion in 2006, $3.2 billion in 2005 and $2.8 billion in 2004. The composition of matter patent for PLAVIX*, which expires in 2011, is currently the subject of patent litigation in the U.S. with Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. (Apotex) and with other generic companies, as well as in other less significant jurisdictions. The Company has previously disclosed certain developments in the pending PLAVIX* litigation with Apotex, including the at-risk launch of a generic product by Apotex in August 2006. As noted above, Apotex launched a generic clopidogrel bisulfate product that competes with PLAVIX* on August 8, 2006. On August 31, 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the Court) granted a motion by the Company and its product partner, Sanofi-Aventis (Sanofi), to enjoin further sales of Apotex generic clopidogrel bisulfate product, but did not order Apotex to recall product from its customers. The Court grant of a preliminary injunction has been affirmed on appeal. The trial in the underlying patent litigation ended on February 15, 2007 and the Court is expected to rule following post-trial briefing. The at-risk launch of generic clopidogrel bisulfate had a significant adverse effect on net sales of PLAVIX* in 2006, which the Company estimates to be in a range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. In particular, the launch had a significant adverse effect on sales in the third quarter, which the Company estimates to be in the range of $525 million to $600 million, as well as in the fourth quarter of 2006, which the Company estimates to be in the range of $700 million to $750 million. In the first, second, third and fourth quarters 41 of 2006, U.S. net sales for PLAVIX* were $850 million, $988 million, $474 million and $343 million, respectively. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand for clopidogrel bisulfate (branded and generic) increased by 14% in 2006 compared to 2005, while estimated total U.S. prescription demand for branded PLAVIX* decreased by 18% in the same period. The Company expects generic clopidogrel bisulfate that was sold into distribution channels following the Apotex at-risk launch in August 2006 will have a residual impact on PLAVIX* net sales and the Company overall financial results into 2007. The full impact of Apotex launch of its generic clopidogrel bisulfate product on the Company cannot be reasonably estimated at this time and will depend on a number of factors, including, among others, the amount of generic product sold by Apotex; whether the Company and Sanofi (the Companies) prevail in the underlying patent litigation; even if the Companies prevail in the pending patent case, the extent to which the launch by Apotex will permanently adversely impact the pricing and prescription demand for PLAVIX*, the amount of damages that would be sought and/or recovered by the Companies, and Apotex ability to pay such damages. Loss of market exclusivity of PLAVIX* and/or sustained generic competition would be material to the Company sales of PLAVIX*, results of operations and cash flows, and could be material to the Company financial condition and liquidity. The Company U.S. territory partnership under its alliance with Sanofi is also a plaintiff in three additional pending patent infringement lawsuits against Dr. Reddy Laboratories, Inc. and Dr. Reddy Laboratories, LTD (Dr. Reddy s), Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva) and Cobalt Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Cobalt), all related to the U.S. Patent No. 4,847,265 (the 265 Patent). A trial date for the action against Dr. Reddy has not been set. The patent infringement actions against Teva and Cobalt have been stayed pending resolution of the Apotex litigation, and the parties to those actions have agreed to be bound by the outcome of the litigation against Apotex, although Teva and Cobalt can appeal the outcome of the litigation. Each of Dr. Reddy and Teva have filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application (aNDA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and all exclusivity periods and statutory stay periods under the Hatch-Waxman Act have expired, with the exception of the 30-month stay that applies to Teva, which expires on February 27, 2007. Accordingly, final approval by the FDA would provide each company authorization to distribute a generic clopidogrel bisulfate product in the U.S., subject to various legal remedies for which the Companies may apply including injunctive relief and damages. The Company continues to believe that the PLAVIX* patents are valid and infringed, and with Sanofi, is vigorously pursuing enforcement of their patent rights in PLAVIX*. It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the ultimate outcome of the ongoing patent litigation with Apotex, or of the other PLAVIX* patent litigations, or the timing of any renewed generic competition for PLAVIX* from Apotex or additional generic competition for PLAVIX* from other third-party generic pharmaceutical companies. However, if Apotex were to prevail at trial, the Company would expect to face renewed generic competition for PLAVIX* from Apotex promptly thereafter. As previously disclosed, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice is conducting a criminal investigation regarding the proposed settlement of the pending patent PLAVIX* litigation with Apotex. The Company is cooperating fully with the investigation. It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the outcome of the investigation or its impact on the Company. It is also not possible at this time reasonably to assess the impact of the investigation, if any, on the Company compliance with the Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the U.S. Attorney Office for the District of New Jersey (USAO). Also as previously disclosed, the USAO had initiated an investigation conducted by the Monitor under the DPA (Monitor) and the USAO, into corporate governance issues relating to the Company negotiations of the proposed settlement with Apotex, which included a review of whether there was any violation of Federal securities laws in connection with the proposed settlement with Apotex under the terms of the previously disclosed Consent Order the Company entered into with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in August 2004 (Consent or SEC Consent). The Monitor has completed his investigation and submitted his report on the investigation to the USAO. The Monitor report did not find any violation of the Consent or the Federal securities laws in connection with the proposed settlement. The Monitor concluded that the Company had violated certain paragraphs of the DPA related to governance matters. The violations cited by the Monitor in his report relate, among other things, to communication failures, including insufficient communications, by the Company former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and former General Counsel with the Board of Directors (the Board) and with other members of senior management, as well as failure to comply with certain internal Company policies and procedures. The Monitor did not make any findings with respect to whether the Company knowingly and materially breached the DPA or make any recommendations. The USAO has advised the Company that he believes the matters cited in the Monitor report have been fully remediated and, accordingly, that he does not intend to take any action under the DPA with respect to the Monitor report. For additional discussion of legal matters, including the PLAVIX* patent litigation, the Antitrust Division investigation related to the proposed settlement with Apotex and the terms of the DPA and SEC Consent, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 21. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies, OUTLOOK and SEC Consent Order and Deferred Prosecution Agreement below. Business Environment The Company conducts its business primarily within the pharmaceutical industry, which is highly competitive and subject to numerous government regulations. Many competitive factors may significantly affect the Company sales of its products, including product efficacy, safety, price and cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, product labeling, quality control and quality assurance of its manufacturing operations, and research and development of new products. To successfully compete for business in the health care industry, the Company must demonstrate that its products offer medical benefits, as well as cost advantages. Currently, most of the Company new product introductions compete with other products already on the market in the same therapeutic category, in addition to potential future competition of new products that competitors may introduce in the future. The Company manufactures branded products, which are priced higher than generic products. Generic competition is one of the Company leading challenges globally. 42 In the pharmaceutical industry, the majority of an innovative product commercial value is usually realized during the period that the product has market exclusivity. When a product loses exclusivity, it is no longer protected by a patent and is subject to new competing products in the form of generic brands. Upon exclusivity loss, the Company can lose a major portion of that product sales in a short period of time. Both in the U.S. and internationally, the health care industry is subject to various government-imposed regulations that authorize prices or price controls that have and will continue to have an impact on the Company sales. In the U.S., Congress and some state legislatures have considered a number of proposals and have enacted laws that could effect major changes in the health care system, either nationally or at the state level. Driven in part by budget concerns, Medicaid access and reimbursement restrictions have been implemented in some states and proposed in many others. In addition, in January 2006, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act became effective and provides outpatient prescription drug coverage to senior citizens in the U.S. The Company is assessing the impact this legislation could have on its business, including a potential negative impact on the U.S. Pharmaceuticals business due to further legislative and/or regulatory changes that could result in additional pricing pressures or controls. In many markets outside the U.S., the Company operates in environments of government-mandated, cost-containment programs, or under other regulatory bodies or groups that can exert downward pressure on pricing. Pricing freedom is limited in the United Kingdom (UK), for instance, by the operation of a profit control plan and in Germany by the operation of a reference price system. Companies also face significant delays in market access for new products and more than two years can elapse after drug approval before new medicines become available in some national markets. The growth of Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) in the U.S. has played a large role in the competition that surrounds the health care industry. MCOs seek to reduce health care expenditures for participants by making volume purchases and entering into long-term contracts to negotiate discounts with various pharmaceutical providers. Because of the market potential created by the large pool of participants, marketing prescription drugs to MCOs has become an important part of the Company strategy. Companies compete for inclusion in a MCO formulary and the Company has generally been successful in having its major products included. The Company believes that developments in the managed care industry, including continued consolidation, have had and will continue to have a generally downward pressure on prices. Pharmaceutical production processes are complex, highly regulated and vary widely from product to product. Shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures and regulatory approvals. Biologics manufacturing involves more complex processes than those of traditional pharmaceutical operations. As biologics become more important to the Company product portfolio, the Company will continue to make arrangements with third-party manufacturers, and will make substantial investments to increase its internal capacity to produce biologics on a commercial scale, including building a new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility for the production of biologics in Devens, Massachusetts, with construction to commence in early 2007. The Company has maintained a competitive position in the market and strives to uphold this position, which is dependent on its success in discovering and developing innovative, cost-effective products that serve unmet medical need. The Company and its subsidiaries are the subject of a number of significant pending lawsuits, claims, proceedings and investigations. It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the final outcome of these investigations or litigations. Management continues to believe, as previously disclosed, that during the next few years, the aggregate impact, beyond current reserves, of these and other legal matters affecting the Company is reasonably likely to be material to the Company results of operations and cash flows, and may be material to its financial condition and liquidity. For additional discussion of legal matters, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 21. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Strategy The Company continues to execute its strategy for long-term growth and is currently on track with its strategic transition. This strategy consists of increasing investments behind growth brands and new specialty products, focusing the Company research and development programs on products in the pharmaceutical pipeline in disease areas that address significant unmet medical need, aligning sales and marketing emphasis on specialists and high value primary care prescribers, and implementing initiatives designed to achieve and maintain a more efficient cost base. The Company pharmaceutical portfolio has continued to transition away from products which have lost exclusivity towards growth drivers, recently launched and other products, which include PLAVIX* (clopidogrel bisulfate), ABILIFY* (aripiprazole), AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* (irbesartan/irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide), REYATAZ (atazanavir sulfate), the SUSTIVA (efavirenz) Franchise, ERBITUX* (cetuximab), ORENCIA (abatacept), BARACLUDE (entecavir) and SPRYCEL (dasatinib). U.S. net sales of these products accounted for 83% of the Company U.S. pharmaceutical net sales in 2006, compared to 71% in 2005, while worldwide net sales of these products accounted for 59% of the Company worldwide pharmaceutical net sales in 2006 as compared to 49% in 2005. The Company experienced the last of a series of major anticipated exclusivity losses in 2006, with the market exclusivity expiration of PRAVACHOL in the U.S. and certain markets in Europe, and does not expect any significant new exclusivity losses for the next several years. 43 In order to support the production of the specialty products in the pharmaceutical portfolio including biologics, during 2006, the Board of Directors approved capital expenditures of approximately $750 million for a bulk biologics manufacturing facility in the U.S. In February 2007, the Company completed the land purchase of an 89 acre site to locate its new large-scale, expandable multi-product bulk biologics manufacturing facility in Devens, Massachusetts. Construction is expected to begin in early 2007, and the facility is projected to be operationally complete in 2009. The Company expects to submit the site for regulatory approval in 2010. Commercial production of biologic compounds is anticipated to begin by 2011. In addition, the Company will expand its Manati, Puerto Rico facility, targeted for start-up in 2009. The expansion will add new space and renovate existing space for the filling and finishing of the Company sterile products and biologic compounds, including ORENCIA, and several investigational compounds. Given the Company current limited capacity for commercial volumes of biologics products, the Company also received approval from the FDA in May 2006 that permits a third party to manufacture ORENCIA at an additional facility. This facility, together with another third party facility, which is pending submission to and approval from the FDA, will support increased production capacity necessary to meet expected long-term demand for ORENCIA and initial requirements for other biologics products if they are commercialized. In keeping with its strategy, the Company invested $3.1 billion in research and development, representing a 12% growth rate over 2005. Research and development dedicated to pharmaceutical products, including milestone payments for in-licensing and development programs, was $2.8 billion compared to $2.5 billion in 2005. As part of its strategy, the Company is re-examining its operating costs to achieve and maintain a more efficient cost base. At the end of 2005, the Company launched an initiative to identify and realize productivity savings. Through this initiative the Company has re-examined its operating model to focus resources on high value priorities; simplify and streamline business processes, improve governance and decision making; and build the capabilities to sustain these cost reductions for the long term. The Company is on plan to achieve the goal of realizing a minimum of $500 million in productivity savings in 2007 and an incremental $100 million in 2008 as well as making the Company more productive, efficient and effective. New Product and Pipeline Developments In January 2007, the Company and AstraZeneca PLC (AstraZeneca) announced a collaboration to develop and commercialize two investigational compounds, saxagliptin and dapagliflozin, being studied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The Company discovered both compounds. The collaboration on these compounds is worldwide, except for Japan. Separately, the Company also announced a collaboration with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Otsuka) to develop saxagliptin in Japan. In November 2006, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for ipilimumab used in combination with chemotherapy (dacarbazine) in previously untreated metastatic melanoma patients. The FDA also granted Fast Track designation for ipilimumab used as a monotherapy in previously treated metastatic melanoma patients. In October 2006, the Company moved its investigational anti-thrombosis compound apixaban into Phase III development. Apixaban is an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor. In October 2006, the Company received FDA approval of a new once-daily 300 mg single capsule formulation of REYATAZ for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection in adults as part of a combination therapy, which can replace two REYATAZ 150 mg capsules in appropriate patients. The Company now has one-pill, once-daily HIV medicine options available in three drug classes as part of a combination therapy. The Company and Otsuka received approval from the FDA in September 2006 and the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) in October 2006 for ABILIFY* Injection, the first ready-to-use single-dose vial of an atypical antipsychotic to control agitation in adults with schizophrenia and bipolar mania. In August 2006, the Company and Sanofi received approval from both the FDA and the EMEA for an additional indication for PLAVIX* to reduce the rate of death from any cause and the rate of a combined endpoint of re-infarction, stroke or death in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. In July 2006, ATRIPLA*, the first-ever once-daily single tablet three-drug regimen for HIV intended as a stand-alone therapy or in combination with other antiretrovirals, received approval from the FDA. The product combines SUSTIVA (efavirenz), manufactured by the Company and TRUVADA* (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), manufactured by Gilead. The Company, Gilead and Merck & Co., Inc. submitted a Marketing Authorization Approval for ATRIPLA* to the EMEA in October 2006. In addition, the Company and Gilead submitted ATRIPLA* for regulatory approval in Canada in September 2006. 44 In June 2006, the Company received approval for SPRYCEL (dasatinib) from the FDA for the treatment of adults with chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ALL) with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy, including GLEEVEC * (imatinib mesylate). SPRYCEL was launched in the U.S. in July 2006. In November 2006, the Company also received approval of SPRYCEL from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the EMEA. The product was launched in Austria, Germany, France, Finland, Sweden and the UK. In February 2007, the Company received approval for SPRYCEL, without the Ph+ALL indication, in Switzerland. In April 2006, the Company launched EMSAM* (selegiline transdermal system) in the U.S. EMSAM* is the first transdermal patch for the delivery of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults. EMSAM* was developed by Somerset Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a joint venture between Mylan Laboratories, Inc. (Mylan) and Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Watson). The Company has obtained exclusive distribution rights to commercialize EMSAM* in the U.S. and Canada and markets EMSAM* through its existing neuroscience sales force. In March 2006, the FDA approved ERBITUX*, which is co-promoted by the Company and ImClone Systems Incorporated (ImClone), for use in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. ERBITUX* had previously been indicated for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. In February 2006, the Company launched BARACLUDE, its treatment for hepatitis B, in China. The Company also launched BARACLUDE in several new markets during the third quarter of 2006, including Germany, France, the UK and Japan. BARACLUDE is approved in more than 50 countries worldwide. In February 2006, the Company launched ORENCIA, its treatment for signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, in the U.S. after receiving approval from the FDA in December 2005. In June 2006, the Company received approval of ORENCIA in Canada and launched the product in August 2006. OUTLOOK For 2007, the Company expects reductions of net sales for products that have lost exclusivity in previous years to range between $0.9 billion and $1.0 billion, as compared to $1.4 billion in 2006, and $1.3 billion in 2005. While the Company expects generic clopidogrel bisulfate inventory in the market to have a continued residual impact on 2007 PLAVIX* net sales, the Company does expect PLAVIX* net sales and earnings growth in 2007, assuming the absence of renewed or additional generic competition. The Company expects increased prescription demand for PLAVIX* as well as for other key brands and newly launched products. Compared to 2006, gross margin is expected to improve due to growth of higher margin products, lower margin erosion related to exclusivity losses, and improved manufacturing efficiencies. Marketing, selling and administrative expense is expected to remain relatively unchanged as efficiency savings should largely offset inflationary cost increases, and as the Company continues to focus on high value primary care and specialist physicians and implements various productivity initiatives. The Company expects to continue to increase investments to develop additional new compounds and support the introduction of new products. The Company and its subsidiaries are the subject of a number of significant pending lawsuits, claims, proceedings and investigations including the pending PLAVIX* litigation, described below. There can be no assurance that there will not be an increase in the scope of these matters or that any future lawsuits, claims and proceedings will not be material to the Company. In addition, there is an increasing trend by foreign governments to scrutinize sales and marketing activities of pharmaceutical companies and there can be no assurance that any such investigations or any other investigations will not be material. It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the final outcome of these investigations or litigations. Management continues to believe, as previously disclosed, that during the next few years, the aggregate impact, beyond current reserves, of the pending PLAVIX* patent litigation, these other litigations and investigations and other legal matters affecting the Company is reasonably likely to be material to the Company results of operations and cash flows, and may be material to its financial condition and liquidity. The Company expectations for the next several years described above do not reflect the potential impact of litigation on the Company results of operations. As previously disclosed, the composition of matter patent for PLAVIX*, which expires in 2011, is subject to litigation in the U.S. with Apotex. The trial in the underlying patent litigation ended on February 15, 2007 and the Court is expected to rule following post-trial briefing. If Apotex were to prevail in the trial in the patent litigation, the Company would expect to face renewed generic competition for PLAVIX* promptly thereafter. There are other pending PLAVIX* patent litigations in the U.S. and in other less significant markets for the product. In the U.S., the Company U.S. territory partnership under its alliance with Sanofi is a plaintiff in three additional pending patent infringement lawsuits against Dr. Reddy s, Teva and Cobalt, all related to the 265 Patent. Each of Dr. Reddy and Teva have filed an aNDA with the FDA, and all exclusivity periods and statutory stay periods under the Hatch-Waxman Act have expired, with the exception of the 30-month stay that applies to Teva, which expires on February 27, 2007. Accordingly, final approval by the FDA would provide each company authorization to distribute a generic clopidogrel bisulfate product in the U.S., although such a launch at this point in time would be at risk of an adverse damages award should the Companies prevail in the underlying patent litigation. The Company continues to believe that the PLAVIX* patents are valid and infringed, and with Sanofi, is vigorously pursuing these cases. 45 It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the ultimate outcome of the patent litigation with Apotex or of the other PLAVIX* patent litigations, or the timing of any renewed generic competition for PLAVIX* from Apotex or additional generic competition for PLAVIX* from other generic pharmaceutical companies. Loss of market exclusivity of PLAVIX* and/or the development of sustained generic competition would be material to the Company sales of PLAVIX*, results of operations and cash flows, and could be material to the Company financial condition and liquidity. PLAVIX* is the Company largest product by net sales, and U.S. net sales for PLAVIX* were $2.7 billion, $3.2 billion and $2.8 billion in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. As previously disclosed, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice is conducting a criminal investigation regarding the proposed settlement of the pending PLAVIX* patent litigation with Apotex. The Company is cooperating fully with the investigation. It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the outcome of the investigation or its impact on the Company. It is also not possible at this time reasonably to assess the impact of the investigation, if any, on the Company compliance with the DPA with the USAO. Also as previously disclosed, the USAO had initiated an investigation conducted by the Monitor under the DPA and the USAO, into the Company negotiations of the proposed settlement with Apotex, which included a review of corporate governance issues and whether there was any violation of Federal securities laws in connection with the proposed settlement with Apotex under the terms of the previously disclosed Consent that the Company entered into with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). The Monitor has completed his investigation and submitted his report on the investigation to the USAO. The Monitor report did not find any violation of the Consent or the Federal securities laws in connection with the proposed settlement. The Monitor concluded that the Company had violated certain paragraphs of the DPA related to governance matters. The violations cited by the Monitor in his report relate, among other things, to communication failures, including insufficient communications, by the Company former CEO and former General Counsel with the Board and with other members of senior management, as well as failure to comply with certain internal Company policies and procedures. The Monitor did not make any findings with respect to whether the Company knowingly and materially breached the DPA or make any recommendations. The USAO has advised the Company that he believes the matters cited in the Monitor report have been fully remediated and, accordingly, that he does not intend to take any action under the DPA with respect to the Monitor report. For additional discussion of legal matters, including the PLAVIX* patent litigation, the Antitrust Division investigation related to the proposed settlement with Apotex and the terms of the DPA and SEC Consent, see Executive Summary PLAVIX* and SEC Consent Order and Deferred Prosecution Agreement above and Item 8. Financial Statements Note 21. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussions of the Company results of continuing operations exclude the results related to the Oncology Therapeutics Network (OTN) business, which were previously presented as a separate segment prior to its divestiture in 2005, and have been segregated from continuing operations and reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Discontinued Operations below. % Change Dollars in Millions 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Net Sales $ 17,914 $ 19,207 $ 19,380 (7)% (1)% Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Minority Interest and Income Taxes $ 2,635 $ 4,516 $ 4,418 (42)% 2% % of net sales 14.7 % 23.5 % 22.8 % Provision for Income Taxes $ 610 $ 932 $ 1,519 (35)% (39)% Effective tax rate 23.2 % 20.6 % 34.4 % Earnings from Continuing Operations $ 1,585 $ 2,992 $ 2,378 (47)% 26% % of net sales 8.8 % 15.6 % 12.3 % Net Sales Net sales from continuing operations for 2006 decreased 7% to $17.9 billion compared to 2005.

In 2005, net sales from continuing operations decreased 1% to $19.2 billion compared to 2004. U.S. net sales in 2005 decreased 1% to $10.5 billion compared to 2004, while international net sales of $8.7 billion remained relatively constant in 2005 as compared to 2004, including a 2% favorable foreign exchange impact. 46 The composition of the change in net sales is as follows: Analysis of % Change Total Change Volume Price Foreign Exchange 2006 vs. 2005 (7)% (9)% 2% 2005 vs. 2004 (1)% (2)% 1% In general, the Company business is not seasonal. For information on U.S. pharmaceutical prescriber demand, reference is made to the table within Business Segments under the Pharmaceuticals section below, which sets forth a comparison of changes in net sales to the estimated total prescription growth (for both retail and mail order customers) for certain of the Company top 15 pharmaceutical products and products that the Company views as current and future growth drivers sold within the U.S. The Company operates in three reportable segments Pharmaceuticals, Nutritionals and Other Health Care. In May 2005, the Company completed the sale of OTN, which was previously presented as a separate segment. As such, the results of operations for OTN are presented as part of the Company results from discontinued operations in accordance with Statement of Financial Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Accordingly, OTN results of operations in prior periods have been reclassified to discontinued operations to conform with current year presentations. The Company net sales by segment were as follows: Net Sales % Change Dollars in Millions 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Pharmaceuticals $ 13,861 $ 15,254 $ 15,564 (9 )% (2 )% % of net sales 77 % 79 % 80 % Nutritionals 2,347 2,205 2,001 6 % 10 % % of net sales 13 % 12 % 10 % Other Health Care 1,706 1,748 1,815 (2 )% (4 )% % of net sales 10 % 9 % 10 % Health Care Group 4,053 3,953 3,816 3 % 4 % Total $ 17,914 $ 19,207 $ 19,380 (7 )% (1 )% The Company recognizes revenue net of various sales adjustments to arrive at net sales as reported on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. These adjustments are referred to as gross-to-net sales adjustments and are further described in Critical Accounting Policies below. The following table sets forth the reconciliation of the Company gross sales to net sales by each significant category of gross-to-net sales adjustments: For the Years Ended December 31 Dollars in Millions 2006 2005 2004 Gross Sales $ 20,804 $ 23,003 $ 23,896 Gross-to-Net Sales Adjustments Prime Vendor Charge-Backs (703 ) (1,090 ) (1,319 ) Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Rebates (872 ) (843 ) (846 ) Managed Health Care Rebates and Other Contract Discounts (348 ) (514 ) (660 ) Medicaid Rebates (174 ) (595 ) (673 ) Cash Discounts (224 ) (271 ) (311 ) Sales Returns (230 ) (164 ) (276 ) Other Adjustments (339 ) (319 ) (431 ) Total Gross-to-Net Sales Adjustments (2,890 ) (3,796 ) (4,516 ) Net Sales $ 17,914 $ 19,207 $ 19,380 The decrease in gross-to-net sales adjustments in 2006 compared to 2005 was affected by a number of factors, including changes in customer mix and a portfolio shift, in each case towards products that required lower rebates, as well as changes in contract status. The decrease in prime vendor charge-backs was primarily the result of lower PLAVIX* net sales, volume erosion on highly rebated PARAPLATIN (carboplatin) and TAXOL (paclitaxel) due to generic competition, as well as the impact from the discontinued commercialization of TEQUIN (gatifloxacin). Managed health care rebates and other contract discounts decreased primarily as a result of the reversal of reserves related to the TRICARE Retail Pharmacy Refund Program, as well as the exclusivity loss of PRAVACHOL, which also reduced Medicaid rebates. In addition, lower PLAVIX* net sales and the shift in patient enrollment from Medicaid to Medicare under Medicare Part D, resulted in a decrease in Medicaid rebates, partially offset by a corresponding increase in managed health care rebates. The decrease in cash discounts was primarily due to the exclusivity loss of PRAVACHOL and lower PLAVIX* sales volumes. The increase in sales returns was primarily due to higher returns trends for non-exclusive brands as well as from the discontinued commercialization of TEQUIN. 47 In 2005, the decrease from 2004 for prime vendor charge-backs and managed health care rebates was primarily due to lower relative sales volume in this segment due to product mix. The decrease in sales returns was primarily due to lower returns for certain products including TEQUIN, PRAVACHOL and SUSTIVA. The decrease in other adjustments was due to lower sales discounts and government rebates in the international businesses. The following table sets forth the activities and ending balances of each significant category of gross-to-net sales adjustments: Dollars in Millions Prime Vendor Charge-Backs Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Rebates Managed Health Care Rebates and Other Contract Discounts Medicaid Rebates Cash Discounts Sales Returns Other Adjustments Total Balance at January 1, 2005 $ 106 $ 234 $ 198 $ 372 $ 33 $ 229 $ 176 $ 1,348 Provision related to sales made in current period 1,096 843 509 558 269 191 351 3,817 Provision related to sales made in prior periods (6 ) 5 37 2 (27 ) (32 ) (21 ) Returns and payments (1,089 ) (825 ) (542 ) (641 ) (278 ) (206 ) (364 ) (3,945 ) Impact of foreign currency translation (3 ) (2 ) (7 ) (12 ) Balance at December 31, 2005 107 252 167 326 26 185 124 1,187 Provision related to sales made in current period 706 867 381 174 221 200 348 2,897 Provision related to sales made in prior periods (3 ) 5 (33 ) 3 30 (9 ) (7 ) Returns and payments (747 ) (894 ) (405 ) (363 ) (232 ) (196 ) (343 ) (3,180 ) Impact of foreign currency translation 1 2 4 7 Balance at December 31, 2006 $ 63 $ 230 $ 111 $ 137 $ 18 $ 221 $ 124 $ 904 In 2006, the Company recorded gross-to-net sales adjustments related to sales made in prior periods. The significant items included charges for sales returns of $30 million primarily related to higher than expected return trends for certain non-exclusive products as well as from the discontinued commercialization of TEQUIN; and credits in other contract discounts of $33 million, primarily due to the reversal of reserves related to the TRICARE Retail Pharmacy Refund Program. In 2005, the significant items included charges of $37 million for Medicaid rebates primarily as a result of higher than expected Medicaid utilization of various products; credits of $32 million for other adjustments primarily as a result of lower than expected rebates to foreign governments; and credits of $27 million for sales returns resulting from lower returns for certain products including TEQUIN, AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* and PLAVIX*. No other significant revisions were made to the estimates for gross-to-net sales adjustments in 2006 and 2005. Pharmaceuticals The composition of the change in pharmaceutical sales is as follows: Analysis of % Change Total Change Volume Price Foreign Exchange 2006 vs. 2005 (9)% (11)% 2% 2005 vs. 2004 (2)% (3)% 1% In 2006, Worldwide Pharmaceuticals sales decreased 9% to $13,861 million. U.S. Pharmaceuticals sales decreased 9% to $7,417 million from $8,190 million in 2005, primarily due to lower sales of PLAVIX* resulting from the at-risk launch of generic clopidogrel bisulfate in August 2006 and loss of exclusivity of PRAVACHOL; offset by continued growth of ABILIFY*, ERBITUX*, REYATAZ, the SUSTIVA Franchise and AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* and sales of newer products including ORENCIA, BARACLUDE and SPRYCEL. In aggregate, estimated U.S. wholesaler inventory levels of the Company key pharmaceutical products sold by the U.S. Pharmaceuticals business at the end of 2006 were approximately two and a half weeks. 48 International Pharmaceuticals sales decreased 9% to $6,444 million in 2006 from $7,064 million in 2005, primarily due to a decline in PRAVACHOL and TAXOL (paclitaxel) sales resulting from increased generic competition in Europe, partially offset by increased sales of newer products including REYATAZ, ABILIFY* and BARACLUDE. In 2005, Worldwide Pharmaceuticals sales decreased 2% to $15,254 million. U.S. Pharmaceuticals sales in 2005 decreased 3% to $8,190 million compared to $8,446 million in 2004, primarily due to the continued impact of exclusivity losses of PARAPLATIN and the GLUCOPHAGE* Franchise and increased competition for PRAVACHOL, partially offset by increased sales of growth drivers including PLAVIX*, ABILIFY*, ERBITUX* and REYATAZ. In aggregate, estimated wholesaler inventory levels of the Company key pharmaceutical products sold by the U.S. Pharmaceuticals business at the end of 2005 were down from the end of 2004 by approximately three-tenths of a month to approximately two and a half weeks. The decline in inventory levels negatively impacted the sales performance of certain products in 2005. International pharmaceutical sales in 2005 decreased 1%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact to $7,064 million, primarily due to increased generic competition for PRAVACHOL and TAXOL (paclitaxel), partially offset by increased sales of newer products including REYATAZ and ABILIFY* as well as growth of PLAVIX*. Key pharmaceutical products and their sales, representing 78%, 77% and 71% of total pharmaceutical sales in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, are as follows: % Change Dollars in Millions 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Cardiovascular PLAVIX* $ 3,257 $ 3,823 $ 3,327 (15)% 15% PRAVACHOL 1,197 2,256 2,635 (47)% (14)% AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* 1,097 982 930 12% 6% COUMADIN 220 212 255 4% (17)% MONOPRIL 159 208 274 (24)% (24)% Virology REYATAZ 931 696 414 34% 68% SUSTIVA Franchise (total revenue) 791 680 621 16% 10% ZERIT 155 216 272 (28)% (21)% BARACLUDE 83 12 ** Other Infectious Diseases CEFZIL 87 259 270 (66)% (4)% Oncology ERBITUX* 652 413 261 58% 58% TAXOL (paclitaxel) 563 747 991 (25)% (25)% SPRYCEL 25 Affective (Psychiatric) Disorders ABILIFY* (total revenue) 1,282 912 593 41% 54% EMSAM* 18 Immunoscience ORENCIA 89 Other Pharmaceuticals EFFERALGAN 266 283 274 (6)% 3% ** In excess of 200%. Sales of PLAVIX*, a platelet aggregation inhibitor that is part of the Company alliance with Sanofi, decreased 15% to $3,257 million in 2006 from 2005. Sales of PLAVIX* decreased 18% in the U.S. in 2006 to $2,655 million from 2005, primarily as a result of the launch of a generic clopidogrel bisulfate product in August 2006. While market exclusivity for PLAVIX* is expected to expire in 2011 in the U.S. and 2013 in the major European markets, the composition of matter patent for PLAVIX* is the subject of litigation, including the litigation with Apotex as noted above. The trial in the underlying patent litigation ended on February 15, 2007 and the Court will rule following post-trial briefing. If Apotex were to prevail at trial in the underlying patent litigation or if there is additional competition for PLAVIX* from other third-party generic pharmaceutical companies, PLAVIX* would face renewed generic competition. In 2005, sales increased 15%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $3,823 million from $3,327 million in 2004. U.S. sales increased 14% to $3,235 million in 2005 from $2,833 million in 2004, primarily due to increased demand. For additional information on the PLAVIX* litigations, as well as the generic launch by Apotex, see Executive Summary PLAVIX* above and Item 8. Financial Statements Note 21. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. 49 Sales of PRAVACHOL, an HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor, decreased 47%, including a 1% unfavorable foreign exchange impact, to $1,197 million in 2006 from 2005, due to market exclusivity expiration in April 2006 resulting in generic competition for most strengths in the U.S. and generic competition in key European markets. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand decreased approximately 59% compared to 2005. In 2005, sales for PRAVACHOL decreased 14% to $2,256 million from $2,635 million in 2004, primarily due to lower demand resulting from increased competition and the related reduction in wholesaler inventory levels, partially offset by lower managed health care rebates in 2005. Market exclusivity in the European Union (EU) ended in 2004, with the exception of Sweden, where expiration occurred in March 2006, Italy, where expiration will occur in January 2008, and France, where generic competition that was not authorized by the Company commenced in July 2006. As previously disclosed, the Company authorized Watson to distribute pravastatin sodium tablets in the U.S. Sales of AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*, an angiotensin II receptor blocker for the treatment of hypertension that is also part of the Sanofi alliance, increased 12%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $1,097 million in 2006 from 2005. U.S. sales increased 13% to $647 million in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to higher average net selling prices and higher volume. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand increased approximately 4% compared to 2005. International sales increased 10%, including a 2% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $450 million compared to 2005. In 2005, sales increased 6%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $982 million from $930 million in 2004. U.S. sales increased 2% to $574 million in 2005 compared to $562 million in 2004, while international sales increased 11%, including a 3% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $408 million from $368 million in 2004, primarily due to increased sales in Canada, France and Germany. Market exclusivity for AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* (known in the EU as APROVEL*/KARVEA*) is expected to expire in 2012 (including pediatric extension) in the U.S. and in 2012 in countries in the EU; AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* is not currently marketed in Japan. Sales of COUMADIN (warfarin sodium), an oral anti-coagulant used predominantly in patients with atrial fibrillation or deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, increased 4% to $220 million in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to higher average net selling prices, partially offset by lower demand driven by continued competition. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand decreased approximately 21% compared to 2005. Sales in 2005 decreased 17% to $212 million from $255 million in 2004, due to continued competition. Market exclusivity for COUMADIN expired in the U.S. in 1997. Sales of MONOPRIL, a second generation angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor for the treatment of hypertension, sold almost exclusively in non-U.S. markets, decreased 24% to $159 million in 2006. Sales in 2005 were $208 million, a decrease of 24%, including a 2% favorable foreign exchange impact, from $274 million in 2004. The sales declines in both years were due to product supply issues in key European markets. Market exclusivity protection for MONOPRIL expired in 2003 in the U.S. and has expired or is expected to expire between 2001 and 2008 in countries in the EU. MONOPRIL is not currently marketed in Japan. Sales of REYATAZ, a protease inhibitor for the treatment of HIV, increased 34%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $931 million in 2006, primarily due to increased demand in the U.S., Europe and Latin America. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand increased approximately 18% compared to 2005. U.S. sales increased 27% to $514 million in 2006 from $405 million in 2005, primarily due to higher demand and higher average net selling prices. International sales increased 43%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $417 million in 2006 compared to 2005. Sales in 2005 were $696 million compared to $414 million in 2004, primarily due to increased demand in the U.S. and in Europe, where REYATAZ was launched in the second quarter of 2004. Market exclusivity for REYATAZ is expected to expire in 2017 in the U.S., in countries in the EU and Japan. Total revenue for the SUSTIVA Franchise, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV, increased 16%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $791 million in 2006 from 2005 due to higher demand and the launch of ATRIPLA* in the third quarter of 2006. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand for the SUSTIVA Franchise increased approximately 11% compared to 2005. In July 2006, the Company and Gilead launched ATRIPLA*, a once-daily single tablet three-drug regimen for HIV intended as a stand-alone therapy or in combination with other antiretrovirals. Total revenue for the SUSTIVA Franchise includes sales of SUSTIVA as well as revenue from bulk efavirenz included in the combination therapy ATRIPLA*. The Company records revenue for the bulk efavirenz component of ATRIPLA* upon sales of ATRIPLA* by the Gilead joint venture to third-party customers. In 2005, SUSTIVA sales increased 10% to $680 million from $621 million in 2004, primarily due to increased demand, higher average selling prices and lower sales returns. Market exclusivity for SUSTIVA is expected to expire in 2013 in the U.S. and in countries in the EU; the Company does not, but others do, market SUSTIVA in Japan. For additional information on revenue recognition of the SUSTIVA Franchise, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 2. Alliances and Investments. Sales of ZERIT (stavudine) , an antiretroviral agent used in the treatment of HIV, decreased 28% to $155 million in 2006, primarily as a result of lower demand in both the U.S. and Europe. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand decreased approximately 30% compared to 2005. In 2005, ZERIT sales decreased 21%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $216 million from $272 million in 2004, primarily as a result of a decrease in demand in the U.S. Market exclusivity protection for ZERIT is expected to expire in 2008 in the U.S., between 2007 and 2011 in countries in the EU and in 2008 in Japan. 50 Sales of BARACLUDE, an oral antiviral agent for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, increased to $83 million in 2006 compared to $12 million in 2005. BARACLUDE was launched in the U.S in April 2005, China in February 2006, UK and Germany in July 2006 and in France and Japan in September 2006. The Company has a composition of matter patent that expires in the U.S. in 2010 and in Germany, France and the UK in 2011. Sales of CEFZIL, an antibiotic for the treatment of mild to moderately severe bacterial infections, decreased 66% to $87 million in 2006 from 2005, primarily due to generic competition in the U.S. In 2006, estimated total U.S. prescription demand decreased approximately 91% compared to 2005. In 2005, CEFZIL sales decreased 4%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $259 million from $270 million in 2004, primarily due to lower demand. Market exclusivity expired in December 2005 in the U.S. and is expected to expire between 2007 and 2009 in the EU. Sales of ERBITUX*, which is sold by the Company almost exclusively in the U.S., increased 58% to $652 million in 2006 from $413 million in 2005, driven by continued growth related to usage in the treatment of colorectal cancer and for the treatment of head and neck cancer, which was approved by the FDA in March 2006. Sales in 2005 increased to $413 million from $261 million in 2004. ERBITUX* is marketed by the Company under a distribution and copromotion agreement with ImClone. A use patent relating to combination therapy with cytotoxic treatments expires in 2017. There is no patent covering monotherapy. Currently, generic versions of biological products cannot be approved under U.S. law. However, the law could change in the future. Even in the absence of new legislation, the FDA is taking steps toward allowing generic versions of certain biologics. Competitors seeking approval of biological products must file their own safety and efficacy data, and address the challenges of biologics manufacturing, which involves more complex processes and are more costly than those of traditional pharmaceutical operations. The Company right to market ERBITUX* in North America and Japan under its agreement with ImClone expires in September 2018. The Company does not, but others do, market ERBITUX* in countries in the EU. As previously disclosed, ImClone and Yeda Research and Development Company Ltd. (Yeda) have been in litigation over the ownership of the use patent for combination therapy with cytotoxic treatments relating to ERBITUX*. In September 2006, the court granted Yeda the complete ownership of that patent. ImClone has appealed the court decision. For further information pertaining to legal proceedings involving ERBITUX*, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 21. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies, and Note 2. Alliances and Investments. Sales of TAXOL (paclitaxel), an anti-cancer agent sold almost exclusively in the non-U.S. markets, were $563 million in 2006 compared to $747 million in 2005. Sales of TAXOL (paclitaxel) decreased 25%, including a 2% unfavorable foreign exchange impact, primarily due to increased generic competition in Europe and generic entry in Japan during the third quarter of 2006. In 2005, TAXOL (paclitaxel) sales decreased 25%, including a 1% unfavorable foreign exchange impact, to $747 million from $991 million in 2004, primarily as a result of increased generic competition in Europe. Market exclusivity protection for TAXOL (paclitaxel) expired in 2000 in the U.S. and in 2003 in countries in the EU. Two generic paclitaxel products have received regulatory approval in Japan, and one generic product has entered the market. SPRYCEL, an oral inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases, for the treatment of adults with chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase chronic myloid leukemia with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy, including GLEEVEC* (imatinib meslylate), was launched in the U.S. in July 2006 and in certain European markets in the fourth quarter of 2006. Sales for 2006 were $25 million. Market exclusivity for SPRYCEL is expected to expire in 2020 in the U.S. Total revenue for ABILIFY*, an antipsychotic agent for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute bipolar mania and bipolar disorder, increased 41% to $1,282 million in 2006 from 2005. U.S. sales increased 40% to $1,052 million in 2006 from $750 million in 2005, primarily due to higher demand and higher average net selling prices. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand increased approximately 21% compared to 2005. In 2005, total revenue for ABILIFY* was $912 million, compared to $593 million in 2004, primarily due to demand growth in the U.S. and the continued growth in Europe, which achieved sales of $140 million in 2005. Total revenue for ABILIFY* primarily consists of alliance revenue representing the Company 65% share of net sales in countries where it copromotes with Otsuka and the product is sold by an Otsuka affiliate as a distributor. Otsuka market exclusivity protection for ABILIFY* is expected to expire in 2014 in the U.S. (including the granted patent term extension). Otsuka has received formal notices from six generic pharmaceutical companies stating that each has filed an aNDA with the FDA for various dosage forms of aripiprazole, which the Company and Otsuka comarket in the U.S. as ABILIFY*. Each of these notices further states that its aNDA contains a p(IV) certification directed to U.S. Patent No. 5,006,528 (the 528 Patent), which covers aripiprazole and expires in October 2014. In addition, each of the notices purports to provide Otsuka with the respective p(IV) certification. These certifications contain various allegations regarding the enforceability of the 528 Patent and/or the validity and/or infringement of some or all the claims therein. Otsuka has sole rights to enforce the 528 Patent. For additional information, see Item 1, Business Business Segments Pharmaceuticals Segment. The Company also has the right to copromote ABILIFY* in several European countries (the UK, France, Germany and Spain) and to act as exclusive distributor for the product in the rest of the EU. A composition of matter patent is in force in Germany, the UK, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain and Denmark. The original expiration date of 2009 has been extended to 2014 by grant of a supplemental protection certificate in all of the above countries except Romania and Denmark. 51 Data exclusivity in the EU expires in 2014. The Company contractual right to market ABILIFY* expires in November 2012 in the U.S. and Puerto Rico and, for the countries in the EU where the Company has the exclusive right to market ABILIFY* until June 2014. For additional information on revenue recognition of ABILIFY*, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 2. Alliances and Investments. EMSAM*, a transdermal patch for the delivery of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults, was launched in the U.S. in April 2006. Sales in 2006 were $18 million. In the third quarter of 2006, as a result of lower than expected sales for EMSAM*, the Company recorded a $27 million impairment charge for EMSAM* related assets. EMSAM* was developed by Somerset, a joint venture between Mylan and Watson. The Company has obtained exclusive distribution rights to commercialize EMSAM* in the U.S. and Canada and markets EMSAM* in the U.S. through its existing neuroscience sales force. As a new drug formulation, EMSAM* received three years of Hatch-Waxman data exclusivity, which expires in 2009 in the U.S. ORENCIA, a fusion protein indicated for adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more currently available treatments, such as methotrexate or anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy, was launched in the U.S. in February 2006. Sales in 2006 were $89 million, substantially all in the U.S. The Company has a composition of matter patent that expires in the U.S. in 2016 and the patent may be eligible for patent term restoration, which could possibly extend the term. As noted above, generic versions of biological products cannot be approved under U.S. law, but the law could change in the future. Sales of EFFERALGAN (paracetamol), a formulation of acetaminophen for pain relief sold principally in Europe, decreased 6% to $266 million in 2006, primarily due to a change in government reimbursement. In 2005, sales increased 3%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $283 million from $274 million in 2004, primarily due to increased sales in Italy and Spain as a result of a strong flu season in 2005. The estimated U.S. prescription change data provided above includes information only from the retail and mail order channels and does not reflect information from other channels, such as hospitals, institutions and long-term care, among others. The estimated prescription and prescription change data are based on National Prescription Audit (NPA) data provided by IMS Health (IMS), a supplier of market research for the pharmaceutical industry, as described below. In most instances, the basic exclusivity loss date indicated above is the expiration date of the patent that claims the active ingredient of the drug or the method of using the drug for the approved indication. In some instances, the basic exclusivity loss date indicated is the expiration date of the data exclusivity period. In situations where there is only data exclusivity without patent protection, a competitor could seek regulatory approval prior to the expiration of the data exclusivity period by submitting its own clinical trial data to obtain marketing approval. The Company assesses the market exclusivity period for each of its products on a case-by-case basis. The length of market exclusivity for any of the Company products is difficult to predict with certainty because of the complex interaction between patent and regulatory forms of exclusivity and other factors. There can be no assurance that a particular product will enjoy market exclusivity for the full period of time that the Company currently anticipates.

(c) Based on a weighted-average of the estimated number of prescription units (tablets or milliliters) in the retail and mail order channels based on data provided by IMS. (d) The therapeutic categories are determined by the Company as those products considered to be in direct competition with the Company own products. The products listed above compete in the following therapeutic categories: ABILIFY* (antipsychotics), AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* (angiotensin receptor blockers), BARACLUDE (oral antiviral agent), CEFZIL (branded oral solid and liquid antibiotics), COUMADIN (warfarin), ERBITUX* (oncology), GLUCOPHAGE* Franchise (oral antidiabetics), KENALOG (intra-articular/intramuscular steroid), ORENCIA (fusion protein), PARAPLATIN (carboplatin), PLAVIX* (antiplatelet agents), PRAVACHOL (HMG CoA reductase inhibitors), REYATAZ (protease inhibitors excluding NORVIR*), SPRYCEL (TKIs for leukemia), the SUSTIVA Franchise (antiretrovirals third agents excluding NORVIR* and TRIZIVIR*), TEQUIN (branded oral solid antibiotics), VIDEX/VIDEX EC and ZERIT (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors). (e) BARACLUDE was launched in the U.S. in April 2005. (f) ERBITUX* and PARAPLATIN specifically, and parenterally administered oncology products in general, do not have prescription-level data because physicians do not write prescriptions for these products. The Company believes therapeutic category share information provided by third parties for these products may not be reliable and accordingly, none is presented here. (g) The Company does not have prescription level data for KENALOG because the product is not dispensed through a retail pharmacy. The Company believes therapeutic category share information provided by third parties for this product may not be reliable and accordingly none is presented here. (h) ORENCIA was launched in the U.S. in February 2006. The Company does not have prescription level data because the product is not dispensed through retail pharmacies. (i) Prior year Estimated TRx Therapeutic Category Share Percentage has been recalculated to conform with current year presentation for the following: CEFZIL has been recalculated as a percentage share based on the combined Oral and Liquid/Suspension markets; REYATAZ has been recalculated as a percentage share of the Protease Inhibitors excluding NORVIR*; the SUSTIVA Franchise has been recalculated as a percentage share of Third Agents excluding NORVIR* and TRIZIVIR*. (j) SPRYCEL was launched in the U.S. in July 2006. (k) Beginning in the third quarter of 2006, the SUSTIVA Franchise (total revenue) includes sales of SUSTIVA, as well as revenue of bulk efavirenz included in the combination therapy, ATRIPLA*. The therapeutic category share information and change in U.S. total prescriptions growth for the SUSTIVA Franchise (antiretrovirals third agents excluding NORVIR* and TRIZIVIR*) includes both branded SUSTIVA and ATRIPLA* prescription units. ** In excess of 200%. The Company has historically reported estimated total U.S. prescription change and estimated therapeutic category share based on NPA data, which IMS makes available to the public on a subscription basis, and a simple average of the estimated number of prescriptions in the retail and mail order channels. In the third quarter of 2005, the Company began disclosing estimated total U.S. prescription change and estimated therapeutic category share based on both NPA and NGPS version 1.0 data. NGPS version 1.0 data was collected by IMS under a new, revised methodology and was released by IMS on a limited basis through a pilot program. IMS announced NGPS version 2.0 data is available to the public on a subscription basis starting in January 2007 and legacy NPA and NGPS version 1.0 will be discontinued. The Company believes that the NGPS data provided by IMS provides a superior estimate of prescription data for the Company products in the retail and mail order channels. The Company has calculated the estimated total U.S. prescription change and estimated therapeutic category share based on NGPS data on a weighted-average basis to reflect the fact that mail order prescriptions include a greater volume of product supplied compared with retail prescriptions. The Company believes that calculation of the estimated total U.S. prescription change and estimated therapeutic category share based on the NGPS data and the weighted-average approach with respect to the retail and mail order channels provides a superior estimate of total prescription demand. The Company now uses this methodology for its internal demand forecasts. 54 The estimated prescription change data and estimated therapeutic category share reported throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K only include information from the retail and mail order channels and do not reflect information from other channels, such as hospitals, institutions and long-term care, among others. The data provided by IMS are a product of IMS own record-keeping processes and are themselves estimates based on sampling procedures, subject to the inherent limitations of estimates based on sampling. In addition, the NGPS version 1.0 data was part of a pilot program that was replaced by IMS and incorporated in the NGPS version 2.0 released in January 2007. The Company continuously seeks to improve the quality of its estimates of prescription change amounts, therapeutic category share percentages and ultimate patient/consumer demand through review of its methodologies and processes for calculation of these estimates and review and analysis of its own and third parties data used in such calculations. The Company expects that it will continue to review and refine its methodologies and processes for calculation of these estimates and will continue to review and analyze its own and third parties data used in such calculations. International Pharmaceuticals, Nutritionals and Other Health Care The following table sets forth for each of the Company key pharmaceutical products and other growth drivers sold by the Company International Pharmaceuticals business, including the top 15 pharmaceutical products sold in the Company major non-U.S. countries (based on 2005 net sales), and for each of the key products sold by the other reporting segments listed below, the percentage change in the Company estimated ultimate patient/consumer demand for the months of December 2006 and September 2006 compared to the same period in the prior year. The Company commenced collecting the estimated ultimate patient/consumer demand for these reporting segments with the March 2005 period. The Company believes the year-to-year comparison below provides a more meaningful comparison to changes in sales for the quarter than the quarter-to-prior quarter comparisons previously provided. % Change in Demand on a Constant U.S. Dollar Basis December 2006 vs. December 2005 September 2006 vs. September 2005 International Pharmaceuticals ABILIFY* (total revenue) 15 23 AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* 6 3 BARACLUDE * * BUFFERIN* 11 20 CAPOTEN (16 ) (24 ) DAFALGAN 5 11 EFFERALGAN 2 (23 ) MAXIPIME (23 ) (5 ) MONOPRIL (10 ) (15 ) PARAPLATIN (11 ) (19 ) PERFALGAN 17 31 PLAVIX* (8 ) (13 ) PRAVACHOL (63 ) (55 ) REYATAZ 23 20 SUSTIVA Franchise (total revenue) 4 2 TAXOL (paclitaxel) (18 ) (26 ) VIDEX/VIDEX EC (33 ) (22 ) Nutritionals ENFAMIL/ENFAGROW 6 5 NUTRAMIGEN 17 7 Other Health Care ConvaTec Ostomy 3 Wound Therapeutics 5 5 Medical Imaging CARDIOLITE (5 ) (5 ) ** In excess of 200%. 55 Estimated Inventory Months on Hand in the Distribution Channel U.S. Pharmaceuticals The following tables set forth for each of the Company top 15 pharmaceutical products (based on 2005 annual net sales) and other products that the Company views as current and future growth drivers sold by the Company U.S. Pharmaceuticals business, the U.S. Pharmaceuticals net sales and the estimated number of months on hand of the applicable product in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel for the quarters ended December 31 and September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company believes the estimated number of months on hand for the quarters ended December 31 and September 30 for each of the three preceding years provide a more meaningful comparison to the Estimated End-User Demand for U.S. Pharmaceuticals disclosed above than the Company former practice of providing the six most recent quarters.

The estimated months on hand of the product in the U.S. wholesale distribution channel only include branded SUSTIVA inventory. BARACLUDE was launched in the U.S. in April 2005. In anticipation of the launch, the Company U.S. wholesalers built inventories of the product to meet expected demand and at September 30, 2005, BARACLUDE inventory in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel exceeded one month on hand. The estimated value of BARACLUDE inventory in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel had been worked down to less than one month on hand in subsequent quarters. 56 At December 31, 2006 and September 30, 2006, the estimated value of CEFZIL inventory in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel exceeded one month on hand by approximately $9.7 million and $11.8 million, respectively. The demand for CEFZIL decreased significantly in 2006 due to reduced wholesaler outmovements as generic competition began in the U.S. in December 2005. At December 31, 2004, the estimated value of CEFZIL inventory exceeded one month on hand by approximately $1.6 million as the Company built higher inventories of the product to meet expected higher demand typically experienced in the winter months in the U.S. The Company continues to monitor CEFZIL sales with the objective to work down wholesaler inventory levels to one month on hand or less. At December 31, 2004, the estimated value of GLUCOPHAGE* Franchise products inventory (GLUCOPHAGE* XR, GLUCOPHAGE* IR, GLUCOVANCE* and METAGLIP*) in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel exceeded one month on hand by approximately $1.6 million. As with all products, the months on hand estimate for the GLUCOPHAGE* Franchise products is an average of months on hand for all stock-keeping units (SKUs) of the product group. The increase in months on hand of the GLUCOPHAGE* Franchise products at the end of the fourth quarter 2004 to above one month on hand resulted primarily from the purchase by wholesalers of certain SKUs. After giving effect to these purchases, the increased months on hand for these SKUs were less than one month on hand. However, when the increased months on hand for these SKUs were averaged with all SKUs for the GLUCOPHAGE* Franchise products, the aggregate estimated months on hand exceeded one month. At March 31, 2005, the estimated value of GLUCOPHAGE* Franchise products inventory in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel had been worked down to approximately one month on hand, and has been worked down to, and remained at, less than one month on hand in subsequent quarters. At December 31, 2004 and September 30, 2004, the estimated value of KENALOG inventory in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel exceeded one month on hand by approximately $1.0 million and $2.6 million, respectively, due to high levels of goods-in-transit caused by shipping delays. In subsequent quarters, the estimated value of KENALOG inventory in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel had been worked down to less than one month on hand. In October 2004, the U.S. pediatric exclusivity period for PARAPLATIN expired. The resulting entry of multiple generic competitors for PARAPLATIN led to a significant decrease in demand for PARAPLATIN, which in turn led to the months on hand of the product in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel exceeding one month on hand at December 31, 2006, September 30, 2006, September 30, 2005, December 31, 2004 and September 30, 2004. The estimated value of PARAPLATIN inventory in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel over one month on hand was approximately $0.6 million at December 31, 2006, $0.6 million at September 30, 2006, $0.7 million at September 30, 2005, $6.0 million at December 31, 2004 and $6.6 million at September 30, 2004. The Company no longer produces PARAPLATIN for the U.S. market and will continue to monitor PARAPLATIN wholesaler inventory levels until they have been depleted. At September 30, 2006, the estimated value of PLAVIX* inventory in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel exceeded one month on hand by approximately $41.4 million due to the at-risk launch of generic clopidogrel bisulfate in August 2006. Demand for PLAVIX* decreased precipitously following the at-risk launch of generic clopidogrel bisulfate. As of December 31, 2006, PLAVIX* inventory in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel has been worked down to less than one month on hand. SPRYCEL was launched in the U.S. in July 2006. Consistent with customary practice at the time of a new product launch, the Company U.S. wholesalers built inventories of the product to meet expected demand, and at December 31, 2006 and September 30, 2006, the estimated value of SPRYCEL inventory in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel exceeded one month on hand by approximately $1.4 million and $0.6 million, respectively. The Company continues to monitor SPRYCEL inventory and sales with the objective to work down wholesaler inventory levels to one month on hand or less. In the first quarter of 2006, the Company made the decision to discontinue commercialization of TEQUIN for commercial reasons. The Company stopped shipping product to U.S. wholesalers in June 2006 and established an accrual for the estimated returns of TEQUIN inventory. In July 2006, the Company notified the U.S. wholesaler and retail distribution channels that it would allow for return of the product regardless of expiry dates. The estimated value of TEQUIN inventory in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel that exceeded one month on hand was de minimis at September 30, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the Company is not aware of any significant amounts of TEQUIN inventory remaining in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel. The Company expects most of the TEQUIN inventory in all U.S. channels to be reduced to nominal levels in the first quarter of 2007. The estimated value of VIDEX/VIDEX EC (didanosine) inventory in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel that exceeded one month on hand was de minimis at December 31, 2006 and was approximately $0.2 million at September 30, 2005. As a result of generic competition in the U.S. commencing in the fourth quarter of 2004, demand for VIDEX/VIDEX EC decreased significantly. 57 For all products other than ERBITUX* and ORENCIA, the Company determines the above months on hand estimates by dividing the estimated amount of the product in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel by the estimated amount of out-movement of the product from the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel over a period of 31 days, all calculated as described below. Factors that may influence the Company estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, wholesaler purchases in light of increases in wholesaler list prices, new product launches, new warehouse openings by wholesalers and new customer stockings by wholesalers. In addition, such estimates are calculated using third-party data, which represent their own record-keeping processes and as such, may also reflect estimates. The Company maintains inventory management agreements (IMAs) with most of its U.S. Pharmaceuticals wholesalers, which account for nearly 100% of total gross sales of U.S. pharmaceutical products. Under the current terms of the IMAs, the Company three largest wholesaler customers provide the Company with weekly information with respect to inventory levels of product on hand and the amount of out-movement of products. These three wholesalers accounted for approximately 90% of total gross sales of U.S. pharmaceutical products in 2006. The inventory information received from these wholesalers excludes inventory held by intermediaries to whom they sell, such as retailers and hospitals, and excludes goods in transit to such wholesalers. The Company uses the information provided by these three wholesalers as of the Friday closest to quarter end to calculate the amount of inventory on hand for these wholesalers at the applicable quarter end. This amount is then increased by the Company estimate of goods in transit to these wholesalers as of the applicable Friday, which have not been reflected in the weekly data provided by the wholesalers. Under the Company revenue recognition policy, sales are recorded when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred, which in the U.S. Pharmaceuticals business is generally when product is shipped. In such cases, goods in transit to a wholesaler are owned by the applicable wholesaler and, accordingly, are reflected in the calculation of inventories in the wholesaler distribution channel. The Company estimates the amount of goods in transit by using information provided by these wholesalers with respect to their open orders as of the applicable Friday and the Company records of sales to these wholesalers with respect to such open orders. The Company determines the out-movement of a product from these wholesalers over a period of 31 days by using the most recent four weeks of out-movement of a product as provided by these wholesalers and extrapolating such amount to a 31 day basis. The Company estimates inventory levels on hand and out-movements for its U.S. Pharmaceuticals business wholesaler customers other than the three largest wholesalers for each product based on the assumption that such amounts bear the same relationship to the three largest wholesalers inventory levels and out-movements for such product as the percentage of aggregate sales for all products to these other wholesalers in the applicable quarter bears to aggregate sales for all products to the Company three largest wholesalers in such quarter. Finally, the Company considers whether any adjustments are necessary to these extrapolated amounts based on such factors as historical sales of individual products made to such other wholesalers and third-party market research data related to prescription trends and patient demand. In addition, the Company receives inventory information from these other wholesalers on a selective basis for certain key products. The Company U.S. Pharmaceuticals business through the IMAs discussed above, has arrangements with substantially all of its direct wholesaler customers and requires those wholesalers to maintain inventory at levels that are no more than one month of their demand. In response to the at-risk launch of generic clopidogrel bisulfate on August 8, 2006, the Company offered certain U.S. MCOs incremental rebates from its wholesaler list price for PLAVIX* under certain conditions through March 31, 2007. A small number of MCOs accepted the offer. All other offers were rejected, did not qualify or were terminated prior to or at the time of the issuance of the preliminary injunction on August 31, 2006, and no further such offers have been made. The Company also provided a temporary price reduction below the Federal supply schedule for PLAVIX* to the Veterans Administration for a limited period in August and September 2006. Primarily as a result of very limited participation in the rebate offer, the Company estimates that the impact of the two programs on PLAVIX* net sales in the third and fourth quarters was de minimis. ORENCIA was launched in February 2006. From launch through the second quarter, the Company distributed ORENCIA through an exclusive distribution arrangement with a single distributor. Following approval of the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) that allows a third party to manufacture ORENCIA at an additional site, the exclusive distribution arrangement terminated on July 17, 2006 and the Company expanded its distribution network for ORENCIA to multiple distributors. The above estimates of months on hand was calculated by dividing the inventories of ORENCIA held by these distributors at the end of the quarter by the outmovement of the product over the last 31 day period, as reported by these distributors. The inventory on hand and outmovements reported by these distributors are a product of the distributors own record-keeping processes. During 2004 and through May 2005, McKesson Corporation (McKesson), one of the Company wholesalers, provided warehousing, packing and shipping services for ERBITUX*. McKesson held ERBITUX* inventory on consignment and, under the Company revenue recognition policy, the Company recognized revenue when such inventory was shipped by McKesson to the end-users. McKesson also held inventories of ERBITUX* for its own account. Upon the divestiture of OTN in May 2005, the Company discontinued the consignment arrangement with McKesson and McKesson no longer held inventories for its own account. Thereafter, the Company sold ERBITUX* to intermediaries (such as wholesalers and specialty oncology distributors) and shipped ERBITUX* directly to the end-users of the product who are the customers of those intermediaries. Beginning in the third quarter of 2006, the Company expanded its distribution model to include one of the Company wholesalers who then held ERBITUX* inventory. The Company recognizes revenue upon such shipment consistent with its revenue recognition policy. 58 The above estimate of months on hand was calculated by dividing the inventories of ERBITUX* held by the wholesaler for its own account as reported by the wholesaler as of the end of the quarter by the outmovements of the product reported by that wholesaler over the last 31 day period. The inventory levels reported by the wholesaler are a product of the wholesaler own record-keeping process. As previously disclosed, for the Company Pharmaceuticals business outside of the U.S., Nutritionals and Other Health Care business units around the world, the Company has significantly more direct customers, limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information, where available, varies widely. Accordingly, the Company relies on a variety of methods to estimate direct customer product level inventory and to calculate months on hand for these business units. Estimated Inventory Months on Hand in the Distribution Channel The following table sets forth for each of the Company key products sold by the businesses listed below, the net sales of the applicable product for each of the quarters ended December 31, 2006, September 30, 2006, December 31, 2005 and September 30, 2005, and the estimated number of months on hand of the applicable product in the direct customer distribution channel for the businesses as of the end of each of the four quarters. The Company believes the estimated number of months on hand for the quarters ended December 31 and September 30 for each of the two preceding years provide a more meaningful comparison to the Estimated End-User Demand for International Pharmaceuticals, Nutritionals and Other Health Care disclosed above than the Company former practice of providing the four most recent quarters. The estimates of months on hand for key products described below for the International Pharmaceuticals business are based on data collected for all of the Company significant business units outside of the U.S. Also described further below is information on non-key product(s) where the amount of inventory on hand at direct customers is more than approximately one month and the impact is not de minimis. For the other non-Pharmaceuticals reporting segments, estimates are based on data collected for the U.S. and all significant business units outside of the U.S. December 31, 2006 September 30, 2006 Dollars in Millions Net Sales Months On Hand Net Sales Months on Hand International Pharmaceuticals ABILIFY* (total revenue) $ 68 0.7 $ 53 0.6 AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* 125 0.6 118 0.5 BARACLUDE 18 0.8 8 0.9 BUFFERIN* 32 0.5 28 0.5 CAPOTEN 31 0.8 28 0.8 DAFALGAN 40 1.0 35 1.1 EFFERALGAN 74 0.7 62 0.9 MAXIPIME 33 0.6 40 0.7 MONOPRIL 35 0.9 34 1.0 PARAPLATIN 28 0.8 27 0.6 PERFALGAN 54 0.5 48 0.6 PLAVIX* 153 0.6 156 0.6 PRAVACHOL 96 0.8 119 0.7 REYATAZ 111 1.0 104 1.1 SUSTIVA Franchise (a) (total revenue) 78 0.5 73 0.5 TAXOL (paclitaxel) 128 0.7 135 0.6 VIDEX/VIDEX EC 29 1.4 35 1.4 Nutritionals ENFAMIL/ENFAGROW 338 0.9 315 0.8 NUTRAMIGEN 54 1.0 50 1.0 Other Health Care ConvaTec Ostomy 151 1.0 139 0.9 Wound Therapeutics 123 1.0 113 0.9 Medical Imaging CARDIOLITE 103 0.9 97 0.8 (a) Beginning in the third quarter of 2006, the SUSTIVA Franchise includes sales of SUSTIVA, as well as revenue of bulk efavirenz included in the combination therapy, ATRIPLA*.

Expected demand is the estimated ultimate patient/consumer demand calculated based on estimated end-user consumption or direct customer out-movement data over the most recent 31 day period or other reasonable period. Factors that may affect the Company estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, direct customer purchases in light of price increases, new product or product presentation launches, new warehouse openings by direct customers, new customer stockings by direct customers and expected direct customer purchases for governmental bidding situations. The Company relies on a variety of methods to calculate months on hand for these businesses and reporting segments. Where available, the Company relies on information provided by third parties to determine estimates of aggregate product level inventory on hand at direct customers and expected demand. For the businesses and reporting segments listed above; however, the Company has limited information on direct customer product level inventory, end-user consumption and direct customer out-movement data. Further, the quality of third-party information, where available, varies widely. In some circumstances, such as the case with new products or seasonal products, such historical end-user consumption or out-movement information may not be available or applicable. In such cases, the Company uses estimated prospective demand. In cases where direct customer product level inventory, ultimate patient/consumer demand or out-movement data do not exist or are otherwise not available, the Company has developed a variety of other methodologies to calculate estimates of such data, including using such factors as historical sales made to direct customers and third-party market research data related to prescription trends and end-user demand. As of September 30, 2006, the Company has entered into exclusive distributorship arrangements for certain products in several Eastern and Central European markets. As of September 30, 2006, December 31, 2005 and September 30, 2005, DAFALGAN, an analgesic product sold principally in Europe, had approximately 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 months of inventory on hand, respectively, at direct customers. The level of inventory on hand was due primarily to private pharmacists purchasing DAFALGAN approximately once every eight weeks and the seasonality of the product. 60 As of September 30, 2005, EFFERALGAN, an analgesic product sold principally in Europe, had approximately 1.1 months of inventory on hand at direct customers. The level of inventory on hand was due primarily to private pharmacists purchasing EFFERALGAN approximately once every eight weeks and the seasonality of the product. As of September 30, 2006, REYATAZ, an antiviral product, had approximately 1.1 months of inventory on hand at direct customers. The increased level of inventory on hand was due primarily to government purchasing patterns in Brazil. As of December 31, 2006 and September 30, 2006, VIDEX/VIDEX EC, an antiviral product, had approximately 1.4 months of inventory on hand at direct customers. The increased level of inventory on hand was due primarily to government purchasing patterns in Brazil. The Company is contractually obligated to provide VIDEX/VIDEX EC to the Brazilian government upon placement of an order for product by the government. Under the terms of the contract, the Company has no control over the inventory levels relating to such orders. The Company, however, expects that the inventory levels for VIDEX/VIDEX EC will be worked down. As of December 31, 2005 and September 30, 2005, NUTRAMIGEN, an infant nutritional product sold principally in the U.S., had approximately 1.1 months of inventory on hand at direct customers. The level of inventory on hand at the end of the quarter ended December 31, 2005 was due primarily to holiday stocking by retailers and at the quarter ended September 30, 2005 was due primarily to the impact of retailers holding higher levels of inventory in response to Hurricane Katrina. The Company continuously seeks to improve the quality of its estimates of months on hand of inventories held by its direct customers including thorough review of its methodologies and processes for calculation of these estimates and a thorough review and analysis of its own and third parties data used in such calculations. The Company expects that it will continue to review and refine its methodologies and processes for calculation of these estimates and will continue to review and analyze its own and third parties data in such calculations. The Company also has and will continue to take steps to expedite the receipt and processing of data for the non-U.S. Pharmaceuticals businesses. Health Care Group The combined 2006 revenues from the Health Care Group increased 3% to $4,053 million compared to the same period in 2005, despite a 4% unfavorable impact from the divestiture of the U.S. and Canadian Consumer Medicines (Consumer Medicines) business in the third quarter of 2005. The combined 2005 revenues from the Health Care Group increased 4% to $3,953 million compared to the same period in 2004.

In 2005, Worldwide Nutritionals sales were $2,205 million, an increase of 10%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact and despite a 2% unfavorable impact from the divestiture of the Adult Nutritional business, from $2,001 million in 2004. In the first quarter of 2004, the Company divested its Adult Nutritional business. International sales increased 11%, including a 3% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $1,256 million in 2006 from 2005, primarily due to increased sales of children nutritional products. In 2005, international sales increased 12%, including a 2% favorable foreign exchange impact and despite a 1% unfavorable impact from the divestiture of the Adult Nutritional business, to $1,135 million from $1,010 million in 2004, primarily due to the increased sales of ENFAMIL and ENFAGROW. 61 U.S. sales increased 2% to $1,091 million in 2006 from 2005, primarily due to increased sales of ENFAMIL. In 2005, U.S. sales increased 8%, despite a 3% unfavorable impact from the divestiture of the Adult Nutritional business, to $1,070 million from $991 million in 2004, primarily due to increased sales of ENFAMIL. Other Health Care The Other Health Care segment includes ConvaTec and the Medical Imaging business, as well as the Consumer Medicines business in 2005 and 2004. In the third quarter of 2005, the Company sold its Consumer Medicines business and related assets.

Ostomy sales increased 1% to $554 million in 2006, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact. Sales of wound therapeutic products increased 6%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $441 million in 2006 from $416 million in 2005, primarily due to continued growth of the AQUACEL franchise. In 2005, worldwide ConvaTec sales increased 4%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $992 million from $954 million in 2004, primarily due to an increase in worldwide sales of wound therapeutic products. Worldwide Medical Imaging sales increased 9% to $658 million in 2006 from 2005. This growth was primarily due to an increase in TechneLite technetium Tc99m generator sales resulting from a competitor market absence in the first quarter of 2006 and an increase in DEFINITY sales during a competitor continued absence from the market. CARDIOLITE sales decreased 2% to $408 million in 2006 from $416 million in 2005, primarily due to decreased price. In 2005, Medical Imaging sales increased 2%, to $602 million from $589 million in 2004, primarily due to increased demand for CARDIOLITE. 62 Geographic Areas In general, the Company products are available in most countries in the world. The largest markets are in the U.S., France, Japan, Canada, Spain, Italy, Mexico and Germany. The Company sales by geographic areas were as follows: % Change Dollars in Millions 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 United States $ 9,729 $ 10,461 $ 10,613 (7)% (1)% % of Total 55 % 54 % 55 % Europe, Middle East and Africa 4,544 5,136 5,470 (12)% (6)% % of Total 25 % 27 % 28 % Other Western Hemisphere 1,615 1,592 1,425 1% 12% % of Total 9 % 8 % 7 % Pacific 2,026 2,018 1,872 8% % of Total 11 % 11 % 10 % Total $ 17,914 $ 19,207 $ 19,380 (7)% (1)% Sales in the U.S. decreased 7% in 2006, primarily as a result of lower sales of PLAVIX* and the loss of exclusivity of PRAVACHOL in April 2006. This decrease in sales was partially offset by growth of the remaining pharmaceutical growth drivers and recently launched products. In 2005, sales in the U.S. decreased 1% in 2005, as a result of lower sales of PARAPLATIN and the GLUCOPHAGE* Franchise due to the continuing impact of earlier exclusivity losses, and PRAVACHOL , due to lower demand resulting from increased competition. This decrease in sales was mostly offset by increased sales of growth drivers including PLAVIX*, ABILIFY*, ERBITUX* and REYATAZ , as well as strong sales growth of ENFAMIL. Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa decreased 12% as a result of sales decline of PRAVACHOL and TAXOL (paclitaxel) resulting from increased generic competition. This decrease in sales was partially offset by increased sales in major European markets of REYATAZ and AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*. In 2005, sales decreased 6%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, as a result of sales decline of TAXOL (paclitaxel), due to increased generic competition, and PRAVACHOL , due to exclusivity loss in select markets, including the UK and the Netherlands. This decrease in sales was partially offset by increased sales in major European markets of REYATAZ and ABILIFY*, which were both launched in Europe in the second quarter of 2004. Sales in the Other Western Hemisphere countries increased 1%, including a 3% favorable foreign exchange impact, primarily due to increased sales of AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* in Canada and key nutritional products, partially offset by decreased sales of TEQUIN and other pharmaceutical products. In 2005, sales increased 12%, including a 7% favorable foreign exchange impact, primarily due to increased sales of PLAVIX* in Canada and Mexico, REYATAZ in Brazil and Canada, and AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* in Canada. Sales in the Pacific region remained consistent compared to 2005. In 2005, sales increased 8%, as a result of increased sales of TAXOL (paclitaxel) in Japan, and ENFAGROW and ENFAMIL in China. 63 Expenses % Change Dollars in Millions 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Cost of products sold $ 5,956 $ 5,928 $ 5,989 (1 )% % of net sales 33.2% 30.9% 30.9% Marketing, selling and administrative $ 4,919 $ 5,106 $ 5,016 (4 )% 2 % % of net sales 27.5% 26.6% 25.9% Advertising and product promotion $ 1,351 $ 1,476 $ 1,411 (8 )% 5 % % of net sales 7.5% 7.7% 7.3% Research and development $ 3,067 $ 2,746 $ 2,500 12 % 10 % % of net sales 17.1% 14.3% 12.9% Acquired in-process research and development $ $ $ 63 (100 )% % of net sales 0.3% Provision for restructuring, net $ 59 $ 32 $ 104 84 % (69 )% % of net sales 0.3% 0.1% 0.5% Litigation charges, net $ 302 $ 269 $ 420 12 % (36 )% % of net sales 1.7% 1.4% 2.2% Gain on sale of businesses $ (200 ) $ (569 ) $ (320 ) 65 % (78 )% % of net sales (1.1)% (3.0)% (1.7)% Equity in net income of affiliates $ (474 ) $ (334 ) $ (273 ) (42 )% (22 )% % of net sales (2.6)% (1.7)% (1.4)% Other expense, net $ 299 $ 37 $ 52 * * (29 )% % of net sales 1.7% 0.2% 0.3% Total Expenses, net $ 15,279 $ 14,691 $ 14,962 4 % (2 )% % of net sales 85.3% 76.5% 77.2% ** In excess of 200%. Cost of products sold, as a percentage of sales, increased to 33.2% in 2006 compared with 30.9% in 2005. In 2006, the Company included $91 million, or 0.5% as a percentage of sales, of certain costs in cost of products sold, which were reported in marketing, selling and administrative expenses in the prior year results. In addition to the reclassification, the increase was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of pharmaceutical net sales mix, including lower sales of PLAVIX* and impairment charges for TEQUIN and EMSAM* related assets as well as for a manufacturing facility. In 2005 and 2004, cost of products sold, as a percentage of sales, was 30.9%. In 2005, the unfavorable impact on gross margins resulting from the change in the U.S. Pharmaceuticals sales mix was offset by TEQUIN impairment charges and $76 million of net litigation charges recorded in 2004. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses decreased 4% to $4,919 million as compared to 2005, including a 2% decrease resulting from the above-mentioned reclassification. In addition to the reclassification, the decrease was primarily due to lower sales force expenses resulting from the previously announced restructuring of the U.S. primary care sales organization that became effective in March 2006 and lower expenses for PRAVACHOL, partially offset by the impact of the adoption of stock option expensing. In 2005, marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 2% to $5,106 million from $5,016 million in 2004, primarily due to higher legal costs and higher pension expenses, reflecting increased amortization of unrecognized net losses as well as change in actuarial assumptions, partially offset by lower sales force expenses resulting from a focus on specialists and high value primary care physicians. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 27.5%, which included a 0.5% decrease from the reclassification; compared with 26.6% and 25.9% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Advertising and product promotion expenditures decreased 8% to $1,351 million as compared to 2005, primarily driven by the divestiture of the Consumer Medicines business in 2005 and lower spending on mature brands, partially offset by increased investments in new products including ORENCIA and SPRYCEL. In 2005, advertising and product promotion expenditures increased 5% to $1,476 million as compared to $1,411 million in 2004, primarily due to increased investments in direct-to-consumer marketing campaigns for PLAVIX* and ABILIFY*, increased costs associated with pre-launch activities for ORENCIA and the launch of BARACLUDE, partially offset by lower spending on mature products. 64 The Company investment in research and development was $3,067 million in 2006, an increase of 12% over 2005. In 2005, the investment in research and development was $2,746 million, which represented a 10% increase over $2,500 million in 2004. The increases in both 2006 and 2005 reflect the Company strategy with continued investments in late-stage compounds and developing a pipeline in disease areas that address significant unmet medical need. Research and development costs also included charges consisting primarily of upfront and milestone payments of $85 million in 2006, primarily to Exelixis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Solvay Global (Solvay), $72 million in 2005, primarily to Medarex and Pierre Fabre Medicament S.A. (Pierre Fabre) and $58 million in 2004, primarily to Pierre Fabre and Solvay. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses were 17.1% in 2006 compared with 14.3% in 2005 and 12.9% in 2004. The percentage of sales in 2006 was impacted by lower PLAVIX* sales. Acquired in-process research and development of $63 million in 2004 was related to the purchase of Acordis, a UK-based company. For additional information on the acquisition, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 4. Acquisitions and Divestitures. Restructuring programs have been implemented to realign and streamline operations in order to increase productivity, reduce operating expenses and to rationalize the Company manufacturing network, research facilities, and the sales and marketing organizations. Actions under the 2006 restructuring program are expected to be substantially complete during 2008 while actions under the 2005 and 2004 restructuring programs were substantially completed at December 31, 2006. As a result of these actions, the Company expects the future annual benefit to earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes to be approximately $64 million, $77 million and $186 million for the 2006, 2005 and 2004 programs, respectively. For additional information on restructuring, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 3. Restructuring. Litigation charges, net of settlement income and insurance recoveries, were $302 million in 2006, $269 million in 2005 and $420 million in 2004. The $302 million net charge in 2006 consisted of an increase to the reserves of $353 million for the settlement in principle of certain pricing and sales investigations, partially offset by insurance recoveries of $37 million from an unrelated matter and $14 million in income from a settlement of a litigation matter. The $269 million net charge in 2005 consisted of increases to the reserves of $590 million for liabilities primarily related to private litigations and governmental investigations, partially offset by insurance recoveries of $321 million. The $420 million charge in 2004 consisted of $336 million related to private litigation and governmental investigations related to wholesaler inventory issues and accounting matters, $50 million related to the PLATINOL litigation settlement and $34 million related to pharmaceutical pricing and sales practices. For additional information on litigation, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 21. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. The gain on sale of businesses of $200 million ($130 million net of tax) in 2006 was related to the sale of inventory, trademark, patent and intellectual property rights related to DOVONEX*. The gain on sale of businesses of $569 million ($370 million net of tax) in 2005 was related to the sale of the Consumer Medicines business and related assets. The gain on sale of business of $320 million ($198 million net of tax) in 2004 was related to the sale of the Adult Nutritional business. For additional information on these transactions, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 4. Acquisitions and Divestitures. Equity in net income of affiliates for 2006 was $474 million, compared with $334 million and $273 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Equity in net income of affiliates is principally related to the Company joint venture with Sanofi and investment in ImClone. In 2006, the $140 million increase in equity in net income of affiliates was primarily due to increased net income in the joint venture with Sanofi and income from the equity investment in ImClone in 2006 compared to a loss in 2005. In 2005, the $61 million increase in equity in net income of affiliates from 2004 primarily reflects an increase in net income in the Sanofi joint venture, partially offset by a net loss from the investment in ImClone. For additional information on equity in net income of affiliates, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 2. Alliances and Investments. Other expense, net, was $299 million, $37 million and $52 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Other expense, net includes net interest expense, foreign exchange gains and losses, income from third-party contract manufacturing, royalty income and expense, debt retirement costs, gains and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment, gains and losses on sale of marketable securities and certain other litigation matters. The $262 million increase in other expense, net in 2006 from 2005 was primarily due to higher debt retirement costs in connection with the repurchase in 2006 of the $2.5 billion Notes due 2011 compared to the repurchase in 2005 of the $2.5 billion Notes due 2006, as well as a $143 million non-recurring income in 2005 resulting from the termination of the muraglitazar collaborative agreement, partially offset by lower net foreign exchange losses. The $15 million decrease in other expense, net in 2005 from 2004 was primarily due to deferred income recognized from the termination of the collaborative agreement for muraglitazar, partially offset by debt retirement costs in connection with the repurchase of the $2.5 billion Notes due 2006 and higher net foreign exchange losses. For additional information, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 7. Other Expense, Net. Stock-based compensation expense recognized under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)) for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $112 million. These charges were 65 recorded in cost of product sold, marketing selling and administrative expenses and research and development expenses. Stock-based compensation expense recognized under Accounting Principles Board (APB) No. 25 for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $31 million and $30 million, respectively. These expenses were recorded in marketing, selling and administrative expenses. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded several expense/(income) items that affected the comparability of results of the periods presented herein, which are set forth in the following table.

In 2006, earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes decreased 42% to $2,635 million from $4,516 million in 2005. The decrease was primarily driven by the net impact of items that affected the comparability of results as discussed above, lower net sales for pharmaceutical products resulting from lower PLAVIX* net sales and loss of exclusivity of PRAVACHOL, and increased spending on research and development, partially offset by an increase in equity in net income of affiliates and lower advertising and promotion expenses. In 2005, earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes increased 2% to $4,516 million from $4,418 million in 2004. The increase was primarily a result of growth in the Nutritionals segment and the net impact of items that affected the comparability of results as discussed above, partially offset by lower sales and gross margin of pharmaceutical products, primarily due to exclusivity losses and increased spending on research and development, primarily for late-stage pharmaceutical compounds. Pharmaceuticals Earnings before minority interest and income taxes were $2,559 million in 2006. The decrease in 2006 from 2005 was primarily due to lower net sales as a result of lower PLAVIX* sales and loss of exclusivity of PRAVACHOL, investment in research and development and continued investment in key growth drivers and new products. Earnings before minority interest and income taxes of $3,732 million in 2005 decreased from $4,334 million in 2004, primarily due to lower net sales and gross margin, primarily related to exclusivity losses, higher advertising and product promotion investments behind growth drivers and increased spending on research and development. 67 Health Care Group Nutritionals Earnings before minority interest and income taxes were $696 million in 2006. The increase in 2006 from 2005 was primarily due to sales growth of children nutritional products, partially offset by increased investments in advertising expense and research and development programs. Earnings before minority interest and income taxes of $677 million in 2005 increased from $610 million in 2004, primarily due to increased worldwide sales of infant formula products and international sales of toddler and children nutritional products, partially offset by increased investments in advertising and product promotion, and research and development programs. Other Health Care Earnings before minority interest and income taxes were $517 million in 2006. The increase in 2006 from 2005 was primarily driven by increased sales in the ConvaTec and Medical Imaging businesses. Earnings before minority interest and income taxes of $469 million in 2005 decreased from $510 million in 2004, primarily due to the sale of the Consumer Medicines business in the third quarter of 2005 and higher spending on research and development, partially offset by sales growth in the ConvaTec and Medical Imaging businesses. Corporate/Other Loss before minority interest and income taxes was $1,137 million in 2006. The increase in 2006 from 2005 was primarily due to higher debt retirement costs in 2006 compared to 2005, lower gain on sale of a product asset in 2006 compared to the Consumer Medicines business in 2005, a $143 million income in 2005 resulting from the termination of the muraglitazar collaborative agreement, as well as lower insurance recoveries in 2006 as compared to 2005, partially offset by lower litigation charges in 2006 compared to 2005. Loss before minority interest and income taxes in 2005 of $362 million decreased from $1,036 million in 2004, primarily due to the increase on the gain on the sales of businesses/product lines, deferred income recognized from the termination of the collaborative agreement for muraglitazar and a reduction of litigation charges, net. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes was 23.2% in 2006 compared with 20.6% in 2005 and 34.4% in 2004. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2006 compared to 2005 resulted from the elimination in 2006 of tax benefits under Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code, the treatment of provisions for a portion of certain litigation reserves as non-deductible in 2006, tax benefits in 2005 associated with the settlement of an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination and a favorable adjustment in 2005 to taxes on special dividends under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA), partially offset by favorable U.S. tax legislation enacted in 2006 related to the tax treatment of certain inter-company transactions amongst the Company foreign subsidiaries, and the implementation of tax planning strategies in 2006 related to the utilization of certain charitable contributions. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2005 was due primarily to a charge in 2004 of approximately $575 million for taxes on special dividends under the AJCA, a 2004 charge related to the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain charitable contributions and tax benefits in 2005 discussed above, partially offset by lower estimated foreign tax credits in 2005. The Company has recorded significant deferred tax assets related to U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1,071 million and U.S. research tax credit carryforwards of approximately $259 million, which expire in varying amounts beginning in 2012. Realization of the foreign tax credit and research tax credit carryforwards is dependent on generating sufficient domestic taxable income prior to their expiration. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. The Company anticipates increasing its level of domestic profitability over time by undertaking actions such as increasing its biologics manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and implementing tax planning strategies. While increasing domestic profitability will likely cause the Company effective tax rate to increase, it will also further enhance the Company ability to utilize its foreign tax credit and research tax credit carryforwards. The amount of foreign tax credit and research tax credit carryforwards considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if PLAVIX* is subject to either renewed or additional generic competition. If such events occur, the Company may need to record significant valuation allowances against these U.S. Federal deferred tax assets. For a discussion of PLAVIX* related matters, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 21. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. The Company U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2002 and 2003 are currently under examination by the IRS. The IRS has proposed (1) a significant disallowance of certain litigation settlement expenses and (2) a significant reduction in U.S. foreign tax 68 credits claimed following the Company previously disclosed 2002 international restructuring. The IRS position on this latter matter also affects U.S. foreign tax credits claimed by the Company in 2004, although that year currently is not under examination. While the Company believes that it has very strong positions with respect to both issues and intends to contest the IRS positions, it is not possible to predict the outcome of these issues. The Company has established tax contingency reserves that reflect the best estimate of the probable tax liability for these matters. If the Company were not to prevail in a final, non-appealable determination of these matters the amount of loss in excess of established reserves could have a material adverse effect on the Company results of operations, however, the Company does not believe that such a determination would have a material adverse effect on its cash flows. Minority Interest In 2006, minority interest, net of taxes decreased to $440 million from $592 million in 2005 primarily due to lower earnings in the Company partnership with Sanofi for the territory covering the Americas, resulting from the impact of the August 2006 at-risk launch of generic clopidogrel bisulfate. Discontinued Operations In May 2005, the Company completed the sale of OTN to One Equity Partners LLC for cash proceeds of $197 million including the impact of a preliminary working capital adjustment. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $63 million ($13 million net of tax) that was presented as a gain on sale of discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of earnings. OTN was previously presented as a separate segment. For further discussions of OTN, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 5. Discontinued Operations. The following amounts related to the OTN business have been segregated from continuing operations and are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented: Year ended December 31, Dollars in Millions 2006 2005 2004 Net sales $ $ 1,015 $ 2,506 Loss before income taxes (8 ) 15 Loss, net of taxes (5 ) 10 Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were approximately $4.0 billion at December 31, 2006, compared to $5.8 billion at December 31, 2005. The Company continues to maintain a sufficient level of working capital, which was approximately $3.8 billion at December 31, 2006, decreasing from $5.4 billion at December 31, 2005. As noted above, there have been recent developments in the pending patent litigation involving PLAVIX*, including the generic launch by Apotex in August 2006, which currently is subject to a preliminary injunction that has halted sales by Apotex. The trial in the underlying patent litigation ended on February 15, 2007 and the Court is expected to rule following post-trial briefing. If Apotex were to prevail at trial, the Company would expect that PLAVIX* would face renewed generic competition promptly thereafter. Subject to these risks, the Company currently believes that, in the absence of renewed or additional generic competition for PLAVIX* from other generic pharmaceutical companies, in 2007 and future periods, cash generated by its U.S. operations, together with existing cash and borrowings from the capital markets, to be sufficient to cover cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures (which the Company expects to include substantial investments in facilities to increase and maintain the Company capacity to provide biologics on a commercial scale), milestone payments and dividends paid in the U.S. Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, the conversion of other working-capital items and borrowings are expected to fund near-term operations. Under any circumstances, renewed or additional generic competition for PLAVIX* would be material to the Company sales of PLAVIX* and results of operations and cash flows, and could be material to the Company financial condition and liquidity. Additional information about the pending PLAVIX* patent litigation and the recent adverse developments is included in Item 8. Financial Statements Note 21. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies Intellectual Property PLAVIX* Litigation and Executive Summary PLAVIX* above. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company disclosed that it anticipated repatriating approximately $9 billion in special dividends in 2005 and recorded a $575 million provision for deferred income taxes pursuant to the AJCA as enacted and other pending matters. The Company repatriated approximately $6.2 billion from foreign subsidiaries in the first quarter of 2005 and repatriated the remaining balance of approximately $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005. The Company has used and expects to continue to use the special dividends in accordance with requirements established by the AJCA and the U.S. Treasury Department. 69 During the second quarter of 2005, the U.S. Treasury Department issued AJCA related guidance clarifying that the gross-up for foreign taxes associated with the special dividends also qualifies for the 5.25% tax rate established by the AJCA. As a result of this guidance, the Company reduced the $575 million provision by recording a benefit of approximately $135 million in its tax provision for 2005. Except for earnings associated with the special dividends discussed above, U.S. income taxes have not been provided on the balance of unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, since the Company has invested or expects to invest such earnings permanently offshore. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had approximately $11.3 billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which taxes have not been provided as the Company has invested or expects to invest these undistributed earnings permanently offshore. If in the future these earnings are repatriated to the U.S., or if the Company determines such earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future, additional tax provisions would be required. Due to complexities in the tax laws and the assumptions that would have to be made, it is not practicable to estimate the amounts of income taxes that would have to be provided. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2006 primarily consisted of U.S. dollar denominated bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. Marketable securities at December 31, 2006 primarily consisted of U.S. dollar denominated floating rate instruments with a AAA/aaa credit rating. Due to the nature of these instruments, the Company considers it reasonable to expect that their fair market values will not be significantly impacted by a change in interest rates, and that they can be liquidated for cash at short notice. The average interest yield on invested cash and cash equivalents was 5.2% and 4.1% at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, while interest yields on marketable securities averaged 5.3% and 4.4%, respectively. In September 2006, the Company and Sanofi each posted $200 million towards a $400 million bond with the Court as collateral in support of the preliminary injunction. The Company has pledged to the issuer of the bond collateral for its $200 million bond consisting of short-term, high quality securities. This collateral is reported as marketable securities on the Company consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006. Under the terms of the pledge agreement, the Company is entitled to receive the income generated from the marketable securities and to make certain investment strategy decisions, but is restricted from using the $200 million pledged securities for any other purpose until such time as the bond is cancelled. In December 2006, the Company completed the sale and leaseback of several administrative facilities in New Jersey for $283 million. The resulting pre-tax gain from the transaction of $154 million was deferred and will reduce future lease rental costs over the lease periods ranging from 8 to 12 years. Short-term borrowings at the end of 2006 and 2005 were $187 million and $231 million, respectively. The Company maintains cash balances and short-term investments in excess of short-term borrowings. Long-term debt was $7.2 billion at December 31, 2006 compared to $8.4 billion at December 31, 2005. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company restructured its long-term debt by retiring all of its outstanding $2.5 billion principal amount of 5.75% Notes due 2011, through a cash tender offer and subsequent redemption and issuing 500 million aggregate principal of 4.375% Notes due 2016, 500 million aggregate principal of 4.625% Notes due 2021, as well as $1.25 billion aggregate principal of 5.875% Notes due 2036. The Company incurred an aggregate pre-tax expense of approximately $220 million in connection with the early redemption of the 2011 Notes and termination of related interest rate swaps, which included the write-off of the related unamortized discount, issuance costs and deferred loss on an interest rate lock. Long-term debt at December 31, 2006 also included Japanese yen debt of 19.4 billion Yen. In December 2006, the Company replaced its prior $2 billion revolving credit facility with a new $2 billion five year revolving credit facility from a syndicate of lenders, which is extendable on the anniversary date with the consent of the lenders. This facility contains customary terms and conditions substantially similar to the prior facility, including a financial covenant whereby the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capital cannot exceed 50% at the end of each quarter. The Company has been in compliance with this covenant since the inception of this new facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2006. In August 2005, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into a new $2.5 billion term loan facility with a syndicate of lenders. Borrowings under this facility are guaranteed by the Company, the subsidiaries of the borrower and by certain European subsidiaries of the Company. This facility contains a five-year tranche of up to $2.0 billion and a two-year tranche of up to $500 million and was fully drawn at December 31, 2005. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company repaid the entire $500 million of the two-year tranche and $700 million of the five-year tranche. The Company is subject to substantially the same covenants as those included in its December 2004 Revolving Credit facility. The Company is also subject to further restrictions, including certain financial covenants. Prior to borrowing any proceeds against the facility in 2005, the Company obtained a waiver from the lenders for a covenant default under this facility due to a one-time intercompany distribution. At December 31, 2006, the Company was in full compliance with all covenants. 70 During the second quarter of 2005, the Company repurchased all of its outstanding $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount 4.75% Notes due 2006, and incurred an aggregate pre-tax loss of approximately $69 million in connection with the early redemption of the Notes and termination of related interest rate swaps. A majority of the Company debt is fixed rate. The Company, however, has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps for $3.9 billion of its long-term debt, including 1 billion Euro. Interest expense, net of interest swap gains, was $498 million, $349 million, and $310 million, in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in interest expense in 2006 from 2005 and in 2005 from 2004 was primarily due to higher interest rates. The Moody Investors Service (Moody s) long-term and short-term credit ratings for the Company are currently A2 and Prime-1, respectively, following a downgrade of the long-term credit rating during the third quarter of 2006 from A1. Moody long-term credit rating was amended from negative outlook to stable outlook in the third quarter of 2006. Standard & Poor (S&P) long-term and short-term credit ratings for the Company are currently A+ and A-1, respectively. S&P long-term credit rating remains on negative outlook. Fitch Ratings (Fitch) long-term and short-term credit ratings for the Company are currently A+ and F1, respectively. Fitch has placed the Company on Rating Watch Negative . The following is a discussion of working capital: December 31, Dollars in Millions 2006 2005 Working capital $ 3,806 $ 5,393 The decrease in working capital of $1,587 million from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2006 was impacted by: Decrease in cash and marketable securities primarily due to the repayment of long-tem debt. Lower receivables primarily due to lower PLAVIX* sales and the loss of exclusivity of PRAVACHOL, mostly offset by higher receivables due from alliance partners. Increase in inventories to support growth drivers and recently launched products, mostly offset by a reduction of PRAVACHOL inventory resulting from loss of exclusivity. Reduction in deferred tax assets in 2006 primarily due to litigation settlement payments. Lower accounts payable due to lower purchases of PRAVACHOL raw materials. Increase in deferred income resulting from higher deferred alliance revenue. Lower accrued rebates and returns primarily due to exclusivity loss of PRAVACHOL, volume erosion on highly rebated PARAPLATIN and TAXOL (paclitaxel) and lower PLAVIX* volumes, partially offset by higher sales returns. The following is a discussion of cash flow activities: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions 2006 2005 2004 Cash flow provided by/(used in): Operating activities $ 2,083 $ 1,836 $ 3,176 Investing activities 206 1,191 (1,622 ) Financing activities (3,351 ) (3,637 ) (463 ) Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.1 billion in 2006 and $1.8 billion in 2005. The $247 million increase in 2006 compared to 2005 is mainly attributable to significant changes in adjustments to net earnings of $1,398 million and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $264 million, offset by lower net earnings of $1,415 million. Significant positive changes in adjustments to net earnings in 2006 compared to 2005, of $1,398 million, mainly included: A $576 million positive cash flow variance in the deferred income tax expense/(benefit) due to a lower level of increase in deferred tax benefit in 2006 compared to 2005. In 2006, there was an increase in deferred tax benefits associated with U.S. research and development, foreign tax credits and an increase in litigation reserves. In 2005, there was an increase in deferred tax benefits associated with the reversal of the tax liability related to the repatriation of special dividends under the AJCA. A $425 million positive cash flow variance due to lower gain on sale of a product asset in 2006 as compared to sale of a business in 2005. A $143 million positive cash flow variance for deferred income recognized related to the termination of the muraglitazar collaborative agreement in 2005. 71 Net positive changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2006 compared to 2005, of $264 million, mainly included: A $329 million negative cash flow variance from receivables. In 2006, the increase in cash flow was driven by increases in receivables due from alliance partners, which were partially offset by lower trade receivable volume. In 2005, the increase in cash flow is driven by the collection of foreign withholding taxes and from alliance partners. A $448 million positive cash flow variance from inventories primarily due to an increase in inventories in 2005 resulting from the growth of newer products and in anticipation of new product launches, and the reduction in inventories in 2006 resulting from PRAVACHOL exclusivity loss. A $283 million negative cash flow variance in litigation primarily due to settlement payments of $339 million in 2006 for the DPA and the Vanlev litigation, which were partially offset by unrelated insurance recoveries of $67 million. A $443 million positive cash flow variance from income taxes payable primarily related to payments in 2005 for the settlement of examinations by the IRS for years 1998 through 2001 and the repatriation of special dividends under AJCA. Net cash provided by investing activities was $206 million in 2006 compared to net cash provided of $1,191 million in 2005. The $985 million negative cash flow variance is primarily attributable to: A $281 million negative cash flow variance mainly from the sale of marketable securities in 2005. A $617 million negative cash flow variance from lower proceeds for the sale of a product asset in 2006 compared to the sale of the Consumer Medicines and OTN businesses in 2005. A $280 million negative cash flow variance from milestone payments in 2006 primarily related to ImClone. A $281 million positive cash flow variance for proceeds from the disposal of properties in connection with a sale and lease back transaction in 2006. Net cash used in financing activities was $3,351 million in 2006 compared to $3,637 million in 2005. The $286 million positive cash flow variance was mainly attributable to: A $1,655 million positive cash flow variance from the repayment of short-term borrowings in 2005. A $1,198 negative cash flow variance from the retirement of long-term debt. In 2006, the Company repaid debt of $1,200 million and retired the 5.75% Notes due 2011 for $2,425 million. In 2005, the Company retired the 4.75% Notes due 2006 for $2,507 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion in 2005 and $3.2 billion in 2004. The $1,340 million decrease in 2005 compared to 2004 is mainly attributable to significant changes in adjustments to net earnings of $1,648 million and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $304 million, offset by higher net earnings of $612 million. Significant negative changes in adjustments to net earnings in 2005 compared to 2004, of $1,648 million, mainly included: A $1,090 million negative cash flow variance due primarily to the reversal of the $575 million AJCA deferred tax provision recorded in 2004. A $151 million negative cash flow variance due to lower litigation settlement expenses in 2006. A $312 million negative cash flow variance due to a higher gain on sale of businesses in 2005 as compared to 2004. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2005 compared to 2004, of $304 million, mainly included: A $1,095 million positive cash flow variance from receivables. The increase in cash flow from receivables is driven by lower sales volume in 2005 and an increase in foreign withholding taxes receivable in 2004. A $511 million positive cash flow variance primarily due to lower litigation settlement payments as well as insurance recoveries in 2005. A $626 million negative cash flow variance from accounts payable and accrued expenses primarily due to vendor payments prior to the sale of the OTN business in 2005 and lower accrued rebates and returns in 2005 as compared to 2004. A $762 million negative cash flow variance from income taxes payable primarily related to payments in 2005 for the settlement of examinations by the IRS for years 1998 through 2001 and the repatriation of special dividends under AJCA. Net cash provided by investing activities was $1,191 million in 2005 compared to net cash used of $1,622 million in 2004. The $2,813 million positive cash flow variance is primarily attributable to: A $1,822 million positive cash flow variance mainly from the sale of marketable securities in 2005 compared with purchases in 2004. A $479 million positive cash flow variance from higher proceeds from the sale of the Consumer Medicines and OTN businesses in 2005 compared with the sale of the Adult Nutritionals business in 2004. A $250 million positive cash flow variance due to a milestone payment in 2004 to ImClone. A $150 million positive cash flow variance due to the purchase of Acordis Specialty Fibres in 2004. 72 Net cash used in financing activities was $3,637 million in 2005 compared to $463 million in 2004. The $3,174 million negative cash flow variance was mainly attributable to: A $3,183 million negative cash flow variance from the retirement of commercial paper in 2005 compared to purchases in 2004. A $2,500 million negative cash flow variance due to the 2005 repurchase of the $2.5 billion 4.75% Notes due 2006. A $2,500 million positive cash flow variance from proceeds from borrowings against the new term loan facility in 2005. Cash provided from operations and borrowings were primarily used over the past three years to pay dividends of approximately $6.6 billion. The Company has also invested approximately $2.2 billion over the past three years in capital expansion to improve plant efficiency and maintain superior research facilities. Over the past three years, the Company did not repurchase any of its common stock. The total shares acquired since the share repurchase program inception is 372 million shares. The share repurchase program authorizes the Company to purchase common stock from time to time in the open market or through private transactions as market conditions permit. This program is intended to reduce the increase in shares outstanding from option exercises and to obtain shares for general corporate purposes. Dividends declared per common share were $1.12 for each of 2006, 2005 and 2004. In December 2006, the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $.28 per common share and indicated a dividend for the full year 2007 of $1.12 per share. Dividend decisions are made on a quarterly basis by the Company Board of Directors. The Company financial condition and liquidity could be affected by obligations to make milestone or other one-time payments and by the outcome of pending litigations and investigations, including the challenge to the PLAVIX* patent and/or the potential for renewed or additional generic competition for PLAVIX*. For more information, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 2. Alliances and Investments and Note 21. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Contractual Obligations Payments due by period for the Company contractual obligations at December 31, 2006, are as follows: Obligations Expiring by Period Dollars in Millions Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Later Years Short-term borrowings $ 187 $ 187 $ $ $ $ $ Long-term debt (1) 7,248 1,735 1,329 4,184 Operating leases 714 141 120 97 70 63 223 Purchase obligations 2,728 505 464 412 399 382 566 Stand-by letters of credit/performance guarantees 165 105 48 1 11 Pension and other liabilities 1,589 135 196 153 150 147 808 Total $ 12,631 $ 1,073 $ 2,563 $ 663 $ 1,948 $ 592 $ 5,792 (1) The current portion of long-term debt obligations is included in short-term borrowings on the Company consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006 and all balances approximate the outstanding nominal long-term debt values. The contractual obligations table above excludes interest payment obligations. The Company convertible debenture is included as due for payment in 2008, as it contains a 2008 put and call feature. In addition to the above, the Company has committed to make potential future milestone payments to third-parties as part of in-licensing and development programs. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on the Company consolidated balance sheet. For a discussion of contractual obligations, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 14. Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt; Note 17. Financial Instruments; Note 19. Leases; and Note 20. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans. SEC Consent Order and Deferred Prosecution Agreement As previously disclosed, on August 4, 2004, the Company entered into a final settlement with the SEC, concluding an investigation concerning certain wholesaler inventory and accounting matters. The settlement was reached through a Consent, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 10 to the Company quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2004. Under the terms of the Consent, the Company agreed, subject to certain defined exceptions, to limit sales of all products sold to its direct customers (including wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, retail outlets, pharmacies and government purchasers) based on expected demand or on amounts that do not exceed approximately one month of inventory on hand, without making a timely public 73 disclosure of any change in practice. The Company also agreed in the Consent to certain measures that it has implemented including: (a) establishing a formal review and certification process of its annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC; (b) establishing a business risk and disclosure group; (c) retaining an outside consultant to comprehensively study and help re-engineer the Company accounting and financial reporting processes; (d) publicly disclosing any sales incentives offered to direct customers for the purpose of inducing them to purchase products in excess of expected demand; and (e) ensuring that the Company budget process gives appropriate weight to inputs that come from the bottom to the top, and not just those that come from the top to the bottom, and adequately documenting that process. Further, the Company agreed in the Consent to retain an Independent Advisor through the date that the Company Form 10-K for the year ended 2005 was filed with the SEC. The Independent Advisor continues to serve as the Monitor under the DPA discussed below. As previously disclosed, on June 15, 2005, the Company entered into a DPA with the USAO for the District of New Jersey resolving the investigation by the USAO of the Company relating to wholesaler inventory and various accounting matters covered by the Company settlement with the SEC. Pursuant to the DPA, the USAO filed a criminal complaint against the Company alleging conspiracy to commit securities fraud, but will defer prosecution of the Company and dismiss the complaint after two years if the Company satisfies all of the requirements of the DPA. A copy of the DPA was filed as Exhibit 99.2 to a Form 8-K filed by the Company on June 16, 2005 and is incorporated by reference hereto as Exhibit 10w to the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. Under the DPA, among other things, the Company agreed to include in its Forms 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC and in its annual report to shareholders the following information: (a) estimated wholesaler/direct customer inventory levels of the top fifteen (15) products sold by the U.S. Pharmaceuticals business; (b) for major non-U.S. countries, estimated aggregate wholesaler/direct-customer inventory levels of the top fifteen (15) pharmaceutical products sold in such countries taken as a whole measured by aggregate annual sales in such countries; (c) arrangements with and policies concerning wholesaler/direct customers and other distributors for these products, including efforts by the Company to control and monitor wholesaler/distributor inventory levels; and (d) data concerning prescriptions or other measures of end-user demand for these products. Pursuant to the DPA, the Company also agreed to include in such filings and reports information on acquisition, divestiture, and restructuring reserve policies and activity, and rebate accrual policies and activity. The Company also agreed to implement remedial measures already undertaken or mandated in the Consent and in the settlements of the derivative litigation and the Federal securities class action relating to wholesaler inventory and various accounting matters. In addition, the Company agreed to undertake additional remedial actions, corporate reforms and other actions, including: (a) appointing an additional non-executive Director acceptable to the USAO; (b) establishing and maintaining a training and education program on topics that include corporate citizenship and financial reporting obligations; (c) making an additional $300 million payment into the shareholder compensation fund established in connection with the Consent; (d) not engaging in or attempting to engage in any criminal conduct as that term is defined in the DPA; (e) continuing to cooperate with the USAO, including with respect to the ongoing investigation regarding individual current and former employees of the Company; and (f) retaining a Monitor. Also as part of the DPA, the Board separated the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Company and on June 15, 2005, elected a Non-Executive Chairman. As noted above under the DPA, the Company agreed to not engage or attempt to engage in criminal conduct. Criminal conduct is defined under the DPA as a) any crime related to the Company business activities committed by one or more executive officers or directors; b) securities fraud, accounting fraud, financial fraud or other business fraud materially affecting the books and records of publicly filed reports of the Company, and c) obstruction of justice. The USAO, in its discretion, may prosecute the Company for any Federal crimes for which the USAO has knowledge, including the matters that were the subject of the criminal complaint referenced above, should the USAO determine that the Company committed any criminal conduct. The Monitor has defined powers and responsibilities under the DPA, including the responsibility at least until April 2007 to oversee the Company compliance with all of the terms of the DPA, the Consent and the settlements of the derivative action and the Federal securities class action. The Monitor has the authority to require the Company to take any steps he believes necessary to comply with the terms of the DPA and the Company is required to adopt all recommendations made by the Monitor, unless the Company objects to the recommendation and the USAO agrees that adoption of the recommendation should not be required. In addition, the Monitor reports to the USAO, on at least a quarterly basis, as to the Company compliance with the DPA and the implementation and effectiveness of the internal controls, financial reporting, disclosure processes and related compliance functions of the Company. On September 12, 2006, the Board announced that the Company then current CEO and General Counsel would be leaving their respective positions effective immediately. The announcement took place after the Board received and considered reports from the Company outside counsel on issues relating to the PLAVIX* patent litigation with Apotex and a preliminary recommendation from the Monitor to terminate the employment of such individuals. The Monitor recommendation 74 followed an investigation initiated by the USAO, conducted by the Monitor and the USAO, into corporate governance issues relating to the Company negotiations on a proposed settlement with Apotex. The Company had been advised by the Monitor and the USAO that the investigation did not involve matters that are the subject of the ongoing investigation by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice into the PLAVIX* settlement agreement. At the time the Monitor made his preliminary recommendation, the Monitor and the USAO also advised the Company that they had not found a violation of the DPA or any unlawful conduct by the Company or its employees. The investigation included a review of whether there was any violation of Federal securities laws in connection with the proposed settlement with Apotex under the terms of the SEC Consent. The Monitor has completed his investigation and submitted his report on the investigation to the USAO. The Monitor report did not find any violation of the Consent or the Federal securities laws in connection with the proposed settlement. The Monitor concluded that the Company had violated certain paragraphs of the DPA related to governance matters. The violations cited by the Monitor in his report relate, among other things, to communication failures, including insufficient communications, by the Company former CEO and former General Counsel with the Board and with other members of senior management, as well as failure to comply with certain internal Company policies and procedures. The Monitor did not make any findings with respect to whether the Company knowingly and materially breached the DPA or make any recommendations. The USAO has advised the Company that he believes the matters cited in the Monitor report have been fully remediated and, accordingly, that he does not intend to take any action under the DPA with respect to the Monitor report. For additional information on the pending PLAVIX* patent litigation and the Antitrust Division investigation, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 21. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. The Company has established a company-wide policy to limit its sales to direct customers for the purpose of complying with the Consent. This policy includes the adoption of various procedures to monitor and limit sales to direct customers in accordance with the terms of the Consent. These procedures include a governance process to escalate to appropriate management levels potential questions or concerns regarding compliance with the policy and timely resolution of such questions or concerns. In addition, compliance with the policy is monitored on a regular basis. The Company maintains IMAs with most of its U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers that account for nearly 100% of total gross sales of U.S. pharmaceutical products. Under the current terms of the IMAs, the Company three largest wholesaler customers provide the Company with weekly information with respect to months on hand product level inventories and the amount of out-movement of products. These three wholesalers currently account for 90% of total gross sales of U.S. pharmaceutical products in 2006, 2005 and 2004. The inventory information received from these wholesalers, together with the Company internal information, is used to estimate months on hand product level inventories at these wholesalers. The Company estimates months on hand product inventory levels for its U.S. Pharmaceutical business wholesaler customers other than the three largest wholesalers by extrapolating from the months on hand calculated for the three largest wholesalers. The Company considers whether any adjustments are necessary to these extrapolated amounts based on such factors as historical sales of individual products made to such other wholesalers and third-party market research data related to prescription trends and patient demand. In contrast, for the Company Pharmaceutical business outside of the U.S., Nutritionals and Other Health Care business units around the world, the Company has significantly more direct customers, limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information, where available, varies widely. Accordingly, the Company relies on a variety of methods to estimate months on hand product level inventories for these business units. The Company discloses for each of its top fifteen (15) pharmaceutical products (based on 2005 net sales) and pharmaceutical products that the Company views as current and future growth drivers sold by the U.S. Pharmaceuticals business the amount of net sales and the estimated number of months on hand in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel as of the end of the immediately preceding quarter and as of the end of the applicable quarter as well as corresponding information for the prior year in its quarterly and annual reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K. The Company discloses corresponding information for the top fifteen pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical products that the Company views as current and future growth drivers sold within its major non-U.S. countries, as described above. For all other business units, the Company discloses on a quarterly basis the key product level inventories. The information required to estimate months on hand product level inventories in the direct customer distribution for the non-U.S. Pharmaceuticals businesses is not available prior to the filing of the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for an applicable quarter. Accordingly, the Company discloses this information on its website approximately 60 days after the end of the applicable quarter and furnishes it on Form 8-K, and in the Company Form 10-Q for the following quarter. In addition to the foregoing quarterly disclosure, the Company will include all the foregoing information for all business units for the immediately preceding quarter and of the applicable quarter as well as corresponding information for the prior year in its Annual Report on Form 10-K. For products not described above, if the inventory at direct customers exceeds approximately one month on hand, the Company will disclose the estimated months on hand for such product(s), except where the impact on the Company is de minimis. The Company has enhanced and will continue to seek to enhance its methods to estimate months on hand product inventory levels for the U.S. Pharmaceuticals business and for the non-U.S. Pharmaceuticals businesses around the world, taking into account the complexities described above. The Company also has taken and will continue to take steps to expedite the receipt and processing of data for the non-U.S. Pharmaceuticals businesses. The Company believes the above-described procedures provide a reasonable basis to ensure compliance with both the Consent and the DPA and provides sufficient information to comply with disclosure requirements of both. Recently Issued Accounting Standards The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Shared-Based Payment, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes the 75 Company previous accounting under APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees , for periods beginning January 1, 2006. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107, Share-Based Payment relating to SFAS No. 123(R). The Company has applied the provisions of SAB No. 107 in its adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method, which requires the application of the accounting standard as of January 1, 2006, and has elected the alternative method as provided in FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. 123(R)-3 Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share - Based Payment Awards, in determining the Company pool of excess tax benefits. The Company consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect the impact of SFAS No. 123(R). In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, the Company consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of SFAS No. 123(R). Stock-based compensation expense recognized under SFAS No. 123(R) for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $112 million ($73 million, net of tax) or $0.04 per share, with a corresponding amount recorded in additional paid-in capital within stockholders equity. Additionally, $10 million related to performance awards was reclassified from liabilities to stockholders equity in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities , which permits an entity to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. The objective of SFAS No. 159 is to improve financial reporting by allowing entities to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by the measurement of related assets and liabilities using different attributes, without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. Under SFAS No. 159, entities that elect the fair value option (by instrument) will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The fair value option election is irrevocable, unless a new election date occurs. SFAS No. 159 establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to help financial statement users understand the effect of the entity election on its earnings, but does not eliminate disclosure requirements of other accounting standards. Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value must be displayed on the face of the balance sheet. This Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is evaluating this pronouncement. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) . This pronouncement requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan (other than a multiemployer plan) as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income of a business entity. This pronouncement also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year-end statement of financial position, with limited exceptions. The pronouncement does not require prior periods to be restated to reflect the impact of SFAS No. 158. The Company adopted SFAS No. 158 in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 and the adoption of this accounting pronouncement resulted in a $1,064 million reduction of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity, a $767 million reduction in total assets and a $297 million increase in total liabilities. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 did not impact the Company results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements . This pronouncement defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement is not expected to have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108 Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying the Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements that expresses the staff views regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements. This bulletin is effective for any interim period of the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. SAB No. 108 requires that companies utilize a dual approach to assess the quantitative effects of financial statement misstatements. The dual approach includes both an income statement focus and balance sheet focus assessment. The adoption of this bulletin did not have any effect on the Company consolidated financial statements. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 which, in the case of the Company, is effective as of January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes . FIN No. 48 requires that all tax positions be evaluated using a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements are recorded as adjustments to income taxes payable or receivable, or adjustments to deferred taxes, or both. FIN No. 48 also requires expanded disclosure at the end of each annual reporting period including a tabular reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits. In accordance with FIN No. 48, the Company will report the difference between the net amount of assets and liabilities recognized in the statement of financial position prior to and after the application of FIN No. 48 as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement is not expected to have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial statements. In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 . This pronouncement relates to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. This Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement is not expected to have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial statements. In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140 . This pronouncement primarily resolves certain issues addressed in the implementation of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , concerning beneficial interests in securitized financial assets. The Statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired, issued, or subject to a remeasurement event occurring after the beginning of the 2007 fiscal year. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement is not expected to have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial statements. 76 In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections , which replaces APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements . This pronouncement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle, and revises the requirements for accounting for and reporting a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to do so. This pronouncement also requires that a change in the method of depreciation, amortization, or depletion for long-lived, non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is affected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The Statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements, including those that are in a transition phase as of the effective date of SFAS No. 154. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement did not have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial statements. In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations . FIN No. 47 clarifies that an entity must record a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. Asset retirement obligations covered by FIN No. 47 are those for which an entity has a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity, even if the timing and method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN No. 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement did not have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP No. 109-1 Application of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 . FSP No. 109-1 provides that the Deduction on Qualified Production Activities will be treated as a special deduction as described in SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes . Accordingly, the tax effect of this deduction was reported as a component of the Company tax provision and did not have an effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities. On May 24, 2006, the IRS issued Final Tax Regulations (FTR) with respect to the Deduction on Qualified Production Activities under Section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code. The final regulations are effective for taxable years beginning on or after June 1, 2006. The adoption of the FTR and FSP No. 109-1 did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets . The provisions of this Statement are effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The provisions of this Statement should be applied prospectively, and eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph 21(b) of APB No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions , and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement did not have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 . The pronouncement requires abnormal amounts of idle facility and related expenses to be recognized as current period charges and also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement did not have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies The Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, including disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the Company financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in their application, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Because of the uncertainty of factors surrounding the estimates or judgments used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, actual results may vary from these estimates. The Company believes that the following discussion represents its critical accounting policies. Management has discussed the Company critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 77 Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements , as amended by SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition . The Company accounting policy for revenue recognition has a substantial impact on its reported results and relies on certain estimates that require difficult, subjective and complex judgments on the part of management. The Company recognizes revenue when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer, which generally occurs on the date of shipment, with the exceptions described below. In previous years, certain transactions with the Company U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers were accounted for using the consignment model. In the case of sales made to wholesalers (1) as a result of incentives, (2) in excess of the wholesaler ordinary course of business inventory level, (3) at a time when there was an understanding, agreement, course of dealing or consistent business practice that the Company would extend incentives based on levels of excess inventory in connection with future purchases, and (4) at a time when such incentives would cover substantially all, and vary directly with, the wholesaler cost of carrying inventory in excess of the wholesaler ordinary course of business inventory level, substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership did not transfer upon shipment, and accordingly, such sales were accounted for using the consignment model. The determination of when, if at all, sales to a wholesaler meet the foregoing criteria involves evaluation of a variety of factors and a number of complex judgments. Under the consignment model, the Company does not recognize revenue upon shipment of product. Rather, upon shipment of product, the Company invoices the wholesaler, records deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price, and classifies the inventory held by the wholesalers as consignment inventory at the Company cost of such inventory. The Company recognizes revenue (net of the gross to net sales adjustments discussed below, all of which involve significant estimates and judgments) when the consignment inventory is no longer subject to incentive arrangements, but not later than when such inventory is sold through to the wholesalers customers, on a first-in first-out basis (FIFO). In the case of new products for which the product introduction is not an extension of an existing line of product, where the Company determines that there are not products in a similar therapeutic category, or where the Company determines the new product has dissimilar characteristics with existing products, such that the Company cannot reliably estimate expected returns of the new product, the Company defers recognition of revenue until the right of return no longer exists or until the Company has developed sufficient historical experience to estimate sales returns. For discussions on revenue recognition, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition and Sales Rebate and Return Accruals. Gross-to-Net Sales Adjustments The Company has the following significant categories of gross-to-net sales adjustments: prime vendor charge-backs, WIC rebates, managed health care rebates and other contract discounts, Medicaid rebates, cash discounts, sales returns, and other adjustments, all of which involve significant estimates and judgments and require the Company to use information from external sources. The Company accounts for these gross-to-net sales adjustments in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 01-9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor Products) , and SFAS No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists, as applicable. See Net Sales section above for a reconciliation of the Company gross sales to net sales by each significant category of gross-to-net sales adjustment. Prime vendor charge-backs The Company U.S. businesses participate in prime vendor programs with government entities, the most significant of which are the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and other parties whereby pricing on products is extended below wholesaler list price to participating entities. These entities purchase products through wholesalers at the lower prime vendor price and the wholesalers charge the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower prime vendor price back to the Company. The Company accounts for prime vendor charge-backs by reducing accounts receivable in an amount equal to the Company estimate of charge-back claims attributable to a sale. The Company determines its estimate of the prime vendor charge-backs primarily based on historical experience regarding prime vendor charge-backs and current contract prices under the prime vendor programs. The Company considers prime vendor payments, levels of inventory in the distribution channel, and the Company claim processing time lag and adjusts the reduction to accounts receivable periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. WIC rebates The Company U.S. Nutritionals business participates on a competitive bidding basis in nutrition programs sponsored by states, tribal governments, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. territories for WIC. Under these programs, the Company reimburses these entities for the difference between wholesaler list price and the contract price on eligible products. The Company accounts for WIC rebates by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to the Company estimate of WIC rebate claims attributable to a sale. The Company determines its estimate of the WIC rebate accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding WIC rebates and current contract prices under the WIC programs. The Company considers levels of inventory in the distribution channel, new WIC contracts, terminated WIC contracts, changes in existing WIC contracts, and WIC participation and adjusts the accrual periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. 78 Managed health care rebates and other contract discounts The Company offers rebates and discounts to managed health care organizations in the U.S. which manage prescription drug programs and Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans covering the Medicare Part D drug benefit in addition to their commercial plans, as well as globally to other contract counterparties such as hospitals and group purchasing organizations. The Company accounts for managed health care rebates and other contract discounts by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to the Company estimate of managed health care rebates and other contract discounts attributable to a sale. The Company determines its estimate of the managed health care rebates and other contract discounts accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding these rebates and discounts and current contract prices. The Company considers the sales performance of products subject to managed health care rebates and other contract discounts and levels of inventory in the distribution channel and adjusts the accrual periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. Medicaid rebates The Company U.S. businesses participate in state government-managed Medicaid programs as well as certain other qualifying Federal and state government programs whereby discounts and rebates are provided to participating state and local government entities. Discounts and rebates provided through these latter programs are included in the Company Medicaid rebate accrual and are considered Medicaid rebates for the purposes of this discussion. The Company accounts for Medicaid rebates by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to the Company estimate of Medicaid rebate claims attributable to a sale. The Company determines its estimate of the Medicaid rebates accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding Medicaid rebates, as well as any expansion on a prospective basis of its participation in the non-mandatory aspects of the qualifying Federal and state government programs, legal interpretations of applicable laws related to Medicaid and qualifying Federal and state government programs, and any new information regarding changes in the Medicaid programs regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the rebates. The Company considers outstanding Medicaid claims, Medicaid payments, and levels of inventory in the distribution channel and adjusts the accrual periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. Cash discounts In the U.S. and certain other countries, the Company offers cash discounts, approximating 2% of the sales price, as an incentive for prompt payment. The Company accounts for cash discounts by reducing accounts receivable by the full amount of the discounts. The Company considers payment performance and adjusts the accrual to reflect actual experience. Sales returns The Company accounts for sales returns in accordance with SFAS No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists , by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to the Company estimate of sales recorded for which the related products are expected to be returned. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, the provision for sales returns was $230 million, $164 million and $276 million, respectively, or 1% of gross sales for each of the three years. For returns of established products, the Company determines its estimate of the sales return accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding sales returns, but also considers other factors that could impact sales returns. These factors include levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product recalls, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, introductions of generic products and introductions of competitive new products. The Company considers all of these factors and adjusts the accrual periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. The Company considers the level of inventory in the distribution channel and determines whether it believes an adjustment to the sales return accrual is appropriate. The Company adjusts the sales return accrual based on historical experience, the Company returned goods policy, the shelf life of the Company products, and life cycle of the product levels of inventory in the distribution channel. The Company considers introductions of generic products and factors the impact into the sales returns calculation based on historical experience and the Company returned goods policy. In the event of a product recall or product discontinuance, the Company considers the reasons for and impact of such actions and adjusts the sales return accrual as appropriate, taking into account historical experience, estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and, for product discontinuances, estimates of continuing demand. Sales returns accruals from new products are estimated and primarily based on the historical sales returns experience of similar products, such as those within the same line of product or those within the same or similar therapeutic category. In limited circumstances, where the new product is not an extension of an existing line of product or where the Company has no historical 79 experience with products in a similar therapeutic category, such that the Company cannot reliably estimate expected returns of the new product, the Company defers recognition of revenue until the right of return no longer exists or until the Company has developed sufficient historical experience to estimate sales returns. The Company also considers the shelf life of new products and determines whether it believes an adjustment to the sales return accrual is appropriate. The shelf life in connection with new products tends to be shorter than the shelf life for more established products because the Company may still be developing an optimal manufacturing process for the new product that would lengthen its shelf life. In addition, higher launch quantities may have been manufactured in advance of the launch date to ensure sufficient supply exists to satisfy market demand. In those cases, the Company assesses the reduced shelf life, together with estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and projected demand, and determines whether it believes an adjustment to the sales return accrual is appropriate. Other adjustments In addition to the gross-to-net sales adjustments described above, the Company makes other gross-to-net sales adjustments. For example, the Company offers sales discounts, most significantly in its non-U.S. businesses, and also offers consumer coupons and rebates, most significantly in its U.S. Nutritionals and Pharmaceuticals business. In addition, in a number of countries outside the U.S., including major European countries, the Company provides rebates to government entities. The Company generally accounts for these other gross-to-net adjustments by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to the Company estimate of the adjustments attributable to a sale. The Company generally determines its estimates of the accruals for these other gross-to-net sales adjustments primarily based on historical experience, performance on commitments to government entities and other relevant factors, including estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel, and adjusts the accruals periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. Use of information from external sources The Company uses information from external sources to estimate its gross-to-net sales adjustments. The Company estimates of inventory at the wholesalers and deferred revenue on consigned inventory are based on the projected prescription demand-based sales for its products and historical inventory experience, as well as the Company analysis of third-party information, including written and oral information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and sell-through to customers and third-party market research data, and the Company internal information. The inventory information received from wholesalers is a product of their record-keeping process and excludes inventory held by intermediaries to whom they sell, such as retailers and hospitals. The Company receives information from IMS, a supplier of market research to the pharmaceutical industry, which it uses to project the prescription demand-based sales for many of its U.S. Pharmaceutical products. The Company has historically reported estimated total U.S. prescription growth and estimated therapeutic category share based on NPA data, which IMS made available to the public on a subscription basis, and a simple average of the estimated number of prescriptions in the retail and mail order channels. In the third quarter of 2005, the Company began disclosing estimated total U.S. prescription growth and estimated therapeutic category share based on both NPA and NGPS version 1.0 data. NGPS version 1.0 data was collected by IMS under a new, revised methodology and was released by IMS on a limited basis through a pilot program. IMS has announced that NGPS version 2.0 data is available to the public on a subscription basis starting in January 2007 and legacy NPA and NGPS version 1.0 will be discontinued. The Company believes that the NGPS data provided by IMS provides a superior estimate of prescription data for the Company products in the retail and mail order channels. The Company has calculated the estimated total U.S. prescription growth and the estimated therapeutic category share based on NGPS data on a weighted average basis to reflect the fact that mail order prescriptions include a greater volume of product supplied compared with retail prescriptions. The Company believes that calculation of the estimated total U.S. prescription growth and the estimated therapeutic category share based on the NGPS data and the weighted average approach with respect to the retail and mail order channels provide a superior estimate of total prescription demand. The Company now uses this methodology for its internal demand forecasts. The Company also uses information from external sources to identify prescription trends, patient demand and average selling prices. The Company estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third-party information, as certain third-party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations including lags between the date as of which third-party information is generated and the date on which the Company receives third-party information. Retirement Benefits The Company pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations required by SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions , and SFAS No. 106 , Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions . The Company considers accounting for retirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, salary growth, long-term return on plan assets, retirement, turnover, health care cost trend rates, and mortality rates. Depending on the assumptions and estimates used, the pension and postretirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. In addition, the assumptions can materially affect projected benefit obligations and future cash funding. The Company adopted SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 and the adoption of this 80 accounting pronouncement resulted in a $1,064 million reduction of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholder equity, a $767 million reduction in total assets and a $297 million increase in total liabilities. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 did not impact the Company results of operations or cash flows. Plan Description The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans, and termination indemnity plans for regular full-time employees. The principal defined benefit pension plan is the Bristol-Myers Squibb Retirement Income Plan and the principal defined contribution plan is the Bristol-Myers Squibb Savings and Investment Program. Approximately 80% of total Company defined benefit pension plan assets and liabilities are held in U.S. plans. The assets for the U.S. plans are held in a single trust with a common asset allocation. Unless specified otherwise, the references in this section are to total Company plans (i.e., U.S. plans together with international plans). Benefits under the Company defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of credited service and on participants compensation. Assets under the Company defined benefit plans consist primarily of equity and fixed-income securities. At December 31, 2006, the fair market value of plan assets for the Company defined benefit plans increased to $5,658 million from $5,017 million at December 31, 2005. For the U.S. plans, assets were allocated 69% to equity securities (compared to 68% at the end of 2005), 23% to fixed income securities (compared to 25% at the end of 2005) and 8% to private equity and other investments (compared to 7% at the end of 2005). Bristol-Myers Squibb common stock represented less than 1% of assets for the U.S. plans at the end of 2006 and 2005. The Company provides comprehensive medical and group life benefits for substantially all U.S. retirees who elect to participate in the Company comprehensive medical and group life plans. The asset allocation for these postretirement plans is identical to the asset allocation described above for the U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Accrual Accounting and Significant Assumptions Consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 87, the Company accounts for pension benefits using the accrual method, recognizing pension expense before the payment of benefits to retirees. The accrual method of accounting for pension benefits necessarily requires actuarial assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit payments. The Company key assumptions used in calculating its cost of pension benefits are the discount rate, the rate of compensation increase, and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The Company, in consultation with its actuaries, evaluates the key actuarial assumptions and other assumptions used in calculating its cost of pension benefits, such as retirement, turnover and mortality rates, based on expectations or actual experience, as appropriate, and determines such assumptions on December 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension expense for the following year. Depending on the assumptions used, the pension expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. In addition, the assumptions can materially affect projected benefit obligations and future cash funding. Actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors. In determining the discount rate, the Company uses the yield on high quality corporate bonds that coincides with the cash flows of its plans estimated payouts. The Citigroup Above Median yield curve is used in determining the discount rate for the U.S. plans. The assumed rate of compensation increase used by the Company for determining future pension obligations reflects an estimate of the change in actual future compensation levels due to general price levels, productivity, seniority and other factors. In 2006, net pension expense for the Company defined benefit pension plans included in earnings before minority interest and income taxes was $332 million compared to $392 million in 2005. The U.S. plans pension expense for 2006 was determined using a 5.75% assumed discount rate and a 3.56% assumed rate of compensation increase. The present value of benefit obligations at December 31, 2006 for the U.S. plans was determined using a 6.00% assumed discount rate and a 3.56% assumed rate of compensation increase. If the assumed discount rate used in determining the U.S. plans pension expense for 2006 had been reduced by 0.25%, such expense would have increased by approximately $18 million. If the assumed rate of compensation increase used in determining the U.S. plans, pension expense for 2006 had been reduced by 0.25%, such expense would have decreased by approximately $9 million. If the assumed discount rate used in determining the accumulated benefit obligation at December 31, 2006 had been reduced by 0.25%, the accumulated benefit obligation would have increased by $123 million. 81 The U.S. plans pension expense for 2006 was determined using an 8.75% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining the U.S. plans, pension expense for 2006 had been reduced by 1%, such expense would have increased by $38 million. Actual rates of return earned on U.S. plan assets for each of the last 10 years were as follows: Year Return Year Return 2006 14.9 % 2001 (6.1 )% 2005 9.8 % 2000 3.5 % 2004 12.6 % 1999 18.2 % 2003 25.0 % 1998 13.3 % 2002 (13.4 )% 1997 22.2 % At December 31, 2006, the Company increased its assumed discount rate for U.S. plans from 5.75% to 6.00% and maintained its assumed rate of compensation increase at 3.56%. Compensation is assumed to increase on a scale with different rates for different ages. The 3.56% rate disclosed at December 31, 2006 is the single rate, which, if used at each age, would produce the same present value of benefit obligations. The Company maintained the expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets at 8.75% for 2007. The Company expects that the net pension expense for its defined benefit pension plans included in earnings before minority interest and income taxes will be approximately $25 million lower in 2007 than the $332 million in 2006, reflecting primarily the positive delayed impact of the favorable 2004-2006 investment returns. The Company has used the same assumed discount rates and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets in calculating its cost of pension benefits and its cost of other postretirement benefits for U.S. plans except in the case of the discount rates at December 31, 2006 and 2005. Rates of 6.00% and 5.75%, respectively, were used for pension benefits versus 5.75% and 5.50%, respectively, for other postretirement benefits to reflect the shorter duration of the other postretirement liabilities at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. U.S. health care costs for the retiree population are assumed to increase 10.0% in 2007 and then trend down to an expected increase of 4.5% per year by 2018. If actual costs are higher than those assumed, this will likely put significant upward pressure on the Company expense for retiree health care. The effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 are reflected in 2006 net periodic postretirement benefit cost (a reduction of $11 million) and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at January 1, 2006 (a reduction of $94 million). Recognition of Actuarial Gains and Losses In 2006, SFAS No. 158 requires the recognition of actuarial gains and losses as a component of stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income while SFAS No. 87 provides for delayed recognition in years prior to 2006. These amounts arise from changes in the estimated plan benefit obligations due to changes in the assumed discount rate, differences between the actual and expected returns on plan assets, and other assumption changes. The net actuarial gain or loss, determined based on the market-related value of plan assets (which differs from fair market value and is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years), be amortized in pension income or expense for the year to the extent that such unrecognized net actuarial loss or gain exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year. These net gains and losses are recognized as pension income or expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans (approximately 10 years) to the extent that they are not offset by losses and gains in subsequent years. The unrecognized net actuarial loss reflects in large part the steady reduction of the weighted-average discount rate over the years. Unless offset by future unrecognized gains from higher discount rates or higher than expected returns on plan assets, amortization of the unrecognized loss is expected to increase pension expense by $133 million in 2007 and by progressively lower amounts for each of the following nine years. 82 Plan Funding The Company funding policy for defined benefit plans is to contribute amounts to provide for current service and to fund past service liability. The Company contributed $325 million and $423 million to the defined benefit plans in 2006 and 2005, respectively. For discussions on retirement benefits, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 20. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans. Acquired In-Process Research and Development The fair value of in-process research and development acquired in a business combination is determined by independent appraisal based on the present value of each research project projected cash flows. An income approach is utilized that is consistent with guidance in the practice aid issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Assets Acquired in a Business Combination to Be Used in Research and Development Activities: A Focus on Software, Electronic Devices and Pharmaceutical Industries . Future cash flows are predominately based on the net income forecast of each project, consistent with historical pricing, margins, and expense levels of similar products. Revenues are estimated based on relevant market size and growth factors, expected industry trends, individual project life cycles, and the life of each research project underlying patent. In determining the fair value of each research project, expected revenues are first adjusted for technical risk of completion. The resulting cash flows are then discounted at a rate approximating the Company weighted average cost of capital. Other acquired in-process research and development is expensed as incurred when the underlying product has not received regulatory approval and does not have any future alternative use. In addition, costs that are nonrefundable, related to the acquisition or licensing of products that have not yet received regulatory approval to be marketed and that have no alternative future use, are charged to earnings as incurred. For discussions on acquired in-process research and development, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Acquired In-Process Research and Development. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , the Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset fair value is based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including a discounted value of estimated future cash flows. The Company reports an asset to be disposed of at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated net realizable value. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment using a two-step process. The first step is to identify a potential impairment, and the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss, if any. Goodwill is deemed to be impaired if the carrying amount of a reporting unit goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value. SFAS No. 142 requires that indefinite-lived intangible assets be tested for impairment using a one-step process, which consists of a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the intangible asset. Such intangible assets are deemed to be impaired if their net book value exceeds their estimated fair value. All other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144 as described above. The estimates of future cash flows, based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management judgment. Any changes in key assumptions about the Company businesses and their prospects, or changes in market conditions, could result in an impairment charge. For discussions on impairment of long-lived assets, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Equity Investments The Company reviews its equity investments for impairment based on its determination of whether the decline in market value of the investment below the Company carrying value is other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers APB Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock and related interpretations, which set forth factors to be evaluated in determining whether a loss in value should be recognized, including the Company ability to hold its investment, the market price and market price fluctuations of the investment publicly traded shares and inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity, which would justify the carrying amount of the investment. The Company investment in ImClone is subject to this accounting. For a discussion of the Company investment in ImClone, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 2. Alliances and Investments. 83 For discussions on equity investments, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Investments and Note 2. Alliances and Investments. Restructuring To streamline operations and rationalize manufacturing facilities, the Company has periodically recorded restructuring charges. As a result, the Company has made estimates and judgments regarding its future plans, including future termination benefits and other exit costs to be incurred when the restructuring actions take place. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Adjustments of $14 million, $1 million and $8 million were recorded in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and reflect changes in estimates for restructuring actions taken in prior periods. For discussions on restructuring, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Restructuring and Note 3. Restructuring and Other Items. Contingencies In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its business, that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others, government investigations, shareholder lawsuits, product and environmental liability, and tax matters. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies , the Company records accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. For discussions on contingencies, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Income Taxes and Contingencies; Note 8. Income Taxes, and Note 21. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax bases of the Company assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including the long-range forecast of future taxable income and the evaluation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $3,154 million and $2,380 million, respectively, net of valuation allowances of $625 million and $559 million, respectively. The increase in net deferred tax assets in 2006 primarily resulted from the adoption of SFAS No. 158, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 8. Income Taxes and Note 20. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans. The Company has recorded significant deferred tax assets related to U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1,071 million and U.S. research tax credit carryforwards of approximately $259 million, which expire in varying amounts beginning in 2012. Realization of the foreign tax credit and research tax credit carryforwards is dependent on generating sufficient domestic taxable income prior to their expiration. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. The Company anticipates increasing its level of domestic profitability over time by undertaking actions such as increasing its biologics manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and implementing tax planning strategies. While increasing domestic profitability will likely cause the Company effective tax rate to increase, it will also further enhance the Company ability to utilize its foreign tax credit and research tax credit carryforwards. The amount of foreign tax credit and research tax credit carryforwards considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if PLAVIX* is subject to either renewed or additional generic competition. If such events occur, the Company may need to record significant valuation allowances against these U.S. Federal deferred tax assets. For a discussion of PLAVIX* related matters, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 21. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. The Company conducts business in various countries throughout the world and is subject to tax in numerous jurisdictions. As a result of its business activities, the Company files a significant number of tax returns that are subject to examination by various Federal, state, and local tax authorities. Tax examinations are often complex as tax authorities may disagree with the treatment of items reported by the Company and may require several years to resolve. The Company establishes liabilities for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known tax exposures including, but not limited to, transfer pricing matters, tax credits, and deductibility of certain expenses. Such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid, and may need to be adjusted over time as more information becomes known. 84 As of December 31, 2006, the Company had approximately $11.3 billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which taxes have not been provided as the Company has invested or expects to invest these undistributed earnings permanently offshore. If in the future these earnings are repatriated to the U.S., or if the Company determines such earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future, additional tax provisions would be required. Due to complexities in the tax laws and the assumptions that would have to be made, it is not practicable to estimate the amounts of income taxes that would have to be provided. For discussions on income taxes, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Income Taxes and Note 8. Income Taxes. Stock-Based Compensation Expense The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment , which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. The Company uses the modified prospective transition method, which requires the application of the accounting standard as of January 1, 2006, and has elected the alternative method as provided in FSP No. 123(R)-3 in determining the Company pool of excess tax benefits. The Company consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect the impact of SFAS No. 123(R). In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, the Company consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of SFAS No. 123(R). Stock-based compensation expense recognized under SFAS No. 123(R) for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $112 million ($73 million, net of tax) or $0.04 per share, with a corresponding amount recorded in additional paid-in capital within stockholders equity. Comparatively, on a pro forma basis, stock-based compensation expense of $31 million and $30 million ($20 million and $19 million, net of tax), respectively, was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, under APB No. 25. Additionally, $10 million related to performance awards was reclassified from liabilities to stockholders equity in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the Company consolidated statement of earnings. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company accounted for stock-based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method related to stock options in accordance with APB No. 25 as allowed under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation . Under the intrinsic value method, no stock-based compensation expense had been recognized in the Company consolidated statement of earnings because the exercise price of the Company stock options granted to employees and directors equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. Stock-based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of stock-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Company consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2006 included compensation expense for stock-based payment awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) and compensation expense for the stock-based payment awards granted subsequent to January 1, 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). In conjunction with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company changed its method of attributing the value of stock-based compensation expense from the accelerated multiple-option approach to the straight-line single option method. Compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards granted prior to 2006 will continue to be recognized using the accelerated multiple-option approach while compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards, with a service condition only, granted on or subsequent to January 1, 2006 is recognized using the straight-line single-option method. Stock-based payment awards granted on or subsequent to January 1, 2006, with both a service and market condition will be recognized using the accelerated multiple-option approach as required under SFAS No. 123(R). Prior to 2006, the Company applied APB Opinion No. 25, and did not recognize compensation expense for stock options granted under the plans as the exercise price of the option on the date of grant is equal to the fair market value as of that date. However, for grants of restricted stock, the Company recognized compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the period that the restrictions expire. 85 The fair value of the options granted during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was estimated as $4.74 per common share, $5.49 per common share and $5.91 per common share, respectively on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: 2006 2005 2004 Expected volatility 26.7 % 29.4 % 30.0 % Risk-free interest rate 4.6 % 4.4 % 3.5 % Dividend yield 4.8 % 4.6 % 4.4 % Expected life 6.3 yrs 7.0 yrs 7.0 yrs The Company determines fair value of certain stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. This model is affected by the Company stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to: the Company expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. With respect to the accounting treatment of retirement eligibility provisions of employee stock-based compensation awards, the Company has historically followed the nominal vesting period approach. Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company follows the non-substantive vesting period approach and recognizes compensation cost over a one-year period for awards granted to retirement eligible employees, or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved if more than one- year, but less than the vesting period. The impact of applying the non-substantive vesting period approach is not material to the Company consolidated financial statements. As stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2006 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. The Company estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. In the Company pro forma information required under SFAS No. 123 for the periods prior to 2006, the Company accounted for forfeitures as they occurred. Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This annual report and other written and oral statements the Company makes from time to time contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the fact they use words such as should , expect , anticipate , estimate , target , may , project , guidance , intend , plan , believe and other words and terms of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. One can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including factors that could delay, divert or change any of them, and could cause actual outcomes to differ materially from current expectations. These statements are likely to relate to, among other things, the Company goals, plans and projections regarding its financial position, results of operations, cash flows, market position, product development, product approvals, sales efforts, expenses, performance or results of current and anticipated products and the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and financial results, which are based on current expectations that involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including internal or external factors that could delay, divert or change any of them in the next several years.
