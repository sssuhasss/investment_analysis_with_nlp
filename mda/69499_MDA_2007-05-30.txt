The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements for revisions or changes after the date of this Form 10-K. Overview Mylan Laboratories Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company, Mylan or we ) develop, license, manufacture, market and distribute generic, brand and branded generic pharmaceutical products and active pharmaceutical ingredients ( APIs ). On May 12, 2007, Mylan and Merck KGaA announced the signing of a definitive agreement under which Mylan will acquire Merck generic business ( Merck Generics ) for Euro 4.9 billion (approximately $6.7 billion) in an all-cash transaction. Management believes that the combination of Mylan and Merck Generics will create a vertically and horizontally integrated generic and specialty pharmaceuticals leader with a diversified revenue base and a global footprint, and also believes the combined company will be among the top tier of global generic companies, with a significant presence in the top five global generics markets. The transaction remains subject to regulatory review in relevant jurisdictions and certain other customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the second half of calendar 2007. In conjunction with the Merck Generics transaction, the Company entered into a deal-contingent foreign currency option contract in order to mitigate the risk of foreign currency exposure. The contract is contingent upon the closing of this acquisition, and the premium of approximately $121.9 million will be paid only upon such closing. The Company will account for this instrument under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ( SFAS 133 ). This instrument does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133 and, therefore, will be adjusted to fair value at each reporting date with the change in the fair value of the instrument recorded in earnings. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, Mylan completed an acquisition of 71.5% of the outstanding common shares of Matrix Laboratories Limited ( Matrix ), a publicly traded Indian company, for 306 rupees per Matrix share. On December 21, 2006, in accordance with the terms of the transaction, Mylan completed an open offer in which it acquired approximately 20% of Matrix shares outstanding for approximately $210.6 million. Then, on January 8, 2007, Mylan purchased approximately 51.5% of Matrix shares outstanding pursuant to an agreement with certain selling shareholders for approximately $545.6 million. The transaction was funded using Mylan existing revolving credit facility and cash on hand. Approximately $168.0 million of the funds received by three of the selling shareholders (and their affiliates) were used to purchase approximately 8.1 million shares of Mylan Laboratories Inc. common stock in private transactions with the Company. Matrix provides Mylan with a significant presence in important emerging pharmaceutical markets, including India, China and Africa, as well as a European footprint and distribution network through Matrix Docpharma subsidiary. This transaction combines Matrix API and drug development business with Mylan expertise in 32 Table of Contents finished dosage forms. The transaction also expands Mylan high-barrier-to-entry product capabilities, particularly in the area of anti-retrovirals. With the addition of Matrix, Mylan will now report as two reportable segments, the Mylan Segment and the Matrix Segment . Mylan previously reported as one segment. In accordance with SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information ( SFAS 131 ) , information for earlier periods has been recast. Total revenues for fiscal 2007 were $1.61 billion. Mylan Segment total revenues were $1.53 billion, and our Matrix Segment had total revenues of $79.4 million. For fiscal 2006, Mylan had total revenues of $1.26 billion. On a consolidated basis, year over year, this represents an increase of 28% in total revenues. Consolidated gross profit for fiscal 2007 was $843.7 million compared to $627.6 million in the prior year, an increase of 34%, while gross margins increased from 49.9% to 52.3%. Operating income increased by 49% to $427.6 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $287.4 million in fiscal 2006. Net earnings for fiscal 2007 were $217.3 million compared to $184.5 million in fiscal 2006, an increase of 18%. Earnings per diluted share increased from $0.79 in fiscal 2006 to $0.99 in fiscal 2007. Comparability of results between fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 is affected by the following items: Fiscal 2007: The write-off of acquired in-process research and development related to the Matrix acquisition in the amount of $147.0 million (pre-tax and after-tax); Stock-based compensation expense totaling $22.2 million, pre-tax, as a result of the Company adoption of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ( SFAS No. 123R ); A gain on a foreign exchange forward contract of $16.2 million, pre-tax; and A net gain of $50.1 million, pre-tax, related to the favorable settlement of certain litigation. Fiscal 2006: A charge of $12.0 million, pre-tax, with respect to a contingent legal liability related to previously, pre-tax, disclosed litigation in connection with the Company lorazepam and clorazepate products and $20.9 million of restructuring costs. A more detailed discussion of the Company financial results can be found under the section titled Results of Operations . Other factors which impacted fiscal 2007 were: Amlodipine Besylate On March 23, 2007, Mylan launched Amlodipine Besylate Tablets, 2.5 mg (base), 5 mg (base) and 10 mg (base). Amlodipine Besylate Tablets ( amlodipine ) are the generic version of Pfizer Norvasc Tablets, which had U.S. sales of approximately $2.7 billion for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2006, according to IMS Health. Mylan was the first generic company to file on all strengths of amlodipine. The FDA has stated that in the event an appellate court mandate from the March 21, 2007 appellate court decision related to the validity of the amlodipine patent is issued prior to September 25, 2007, the only ANDA eligible for approval during that period will be from Apotex because of the favorable court decision in its case against Pfizer. However, there are several other ANDA applicants seeking immediate approval. On May 21, 2007, an appellate court mandate was issued and Apotex has launched its amlodipine product. Consistent with past practice and as a result of uncertainties concerning pricing and market conditions for this product, revenue is being deferred until the product is sold by Mylan customers or until such time that the uncertainties are resolved. For the year ended March 31, 2007, therefore, substantially all revenues on shipments of amlodipine are deferred. 33 Table of Contents Issuance of Senior Convertible Notes and Common Stock On March 2, 2007, Mylan completed an offering of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due 2012. The notes bear interest at 1.25% and are convertible by holders at an initial conversion rate of 44.5931 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (subject to adjustment in certain circumstances), which represents an intial conversion price of approximately $22.43 per share. Also on March 2, 2007, Mylan completed the sale of 26.2 million shares of its common stock at a price of $19.50 per share. Oxybutynin On November 10, 2006, Mylan announced that the FDA granted final approval for Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. ANDAs for oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets ( oxybutynin ), 5 mg and 10 mg, the generic version of Alza Corporation Ditropan XL. Mylan was the first generic drug company to file ANDAs with the FDA for 5 mg and 10 mg oxybutynin and, as such, had 180 days of market exclusivity for those strengths. In the third fiscal quarter of 2007, Mylan launched its 5 mg and 10 mg oxybutynin products upon receiving approval and also launched a 15 mg strength under our agreement with Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceuticals. Mylan exclusivity on this product expired on May 9, 2007. Results of Operations Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 Total Revenues and Gross Profit Total revenues for fiscal 2007 were $1.61 billion compared to $1.26 billion for fiscal 2006, an increase of $354.7 million or 28%. Mylan Segment total revenues were $1.53 billion, and Matrix Segment total revenues were $79.4 million. In arriving at net revenues, gross revenues are reduced by provisions for estimates, including discounts, customer performance and promotions, price adjustments, returns and chargebacks. See the section titled Application of Critical Accounting Policies in this ITEM 7, for a thorough discussion of our methodology with respect to such provisions. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, the most significant amounts charged against gross revenues were for chargebacks in the amount of $1.19 billion and customer performance and promotions in the amount of $180.7 million. For fiscal 2006, chargebacks of $1.11 billion and customer performance and promotions of $160.8 million were charged against gross revenues. Customer performance and promotions include direct rebates as well as promotional programs. For the Mylan Segment, net revenues increased by $267.5 million or 22% compared to fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of increased volume and contribution from new products. Pricing was relatively stable compared to the prior year. New products in fiscal 2007 contributed net revenues of $108.7 million primarily due to oxybutynin, which was launched in the third quarter. Excluding new products, fentanyl, which continues to be the only ANDA-approved, AB-rated generic alternative to Duragesic on the market, was a primary driver of both the increased volume and relatively stable pricing. Fentanyl accounted for approximately 18% of Mylan Segment net revenues for fiscal 2007. For the Mylan Segment, doses shipped during fiscal 2007 increased over 12% from the same prior year period to approximately 14.1 billion. Other revenues for the Mylan Segment in fiscal 2007 increased by $7.7 million from $17.2 million in fiscal 2006 to $24.9 million for the current fiscal year. This increase was primarily related to the recognition of amounts that had been deferred with respect to Apokyn , which was sold in the prior year, with the remainder related to other business development activities. Net revenues for the Matrix Segment were $95.8 million, of which $79.4 million were sold to third parties. Mylan began consolidating the results of Matrix on January 8, 2007. Approximately 50% of the Matrix Segment third-party revenues come from the sale of API and intermediates and approximately 27% mainly from the distribution of branded generic products in Europe. Intercompany revenue was derived from API sales to the Mylan Segment primarily in conjunction with the launch of amlodipine which is a vertically integrated product, as well as revenue earned through intercompany product development agreements. 34 Table of Contents Consolidated gross profit increased 34% or $216.1 million to $843.7 million from $627.6 million, and gross margins increased to 52.3% from 49.9%. For the Mylan Segment, gross profit was $846.6 million compared to $627.6 million in fiscal 2006, while gross margins increased to 55.2% from 49.9%. For the Matrix Segment gross profit was negatively impacted by approximately $17.6 million representing the reduction of the fair value step-up in inventory, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment recorded as part of the acquisition. For the Mylan Segment, a significant portion of gross profit, as well as the increase in gross margins, was comprised of fentanyl and oxybutynin. Fentanyl contributes margins well in excess of most other products in our portfolio, excluding new products. Absent any changes to market dynamics or significant new competition for fentanyl, the Company expects the product to continue to be a significant contributor to sales and gross profit. Products generally contribute most significantly to gross margin at the time of their launch and, as is the case with oxybutynin, even more so in periods of market exclusivity. As is typical in the generic industry, the entrance into the market of other generic competition generally has a negative impact on the volume and pricing of the affected products. Operating Expenses Consolidated research and development ( R&D ) expense for fiscal 2007 was $103.7 million compared to $102.4 million in fiscal 2006, which represents an increase of $1.3 million or 1%. Matrix Segment R&D expense was $12.7 million for fiscal 2007. Excluding Matrix, R&D expense decreased by $11.4 million or 11%. The Mylan Segment had R&D expense of $81.8 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $101.1 million in fiscal 2006. The overall decrease is primarily the result of the outlicensing of nebivolol, which occurred late in fiscal 2006. Additionally, during the fourth quarter, the Company recognized a charge of $147.0 million to write off acquired in-process R&D associated with the Matrix acquisition. This amount represents the fair value of purchased in-process technology for research projects that, as of the closing date of the acquisition, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. Selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expense for fiscal 2007 was $215.5 million compared to $225.4 million in fiscal 2006, a decrease of $9.8 million or 4%. Mylan Segment SG&A expense was $65.4 million, a decrease of $10.4 million from fiscal 2006. This decrease is primarily the result of approximately $20.0 million of cost savings realized from the closure of Mylan Bertek, the Company branded subsidiary, in the prior year. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase of approximately $4.5 million in stock-based compensation expense. Corporate and Other SG&A expense was $144.4 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $149.6 million in the prior year, a decrease of $5.2 million or 4%. Prior year Corporate and Other SG&A included $19.9 million of restructuring costs associated with the closure of Mylan Bertek, which accounts for the majority of the decrease realized in fiscal 2007. Partally offsetting this were increases in other general and administrative costs, including stock-based compensation expense of approximately $7.7 million. For the Matrix Segment, SG&A expense was $5.8 million in fiscal 2007. Litigation, net Net favorable settlements of $50.1 million were recorded in fiscal 2007. In the same period of the prior year, litigation, net was a $12.4 million charge of which $12.0 million was for a contingent liability with respect to the Company previously disclosed lorazepam and clorazepate product litigation. Interest Expense Interest expense for fiscal 2007 totaled $52.3 million compared to $31.3 million for the same period of the prior year. The Company has had its financing outstanding for all of fiscal 2007, while it was only completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Also included in fiscal 2007 interest expense is interest related to the debt assumed in the Matrix acquisition as well as additional debt borrowed to fund the Matrix acquisition, the convertible notes issued in March of 2007, a commitment fee on the revolving credit facilities and the amortization of debt issuance costs. 35 Table of Contents Other Income, net Other income, net was $50.2 million for fiscal 2007 compared to $18.5 million in the same prior year period. The change is primarily the result of a $16.2 million net gain on a foreign currency forward contract related to the acquisition of Matrix. Additionally, during fiscal 2007, the Company received a cash payment of $5.5 million from Somerset Pharmaceuticals, Inc., in which Mylan owns a 50% equity interest and accounts for this investment using the equity method of accounting. The amount in excess of the carrying value of our investment in Somerset, approximately $5.0 million, was recorded as equity income. Income Tax Expense The Company effective tax rate increased for fiscal 2007 to 48.9% from 32.8% in fiscal 2006. This increase is primarily due to the acquisition of Matrix and the related non-deductible $147.0 million charge related to acquired in-process R&D. In addition, higher pre-tax income for fiscal 2007 resulted in higher state taxes while state credits remained relatively fixed. Additionally, the favorable impact of federal tax credits on the effective tax rate was less significant in fiscal 2007 primarily because of the expiration of the Section 936 credits and lower R&D credits when compared to the previous fiscal year. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Total Revenues and Gross Profit During fiscal 2006, in accordance with SFAS No. 131 Mylan reported as one segment, Pharmaceuticals . With the addition of Matrix, Mylan now has two reportable segments, the Mylan Segment (which is the former Pharmaceuticals segment) and the Matrix Segment . The discussion below has been updated to reflect this change in segment reporting. In fiscal 2006 and 2005, the Matrix Segment did not exist. Net revenues for fiscal 2006 were $1.24 billion compared to $1.25 billion for fiscal 2005, a decrease of $7.8 million or 1%. In arriving at net revenues, gross revenues are reduced by provisions for estimates, including discounts, customer performance and promotions, price adjustments, returns and chargebacks. See the section titled Application of Critical Accounting Policies in this ITEM 7 for a thorough discussion of our methodology with respect to such provisions. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, the most significant amounts charged against gross revenues were for chargebacks in the amount of $1.11 billion and customer performance and promotions in the amount of $160.8 million. For fiscal 2005, chargebacks of $892.6 million and customer performance and promotions of $195.1 million were charged against gross revenues. The increase in the amounts charged against gross revenues for chargebacks in the current year is the result of pricing pressures on certain products in the Company portfolio, most notably omeprazole and carbidopa/levodopa, a full year of chargebacks related to fentanyl and an increase in sales to customers who are entitled to chargeback credits. Customer performance and promotions include direct rebates as well as promotional programs. A greater amount was charged against gross revenues for customer performance and promotions in fiscal 2005 primarily due to promotions offered to customers in connection with the launch of fentanyl that occurred in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. New products launched during fiscal 2006 contributed $6.7 million to net revenues in fiscal 2006 compared to $87.3 million in fiscal 2005 primarily due to fentanyl, which was launched in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The Company considers a product to be a new product only in the year it is launched. Net revenues in fiscal 2006, however, did realize a significant benefit from a full year of sales of fentanyl, which accounted for over 10% of net revenues, as well as other products that were launched during fiscal 2005. The favorable impact of these products served to offset lower revenue on other products in the Company portfolio, most notably omeprazole and carbidopa/levodopa. Both of these products realized lower net revenues as a result of increased competition. As is the case in the generic industry, the entrance into the market of other generic competition generally has a negative impact on the volume and pricing of the affected products. As it relates to other products, the trend generally observed throughout the Company product portfolio in fiscal 2006 was favorable volume, which essentially offset unfavorable pricing. Doses shipped during fiscal 2006 were 12.6 billion, an increase over fiscal 2005 doses shipped of 12.5 billion. 36 Table of Contents The fiscal 2006 results include other revenue of $17.2 million compared to $5.6 million in the prior year. The majority of this increase relates to the sale of Apokyn in fiscal 2006, for which $8.9 million of revenue was recognized. The remainder of the increase in fiscal 2006 is related to royalties. Gross profit for fiscal 2006 was $627.6 million, an increase of $4.1 million or 1% over fiscal 2005, while gross margins were consistent at approximately 50%. A significant portion of gross profit was comprised of fentanyl. Absent any changes to market dynamics or the current competitive landscape for fentanyl, we expect the product to continue to be a significant contributor to sales and gross profit. Additionally, gross margins in the current year were impacted by favorable product mix, partially offset by lower margins on certain products, such as omeprazole and carbidopa/levodopa as a result of competition. Operating Expenses Research and development ( R&D ) expense for fiscal 2006 was $102.4 million compared to $88.3 million in fiscal 2005, which represents an increase of $14.2 million or 16%. Mylan Segment R&D expense was $101.1 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $87.9 million in fiscal 2005, while Corporate and Other R&D expense was $1.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively. The increase in Mylan Segment R&D expense is primarily due to costs incurred for clinical studies related to nebivolol incurred prior to the outlicensing of the product in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, as well as an overall increase in the number of ongoing studies. The Company continued commitment to, and investment in, R&D activities has resulted in a robust ANDA pipeline, and it is expected that R&D expenses will continue to increase in future periods. Selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expense for fiscal 2006 was $225.4 million compared to $259.1 million in fiscal 2005, a decrease of $33.7 million or 13%. Corporate and Other SG&A expense was $149.6 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $145.4 million in fiscal 2005, an increase of $4.2 million or 3%. This increase was offset by the Mylan Segment which had $75.8 million of SG&A expense in fiscal 2006 compared to $113.7 million in the prior year, a decrease of $37.9 million or 33%. Included in fiscal 2005 SG&A were costs of $22.9 million related to the terminated acquisition of King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Legal costs also decreased by approximately $9.0 million from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006, primarily as a result of the timing of certain litigation. Legal challenges continue to be an integral part of the Company strategy and its ability to continue to deliver new generic products to the market. The remainder of the change in SG&A during fiscal 2006 is primarily the result of the closure of Mylan Bertek as part of the Company restructuring. Charges of $19.9 million were incurred primarily in the first and second quarters related to employee termination and severance costs, lease termination costs and asset write-downs. These costs, which were primarily related to the termination of the Mylan Bertek sales force, resulted in significant cost savings realized throughout the remainder of fiscal 2006. Litigation Settlements, net Litigation settlements, included in Corporate and Other, during fiscal 2006 consisted primarily of a charge of $12.0 million for a contingent liability with respect to the Company previously disclosed lorazepam and clorazepate product litigation. In the prior year, net gains of $26.0 million were recorded with respect to settlement of other litigation. Interest Expense During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, Mylan completed a financing of $500.0 million in Senior Notes and a $500.0 million senior secured credit facility (see Contractual Obligations herein). Included in Corporate and Other is interest expense related to this financing of $31.3 million for fiscal 2006. Included in interest expense is a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility and the amortization of financing fees. Other Income, net Corporate and Other includes other income, net of non-operating expenses, of $18.5 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $10.1 million in fiscal 2005. The increase is primarily the result of higher interest and dividend income on our investments in marketable securities as well as less of a loss recorded on our investment in Somerset Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 37 Table of Contents We own a 50% equity interest in Somerset and account for this investment using the equity method of accounting. The recorded loss in Somerset for fiscal 2006 was $2.5 million compared to a loss of $3.3 million in fiscal 2005. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2006 was 32.8%, a decrease from the fiscal 2005 effective tax rate of 34.8%. During fiscal 2006, we recorded a tax benefit of $7.5 million, primarily related to the resolution of certain tax positions with taxing authorities. These previously uncertain tax positions were resolved through the completion of audits or through the acceptance of our amended return filings. This tax benefit was partially offset by liabilities booked primarily for certain state tax filing positions. Despite our belief that our tax return positions are correct, we have established liabilities in both the current and prior fiscal years for these tax positions that may become payable in the event our positions are not upheld. In addition, the fiscal 2006 effective tax rate benefited from the new domestic production deduction and an increase in tax exempt interest as compared to the prior year, offset by higher state taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows from operating activities were $390.2 million for fiscal 2007, resulting from net income and non-cash add-backs (including acquired in-process R&D of $147.0 million), partially offset by changes in certain working capital items. In total, working capital as of March 31, 2007 was $1.7 billion compared to $926.7 million at March 31, 2006. The most significant working capital items affecting cash were accounts receivable and income taxes payable. The increase in accounts receivable is related to increased overall sales. The increase to income taxes payable is the result of increased net income and the timing of tax payments. Cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 was $730.7 million. Of the Company $4.3 billion of total assets at March 31, 2007, $1.4 billion was held in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Investments in marketable securities consist of a variety of high-credit quality debt securities, including U.S. government, state and local government and corporate obligations. These investments are highly liquid and available for working capital and other needs. As these instruments mature, the funds are generally reinvested in instruments with similar characteristics. Capital expenditures during fiscal 2007 were $161.9 million. These expenditures were incurred primarily for equipment, including with respect to the Company previously announced planned expansions and the implementation of an integrated ERP system. Also included in investing activities was $761.0 million paid to acquire a controlling interest of 71.5% in Matrix, net of cash acquired. Upon the closing of the purchase of the controlling interest, Mylan received a cash payment of $16.2 million as the result of a foreign currency forward contract that had been entered into with respect to the Matrix transaction. As a result, the net cash paid by Mylan for Matrix was approximately $744.8 million. Additionally, certain of Matrix selling shareholders used $168.0 million of the funds received by them to purchase shares of Mylan Laboratories Inc. common stock from the Company. The receipt of these proceeds is included in financing activities as discussed below. Cash provided by financing activities was $1.44 billion for fiscal 2007. Mylan generated $657.7 million through the issuance of common stock as a result of the Matrix transaction as described above and through the sale of 26.2 million shares on March 1, 2007 at a price of $19.50 per share. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock are shown net of underwriter discounts and offering expenses of approximately $21.1 million. Proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt were $1.56 billion, consisting primarily of $600.0 million of convertible notes issued on March 1, 2007, borrowings of $315.0 million under the revolving credit facility in order to finance the Matrix acquisition (of which $52.0 million was subsequently repaid) and a term loan of $450.0 million borrowed on March 26, 2007. The term loan was used to pay $450.0 million of debt outstanding under the Company revolving credit facility. Additionally, Mylan repaid $187.9 million of a 2005 term loan outstanding under a previous credit facility that was refinanced in the second quarter of the current fiscal year. The term loan was part of a credit agreement entered by Mylan for a $750.0 million senior unsecured credit facility which, in addition 38 Table of Contents to the term loan, includes a multicurrency revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility ) in an aggregate amount of up to a U.S. dollar equivalent of $300.0 million, which is expected to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including expansion of global operations. At March 31, 2007, the Company had $1.0 billion available under its credit facilities. At the time of issuance of the convertible notes, Mylan entered into a convertible note hedge transaction, comprised of a purchased call option and two warrant transactions with each of Merrill Lynch International, an affiliate of Merrill Lynch, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, London Branch, an affiliate of JPMorgan. The sale of the warrants resulted in cash proceeds of $45.4 million which was used, along with the proceeds from the issuance of the notes, to purchase the bond hedge for approximately $126.0 million. Subject to the conversion provisions outlined in the Convertible Notes Purchase Agreement, the notes are convertible by holders at an initial conversion rate of 44.5931 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, with the principal amount payable in cash and the remainder in stock or cash at the option of the Company. Also included in cash flows from financing activities are proceeds of $49.8 million from the exercise of stock options and cash dividends paid of $50.8 million. In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Board voted to double the amount of the quarterly dividend to 6.0 cents per share from 3.0 cents per share, effective with the dividend paid for the first quarter of fiscal 2006. However, as announced on May 12, 2007, in conjunction with the contemplated acquisition of Merck KGaA generic business, the Company is suspending the dividend on its common stock. On May 12, 2007, Mylan and Merck KGaA announced the signing of a definitive agreement under which Mylan will acquire Merck generics business ( Merck Generics ) for Euro 4.9 billion (approximately $6.7 billion) in an all-cash transaction. Management believes that the combination of Mylan and Merck Generics will create a vertically and horizontally integrated generics and specialty pharmaceuticals leader with a diversified revenue base and a global footprint, and also believes the combined company will be among the top tier of global generic companies, with a significant presence in the top five global generics markets. Mylan has obtained fully committed financing from Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. In conjunction with the Merck Generics transaction, the Company entered into a deal-contingent foreign currency option contract in order to mitigate the risk of foreign currency exposure. The contract is contingent upon the closing of this acquisition, and the premium of approximately $121.9 million will be paid only upon such closing. The Company will account for this instrument under the provisions of SFAS No. 133. This instrument does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133 and, therefore, will be adjusted to fair value at each reporting date with the change in the fair value of the instrument recorded in earnings. The Company is involved in various legal proceedings that are considered normal to its business (see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such proceedings, an adverse outcome in any of these proceedings could materially affect the Company financial position and results of operations. The Company is actively pursuing, and is currently involved in, joint projects related to the development, distribution and marketing of both generic and brand products. Many of these arrangements provide for payments by the Company upon the attainment of specified milestones. While these arrangements help to reduce the financial risk for unsuccessful projects, fulfillment of specified milestones or the occurrence of other obligations may result in fluctuations in cash flows. The Company is continuously evaluating the potential acquisition of products, as well as companies, as a strategic part of its future growth. Consequently, the Company may utilize current cash reserves or incur additional indebtedness to finance any such acquisitions, which could impact future liquidity. 39 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at March 31, 2007 and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Less than One-Three Three-Five As of March 31, 2007 Total One Year Years Years Thereafter (in thousands) Operating leases $ 20,164 $ 5,848 $ 9,621 $ 2,662 $ 2,033 Other long-term obligations 33,112 3,440 13,225 3,612 12,835 Total debt 1,776,362 121,430 254,932 1,050,000 350,000 Scheduled interest payments 362,752 71,394 202,801 66,244 22,313 Revolving credit facility $ 2,192,390 $ 202,112 $ 480,579 $ 1,122,518 $ 387,181 We lease certain real property under various operating lease arrangements that expire generally over the next five years. These leases generally provide us with the option to renew the lease at the end of the lease term. We have also entered into agreements to lease vehicles, which are typically 24 to 36 months, for use by our key employees. Long-term debt consists of $500.0 million in Senior Notes, a Term Loan Facility of $450.0 million and $600.0 million in convertible notes. Additionally, with the acquisition of Matrix, Mylan assumed debt of approximately $226.4 million consisting primarily of two term loans of Euro 82.5 million each. The Senior Notes consist of $150.0 million of Senior Notes due 2010, and bearing interest at 5 3 / 4 % per annum (the 2010 Notes ), and $350.0 million of Senior Notes due 2015, and bearing interest at 6 3 / 8 % per annum (the 2015 Notes , and collectively, the Notes ). The Senior Notes were originally issued on July 21, 2005 but were exchanged on January 14, 2006 in accordance with a registration rights agreement in a transaction consummated on January 19, 2006. The form and terms of the Senior Notes are identical in all material respects to the original notes except the transfer restrictions, registration rights and additional interest provisions relating to the original notes do not apply to the Notes. On March 26, 2007, Mylan and its wholly owned indirect subsidiary Euro Mylan B.V. ( Euro Mylan ) entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of bank lenders for a $750.0 million senior unsecured credit facility (the 2007 Credit Facility ), including (i) a multicurrency revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility ) in an aggregate amount of up to a U.S. dollar equivalent of $300.0 million due July 24, 2011, and (ii) a term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility ) denominated in U.S. dollars in aggregate amount of up to $450.0 million due December 26, 2011. Upon closing, the Company borrowed $450.0 million under the Term Loan Facility and used the proceeds to repay the revolving loans outstanding under the Company existing 2006 Credit Facility. The Company intends to use the Revolving Credit Facility for working capital and general corporate purposes, including expansion of its global operations. At the Company option, loans under the 2007 Credit Facility will bear interest either at a rate equal to LIBOR plus an effective applicable margin or at a base rate, which is defined as the higher of the rate announced publicly by the Administrative Agent, from time to time, as its prime rate or 0.5% above the federal funds rate. In the case of the effective applicable margin for outstanding term loans and revolver advances based on LIBOR, after the delivery by the Company to the Administrative Agent of its financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2007, the effective applicable margin may increase or decrease, within a range from 0.50% to 1.25%, based on the Company total leverage ratio. The interest rate in effect at March 31, 2007 on the outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan facility was 6.2%. On March 1, 2007, Mylan entered into a Purchase Agreement (the Convertible Notes Purchase Agreement ) relating to the sale by the Company of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company 1.25% Senior Convertible Notes due 2012 (the Convertible Notes ). The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 1.25% per year, accruing from March 7, 2007. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning September 15, 2007. The Notes will mature on March 15, 2012, subject to earlier repurchase or conversion. The Notes have an initial conversion rate of 44.5931 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $22.43 per share), subject to adjustment. 40 Table of Contents Matrix term loan borrowings consist of two Facilities ( Facility A and Facility B ), both of which are denominated in euros. Matrix effective interest rate for these loans is Euro Interbank Offered Rate ( Euribor ) plus 110 basis points for Facility A of Euro 82.50 million and Euribor plus 129 basis points for Facility B of Euro 82.50 million for the period ended March 31, 2007. Facility A is repayable in July 2007, and Facility B is payable over three years in semi annual installments beginning in October 2007. Scheduled interest payments represent the estimated interest payments on the Notes, the Term Loan, the Convertible Notes and Matrix debt. Variable debt interest payments are estimated using current interest rates, as discussed above. Other long-term obligations, primarily deferred compensation, consist of the discounted future payments under individually negotiated agreements with certain key employees and directors. On May 12, 2007, Mylan and Merck KGaA announced the signing of a definitive agreement under which Mylan will acquire Merck Generics for Euro 4.9 billion (approximately $6.7 billion) in an all-cash transaction. Mylan has secured fully committed financing through Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. In addition to the above, the Company has entered into various product licensing and development agreements. In some of these arrangements, we provide funding for the development of the product or obtain the rights to the use of the patent, through milestone payments, in exchange for marketing and distribution rights to the product. Because milestones represent the completion of specific contractual events and it is uncertain if and when these milestones will be achieved, such contingencies have not been recorded on the Company Consolidated Balance Sheet. In the event that all projects are successful, milestone and development payments of approximately $21.7 million would be paid. The Company periodically enters into licensing agreements with other pharmaceutical companies for the manufacture, marketing and/or sale of pharmaceutical products. These agreements generally call for the Company to pay a percentage of amounts earned from the sale of the product as a royalty. We have entered into employment and other agreements with certain executives that provide for compensation and certain other benefits. These agreements provide for severance payments under certain circumstances. At March 31, 2007, the Company has $13.1 million in letters of credit outstanding. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Included within these policies are certain policies which contain critical accounting estimates and, therefore, have been deemed to be critical accounting policies. Critical accounting estimates are those which require management to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and for which the use of different estimates, which reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. The Company has identified the following to be its critical accounting policies: the determination of net revenue provisions, intangible assets and goodwill and the impact of existing legal matters. Net Revenue Provisions Net revenues are recognized for product sales upon shipment when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and when provisions for estimates, including discounts, rebates, promotional adjustments, price adjustments, returns, chargebacks and other potential adjustments are reasonably determinable. Accruals for these provisions are presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements as reductions to net revenues and accounts receivable and within other current liabilities. Accounts receivable are presented net of allowances relating to these provisions, which were $404.7 million and $381.8 million at March 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Other current liabilities include $51.9 million and $60.4 million at March 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, for certain rebates and other adjustments that are paid to indirect customers. 41 Table of Contents The following is a rollforward of the most significant provisions for estimated sales allowances during fiscal year ended March 31, 2007: Current Provision Related Checks/Credits to Sales Made in Balance at Issued to Third the Current Balance at 3/31/2006 Parties Period 3/31/2007 Chargebacks $ 191,237 $ (1,168,824 ) $ 1,186,549 $ 208,962 Customer performance and promotions $ 62,762 $ (170,217 ) $ 180,677 $ 73,222 Returns $ 51,768 $ (29,532 ) $ 27,340 $ 49,576 The accrual for chargebacks increased primarily as a result of increased sales, including sales generated from the launch of oxybutynin in the current year. The accrual for customer performance and promotions includes direct rebates as well as promotional programs. The accrual for direct rebates increased primarily as a result of higher sales in the current year, while the increase in the accrual for promotional programs was also driven in part by the launch of oxybutynin in the later part of fiscal 2007. Provisions for estimated discounts, rebates, promotional and other credits require a lower degree of subjectivity and are less complex in nature yet, combined, represent a significant portion of the overall provisions. These provisions are estimated based on historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels and contract terms. Such provisions are determinable due to the limited number of assumptions and consistency of historical experience. Others, such as price adjustments, returns and chargebacks, require management to make more subjective judgments and evaluate current market conditions. These provisions are discussed in further detail below. Price Adjustments Price adjustments, which include shelf stock adjustments, are credits issued to reflect decreases in the selling prices of our products. Shelf stock adjustments are based upon the amount of product that our customers have remaining in their inventories at the time of the price reduction. Decreases in our selling prices and the issuance of credits are discretionary decisions made by us to reflect market conditions. Amounts recorded for estimated price adjustments are based upon specified terms with direct customers, estimated launch dates of competing products, estimated declines in market price and, in the case of shelf stock adjustments, estimates of inventory held by the customer. In most cases, data with respect to the level of inventory held by the customer is obtained directly from certain of our largest customers. Additionally, internal estimates are prepared based upon historical buying patterns and estimated end-user demand. Such information allows us to assess the impact that a price adjustment will have given the quantity of inventory on hand. We regularly monitor these and other factors and evaluate our reserves and estimates as additional information becomes available. Returns Consistent with industry practice, we maintain a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date. Our estimate of the provision for returns is based upon our historical experience with actual returns, which is applied to the level of sales for the period that corresponds to the period during which our customers may return product. This period is known by us based on the shelf lives of our products at the time of shipment. Additionally, we consider factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel, product dating, and expiration period, size and maturity of the market prior to a product launch, entrance in the market of additional generic competition, changes in formularies or launch of over-the-counter products, to name a few, and make adjustments to the provision for returns in the event that it appears that actual product returns may differ from our established reserves. We obtain data with respect to the level of inventory in the channel directly from certain of our largest customers. Although the introduction of additional generic competition does not give our customers the right to return product outside of our established policy, we do recognize that such competition could ultimately lead to increased returns. We analyze this on a case-by-case basis, when significant, and make adjustments to increase our reserve for product returns as necessary. Chargebacks The provision for chargebacks is the most significant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue. The Company markets products directly to wholesalers, distributors, retail pharmacy chains, mail order pharmacies and group purchasing organizations. The Company also markets products indirectly to independent pharmacies, managed care organizations, hospitals, nursing homes and pharmacy benefit 42 Table of Contents management companies, collectively referred to as indirect customers. Mylan enters into agreements with its indirect customers to establish contract pricing for certain products. The indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to actually purchase the products at these contracted prices. Alternatively, certain wholesalers may enter into agreements with indirect customers that establish contract pricing for certain products which the wholesalers provide. Under either arrangement, Mylan will provide credit to the wholesaler for any difference between the contracted price with the indirect party and the wholesaler invoice price. Such credit is called a chargeback, while the difference between the contracted price and the wholesaler invoice price is referred to as the chargeback rate. The provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through levels by our wholesaler customers to indirect customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels. For the latter, in most cases, inventory levels are obtained directly from certain of our largest wholesalers. Additionally, internal estimates are prepared based upon historical buying patterns and estimated end-user demand. Such information allows us to estimate the potential chargeback that we may ultimately owe to our customers given the quantity of inventory on hand. We continually monitor our provision for chargebacks and evaluate our reserve and estimates as additional information becomes available. Intangible Assets and Goodwill We account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values. The cost to acquire a business, including transaction costs, is allocated to the underlying net assets of the acquired business based on estimates of their respective fair values. Amounts allocated to acquired in-process research and development are expensed at the date of acquisition. Intangible assets are amortized over the expected life of the asset. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The purchase price allocation for the acquisition of Matrix is preliminary and is based on the information that was available as of the acquisition date to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Management believes that information provides a reasonable basis for allocating the purchase price, but the Company is awaiting additional information necessary to finalize the purchase price allocation. The fair values reflected in the purchase price allocation may be adjusted upon the final valuation, and such adjustments could be significant. The Company expects to finalize the valuation and complete the purchase price allocation as soon as possible but no later than one year from the acquisition date. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations. Fair values and useful lives are determined based on, among other factors, the expected future period of benefit of the asset, the various characteristics of the asset and projected cash flows. Because this process involves management making estimates with respect to future sales volumes, pricing, new product launches, anticipated cost environment and overall market conditions and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, these estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates. As a result of our acquisition of Matrix, we recorded on our balance sheet goodwill of $505.8 million and $270.4 million of intangible assets. Goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or when events or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles is determined to exist when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the net assets being tested. Impairment of definite-lived intangibles is determined to exist when undiscounted cash flows related to the assets are less than the carrying value of the assets being tested. As discussed above with respect to determining an asset fair value and useful life, because this process involves management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, these estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates. As of March 31, 2007, the Company determined through its estimates that no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets existed. The Company will continue to assess the carrying value of its goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. 43 Table of Contents Legal Matters The Company is involved in various legal proceedings, some of which involve claims for substantial amounts. An estimate is made to accrue for a loss contingency relating to any of these legal proceedings if it is probable that a liability was incurred as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Because of the subjective nature inherent in assessing the outcome of litigation and because of the potential that an adverse outcome in a legal proceeding could have a material impact on the Company financial position or results of operations, such estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates. During fiscal 2006, the Company recorded an accrual of $12.0 million following a jury verdict of approximately that amount in the Company lorazepam and clorazepate litigation. See ITEM 3, Legal Proceedings, for further discussion. The Company will continue to evaluate all legal matters as additional information becomes available. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement 109 ( FIN 48 ), which clarifies the accounting for uncertain tax positions. This Interpretation provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position be recognized in the Company financial statements, only if the position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based on the technical merits of the position. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective for Mylan as of April 1, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48 on its consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ( SFAS 157 ) , which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. The statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS No. 157 on its consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( SFAS 159 ), providing companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 159 on its consolidated financial statements.
