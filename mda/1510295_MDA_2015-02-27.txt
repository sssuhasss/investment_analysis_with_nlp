Corporate Overview We are an independent petroleum refining and marketing, retail and pipeline transportation company. We currently own and operate seven refineries, all located in the United States, with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 1.7 mmbpcd. Our refineries supply refined products to resellers and consumers within our market areas, including the Midwest, Gulf Coast, East Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. We distribute refined products to our customers through one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges, one of the largest terminal operations in the United States, and a combination of MPC-owned and third-party-owned trucking and rail assets. We are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers within our market area. We have two strong retail brands: Speedway and Marathon . We believe that Speedway LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary, operates the second largest chain of company-owned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the United States, with approximately 2,750 convenience stores in 22 states throughout the Midwest, East Coast and Southeast. The Marathon brand is an established motor fuel brand in the Midwest and Southeast regions of the United States, and is available through approximately 5,460 retail outlets operated by independent entrepreneurs in 19 states. As of December 31, 2014 , we owned, leased or had ownership interests in approximately 8,300 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines to deliver crude oil to our refineries and other locations and refined products to wholesale and retail market areas. We are one of the largest petroleum pipeline companies in the United States on the basis of total volumes delivered. Overall, we are one of the largest independent petroleum product refining, marketing, retail and transportation businesses in the United States and the largest east of the Mississippi. Our operations consist of three reportable operating segments: Refining & Marketing; Speedway; and Pipeline Transportation. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services they offer. See Item 1. Business for additional information on our segments. Refining & Marketing refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our seven refineries in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States, purchases refined products and ethanol for resale and distributes refined products through various means, including barges, terminals and trucks that we own or operate. We sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, buyers on the spot market, our Speedway business segment and to independent entrepreneurs who operate Marathon retail outlets. Speedway sells transportation fuels and convenience products in the retail market in the Midwest, East Coast and Southeast. Pipeline Transportation transports crude oil and other feedstocks to our refineries and other locations, delivers refined products to wholesale and retail market areas and includes the aggregated operations of MPLX. 42 Table of Contents Executive Summary Results Select results for 2014 and 2013 are reflected in the following table. (In millions, except per share data) 2014 2013 Income from Operations by segment Refining & Marketing $ 3,609 $ 3,206 Speedway 544 375 Pipeline Transportation 280 210 Net income attributable to MPC $ 2,524 $ 2,112 Net income attributable to MPC per diluted share $ 8.78 $ 6.64 Net income attributable to MPC increased $412 million, or $2.14 per diluted share, in 2014 compared to 2013 , primarily due to our Refining & Marketing segment. Refining & Marketing segment income from operations increased $403 million in 2014 compared to 2013 , primarily due to more favorable net product price realizations and higher U.S. Gulf Coast ( USGC ) and Chicago crack spreads, partially offset by narrower crude oil differentials and higher turnaround and other direct operating costs. Speedway segment income from operations increased $169 million in 2014 compared to 2013 , primarily due to increases in gasoline and distillate gross margin and merchandise gross margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses. These increases were primarily attributable to the acquisition of convenience stores from Hess. Pipeline Transportation segment income from operations increased $70 million in 2014 compared to 2013 , primarily due to higher pipeline transportation revenue and an increase in income from our pipeline affiliates, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. MPLX LP In 2012, we formed MPLX, a master limited partnership, to own, operate, develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets related to the transportation and storage of crude oil, refined products and other hydrocarbon-based products. On October 31, 2012, MPLX completed its initial public offering of 19.9 million common units, which represented the sale by us of a 26.4 percent interest in MPLX. As of December 31, 2014 , we owned a 71.5 percent interest in MPLX, including the two percent general partner interest, and we consolidate this entity for financial reporting purposes since we have a controlling financial interest. MPLX initial assets consisted of a 51 percent general partner interest in Pipe Line Holdings, which owns a network of common carrier crude oil and product pipeline systems and associated storage assets in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions of the United States, and a 100 percent interest in a butane storage cavern in West Virginia. We originally retained a 49 percent limited partner interest in Pipe Line Holdings. On May 1, 2013, we sold a five percent interest in Pipe Line Holdings to MPLX for $100 million , which was financed by MPLX with cash on hand. On March 1, 2014, we sold MPLX a 13 percent interest in Pipe Line Holdings for $310 million . MPLX financed this transaction with $40 million of cash on-hand and $270 million of borrowings on its bank revolving credit agreement. On October 30, 2014, we announced plans to substantially accelerate the growth of MPLX, which is expected to provide unitholders an average annual distribution growth rate percentage in the mid-20s over the next five years as we build meaningful scale more quickly. We believe this increased scale provides MPLX greater flexibility to fund organic projects and to pursue acquisition opportunities. On December 1, 2014, we sold and contributed interests in Pipe Line Holdings totaling 30.5 percent to MPLX for $600 million in cash and 2.9 million MPLX common units valued at $200 million . MPLX financed the sales portion of this transaction with $600 million of borrowings on its bank revolving credit facility. The sales and contribution of our interests in Pipe Line Holdings to MPLX resulted in a change of our ownership in Pipe Line Holdings, but not a change in control. We accounted for these sales as transactions between entities under common control and did not record a gain or loss. 43 Table of Contents On December 8, 2014, MPLX completed a public offering of 3.5 million common units at a price to the public of $66.68 per common unit, with net proceeds of $221 million . MPLX used the net proceeds from this offering to repay borrowings under its bank revolving credit facility and for general partnership purposes. On December 10, 2014, we exercised our right to maintain our two percent general partner interest in MPLX by purchasing 130 thousand general partner units for $9 million . On February 12, 2015, MPLX completed its initial underwritten public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of four percent unsecured senior notes due February 15, 2025 (the Senior Notes ). The Senior Notes were offered at a price to the public of 99.64 percent of par. The net proceeds of this offering were used to repay the amounts outstanding under its bank revolving credit facility, as well as for general partnership purposes. The following table summarizes the cash distributions we received from MPLX during 2014 and 2013 . (In millions) 2014 2013 Cash distributions received from MPLX: General partner distributions, including incentive distribution rights $ 4 $ 1 Limited partner distributions 72 56 Total $ 76 $ 57 The market value of the 19,980,619 MPLX common units and 36,951,515 MPLX subordinated units we owned at December 31, 2014 was $4.18 billion based on the December 31, 2014 closing unit price of $73.49 . Over time, we also believe there will be substantial value attributable to our general partnership interests. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 4 for additional information on MPLX. Acquisitions and Investments On September 30, 2014, we acquired from Hess all of its retail locations, transport operations and shipper history on various pipelines, including approximately 40 mbpd on Colonial Pipeline, for $2.82 billion . We refer to these assets as Hess Retail Operations and Related Assets and substantially all of these assets are part of our Speedway segment. This acquisition significantly expands our Speedway presence from nine to 22 states throughout the East Coast and Southeast and is aligned with our strategy to grow higher-valued, stable cash flow businesses. This acquisition also enables us to further leverage our integrated refining and transportation operations, providing an outlet for an incremental 200 mbpd of assured sales from our refining system. The transaction was funded with a combination of debt and available cash. Our financial results and operating statistics for the periods prior to the acquisition do not include amounts for Hess Retail Operations and Related Assets. In July 2014, we exercised our option to acquire a 35 percent ownership interest in Enbridge Inc. SAX pipeline, which will run from Flanagan, Ill. to Patoka, Ill. and is expected to be operational in late 2015. This option resulted from our agreement to be the anchor shipper on the SAX pipeline and our commitment to the Sandpiper pipeline project. During 2014 , we made contributions of $120 million to Illinois Extension Pipeline to fund our portion of the construction costs incurred-to-date on the SAX pipeline project. On April 1, 2014, we purchased a facility in Cincinnati, Ohio from Felda Iffco Sdn Bhd, Malaysia for $40 million . The plant currently produces biodiesel, glycerin and other by-products. The capacity of the plant is approximately 60 million gallons per year. In March 2014, we acquired from Chevron Raven Ridge Pipe Line Company an additional seven percent interest in Explorer for $77 million , bringing our ownership interest to 25 percent . Due to this increase in our ownership percentage, we now account for our investment in Explorer using the equity method of accounting and report Explorer as a related party. Explorer owns approximately 1,900 miles of refined products pipeline from Lake Charles, Louisiana to Hammond, Indiana. In November 2013, we agreed with Enbridge Energy Partners to serve as an anchor shipper for the Sandpiper pipeline, which will run from Beaver Lodge, North Dakota to Superior, Wisconsin. We also agreed to fund 37.5 percent of the construction of the Sandpiper pipeline project, which is currently estimated to cost $2.6 billion, of which approximately $1.0 billion is our share. We made contributions of $192 million during 2014 and have contributed $216 million since project inception. In exchange for our commitment to be an anchor shipper and our investment in the project, we will earn an approximate 27 percent equity interest in Enbridge Energy Partners North Dakota System when the Sandpiper pipeline is placed into service, which is expected to be in 2017. Enbridge Energy Partners North Dakota System currently includes approximately 240 miles of crude oil gathering pipelines connected to a transportation pipeline that is approximately 730 miles long. We will also have the option to increase our ownership interest to approximately 30 percent through additional investments in future system improvements. 44 Table of Contents On August 1, 2013 , we acquired from Mitsui & Co. (U.S.A.), Inc. its interests in three ethanol companies for $75 million . Under the purchase agreement, we acquired an additional 24 percent interest in TACE, bringing our ownership interest to 60 percent ; a 34 percent interest in TAEI, which holds a 50 percent ownership in TAME, bringing our direct and indirect ownership interest in TAME to 67 percent ; and a 40 percent interest in TAAE, which owns an ethanol production facility in Albion, Michigan. On October 1, 2013, our ownership interest in TAAE increased to 43 percent as a result of TAAE acquiring one of the owner interest. We hold a noncontrolling interest in each of these entities and account for them using the equity method of accounting since the minority owners have substantive participating rights. On February 1, 2013, we acquired from BP the 451,000 barrel per calendar day refinery in Texas City, Texas, three intrastate natural gas liquid pipelines originating at the refinery, four light product terminals, branded-jobber marketing contract assignments for the supply of approximately 1,200 branded sites, a 1,040 megawatt electric cogeneration facility and a 50 mbpd allocation of space on the Colonial Pipeline. We refer to these assets as the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets. We paid $1.49 billion for these assets, which included $935 million for inventory. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement, we may also be required to pay BP a contingent earnout of up to an additional $700 million over six years, subject to certain conditions. In July 2014, we paid BP $180 million for the first period contingent earnout. These assets are part of our Refining & Marketing and Pipeline Transportation segments. Our financial results and operating statistics for the periods prior to the acquisition do not include amounts for the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 for additional information on these acquisitions and investments. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 26 for information regarding our future contributions to the SAX pipeline project and the Sandpiper pipeline project. Share Repurchases On July 30, 2014, our board of directors approved an additional $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization expiring in July 2016 . As of December 31, 2014 , our board of directors had approved $8.0 billion in total share repurchase authorizations since January 1, 2012 and we have repurchased a total of $6.27 billion of our common stock under these authorizations, leaving $1.73 billion available for repurchases. Under these authorizations, we have acquired 89 million shares at an average cost per share of $70.35 . Liquidity As of December 31, 2014 , we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.49 billion and no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under our $2.5 billion revolving credit agreement or $1.3 billion trade receivables securitization facility. As of January 31, 2015, eligible trade receivables supported borrowings of $700 million . MPLX had $385 million of borrowings outstanding under its $1 billion revolving credit agreement as of December 31, 2014 . The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to the estimated construction costs, timing and completion of the Sandpiper and SAX pipeline projects and the share repurchase authorizations. Factors that could affect the estimated construction costs, timing and completion of the Sandpiper and SAX pipeline projects, include, but are not limited to, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. Factors that could affect the share repurchase authorizations and the timing of any repurchases include, but are not limited to, business conditions, availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Overview of Segments Refining & Marketing Refining & Marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our Refining & Marketing gross margin and refinery throughputs. Our Refining & Marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate Midwest (Chicago) and USGC crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. LLS prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products (6 barrels of LLS crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline, 2 barrels of ultra-low sulfur diesel and 1 barrel of three percent residual fuel oil) are used for these crack-spread calculations. 45 Table of Contents Refined product prices have historically moved relative to international crude oil prices like Brent crude. In recent years, domestic U.S. crude oils, such as WTI and LLS, traded at prices less than Brent due to the growth in U.S. crude oil production, logistical constraints and other market factors. These price discounts compared to Brent favorably impacted the LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread. During 2011 and continuing through the first half of 2013, WTI traded at prices significantly less than Brent and LLS, which favorably impacted our Refining & Marketing gross margin. The differential between WTI and LLS significantly narrowed during the second half of 2013 with a further narrowing broadly continuing through 2014. In addition, the differential between LLS and Brent narrowed significantly during the second half of 2014. The spread between domestic crude oils and Brent could remain narrow if there is a change in existing U.S. energy policy regarding crude oil exports, or if low crude oil prices reduce U.S. crude oil production growth substantially. If either were to occur, it could reduce our Refining & Marketing gross margin. Our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. The amount of this discount, the sweet/sour differential, can vary significantly, causing our Refining & Marketing gross margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude oil. In general, a larger sweet/sour differential will enhance our Refining & Marketing gross margin. Future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors, as well as U.S. energy policy. The following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions. (In millions, after-tax) LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread sensitivity (a) (per $1.00/barrel change) $ 450 Sweet/sour differential sensitivity (b) (per $1.00/barrel change) 200 LLS-WTI differential sensitivity (c) (per $1.00/barrel change) 100 Natural gas price sensitivity (per $1.00/million British thermal unit change) 140 (a) Weighted 38 percent Chicago and 62 percent USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads and assumes all other differentials and pricing relationships remain unchanged. (b) LLS (prompt) [delivered cost of sour crude oil: Arab Light, Kuwait, Maya, Western Canadian Select and Mars]. (c) Assumes 20 percent of crude oil throughput volumes are WTI-based domestic crude oil. In addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads, the sweet/sour differential and the discount of WTI to LLS, our Refining & Marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as: the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed; our refinery yields; the selling prices realized for refined products; the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to hedge price risk; the cost of products purchased for resale; and the potential impact of lower of cost or market adjustments to inventories in periods of declining prices. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The cost of our crude oil and refined product inventories is determined under the last in, first out ( LIFO ) method. During periods of rapidly declining prices, the LIFO cost basis of our crude oil and refined product inventories may have to be written down to market value. Despite a significant drop in refined product prices in 2014, we determined that the LIFO cost basis of our crude oil and refined product inventories was recoverable as of December 31, 2014 . If prices decrease further in 2015, we may be required to recognize a lower of cost or market adjustment to these inventories, which totaled approximately 96 million barrels as of December 31, 2014 . Refining & Marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refinery direct operating costs, which include turnaround and major maintenance, depreciation and amortization and other manufacturing expenses. Changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries, including purchased natural gas, and the level of maintenance costs. Planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. The following table lists the refineries that had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities for each of the last three years. Year Refinery 2014 Catlettsburg, Galveston Bay, Garyville and Robinson 2013 Canton, Catlettsburg, Galveston Bay, Garyville and Robinson 2012 Catlettsburg, Detroit, Garyville and Robinson 46 Table of Contents The table below sets forth the location and daily crude oil refining capacity of each of our refineries at December 31 of each year.

Speedway Our retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillate, which is the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, impacts the Speedway segment profitability. Numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand throughout the year, including local competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions. Gasoline demand in PADD 2 is estimated to have grown by about half a percent in 2014 after climbing by 1.4 percent in 2013. Meanwhile, gasoline demand in PADD 1 is estimated to have grown by 1.5 percent in 2014 after a 1.5 percent decline in 2013, reversing a three-year trend of declines and returning to 2012 levels. Strong economic growth in the last three quarters of 2014 and strongly falling prices throughout the second half supported gasoline demand. Distillate demand was supported by severe winter temperatures in early 2014 and a very strong harvest season. PADD 2 distillate demand is estimated to have grown by 3.7 percent in 2014 after climbing by 1.6 percent in 2013. PADD 1 estimated distillate demand grew over five percent after climbing by 8.8 percent in 2013. Market demand increases for gasoline and distillate generally increase the product margin we can realize. The gross margin on merchandise sold at convenience stores historically has been less volatile and has contributed substantially to Speedway gross margin. More than half of Speedway gross margin was derived from merchandise sales in 2014 . Speedway convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise, including prepared foods, beverages and non-food items. Pipeline Transportation The profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. A majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our common carrier pipelines serve our Refining & Marketing segment. In 2012, new transportation services agreements were entered into between MPC and MPLX, which resulted in higher tariff rates. The volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines. Key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. The volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines. In most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from May through September of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. As with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements. 47 Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations (In millions) 2014 2013 2014 vs. 2013 Variance 2012 2013 vs. 2012 Variance Revenues and other income: Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) $ 97,817 $ 100,160 $ (2,343 ) $ 82,243 $ 17,917 Income from equity method investments 153 36 117 26 10 Net gain on disposal of assets 21 6 15 177 (171 ) Other income 111 52 59 46 6 Total revenues and other income 98,102 100,254 (2,152 ) 82,492 17,762 Costs and expenses: Cost of revenues (excludes items below) 83,770 87,401 (3,631 ) 68,668 18,733 Purchases from related parties 505 357 148 280 77 Consumer excise taxes 6,685 6,263 422 5,709 554 Depreciation and amortization 1,326 1,220 106 995 225 Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,375 1,248 127 1,223 25 Other taxes 390 340 50 270 70 Total costs and expenses 94,051 96,829 (2,778 ) 77,145 19,684 Income from operations 4,051 3,425 626 5,347 (1,922 ) Net interest and other financial income (costs) (216 ) (179 ) (37 ) (109 ) (70 ) Income before income taxes 3,835 3,246 589 5,238 (1,992 ) Provision for income taxes 1,280 1,113 167 1,845 (732 ) Net income 2,555 2,133 422 3,393 (1,260 ) Less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 31 21 10 4 17 Net income attributable to MPC $ 2,524 $ 2,112 $ 412 $ 3,389 $ (1,277 ) Net income attributable to MPC increased $412 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and decreased $1.28 billion in 2013 compared to 2012 , primarily due to our Refining & Marketing segment income from operations, which increased $403 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and decreased $1.89 billion in 2013 compared to 2012 . The increase in Refining & Marketing segment income from operations in 2014 was primarily due to more favorable net product price realizations and higher USGC and Chicago crack spreads, partially offset by narrower crude oil differentials and higher turnaround and other direct operating costs . The decrease in 2013 was primarily due to narrower crude oil differentials and lower net product price realizations, partially offset by higher refinery throughput and sales volumes . Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) decreased $2.34 billion in 2014 compared to 2013 and increased $17.92 billion in 2013 compared to 2012 . The decrease in 2014 was primarily due to lower refined product sales prices, partially offset by an increase in refined product sales volumes and higher merchandise sales for our Speedway segment primarily attributable to the convenience stores acquired from Hess. The increase in 2013 was primarily due to higher refined product sales volumes, which were primarily associated with the acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery in February 2013, partially offset by a decrease in refined product sales prices. Consolidated refined product sales increased 52 mbpd in 2014 compared to 2013 and 468 mbpd in 2013 compared to 2012 . Income from equity method investments increased $117 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and $10 million in 2013 compared to 2012 . The increase in 2014 was primarily due to increases in income from our ethanol affiliates of $68 million and income from our pipeline affiliates of $49 million. The increase in income from our ethanol affiliates includes the affects of our acquisition of interests in TAAE, TACE and TAEI in August 2013. The higher income from our pipeline affiliates is primarily due to increases from LOOP LLC ( LOOP ) and Explorer, which is now accounted for as an equity method investment following our acquisition of an increased ownership interest in this pipeline company. The increase in 2013 was primarily due to an increase in income from our ethanol investments of $34 million, partially offset by a decrease in income from our investment in LOOP of $17 million. The increase in income from ethanol investments was primarily due to higher income in 2013 compared to 2012 and the acquisition of interests in TAAE, TACE and TAEI in 2013. 48 Table of Contents Net gain on disposal of assets increased $15 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and decreased $171 million in 2013 compared to 2012 , primarily due to the sale of two terminals and terminal assets in 2014 and a $171 million gain recognized in the third quarter of 2012 associated with the settlement agreement with the buyer of our Minnesota assets. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 for additional information on the Minnesota assets sale and subsequent settlement agreement with the buyer. Other income increased $59 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and $6 million in 2013 compared to 2012 . The increase in 2014 was primarily due to higher gains on sales of excess Renewable Identification Numbers ( RINs ) of $74 million, partially offset by an $11 million impairment in 2014 of an investment in a company accounted for using the cost method. The increase in 2013 was primarily due to higher gains on sales of excess RINs and dividends received from a pipeline affiliate, partially offset by the absence of $12 million of dividends received from our preferred equity interest in the buyer of our Minnesota assets during the third quarter of 2012. Cost of revenues decreased $3.63 billion in 2014 compared to 2013 and increased $18.73 billion in 2013 compared to 2012 . The decrease in 2014 was primarily due to : a decrease in refined product cost of sales of $5.01 billion, primarily due to a decrease in our average crude oil costs of $9.30 per barrel, partially offset by an increase in refined product sales volumes; partially offset by an increase in refinery direct operating costs of $913 million , or $1.37 per barrel of total refinery throughput, which included costs associated with significant planned turnaround activity; and an increase in merchandise cost of sales for our Speedway segment of $327 million, primarily attributable to the convenience stores acquired from Hess. The increase in 2013 was primarily due to : an increase in refined product cost of sales of $17.09 billion, primarily due to an increase in refined product sales volumes attributable to the acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery; and an increase in refinery direct operating costs of $1.62 billion , or $1.11 per barrel of total refinery throughput, primarily attributable to the addition of the Galveston Bay refinery, which had higher operating costs per barrel of throughput than the average of our other six refineries. Purchases from related parties increased $148 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and $77 million in 2013 compared to 2012 . The increase in 2014 was primarily due to acquisitions of ownership interests in TAAE in August 2013 and Explorer in March 2014, resulting in purchases from these companies totaling $118 million in 2014 and $24 million in 2013 , being reported as purchases from related parties while purchases from these companies prior to these acquisitions were reported as cost of revenues. In addition, we also had an increase in purchases from LOOP of $45 million in 2014 . The increase in 2013 was primarily due to higher ethanol volumes purchased from our ethanol investments, partially offset by lower ethanol prices and decreases in purchases from pipeline affiliates, including Centennial Pipeline LLC ( Centennial ). Consumer excise taxes increased $422 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and $554 million in 2013 compared to 2012 , primarily due to increases in taxable refined product sales volumes, including the effects of the acquisitions of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets and Hess Retail Operations and Related Assets. Depreciation and amortization increased $106 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and $225 million in 2013 compared to 2012 . The increase in 2014 was primarily due to completion of certain capital investments at our Galveston Bay refinery, an increase in the number of convenience stores in our Speedway segment and the implementation of corporate-level information technology projects, partially offset by an impairment of a light products terminal in 2013. The increase in 2013 was primarily due to the completion of the heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our Detroit, Michigan refinery in late 2012 and our acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets in February 2013. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $127 million in 2014 compared to 2013 , primarily due to increases in contract services, employee compensation and benefit expenses and credit card processing fees. 49 Table of Contents Other taxes increased $50 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and $70 million in 2013 compared to 2012 . The increase in 2014 was primarily due to increases in property taxes of $30 million, payroll taxes of $27 million and environmental taxes of $11 million, partially offset by decreases in other tax expenses. These increases were attributable to a number of factors including the acquisitions of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets and Hess Retail Operations and Related Assets and the absence of a Federal Oil Spill Tax refund received in 2013. The increase in 2013 was primarily due to increases in property taxes of $41 million, payroll taxes of $21 million and sales and use tax expense of $13 million. The increases in 2013 were attributable to a number of factors including the completion of the heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our Detroit refinery, the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets and Speedway acquisition of 97 convenience stores in 2012. Net interest and other financial costs increased $37 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and $70 million in 2013 compared to 2012 . The increase in 2014 was primarily due to an increase in long-term debt related to the acquisition of Hess Retail Operations and Related Assets and MPLX acquisition of additional interest in Pipe Line Holdings. The increase in 2013 was primarily due to a decrease in capitalized interest in 2013 due to the completion of the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project in late 2012. We capitalized interest of $27 million in 2014 , $28 million in 2013 and $101 million in 2012 . Provision for income taxes increased $167 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and decreased $732 million in 2013 compared to 2012 , primarily due to our income before income taxes, which increased $589 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and decreased $1.99 billion in 2013 compared to 2012 . The effective tax rates in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 are equivalent to or slightly less than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent benefit differences, including the domestic manufacturing deduction, partially offset by state and local tax expense. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 13 for further details. Segment Results Revenues are summarized by segment in the following table. (In millions) 2014 2013 2012 Refining & Marketing $ 91,734 $ 94,910 $ 76,710 Speedway 16,932 14,475 14,243 Pipeline Transportation 597 537 459 Segment revenues $ 109,263 $ 109,922 $ 91,412 Items included in both revenues and costs: Consumer excise taxes $ 6,685 $ 6,263 $ 5,709 Refining & Marketing segment revenues decreased $3.18 billion in 2014 compared to 2013 and increased $18.20 billion in 2013 compared to 2012 . The decrease in 2014 was primarily due to lower refined product sales prices, partially offset by an increase in refined product sales volumes. The increase in 2013 was primarily due to an increase in refined product sales volumes related to the Galveston Bay refinery acquired in February 2013, partially offset by lower refined product selling prices. The table below shows our Refining & Marketing segment refined product sales volumes and prices. 2014 2013 2012 Refining & Marketing segment: Refined product sales volumes (thousands of barrels per day) (a) 2,125 2,075 1,599 Refined product sales destined for export (thousands of barrels per day) 275 218 123 Average refined product sales prices (dollars per gallon) $ 2.71 $ 2.87 $ 3.00 (a) Includes intersegment sales and sales destined for export.

The increase in intersegment refined product sales volumes for 2014 was primarily due to the acquisition of convenience stores from Hess. 2014 2013 2012 Refining & Marketing intersegment sales to Speedway: Intersegment sales (in millions) $ 10,912 $ 9,294 $ 8,782 Refined product sales volumes (millions of gallons) 3,766 2,976 2,727 Average refined product sales prices (dollars per gallon) $ 2.89 $ 3.11 $ 3.21 Speedway segment revenues increased $2.46 billion in 2014 compared to 2013 and $232 million in 2013 compared to 2012 , primarily due to increases in gasoline and distillate sales of $1.98 billion and $138 million , respectively, and increases in merchandise sales of $476 million and $77 million , respectively. The increases in gasoline and distillate sales were primarily due to volume increases of 796 million gallons and 119 million gallons , respectively, primarily due to increases in the number of convenience stores, partially offset by decreases in gasoline and distillate selling prices of $0.20 per gallon and $0.09 per gallon , respectively. The increases in merchandise sales were primarily due to increases in the number of convenience stores and higher same store sales. The increase in the number of convenience stores for 2014 was primarily due to the acquisition of convenience stores from Hess. The following table includes certain revenue statistics for the Speedway segment. 2014 2013 2012 Convenience stores at period-end 2,746 1,478 1,464 Gasoline & distillate sales (millions of gallons) 3,942 3,146 3,027 Average gasoline & distillate sales prices (dollars per gallon) $ 3.25 $ 3.45 $ 3.54 Merchandise sales (in millions) $ 3,611 $ 3,135 $ 3,058 Same store gasoline sales volume (period over period) (0.7 )% 0.5 % (0.8 )% Same store merchandise sales (period over period) (a) 5.0 % 4.3 % 7.0 % (a) Excludes cigarettes. Pipeline Transportation segment revenue increased $60 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and $78 million in 2013 compared to 2012 . The increase in 2014 was primarily due to an increase in revenue related to volume deficiency credits and higher average tariffs received on crude oil and refined products shipped, partially offset by lower refined products and crude oil pipeline throughput volumes. The increase in 2013 was primarily due to higher average tariffs received on the volumes of crude oil and products shipped, higher crude oil throughput volumes and an increase in storage fees and other revenue. The following table includes throughput volumes for the Pipeline Transportation segment. 2014 2013 2012 Pipeline Throughputs (thousands of barrels per day): (a) Crude oil pipelines 1,241 1,293 1,191 Refined products pipelines 878 911 980 Total 2,119 2,204 2,171 (a) On owned common-carrier pipelines, excluding equity method investments. 51 Table of Contents Income before income taxes and income from operations by segment are summarized in the following table. (In millions) 2014 2013 2012 Income from operations by segment: Refining & Marketing $ 3,609 $ 3,206 $ 5,098 Speedway 544 375 310 Pipeline Transportation (a) 280 210 216 Items not allocated to segments: Corporate and other unallocated items (a) (286 ) (271 ) (336 ) Minnesota Assets sale settlement gain 183 Pension settlement expenses (b) (96 ) (95 ) (124 ) Income from operations 4,051 3,425 5,347 Net interest and other financial income (costs) (216 ) (179 ) (109 ) Income before income taxes $ 3,835 $ 3,246 $ 5,238 (a) Included in the Pipeline Transportation segment for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 are $19 million , $20 million and $4 million of corporate overhead expenses attributable to MPLX, which were included in items not allocated to segments prior to MPLX October 31, 2012 initial public offering. These expenses are not currently allocated to other segments. (b) See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 23 . Refining & Marketing segment income from operations increased $403 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and decreased $1.89 billion in 2013 compared to 2012 . The increase in 2014 was primarily due to more favorable net product price realizations and higher USGC and Chicago crack spreads, partially offset by narrower crude oil differentials and higher turnaround and other direct operating costs . The decrease in 2013 was primarily due to narrower crude oil differentials and lower net product price realizations, partially offset by higher refinery throughput and sales volumes . The following table presents certain market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our Refining & Marketing segment business. (Dollars per barrel) 2014 2013 2012 Chicago LLS 6-3-2-1 (a)(b) $ 9.56 $ 8.16 $ 6.74 USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 (a) 7.23 6.24 6.67 Blended 6-3-2-1 (a)(c) 8.11 6.97 6.71 LLS 96.90 107.38 111.67 WTI 92.91 98.05 94.15 LLS WTI crude oil differential (a) 3.99 9.33 17.52 Sweet/Sour crude oil differential (a)(d) 6.97 8.53 12.47 (a) All spreads and differentials are measured against prompt LLS. (b) Calculation utilizes USGC three percent residual fuel oil price as a proxy for Chicago three percent residual fuel oil price. (c) Blended Chicago/USGC crack spread is 38 / 62 percent in 2014 , 38 / 62 percent in 2013 and 52 / 48 percent in 2012 based on MPC refining capacity by region in each period. (d) LLS (prompt) [delivered cost of sour crude oil: Arab Light, Kuwait, Maya, Western Canadian Select and Mars]. Based on the market indicators above and our refinery throughputs, we estimate the following impacts on Refining & Marketing segment income from operations for 2014 compared to 2013 and for 2013 compared to 2012 : The Chicago LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread increased $1.40 per barrel in 2014 compared to 2013 and $1.42 per barrel in 2013 compared to 2012 , which had positive impacts on segment income of $354 million and $291 million, respectively . The USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread increased $0.99 per barrel in 2014 compared to 2013 which had a positive impact on segment income of $407 million. The USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread decreased $0.43 per barrel in 2013 compared to 2012. This decrease was offset by an increase in refinery throughput volumes, primarily due to the acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery, which resulted in a positive impact to segment income of $949 million in 2013 compared to 2012. 52 Table of Contents The LLS-WTI crude oil differential narrowed $5.34 per barrel in 2014 compared to 2013 and $8.19 per barrel in 2013 compared to 2012 , which had negative impacts on segment income of $695 million and $978 million, respectively . The sweet/sour crude oil differential narrowed $1.56 per barrel in 2014 compared to 2013 and $3.94 per barrel in 2013 compared to 2012 , which had negative impacts on segment income of $489 million and $273 million, respectively . The unfavorable impact from 2013 compared to 2012 was partially offset by higher refinery throughput and sales volumes. The market indicators shown above use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and products sold. Differences in our results compared to these market indicators, including product price realizations, mix and crude costs as well as other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances, had estimated positive impacts on Refining & Marketing segment income of $1.73 billion in 2014 compared to 2013 and $298 million in 2013 compared to 2012 . We estimate the positive impact for 2014 was primarily due to more favorable net product price realizations as compared to spot market values and a favorable effect from valuing year end inventories using the LIFO method of accounting. We estimate the positive impact for 2013 was primarily due to favorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs compared to market indicators, partially offset by lower product price realizations. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognized a build in our crude oil and refined products inventories. For purposes of our annual LIFO inventory costing, this increase in inventory is recorded based on pricing at the beginning of 2014, which was substantially higher than fourth quarter prices. As a result, Refining & Marketing segment income for the fourth quarter reflects a favorable effect of approximately $240 million. Comparing 2014 to 2013, the favorable LIFO impact was approximately $130 million. The following table summarizes our refinery throughputs. 2014 2013 2012 Refinery throughputs ( thousands of barrels per day ): Crude oil refined 1,622 1,589 1,195 Other charge and blendstocks 184 213 168 Total 1,806 1,802 1,363 Sour crude oil throughput percent 52 53 53 WTI-priced crude oil throughput percent 19 21 28 Total refinery throughputs increased 439 mbpd in 2013 compared to 2012 , primarily due to the Galveston Bay refinery, which we acquired on February 1, 2013. The following table includes certain key operating statistics for the Refining & Marketing segment. 2014 2013 2012 Refining & Marketing gross margin (dollars per barrel) (a) $ 15.05 $ 13.24 $ 17.85 Refinery direct operating costs (dollars per barrel): (b) Planned turnaround and major maintenance $ 1.80 $ 1.20 $ 1.00 Depreciation and amortization 1.41 1.36 1.44 Other manufacturing (c) 4.86 4.14 3.15 Total $ 8.07 $ 6.70 $ 5.59 (a) Sales revenue less cost of refinery inputs and purchased products, divided by total refinery throughputs. (b) Per barrel of total refinery throughputs. (c) Includes utilities, labor, routine maintenance and other operating costs. 53 Table of Contents Refinery direct operating costs increased $1.37 per barrel in 2014 compared to 2013 and $1.11 per barrel in 2013 compared to 2012 , which include increases in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs of $0.60 per barrel and $0.20 per barrel, respectively, and increases in other manufacturing costs of $0.72 per barrel and $0.99 per barrel, respectively. The increase in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs for 2014 was primarily attributable to the Galveston Bay, Robinson and Catlettsburg refineries, partially offset by decreases at the Garyville and Canton refineries. The increase in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs for 2013 was primarily attributable to the Galveston Bay refinery. The increases in other manufacturing costs were primarily attributable to higher energy costs, catalyst expenses and routine maintenance costs for 2014 and the addition of the Galveston Bay refinery for 2013, which had higher operating costs per barrel of throughput than the average of our other six refineries. We purchase RINs to satisfy a portion of our RFS2 compliance. Our expenses associated with purchased RINs were $141 million in 2014 , $264 million in 2013 and $105 million in 2012 . The decrease in 2014 was primarily due to decreases in the average cost of ethanol and biomass-based biodiesel RINs and decreases in our estimated advanced biofuel and ethanol obligation volumes. The increase in 2013 was primarily due to increases in the average cost of ethanol and biodiesel RINs. Speedway segment income from operations increased $169 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and $65 million in 2013 compared to 2012 , primarily due to increases in our gasoline and distillate gross margin of $246 million and $54 million , respectively, and increases in our merchandise gross margin of $150 million and $30 million , respectively, partially offset by higher operating expenses. The increases were primarily attributable to increases in the number of convenience stores, which for 2014 was primarily due to the acquisition of convenience stores from Hess. The increases in merchandise gross margin were related to a combination of higher merchandise and food sales and improved margins. The convenience stores acquired from Hess contributed $113 million to Speedway segment income from operations in 2014. The following table includes margin statistics for the Speedway segment. 2014 2013 2012 Gasoline & distillate gross margin (dollars per gallon) (a) $ 0.1775 $ 0.1441 $ 0.1318 Merchandise gross margin (in millions) $ 975 $ 825 $ 795 Merchandise gross margin percent 27.0 % 26.3 % 26.0 % (a) The price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, divided by gasoline and distillate sales volume. Pipeline Transportation segment income from operations increased $70 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and decreased $6 million in 2013 compared to 2012 . The increase in 2014 was primarily due to higher pipeline transportation revenue and an increase in income from our pipeline affiliates, which was primarily attributable to our investment in LOOP, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses primarily attributable to the proposed Cornerstone pipeline project and pipeline maintenance costs. The decrease in 2013 was primarily due to higher operating expenses and depreciation and lower pipeline affiliate income, partially offset by higher transportation revenue. The higher expenses and revenues were primarily attributable to the formation of MPLX. Corporate and other unallocated expenses increased $15 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and decreased $65 million in 2013 compared to 2012 , primarily due to costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of Hess Retail Operations and Related Assets in 2014 and lower unallocated employee benefit expenses and lower employee incentive compensation expenses in 2013 compared to 2012. We recognized a gain of $183 million in 2012 associated with the settlement agreement with the buyer of our Minnesota assets, which included $86 million of the deferred gain that was recorded when the sale transaction was originally closed. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 for additional information on the Minnesota assets sale and subsequent settlement with the buyer. We recorded pretax pension settlement expenses of $96 million in 2014 , $95 million in 2013 and $124 million in 2012 resulting from the level of employee lump sum retirement distributions that occurred during these years. 54 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $1.49 billion at December 31, 2014 compared to $2.29 billion at December 31, 2013 . Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the past three years is presented in the following table. (In millions) 2014 2013 2012 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,110 $ 3,405 $ 4,492 Investing activities (4,543 ) (2,756 ) (1,452 ) Financing activities 635 (3,217 ) (1,259 ) Total $ (798 ) $ (2,568 ) $ 1,781 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $295 million in 2014 compared to 2013 , primarily due to unfavorable changes in working capital of $892 million compared to 2013, partially offset by an increase in net income of $422 million and non-cash income adjustments of $175 million . Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $1.09 billion in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to decreases in net income of $1.26 billion and non-cash income adjustments of $453 million, partially offset by favorable changes in working capital of $626 million compared to 2012. For 2014 , changes in working capital were a net $694 million use of cash, primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and an increase in inventories, partially offset by a decrease in current receivables. Changes from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014 per the consolidated balance sheets, excluding the impact of acquisitions, were as follows: Accounts payable decreased $1.65 billion from year-end 2013 , primarily due to lower crude oil payable prices, partially offset by higher crude oil payable volumes. Inventories increased $796 million from year-end 2013 , primarily due to higher refined product and crude oil inventory volumes. Current receivables decreased $1.63 billion from year-end 2013 , primarily due to lower refined product and crude oil receivable prices. For 2013, changes in working capital were a net $198 million source of cash, primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by increases in current receivables and inventory volumes. Accounts payable increased $1.45 billion from year-end 2012, primarily due to higher crude oil payable volumes, and current receivables increased $949 million from year-end 2012, primarily due to higher refined product receivable volumes attributable to an increase in refined product sales volumes. Both of these increases are associated with the Galveston Bay refinery acquired in February 2013. Changes in inventories were a $305 million use of cash in 2013, primarily due to higher refined product and crude oil inventory volumes. For 2012, changes in working capital were a net $428 million use of cash, primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulting primarily from reductions in crude oil prices and payable volumes, partially offset by a decrease in current receivables resulting primarily from reductions in crude oil prices and receivable volumes. Cash flows used in investing activities increased $1.79 billion in 2014 compared to 2013 and $1.30 billion in 2013 compared to 2012. The investing activity is further discussed below. 55 Table of Contents The consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash.

The acquisition of Hess Retail Operations and Related Assets comprised 58 percent of our total capital spending in 2014. The acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets comprised 49 percent of our total capital spending in 2013. The Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project, which we completed in 2012, comprised 46 percent (excluding capitalized interest associated with this project) of our Refining & Marketing segment capital spending in 2012. Cash provided by disposal of assets totaled $27 million , $16 million and $53 million in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. The $53 million of cash from asset disposals in 2012 primarily included proceeds from a settlement agreement with the buyer of our Minnesota assets. Net investments were a $404 million use of cash in 2014 compared to a $74 million use of cash in 2013 and a $51 million source of cash in 2012 . The change in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to increases in contributions to the Sandpiper and SAX pipeline projects of $287 million and our investment in Explorer of $77 million , partially offset by a return of capital from our ethanol affiliates of $9 million. The change in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to investments in our ethanol affiliates of $75 million and the Sandpiper pipeline project of $24 million. Financing activities were a $635 million source of cash in 2014 , a $3.22 billion use of cash in 2013 and a $1.26 billion use of cash in 2012 . The sources of cash primarily consisted of net long-term debt borrowings in 2014 and proceeds from the issuance of MPLX common units in 2014 and 2012. The uses of cash in all three years primarily consisted of common stock repurchases through open market purchases and our ASR programs and dividend payments. Long-term debt borrowings and repayments were a net $3.25 billion source of cash in 2014 compared to a $21 million use of cash in 2013 and a $17 million use of cash in 2012 . During 2014 , we issued $1.95 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and borrowed $700 million under a term loan credit agreement to finance the acquisition of Hess Retail Operations and Related Assets. In addition, MPLX had net borrowings of $635 million under its revolving credit agreement and term loan agreement. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 20 for additional information on our long-term debt. 56 Table of Contents Cash used in common stock repurchases totaled $2.13 billion in 2014 , $2.79 billion in 2013 and $1.35 billion in 2012 associated with the share repurchase plans authorized by our board of directors. The table below summarizes our total share repurchases. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 10 for further discussion of the share repurchase plans. (In millions, except per share data) 2014 2013 2012 Number of shares repurchased (a) 24 37 28 Cash paid for shares repurchased $ 2,131 $ 2,793 $ 1,350 Effective average cost per delivered share $ 88.63 $ 76.14 $ 46.73 (a) Shares repurchased in 2013 includes 1 million shares received under the November 2012 ASR program, which were paid for in 2012. Cash used in dividend payments totaled $524 million in 2014 , $484 million in 2013 and $407 million in 2012 . The increases were primarily due to increases in our base dividend, partially offset by a decrease in the number of outstanding shares of our common stock as a result of share repurchases. Dividends per share were $1.84 in 2014 , $1.54 in 2013 and $1.20 in 2012. Cash proceeds from the issuance of MPLX common units were $221 million in 2014 and $407 million in 2012. The initial public offering in 2012 represented the sale of a 26.4 percent interest in MPLX. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 4 for further discussion of MPLX. Derivative Instruments See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk. Capital Resources Our liquidity totaled $5.27 billion at December 31, 2014 consisting of: December 31, 2014 (In millions) Total Capacity Outstanding Borrowings Available Capacity Revolving credit agreement (a) $ 2,500 $ $ 2,500 Trade receivables securitization facility (b) 1,280 1,280 Total $ 3,780 $ $ 3,780 Cash and cash equivalents 1,494 Total liquidity $ 5,274 (a) Excludes MPLX $1 billion revolving credit agreement, which had $385 million of borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2014 . (b) Availability under our $1.3 billion trade receivables securitization facility is a function of refined product selling prices, which will be lower in a sustained lower price environment. As of January 31, 2015, eligible trade receivables supported borrowings of $700 million . Because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements, including capital spending programs, the repurchase of shares of our common stock, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. MPC Revolving Credit Agreement We have a $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement ( Credit Agreement ) in place with a maturity date of September 14, 2017. The Credit Agreement includes letter of credit issuing capacity of up to $2.0 billion and swingline loan capacity of up to $100 million . We may increase our borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement by up to an additional $500 million , subject to certain conditions including the consent of the lenders whose commitments would be increased. In addition, the maturity date may be extended for up to two additional one -year periods subject to the approval of lenders holding greater than 50 percent of the commitments then outstanding, provided that the commitments of any non-consenting lenders will be terminated on the then-effective maturity date. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin or the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin. We are charged various fees and expenses in connection with the Credit Agreement, including administrative agent fees, commitment fees on the unused portion of our borrowing capacity and fees related to issued and outstanding letters of credit. The applicable interest rates and certain of the fees fluctuate based on the credit ratings in effect from time to time on our long-term debt. 57 Table of Contents There were no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2014 . Trade receivables securitization facility On December 18, 2013 , we entered into a three -year, $1.3 billion trade receivables securitization facility with a group of financial institutions that act as committed purchasers, conduit purchasers, letter of credit issuers and managing agents under the facility. The facility is evidenced by a Receivables Purchase Agreement and a Second Amended and Restated Receivables Sale Agreement and replaces the previously existing accounts receivable facility that was set to expire on June 30, 2014 . The facility consists of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Marathon Petroleum Company LP ( MPC LP ), selling or contributing on an on-going basis all of its trade receivables (including trade receivables acquired from Marathon Petroleum Trading Canada LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPC LP), together with all related security and interests in the proceeds thereof, without recourse, to another wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary, MPC Trade Receivables Company LLC ( TRC ), in exchange for a combination of cash, equity or a subordinated note issued by TRC to MPC LP. TRC, in turn, has the ability to finance its purchase of the receivables from MPC LP by selling undivided ownership interests in qualifying trade receivables, together with all related security and interests in the proceeds thereof, without recourse, to the purchasing group in exchange for cash proceeds. The facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit of up to an initial amount of $1.25 billion , provided that the aggregate credit exposure of the purchasing group is limited to no more than $1.3 billion at any one time. To the extent that TRC retains an ownership interest in the receivables it has purchased or received from MPC LP, such interest will be included in our consolidated financial statements solely as a result of the consolidation of the financial statements of TRC with those of MPC. The receivables sold or contributed to TRC are available first and foremost to satisfy claims of the creditors of TRC and are not available to satisfy the claims of creditors of MPC. TRC has granted a security interest in all of its assets to the purchasing group to secure its obligations under the Receivables Purchase Agreement. Proceeds from the sale of undivided percentage ownership interests in qualifying receivables under the facility will be reflected as debt on our consolidated balance sheet. We will remain responsible for servicing the receivables sold to the purchasing group. TRC pays floating-rate interest charges and usage fees on amounts outstanding under the facility, if any, and certain other fees related to the administration of the facility and letters of credit that are issued and outstanding under the facility. As of December 31, 2014 , eligible trade receivables supported borrowings of $1.28 billion . There were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2014 . Availability under our trade receivables securitization facility is a function of refined product selling prices, which will be lower in a sustained lower price environment. As of January 31, 2015, eligible trade receivables supported borrowings of $700 million . MPLX Credit Agreement On November 20, 2014, MPLX entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders ( MPLX Credit Agreement ), which provides for a five -year $1 billion bank revolving credit facility and a $250 million term loan facility. The maturity date on both facilities is November 20, 2019. The bank revolving credit facility includes letter of credit issuing capacity of up to $250 million and swingline loan capacity of up to $100 million . The borrowing capacity under the MPLX Credit Agreement may be increased by up to an additional $500 million , subject to certain conditions, including the consent of the lenders whose commitments would increase. In addition, the maturity date may be extended up to two additional one -year periods subject to the approval of lenders holding the majority of the commitments then outstanding, provided that the commitments of any non-consenting lenders will be terminated on the original maturity date. The term loan facility was drawn in full on November 20, 2014. The maturity date for the term loan facility may be extended for up to two additional one -year periods subject to the consent of the lenders holding a majority of the outstanding term loan borrowings, provided that the portion of the term loan borrowings held by any non-consenting lenders will continue to be due and payable on the original maturity date. The borrowings under this facility during 2014 were at an average interest rate of 1.4 percent . Borrowings under the MPLX Credit Agreement bear interest at either the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) plus a specified margin. MPLX is charged various fees and expenses in connection with the agreement, including administrative agent fees, commitment fees on the unused portion of the bank revolving credit facility and fees with respect to issued and outstanding letters of credit. The applicable interest rates and certain of the fees fluctuate based the credit ratings in effect from time to time on MPLX long-term debt. 58 Table of Contents In connection with entering into this new credit agreement, MPLX terminated its previously existing $500 million five -year MPLX Operations LLC bank revolving credit agreement, dated as of September 14, 2012. During 2014 , MPLX borrowed $280 million under the MPLX Operations LLC bank revolving credit agreement, at an average interest rate of 1.5 percent , per annum, and repaid all of these borrowings. During 2014 , MPLX borrowed $630 million under the new revolving credit agreement, at an average interest rate of 1.4 percent , per annum, and repaid $245 million of these borrowings. At December 31, 2014 , MPLX had $385 million of borrowings and no letters of credit outstanding under the MPLX Credit Agreement, resulting in total unused loan availability of $615 million , or 61.5 percent of the borrowing capacity. Debt-to-Total-Capital Ratio As described in further detail below, the increase in debt as of year-end 2014 compared to year-end 2013 was primarily related to financing a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Hess Retail Operations and Related Assets. Our debt-to-total capital ratio (total debt to total debt-plus-equity) was 37 percent and 23 percent at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. December 31, (In millions) 2014 2013 Long-term debt due within one year $ 27 $ 23 Long-term debt 6,610 3,373 Total debt $ 6,637 $ 3,396 Calculation of debt-to-total capital ratio: Total debt $ 6,637 $ 3,396 Plus equity 11,390 11,332 Total debt plus equity $ 18,027 $ 14,728 Debt-to-total capital ratio 37 % 23 % MPC Term Loan Agreement On August 26, 2014 , we entered into a $700 million five -year senior unsecured term loan credit agreement (the Term Loan Agreement ) with a syndicate of lenders to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Hess Retail Operations and Related Assets. The Term Loan Agreement matures on September 24, 2019 and may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. We are obligated to pay certain customary fees under the Term Loan Agreement, including an annual administrative fee. Amounts outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement bear interest at either of the following rates at our election (i) the sum of the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) , plus a margin ranging between 0.875 percent to 1.75 percent , depending on our credit ratings, or (ii) the sum of the Base Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement), plus a margin ranging between zero percent to 0.75 percent , depending on our credit ratings. The borrowings under this facility during 2014 were at an average interest rate of 1.3 percent . Senior Notes On September 5, 2014, we completed a public offering of $1.95 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes (the Senior Notes ), consisting of $750 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes due 2024, $800 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes due 2044 and $400 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes due 2054. The net proceeds from the offering of the Senior Notes were approximately $1.92 billion , after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. The net proceeds were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Hess Retail Operations and Related Assets. Interest on each series of Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing on March 15, 2015. The Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of ours and rank equally with all our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Term Loan Agreement, the Credit Agreement and the MPLX Credit Agreement contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types. The financial covenant included in the Term Loan Agreement and the MPC Credit Agreement requires us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement and the MPC Credit Agreement) of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2014 , we were in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization of 0.33 to 1.00, as well as the other covenants contained in the Term Loan Agreement and the MPC Credit Agreement. 59 Table of Contents The MPLX Credit Agreement includes certain representations and warranties, affirmative and restrictive covenants and events of default that we consider to be usual and customary for an agreement of this type. The MPLX Credit Agreement includes a financial covenant that requires MPLX to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (both as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters of no greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 for up to two fiscal quarters following certain acquisitions). Consolidated EBITDA is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period. Other covenants restrict MPLX from incurring debt, creating liens on its assets and entering into transactions with affiliates. As of December 31, 2014 , MPLX was in compliance with the covenants contained in the MPLX Credit Agreement, including a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of 2.8 to 1.0. Our intention is to maintain an investment grade credit profile. As of February 9, 2015, the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows. Rating Agency Rating Moody Baa2 (stable outlook) Standard & Poor BBB (stable outlook) Fitch BBB (stable outlook) The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant. Neither the Credit Agreement, the MPLX Credit Agreement nor our trade receivables securitization facility contains credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. However, any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings would increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under the Credit Agreement and our trade receivables securitization facility. In addition, a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment grade levels could, under certain circumstances, decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables securitization facility, impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis and could result in us having to post letters of credit under existing transportation services agreements. Capital Requirements We have a capital and investment budget for 2015 of $2.53 billion , excluding capitalized interest. Additional details related to the 2015 capital and investment budget are discussed in the Capital Budget Outlook section below. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement for the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets, we may be required to pay the seller a contingent earnout of up to an additional $700 million over six years, subject to certain conditions. In July 2014, we paid $180 million for the first period contingent earnout. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes 5 and 18 . While we have no required contributions to our pension plans for 2015, we may make voluntary contributions at our discretion. On January 31, 2015 , our board of directors approved a 50 cents per share dividend, payable March 10, 2015 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 18, 2015 . On July 30, 2014, our board of directors approved an additional $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization expiring in July 2016 . As of December 31, 2014 , our board of directors had approved $8.0 billion in total share repurchase authorizations since January 1, 2012 and we have repurchased a total of $6.27 billion of our common stock under these authorizations, leaving $1.73 billion available for repurchases. Under these authorizations, we have acquired 89 million shares at an average cost per share of $70.35 . We may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of future repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time. The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to share repurchase authorizations. Factors that could affect the share repurchase authorizations and the timing of any repurchases include, but are not limited to business conditions, availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 60 Table of Contents Contractual Cash Obligations The table below provides aggregated information on our consolidated obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of December 31, 2014 . The contractual obligations detailed below do not include our contractual obligations to MPLX under various fee-based commercial agreements as these transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. (In millions) Total 2015 2016-2017 2018-2019 Later Years Long-term debt (a) $ 11,141 $ 276 $ 1,256 $ 1,809 $ 7,800 Capital lease obligations (b) 470 47 90 84 249 Operating lease obligations 1,326 249 359 250 468 Purchase obligations: (c) Crude oil, feedstock, refined product and renewable fuel contracts (d) 10,379 7,500 800 1,023 1,056 Transportation and related contracts 4,336 257 656 840 2,583 Contracts to acquire property, plant and equipment (e)(f) 1,727 784 943 Service, materials and other contracts (g) 2,047 478 532 402 635 Total purchase obligations 18,489 9,019 2,931 2,265 4,274 Other long-term liabilities reported in the consolidated balance sheet (h) 1,111 77 181 235 618 Total contractual cash obligations $ 32,537 $ 9,668 $ 4,817 $ 4,643 $ 13,409 (a) Includes interest payments for our senior notes, term loans and the MPLX Credit Agreement and commitment and administrative fees for our Credit Agreement, the MPLX Credit Agreement and our trade receivables securitization facility. (b) Capital lease obligations represent future minimum payments. (c) Includes both short- and long-term purchases obligations. (d) These contracts include variable price arrangements with estimated prices to be paid primarily based on futures curves. (e) Includes $703 million to fund 37.5 percent of the construction of the Sandpiper pipeline project and $185 million to fund 35 percent of the construction of the SAX pipeline project. (f) Includes $520 million of contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 for additional information on this acquisition. (g) Primarily includes contracts to purchase services such as utilities, supplies and various other maintenance and operating services. (h) Primarily includes obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits including medical and life insurance, which we have estimated through 2024 . See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 23 . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to indemnities and guarantees that are described below. Although these arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on them to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources. We have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees. In conjunction with the Spinoff, we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to Marathon Oil. These arrangements are described in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 26 . Capital Budget Outlook We have a capital and investment budget for 2015 of $2.53 billion , excluding capitalized interest and any acquisitions we may make. This represents a 27 percent increase from our 2014 spending, excluding the acquisition of Hess Retail Operations and Related Assets. The budget includes spending on refining, retail marketing, transportation, logistics and brand marketing projects as well as amounts designated for corporate activities. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant. Refining & Marketing The Refining & Marketing segment 2015 capital budget is $1.28 billion , which includes $234 million for midstream assets, approximately $370 million for refining margin enhancement projects and approximately $675 million for refinery-sustaining capital. A number of these projects span multiple years. 61 Table of Contents The $234 million budgeted for midstream assets includes projects that will allow us to process condensate from the Utica Shale region and grow Gulf Coast export capabilities. We have a project to build a condensate splitter at our Catlettsburg refinery to allow it to process up to 35 mbpcd of condensate from the Utica Shale region that we expect to complete in 2015. We began operation of a condensate splitter at our Canton refinery at the end of 2014 to allow it to process up to 25 mbpcd of condensate. We have projects at our Galveston Bay and Garyville refineries to increase export capabilities by 165 mbpd by 2018. In 2015, we expect to complete projects representing 50 mbpd of that total. The $370 million budgeted for refining margin enhancement projects includes projects that will allow us to increase our diesel production and to process light crude oil from the Utica Shale region. At our Garyville refinery, we completed a hydrocracker expansion in the first quarter of 2014 that increased the hydrocracker capacity to 110 mbpcd and we expect to complete a project to expand the distillate hydrotreater by 10 mbpcd in the first quarter of 2015. At our Galveston Bay refinery, we have a hydrocracker project designed to increase our ULSD production by nine mbpd by shifting yields from gasoline, which we expect to complete in 2015. At our Robinson refinery, we have a similar project to revamp our distillate hydrocracker to improve margins by processing more feedstock at a lower conversion and shifting approximately five mbpd of light products to ULSD production and a project to increase the light crude oil processing capacity by 30 mbpcd, which will allow it to run 100 percent light crude oil. We expect to complete these projects in 2015 and 2016, respectively. During 2014, we worked on a front-end engineering and design study for a residual fuel hydrocracker project at our Garyville refinery intended to increase margins by upgrading residual fuel to ULSD and gas oil. We are deferring a final investment decision on this project with estimated total costs of $2.2 billion to $2.5 billion as we further evaluate the implications of current market conditions on the project. As of December 31, 2014, we have capitalized $90 million of costs associated with this project. If a decision is made to not pursue this project, there could be a future impairment of the costs incurred for the project. The remaining $675 million budget is primarily allocated to maintaining facilities and meeting regulatory requirements at our refineries. Speedway The Speedway segment 2015 capital budget of $452 million is focused on continued growth and integrating the convenience stores acquired from Hess into Speedway. The budget includes approximately $240 million for the Hess retail outlets primarily associated with store conversions and remodels, which will drive incremental merchandise sales. The remaining budget is primarily for new convenience store construction and land acquisition to expand our markets and remodeling and rebuilding projects to upgrade and enhance our existing facilities. We have identified numerous opportunities for new convenience stores or store rebuilds in our existing market, western Pennsylvania and Tennessee. Also included in the capital budget are expenditures for technology, equipment and dispenser upgrades. Pipeline Transportation The Pipeline Transportation segment 2015 capital budget of $659 million is focused on projects to support the changing energy landscape in the United States, including equity investments in major pipeline projects, new infrastructure and upgrades to replace or enhance our existing facilities. We expect to invest approximately $310 million in the Sandpiper and SAX pipeline projects in 2015 and $1.5 billion in total. In addition, pending the completion of a binding open season, MPLX is planning to construct the Cornerstone pipeline project to connect Utica Shale production in southeastern Ohio to our Canton refinery and related build-out opportunities, which is expected to cost approximately $200 million and is anticipated to be operational in 2016. Corporate and Other The remaining 2015 capital budget includes $140 million , primarily related to an expansion project for our corporate headquarters and upgrades to information technology systems. 62 Table of Contents Our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors, including cash provided by operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. The discussion of liquidity and capital resources above also contains forward-looking statements regarding expected capital and investment spending, costs for projects under construction, project completion dates and expectations or projections about strategies and goals for growth, upgrades and expansion. The forward-looking statements about our capital and investment budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for crude oil and refinery feedstocks and refined products, actions of competitors, delays in obtaining necessary third-party approvals, changes in labor, materials, and equipment costs and availability, planned and unplanned outages, the delay of, cancellation of or failure to implement planned capital projects, project cost overruns, disruptions or interruptions of our refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations. Transactions with Related Parties We believe that transactions with related parties were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 8 for discussion of activity with related parties. Environmental Matters and Compliance Costs We have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products. Legislation and regulations pertaining to fuel specifications, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including costs of compliance and permitting delays. The extent and magnitude of these adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific regulatory and legislative requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists with respect to the measures being considered, the costs and the time frames for compliance, and our ability to pass compliance costs on to our customers. For additional information see Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our environmental expenditures, including non-regulatory expenditures, for each of the last three years were: (In millions) 2014 2013 2012 Capital $ 102 $ 50 $ 115 Compliance: (a) Operating and maintenance 397 321 318 Remediation (b) 36 22 24 Total $ 535 $ 393 $ 457 (a) Based on the American Petroleum Institute definition of environmental expenditures. (b) These amounts include spending charged against remediation reserves, where permissible, but exclude non-cash provisions recorded for environmental remediation. We accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. As environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required. 63 Table of Contents New or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future. We believe we comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation or regulations, it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed. Our environmental capital expenditures accounted for five percent, four percent and eight percent of capital expenditures excluding the acquisitions of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets and Hess Retail Operations and Related Assets in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Our environmental capital expenditures are expected to approximate $250 million , or ten percent, of total capital expenditures in 2015 . Predictions beyond 2015 can only be broad-based estimates, which have varied, and will continue to vary, due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory requirements, the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies, among other matters. Based on currently identified projects, we anticipate that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately $410 million in 2016 ; however, actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed. For more information on environmental regulations that impact us, or could impact us, see Item 1. Business Environmental Matters, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( US GAAP ) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. Fair Value Estimates Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach, each of which includes multiple valuation techniques. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset. This is often referred to as current replacement cost. The cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence. The fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and does not prioritize among the techniques. These standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques. Inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions, including assumptions about risk. Level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while Level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: Level 1 Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2 Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. These are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management best estimate of fair value. Valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy. We use a market or income approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to use the best information available. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 18 for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements. 64 Table of Contents Significant uses of fair value measurements include: assessment of impairment of long-lived assets; assessment of impairment of goodwill; assessment of impairment of equity method investments; recorded values for acquisitions; and recorded values of derivative instruments. Impairment Assessments of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Equity Method Investments Fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our long-lived assets, goodwill and equity method investments for impairment is estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate. Significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted assumptions. Significant assumptions include: Future margins on products produced and sold . Our estimates of future product margins are based on our analysis of various supply and demand factors, which include, among other things, industry-wide capacity, our planned utilization rate, end-user demand, capital expenditures and economic conditions. Such estimates are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews. Future volumes. Our estimates of future refinery and pipeline throughput volumes are based on internal forecasts prepared by our Refining & Marketing and Pipeline Transportation segments operations personnel. Discount rate commensurate with the risks involved . We apply a discount rate to our cash flows based on a variety of factors, including market and economic conditions, operational risk, regulatory risk and political risk. This discount rate is also compared to recent observable market transactions, if possible. A higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows. Future capital requirements . These are based on authorized spending and internal forecasts. We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable. However, actual results may differ from these projections. The need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators, including a significant reduction in prices of or demand for products produced, a poor outlook for profitability, a significant reduction in pipeline throughput volumes, significant reduction in refining margins, other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment in which the asset or equity method investment is located. Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. For purposes of impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which generally is the refinery and associated distribution system level for Refining & Marketing segment assets, site level for Speedway segment convenience stores or the pipeline system level for Pipeline Transportation segment assets. If the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group, fair value is calculated, and the carrying value is written down if greater than the calculated fair value. Unlike long-lived assets, goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually, or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. At December 31, 2014 , we had a total of $1.57 billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of our reporting units exceeded book value for each of our reporting units in 2014 . Equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary loss in value. Factors providing evidence of such a loss include the fair value of an investment that is less than its carrying value, absence of an ability to recover the carrying value or the investee inability to generate income sufficient to justify our carrying value. At December 31, 2014 , we had $865 million of investments in equity method investments recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. An estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions (e.g., pricing, volumes and discount rates) that can materially affect our estimates. That is, unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions. 65 Table of Contents Centennial experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 that has continued through 2014. At December 31, 2014 , Centennial was not shipping product. As a result, we continued to evaluate the carrying value of our equity investment in Centennial. We concluded that no impairment was required given our assessment of its fair value based on market participant assumptions for various potential uses and future cash flows of Centennial assets. If market conditions were to change and the owners of Centennial are unable to find an alternative use for the assets, there could be a future impairment of our Centennial interest. As of December 31, 2014 , our equity investment in Centennial was $36 million and we had a $38 million guarantee associated with 50 percent of Centennial outstanding debt. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 26 for additional information on the debt guarantee. The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to the carrying value of our Centennial equity investment. Factors that could affect the carrying value of our Centennial equity investment include, but are not limited to, a change in business conditions, a further decline or improvement in the long-term outlook of the potential uses of Centennial assets and the pursuit of different strategic alternatives for such assets. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Acquisitions In accounting for business combinations, acquired assets and liabilities and contingent consideration are recorded based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. The excess or shortfall of the purchase price when compared to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, if any, is recorded as goodwill or a bargain purchase gain, respectively. A significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, contingent consideration and other assets and liabilities. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for certain acquisitions, engage third-party consultants for assistance. The fair value of assets and liabilities, including contingent consideration, as of the acquisition date are often estimated using a combination of approaches, including the income approach, which requires us to project related future cash inflows and outflows and apply an appropriate discount rate; the cost approach, which requires estimates of replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence estimates; and the market approach which uses market data and adjusts for entity-specific differences. The estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value. The fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay to BP is re-measured each quarter using an income approach, with changes in fair value recorded in cost of revenues. The amount of cash to be paid under the arrangement is based on both a market-based crack spread and refinery throughput volumes for the months during which the contract applies, as well as established thresholds that cap the annual and total payment. We used internal and external forecasts for the crack spread and internal forecasts for refinery throughput volumes and applied an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate to the range of cash flows indicated by various scenarios to determine the fair value of the arrangement. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 for additional information on our acquisitions. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 18 for additional information on fair value measurements. Derivatives We record all derivative instruments at fair value. All of our commodity derivatives are cleared through exchanges which provide active trading information for identical derivatives and do not require any assumptions in arriving at fair value. Fair value estimation for all our derivative instruments is discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 18 . Additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following: the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; the expected long-term return on plan assets; the rate of future increases in compensation levels; health care cost projections; and the mortality table used in determining future plan obligations. 66 Table of Contents We utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. We have selected different discount rates for our funded pension plans and our unfunded retiree health care plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns. The selected rates are compared to various similar bond indexes for reasonableness. In determining the assumed discount rates, we use our third-party actuary discount rate model. This model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a yield curve derived from Aa bond yields. The yield curve represents a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 0.5 to 99 years. The bonds used have an average rating of Aa or higher by a recognized rating agency and generally only non-callable bonds are included. Outlier bonds that have a yield to maturity that deviate significantly from the average yield within each maturity grouping are not included. Each issue is required to have at least $250 million par value outstanding. Of the assumptions used to measure the year-end obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. Decreasing the discount rates of 3.65 percent for our pension plans and 4.15 percent for our other postretirement benefit plans by 0.25 percent would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by $42 million and $32 million, respectively, and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by $2 million and $4 million, respectively. The long-term asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans (currently targeted at approximately 51 percent equity securities and 49 percent fixed income securities for the primary funded pension plan), past performance and other factors. Certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation and returns. In addition, our long-term asset rate of return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to historical returns for reasonableness. After evaluating activity in the capital markets, along with the current and projected plan investments, we reduced the asset rate of return for our primary plan from 7.00 percent to 6.75 percent effective for 2015. We used the 7.00 percent long-term rate of return to determine our 2014 defined benefit pension expense. Decreasing the 6.75 percent asset rate of return assumption by 0.25 percent would increase our defined benefit pension expense by $4 million. Compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans. Health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. We utilized the 2014 mortality tables from the U.S. Society of Actuaries. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 23 includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our annual defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense, as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive loss reported on the year-end balance sheets. Contingent Liabilities We accrue contingent liabilities for legal actions, claims, litigation, environmental remediation, tax deficiencies related to operating taxes and third-party indemnities for specified tax matters when such contingencies are both probable and estimable. We regularly assess these estimates in consultation with legal counsel to consider resolved and new matters, material developments in court proceedings or settlement discussions, new information obtained as a result of ongoing discovery and past experience in defending and settling similar matters. Actual costs can differ from estimates for many reasons. For instance, settlement costs for claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on degree of responsibility and assessments of the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation may vary from estimates because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology. We generally record losses related to these types of contingencies as cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income, except for tax deficiencies unrelated to income taxes, which are recorded as other taxes. For additional information on contingent liabilities, see Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Environmental Matters and Compliance Costs. An estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, in terms of both the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. 67 Table of Contents Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an accounting standards update making targeted changes to the current consolidation guidance. The new standard changes the way certain decisions are made related to substantive rights, related parties, and decision making fees when applying the VIE consolidation model and eliminates certain guidance for limited partnerships and similar entities under the voting interest consolidation model. The update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. At this point, we have not determined the impact of the new standards update on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In August 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update requiring management to assess an entity ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. Management will be required to assess if there is substantial doubt about an entity ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt and the type of disclosure will be determined based on whether management plans will be able to alleviate the substantial doubt. The accounting standards update will be effective for the first annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter with early application permitted. In June 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update for the elimination of the concept of development stage entity ( DSE ) from U.S. GAAP and removes the related incremental reporting. The standards update eliminates the additional financial statement requirements specific to a DSE. In addition, it amends the consolidation model by eliminating the special provisions in the variable interest entity rules for assessing the sufficiency of the equity of a DSE. The portion of the accounting standards update related to the amendment to the consolidation guidance will be effective on a retrospective basis for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The portion of the accounting standards update related to the removal of the DSE reporting requirements will be effective on a retrospective basis for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of this standards update in the first quarters of 2015 and 2016 is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update for revenue recognition that is aligned with the International Accounting Standards Board revenue recognition standard issued on the same day. The guidance in the update states that revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of a good or service. Recognition of the revenue will involve a multiple step approach including identifying the contract, identifying the separate performance obligations, determining the transaction price, allocating the price to the performance obligations and then recognizing the revenue as the obligations are satisfied. Additional disclosures will be required to provide adequate information to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of reported revenues and revenues expected to be recognized. The accounting standards update will be effective on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with no early adoption permitted. At this point, we have not determined the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that redefines the criteria for determining discontinued operations and introduces new disclosures related to these disposals. The updated definition of a discontinued operation is the disposal of a component (or components) of an entity or the classification of a component (or components) of an entity as held for sale that represents a strategic shift for an entity and has (or will have) a major impact on an entity operations and financial results. The standard requires disclosure of additional financial information for discontinued operations and individually material components not qualifying for discontinued operation presentation, as well as information regarding an entity continuing involvement with the discontinued operation. The accounting standards update is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this standards update in the first quarter of 2015 is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 68 Table of Contents
