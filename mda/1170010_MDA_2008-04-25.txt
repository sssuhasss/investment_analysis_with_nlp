Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented in Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Note references are to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Amounts and percentages in tables may not total due to rounding. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. All share and per share amounts for prior periods have been adjusted to reflect our 2-for-1 common stock split in March 2007. BUSINESS OVERVIEW General CarMax is the nation largest retailer of used vehicles. We pioneered the used car superstore concept, opening our first store in 1993. Our strategy is to better serve the auto retailing market by addressing the major sources of customer dissatisfaction with traditional auto retailers and to maximize operating efficiencies through the use of standardized operating procedures and store formats enhanced by sophisticated, proprietary management information systems. As of February 29, 2008, we operated 89 used car superstores in 41 markets, comprised of 30 mid-sized markets, 10 large markets and 1 small market. We define mid-sized markets as those with television viewing populations generally between 600,000 and 2.5 million people. We also operated six new car franchises, all of which were integrated or co-located with our used car superstores. In fiscal 2008, we sold 377,244 used cars, representing 96% of the total 392,729 vehicles we sold at retail. We believe the CarMax consumer offer is distinctive within the automobile retailing marketplace. Our offer provides customers the opportunity to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for other items at other big box retailers. Our consumer offer is structured around our four customer benefits: low, no-haggle prices; a broad selection; high quality vehicles; and a customer-friendly sales process. Our website, carmax.com, is a valuable tool for communicating the CarMax consumer offer, a sophisticated search engine and an efficient channel for customers who prefer to conduct their shopping online. We generate revenues, income and cash flows primarily by retailing used vehicles and associated items including vehicle financing, extended service plans ( ESPs ) and vehicle repair service. A majority of the used vehicles we sell at retail are purchased directly from consumers. We also generate revenues, income and cash flows from the sale of vehicles purchased through our appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards. These vehicles are sold through on-site wholesale auctions. Wholesale auctions are held on a weekly, bi-weekly or monthly basis, and as of February 29, 2008, we conducted auctions at 49 used car superstores. During fiscal 2008, we sold 222,406 wholesale vehicles. On average, the vehicles we wholesale are approximately 10 years old and have more than 100,000 miles. Participation in our wholesale auctions is restricted to licensed automobile dealers, the majority of whom are independent dealers and licensed wholesalers. CarMax provides financing to qualified customers through CarMax Auto Finance ( CAF ), our finance operation, and a number of other third-party financing providers. We collect fixed, prenegotiated fees from the majority of the third-party providers, and we periodically test additional providers. CarMax has no recourse liability for the financing provided by these third parties. We sell ESPs on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors. We have no contractual liability to the customer under these third-party service plans. Extended service plan revenue represents commissions from the unrelated third parties. We are still at a relatively early stage in the national rollout of our retail concept, and as of February 29, 2008, we had used car superstores located in markets that comprised approximately 43% of the U.S. population. We currently plan to open used car superstores at a rate of approximately 15% of our used car superstore base each year. Over the long term, we expect comparable store used unit sales increases to average in the range of 4% to 8%, reflecting the multi-year ramp in sales at newly opened stores as they mature, continued market share gains at stores that have reached basic maturity sales levels, and underlying industry sales growth. We estimate that our stores generally reach basic maturity sales levels in their fifth year of operation. Table of Contents 18 While total gross profit per unit has gradually increased over the last several years, we believe the primary driver for future earnings growth will be vehicle unit sales growth, from both new stores and from stores included in our comparable store base. We target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold. The gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors, including its anticipated probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age; however, it is not based on the vehicle selling price. The principal challenges we face in expanding our store base include our ability to build our management bench strength to support the store growth and our ability to procure suitable real estate at reasonable costs. We staff each newly opened store with an experienced management team. We must therefore continually recruit, train and develop managers and associates to fill the pipeline necessary to support future store openings. If at any time we believed that the rate of store growth was causing our performance to falter, we would consider slowing the growth rate. Fiscal 2008 Highlights We believe that difficult macro-economic conditions caused an industry-wide slowdown in sales in the automotive retail market in fiscal 2008. Net sales and operating revenues increased 10% to $8.20 billion from $7.47 billion in fiscal 2007, while net earnings decreased 8% to $182.0 million, or $0.83 per share, from $198.6 million, or $0.92 per share. Total used vehicle unit sales increased 12%, reflecting the combination of the growth in our store base and a 3% increase in comparable store used unit sales. Comparable store used unit sales growth slowed from the prior year level, reflecting the combination of the near-term decline in consumer confidence and a slowing sales pace for the automotive retail industry, as well as the challenging comparison with our 9% increase during fiscal 2007. We opened 12 used car superstores in fiscal 2008, increasing our store base by 16%. The new stores included four production superstores and eight non-production superstores, and they represented our entry into five new markets. Total wholesale vehicle unit sales increased 6%. Wholesale unit sales grew at a slower pace than our used vehicle unit sales, reflecting a decrease in our appraisal buy rate (defined as appraisal purchases as a percent of vehicles appraised). New vehicle unit sales declined 17% due to the combination of the softer new car industry trends and the sale of a new car franchise during fiscal 2008. Our total gross profit per unit remained consistent at $2,731 in both fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007. Total gross profit per unit increased modestly in the first half of fiscal 2008, before declining in the second half of the year in response to the more challenging economic conditions. CAF income declined 35% to $85.9 million from $132.6 million in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, CAF income was adversely affected by the disruption in the global credit markets and worsening economic conditions. As a result, we experienced a substantial increase in CAF funding costs and higher net credit losses, and we increased the discount rate used to value our retained interest to 17% from 12%. In fiscal 2007, CAF income included a benefit of $13.0 million, or $0.04 per share, primarily related to favorable valuation adjustments. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales and operating revenues (the SG&A ratio ) increased to 10.5% from 10.4% in fiscal 2007. This increase largely resulted from the modest level of comparable store sales increase and our commitment to our ongoing growth plan, as well as the decision to continue spending on strategic, operational and Internet initiatives in fiscal 2008. Net cash provided by operations decreased to $79.5 million from $136.8 million in fiscal 2007, primarily reflecting an increased investment in working capital. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions. We continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions. Note 2 includes a discussion of significant accounting policies. The accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment. Our financial results might have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed. Table of Contents 19 Securitization Transactions We use a securitization program to fund substantially all of the auto loan receivables originated by CAF. The securitization transactions are accounted for as sales. A gain, recorded at the time of the securitization transaction, results from recording a receivable equal to the present value of the expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized receivables. The fair value of our retained interest in securitization transactions includes the present value of the expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized receivables, cash reserve accounts, an undivided ownership interest in certain receivables and retained subordinated bonds. The present value of the expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized receivables is determined by estimating the future cash flows using management assumptions of key factors, such as finance charge and fee income, cost of funds, loss rates, prepayment rates and discount rates appropriate for the type of asset and risk. These assumptions are derived from historical experience and projected economic trends. Adjustments to one or more of these assumptions may have a material impact on the fair value of the retained interest. The fair value of the retained interest may also be affected by external factors, such as changes in the behavior patterns of customers, changes in the economy and developments in the interest rate and credit markets. Note 2(C) includes a discussion of accounting policies related to securitizations. Note 4 includes a discussion of securitizations and provides a sensitivity analysis showing the hypothetical effect on the retained interest if there were variations from the assumptions used. In addition, see the CarMax Auto Finance Income section of this MD&A for a discussion of the effect of changes in our assumptions. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete, generally either at the time of sale to a customer or upon delivery to a customer. We recognize used vehicle revenue when a sales contract has been executed and the vehicle has been delivered, net of a reserve for returns under our 5-day, money-back guarantee. A reserve for vehicle returns is recorded based on historical experience and trends, and it could be affected if future vehicle returns differ from historical averages. We also sell ESPs on behalf of unrelated third parties to customers who purchase a vehicle. Because these third parties are the primary obligors under these programs, we recognize commission revenue on the ESPs at the time of the sale, net of a reserve for returns. The reserve for ESP returns is recorded based on historical experience and trends, and it could be affected if future ESP returns differ from historical averages. Income Taxes Estimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets. In the ordinary course of business, transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain at the time of the transactions. We adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is probable that our actual results will differ from our estimates. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted. Note 7 includes information regarding income taxes. We evaluate the need to record valuation allowances that would reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. When assessing the need for valuation allowances, we consider future reversals of existing temporary differences and future taxable income. Except for a valuation allowance recorded for a capital loss carryforward that may not be utilized before its expiration, we believe that our recorded deferred tax assets as of February 29, 2008, will more likely than not be realized. However, if a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period when the change in circumstances occurs. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payments of these amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result in the period of determination. Table of Contents 20 Defined Benefit Retirement Plan The plan obligations and related assets of our defined benefit retirement plan are presented in Note 8. Plan assets, which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments, are valued using current market quotations. Plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries using a number of assumptions that we provide. Key assumptions used to measure the plan obligations include the discount rate, the estimated rate of salary increases, the estimated future return on plan assets and the mortality rate. In determining the discount rate, we use the current yield on high-quality, fixed-income investments that have maturities corresponding to the timing of the benefit payments. Salary increase assumptions are based upon our historical experience and anticipated future board and management actions. Asset returns are estimated based upon the anticipated average yield on the plan assets. We do not believe that any significant changes in assumptions used to measure the plan obligations are likely to occur that would have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Used Vehicle Sales Fiscal 2008 Versus Fiscal 2007. The 12% increase in our used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2008 resulted from a corresponding increase in unit sales. The unit sales growth reflected sales from newer superstores not yet included in the comparable store base and a 3% increase in comparable store used units. This lower-than-normal level of comparable store used unit growth reflected the combination of the near-term decline in consumer confidence and a slowing sales pace for the automotive retail industry, as well as the challenging comparison with our 9% increase during fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, we experienced an overall increase in consumer traffic, which we believe benefited from the strength of our consumer offer, as well as the favorable response to the improvements made to carmax.com. However, compared with fiscal 2007, our sales conversion rate declined slightly as consumers appeared to be somewhat more hesitant in committing to big-ticket purchases. Our average used vehicle selling price in fiscal 2008 was similar to the prior year, reflecting consumer-driven mix shifts from large and mid-sized SUVs to smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles. Sales were supported by the continued consistent availability of credit from CAF and from third-party financing providers. Despite the deceleration in automotive industry sales, our data indicated that we continued to gain share within our existing markets in the late-model used vehicle market. Fiscal 2007 Versus Fiscal 2006. The 23% increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2007 resulted from a 16% increase in unit sales and a 6% increase in average selling price. The unit sales growth reflected a 9% increase in comparable store used units, together with sales from newer superstores not yet included in the comparable store base. Our comparable store used unit sales growth benefited from strong store and Internet traffic and continued strong execution by our store teams. The increase in the average retail selling price was primarily the result of a shift in vehicle mix, as we experienced a resurgence in the sales of SUVs and trucks, which we believe had been adversely affected in the prior year by consumer reaction to higher gasoline prices. The increase in average retail selling price also reflected growth in the percentage of luxury vehicles in our sales mix. Sales financed by the third-party subprime financing provider declined to less than 1% of our used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2007 from approximately 3% in fiscal 2006. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, this provider implemented program changes in certain states, narrowing the selection of vehicles it would finance, and making this business less economically attractive to us. We chose to curtail our business with this provider in these states to preserve margins and profits. This decline in subprime-financed sales in fiscal 2007 was substantially offset, however, by incremental sales financed by additional providers added to the group of third-party lenders in the second half of fiscal 2006. New Vehicle Sales Fiscal 2008 Versus Fiscal 2007. The 17% decrease in new vehicle revenues in fiscal 2008 was the result of a corresponding decrease in unit sales. The decline in new vehicle unit sales reflected soft new car industry sales trends, particularly for the domestic manufacturers that we represent, and the sale of our Orlando Chrysler-Jeep-Dodge franchise in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Table of Contents 22 Fiscal 2007 Versus Fiscal 2006. The 11% decrease in new vehicle revenues in fiscal 2007 was substantially the result of decreases in unit sales, and in part reflected our strategic decision in fiscal 2007 to increase targeted gross profit dollars per unit on new vehicles. We had anticipated that this decision would result in some reduction in new vehicle unit sales. The decline in new vehicle unit sales also reflected the effects of reduced industry new car sales for several of the brands we represent, including Chevrolet, Chrysler and Nissan. Wholesale Vehicle Sales Our operating strategy is to build customer satisfaction by offering high-quality vehicles. Fewer than half of the vehicles acquired from consumers through the appraisal purchase process meet our standards for reconditioning and subsequent retail sale. Those vehicles that do not meet our standards are sold through on-site wholesale auctions. Fiscal 2008 Versus Fiscal 2007. The 7% increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2008 resulted from a 6% increase in wholesale unit sales combined with a 1% increase in average wholesale selling price. Compared with the prior year, while appraisal traffic increased, we experienced a decline in our buy rate. Our wholesale auction prices usually reflect the trends in the general wholesale market for the types of vehicles we sell, although they may also be affected by changes in vehicle mix or the average age, miles or condition of the vehicles wholesaled. Fiscal 2007 Versus Fiscal 2006. The 18% increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2007 resulted from a 16% increase in wholesale unit sales and a 1% increase in average wholesale selling price. Our wholesale unit sales benefited from a substantial increase in appraisal traffic, primarily spurred by our strong comparable store unit sales growth, and the expansion of our store base. In the first half of fiscal 2007, our average wholesale selling price climbed 6% reflecting, we believe, the residual effects of industry shortages of older, higher-mileage vehicles experienced following Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma in the fall of 2005. In the second half of fiscal 2007, our average wholesale selling price was 4% below the prior year level reflecting the challenging comparison with the previous year. Other Sales and Revenues Other sales and revenues include commissions on the sale of ESPs, service department sales and third-party finance fees. The fixed fees paid by third-party financing providers vary by provider, reflecting their differing levels of credit risk exposure. We record the discount at which the subprime provider purchases loans as an offset to finance fee revenues received from the other providers. Fiscal 2008 Versus Fiscal 2007. Other sales and revenues increased 11% in fiscal 2008, similar to the 12% increase in used vehicle unit sales. Fiscal 2007 Versus Fiscal 2006. Other sales and revenues increased 10% in fiscal 2007. The increase was primarily the result of increased sales of ESPs and an increase in third-party finance fees. The increase in ESP sales was consistent with our increase in used vehicle unit sales. The third-party finance fees increased nearly 50% in fiscal 2007, benefiting from the decline in sales financed by the subprime provider. Service department sales declined modestly in fiscal 2007, as the reconditioning activities required to support our strong comparable store used vehicle sales growth limited the service capacity available for customer pay work.

Two franchises are integrated within used car superstores, and the remaining four franchises are operated from three facilities that are co-located with select used car superstores. During the second quarter of fiscal 2008, we sold our Orlando Chrysler-Jeep-Dodge franchise. During fiscal 2008, we expanded our car-buying center test with the opening of buying centers in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Tampa, Florida, expanding the test we began in Atlanta, Georgia, in fiscal 2007. At these three locations, we conduct appraisals and purchase, but do not sell, vehicles. These test centers are part of our long-term plan to increase both appraisal traffic and retail vehicle sourcing self-sufficiency. Gross Profit Years Ended February 29 or 28 2008 2007 2006 $ per unit (1) % (2) $ per unit (1) % (2) $ per unit (1) % (2) Used vehicle gross profit $ 1,878 10.8 $ 1,903 10.9 $ 1,808 11.0 New vehicle gross profit $ 994 4.2 $ 1,169 4.9 $ 934 3.9 Wholesale vehicle gross profit $ 794 17.9 $ 742 16.9 $ 700 16.1 Other gross profit $ 437 67.5 $ 431 66.8 $ 391 58.5 Total gross profit $ 2,731 13.1 $ 2,731 13.0 $ 2,544 12.6 (1) Calculated as category gross profit divided by its respective units sold, except the other and total categories, which are divided by total retail units sold. (2) Calculated as a percentage of its respective sales or revenue. Used Vehicle Gross Profit We target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold. The gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors, including its anticipated probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age; however, it is not based on the vehicle selling price. Our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with the broader market trade-in trends and our rapid inventory turns reduce the exposure to the inherent continual depreciation in used vehicle values and contribute to our ability to manage gross profit dollars per unit. We employ a volume-based strategy, and we systematically mark down individual vehicle prices based on proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales growth, inventory turns and gross profit achievement. When customer traffic and sales are consistently strong, we generally take fewer pricing markdowns, which in turn benefits gross profit dollars per unit. Conversely, when the sales pace slows, we generally take more pricing Table of Contents 24 markdowns, which may pressure gross profit dollars per unit. Over the past several years, we have continued to refine our car-buying strategies, which we believe has benefited used vehicle gross profit per unit. Fiscal 2008 Versus Fiscal 2007. Our used vehicle gross profit declined $25 per unit in fiscal 2008. The gross profit per unit increased modestly in the first half of the year before declining in the second half of the year. As the economic environment continued to weaken in the third quarter of fiscal 2008, we moderately reduced our margin targets at the beginning of the fourth quarter in order to create additional value for customers and drive sales. This was consistent with our long-term strategy to deliver a superior customer experience and grow market share. Fiscal 2007 Versus Fiscal 2006. Our used vehicle gross profit increased $95 per unit in fiscal 2007. This increase reflected the benefit of our strong, consistent sales performance throughout the year. We believe several external factors contributed to a greater degree of sales volatility in the prior year, including significant changes in gasoline prices, new vehicle incentives and interest rates. We did not experience similar variability in these external factors in fiscal 2007, and therefore benefited from a more stable business environment. In addition, our used vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2006 was adversely affected by slowing demand for SUVs and trucks that have lower gas mileage, which resulted in higher pricing markdowns for these vehicles. New Vehicle Gross Profit Fiscal 2008 Versus Fiscal 2007. Our new vehicle gross profit decreased $175 per unit in fiscal 2008. The decline in overall consumer demand for new cars in fiscal 2008 pressured profits for many new car retailers, including CarMax. Fiscal 2007 Versus Fiscal 2006. Our new vehicle gross profit increased $235 per unit in fiscal 2007. The increase primarily reflected our strategic decision to increase targeted new vehicle gross profit dollars per unit in fiscal 2007. While this decision contributed to a reduction in new vehicle unit sales, it resulted in an increase in the total gross profit contribution from new vehicles. Wholesale Vehicle Gross Profit Our wholesale vehicle profitability has steadily increased over the last several years, reflecting the benefits realized from improvements and refinements in our car-buying strategies, appraisal delivery processes and in-store auction processes. We have made continuous improvements in these processes, which we believe has allowed us to become more efficient. Our in-store auctions have benefited from initiatives to increase average dealer attendance, which we believe has allowed us to achieve higher prices. Fiscal 2008 Versus Fiscal 2007. Our wholesale vehicle gross profit increased $52 per unit in fiscal 2008. We continued to experience strong dealer attendance at our auctions throughout the year, despite the challenging economic environment. Fiscal 2007 Versus Fiscal 2006. Our wholesale vehicle gross profit increased $42 per unit in fiscal 2007, primarily as a result of ongoing initiatives to improve our car-buying and auction processes. Other Gross Profit We have no cost of sales related to either extended service plan revenues or third-party finance fees, as these represent commissions paid to us by the third-party providers. Accordingly, changes in the mix of extended service plan revenues and third-party finance fees, relative to service department sales, can affect other gross profit. Fiscal 2008 Versus Fiscal 2007. Other gross profit increased $6 per unit in fiscal 2008. The improvement was the result of the growth in ESP sales and third-party finance fees, partially offset by a small reduction in service department margins. Fiscal 2007 Versus Fiscal 2006. Other gross profit increased $40 per unit in fiscal 2007. The improvement was the result of the growth in ESP sales and third-party finance fees and an increase in service department margins. Our service department reported higher profits in fiscal 2007, as our strong comparable store used unit sales growth increased our ability to leverage total service and reconditioning overhead expenses. Table of Contents 25 Impact of Inflation Inflation has not been a significant contributor to results. Profitability is affected by our ability to achieve targeted unit sales and gross profit dollars per vehicle rather than on average retail prices. However, increases in average vehicle selling prices will benefit the SG&A ratio and CAF income to the extent the average amount financed also increases. CarMax Auto Finance Income CAF provides financing for our used and new car sales. Because the purchase of a vehicle is traditionally reliant on the consumer ability to obtain on-the-spot financing, it is important to our business that financing be available to creditworthy customers. While financing can also be obtained from third-party sources, we believe that total reliance on third parties can create unacceptable volatility and business risk. Furthermore, we believe that our processes and systems, the transparency of our pricing and our vehicle quality provide a unique and ideal environment in which to procure high quality auto loans, both for CAF and for the third-party financing providers. CAF provides us the opportunity to capture additional profits and cash flows from auto loan receivables while managing our reliance on third-party financing sources.

(2) Percent of average managed receivables. (3) Percent of total net sales and operating revenues. CAF income does not include any allocation of indirect costs or income. We present this information on a direct basis to avoid making arbitrary decisions regarding the indirect benefit or costs that could be attributed to CAF. Examples of indirect costs not included are retail store expenses and corporate expenses such as human resources, administrative services, marketing, information systems, accounting, legal, treasury and executive payroll. CAF originates auto loans to qualified customers at competitive market rates of interest. The majority of CAF income is generated by the spread between the interest rates charged to customers and the related cost of funds. Substantially all of the loans originated by CAF are sold in securitization transactions. A gain, recorded at the time of securitization, results from recording a receivable approximately equal to the present value of the expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized receivables. In a normalized environment, we expect the gain on loans originated and sold as a percent of loans originated and sold (the gain percentage ) to be in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. Table of Contents 26 Gain Income and Loans Sold Years Ended February 29 or 28 (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 Gain on sales of loans originated and sold (1) $ 58.1 $ 86.7 $ 61.9 Other (losses) gains (1) (9.6 ) 13.0 15.2 Total gain income $ 48.5 $ 99.7 $ 77.1 Loans originated and sold $ 2,430.8 $ 2,240.2 $ 1,792.6 Receivables repurchased from public securitizations and resold 103.6 82.5 94.8 Total loans sold $ 2,534.4 $ 2,322.7 $ 1,887.5 Gain percentage on loans originated and sold 2.4 % 3.9 % 3.5 % Total gain income as a percentage of total loans sold 1.9 % 4.3 % 4.1 % (1) Beginning in fiscal 2008, the effects of changes in valuation assumptions or funding costs related to loans originated and sold during previous quarters of the same fiscal year are presented in gain on sales of loans originated and sold. Previously, these adjustments were reported in other losses or gains. These adjustments totaled $(35.9) million in fiscal 2008. As a result, the sum of amounts previously reported for interim quarters will not equal the total reported for fiscal 2008. The impact of similar adjustments for prior fiscal years was not material. The gain on sales of loans originated and sold includes both the gain income recorded at the time of securitization and the effect of any subsequent changes in valuation assumptions or funding costs that are incurred in the same fiscal year that the loans were originated. Other losses or gains include the effects of changes in valuation assumptions or funding costs related to loans originated and sold during previous fiscal years. In addition, other losses or gains could include the effects of new public securitizations, changes in the valuation of retained subordinated bonds and the resale of receivables in existing public securitizations, as applicable. In the 2008-1 public securitization, we held $44.7 million of subordinated bonds, because the economics of doing so were more favorable than selling them in the public market. Our public securitizations typically contain an option to repurchase the securitized receivables when the outstanding balance in the pool of auto loan receivables falls below 10% of the original pool balance. This option was exercised two times in each of fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006. In each case, the remaining eligible receivables were subsequently resold into the warehouse facility. These transactions did not have a material effect on CAF income in fiscal 2008, 2007 or 2006. Fiscal 2008 Versus Fiscal 2007. CAF income declined 35% to $85.9 million in fiscal 2008, reflecting the disruption in the global credit markets and worsening economic conditions. The gain on sales of loans originated and sold decreased 33% to $58.1 million in fiscal 2008. In the second half of the fiscal year, credit spreads in the asset-backed securities market widened, resulting in a substantial increase in CAF funding costs. In addition, we increased the discount rate assumption used to calculate our gain on sales of loans to 17% from 12%, and we increased our cumulative net loss assumptions on loans originated and sold during fiscal 2008 to a range of 2.7% to 3.0%, which was significantly higher than the cumulative net loss assumptions used on loans originated in fiscal 2007. As a result, the gain percentage declined to 2.4% in fiscal 2008 compared with 3.9% in fiscal 2007. We recognized other losses of $9.6 million, or $0.03 per share, in fiscal 2008, which included the effects of the increase in the discount rate and cumulative net loss assumptions on loans originated and sold in previous years. Other losses also included a $2.7 million reduction in the carrying value of the retained subordinated bonds. In fiscal 2007, we recognized other gains of $13.0 million, or $0.04 per share, which included the effects of reducing cumulative net loss assumptions on loans originated and sold in previous years. The increases in other CAF income and other direct CAF expenses in fiscal 2008 were proportionate to the growth in managed receivables during the year. Fiscal 2007 Versus Fiscal 2006. CAF income rose 27% to $132.6 million in fiscal 2007. CAF income benefited from the growth in retail vehicle unit sales, increases in the gain percentage, average amount financed and total managed receivables. The gain percentage increased to 3.9% in fiscal 2007 from 3.5% in fiscal 2006, reflecting changes in the Table of Contents 27 interest rate environment. In fiscal 2006, our funding costs were rising faster than rates charged to consumers resulting in a lower gain percentage. In fiscal 2007, the relative stability in our funding cost allowed us to achieve a higher gain percentage. We recognized other gains of $13.0 million, or $0.04 per share, in fiscal 2007 compared with $15.2 million, or $0.04 per share, in fiscal 2006. In both years, the majority of the other gains resulted from reductions in our cumulative net loss assumptions related to receivables originated in prior fiscal years. The increases in other CAF income and other direct CAF expenses in fiscal 2007 were proportionate to the growth in managed receivables during the year. Past Due Account Information As of February 29 or 28 (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 Loans securitized $ 3,764.5 $ 3,242.1 $ 2,710.4 Loans held for sale or investment 74.0 68.9 62.0 Total managed receivables $ 3,838.5 $ 3,311.0 $ 2,772.5 Accounts 31+ days past due $ 86.1 $ 56.9 $ 37.4 Past due accounts as a percentage of total managed receivables 2.24 % 1.72 % 1.35 % Credit Loss Information Years Ended February 29 or 28 (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net credit losses on managed receivables $ 38.3 $ 20.7 $ 18.4 Average managed receivables $ 3,608.4 $ 3,071.1 $ 2,657.7 Net credit losses as a percentage of average managed receivables 1.06 % 0.67 % 0.69 % Recovery rate 50 % 51 % 51 % We are at risk for the performance of the managed securitized receivables to the extent of our retained interest in the receivables. If the managed receivables do not perform in accordance with the assumptions used in determining the fair value of the retained interest, earnings could be affected. In fiscal 2008, we experienced increases in both past due accounts as a percentage of total managed receivables and net credit losses as a percentage of average managed receivables compared with the previous fiscal year. We believe these increases were the result of a combination of factors, including the prior expansion of our credit offers and the less favorable general economic and industry trends for losses and delinquencies. We continually strive to refine CAF origination strategy in order to optimize profitability and sales while controlling risk. In general, we originate pools of loans targeted to have cumulative net loss rates in the range of 2.0% to 2.5%. Receivables originated in calendar years 2003, 2004 and early 2005 have experienced loss rates well below both CAF historical averages and these targeted loss rates. We believe this favorability was due, in part, to the credit scorecard we implemented in late 2002. As it became evident that the scorecard was resulting in lower-than-expected loss rates, CAF gradually expanded its credit offers beginning in late 2004. As a result, receivables originated in late 2005 and in 2006 and 2007 have been experiencing higher loss and delinquency rates compared with the receivables originated in these earlier years. While the delinquency and projected loss rates on the more recent originations were higher than our initial expectations, we believe this was primarily related to the worsening economic climate. Consequently, we increased our cumulative net loss assumptions on the 2007 and 2008 public securitizations, and we incorporated similar economic stress into the projections for our most recent originations. The recovery rate represents the average percentage of the outstanding principal balance we receive when a vehicle is repossessed and liquidated at wholesale auction. Historically, the annual recovery rate has ranged from a low of 42% to a high of 51%, and it is primarily affected by changes in the wholesale market pricing environment. Table of Contents 28 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Fiscal 2008 Versus Fiscal 2007. The SG&A ratio increased to 10.5% from 10.4% in fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2008, we increased our SG&A spending related to specific strategic, operational and Internet initiatives intended to improve customer satisfaction and increase efficiencies over the long term. As a result, our 3% increase in comparable store used unit sales in fiscal 2008 did not generate sufficient overhead leverage to offset the increases in spending related to our ongoing growth plan and these initiatives. Fiscal 2007 Versus Fiscal 2006. The SG&A ratio declined to 10.4% from 10.8% in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2007, we benefited from the leverage of fixed expenses generated by our strong comparable store sales growth. The improvement in the fiscal 2007 SG&A ratio was partially offset by an increase in share-based compensation costs due to the accelerated vesting of stock options upon the retirement of our former chief executive officer and by the recognition of an impairment loss totaling $4.9 million, or $0.01 per share. The impairment loss related to the write down of intangible assets associated with one of our new car franchises, which was subsequently sold. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 38.7% in fiscal 2008, 38.6% in fiscal 2007 and 38.3% in fiscal 2006. OPERATIONS OUTLOOK Store Openings and Capital Expenditures During the fiscal year ending February 28, 2009, we plan to expand our used car superstore base by approximately 16%, opening an estimated 14 used car superstores, including 7 production and 7 non-production stores.

We expect to enter eight new markets and expand our presence in five existing markets in fiscal 2009. We currently expect to open approximately nine superstores in the first half of fiscal 2009 and five superstores in the second half of the fiscal year. However, normal construction, permitting or other scheduling delays could shift opening dates of any stores into a later period. In fiscal 2009, we also plan to open a central reconditioning facility in the Washington, D.C. / Baltimore market, where we currently have six superstores. We have experienced strong sales growth in this market, and this facility will support additional expected market share gains. In addition, we are converting our non-production store in Ontario, California, to a production store with the addition of reconditioning facilities, which will support our continued growth in the Los Angeles market. Table of Contents 29 In fiscal 2009, we also plan to expand our car-buying center test with the opening of our fourth and fifth centers, in Dallas, Texas, (opened April 2008) and in Baltimore, Maryland. We will continue to evaluate the performance of these five centers before deciding whether to open additional centers in future years. We currently estimate gross capital expenditures will total approximately $350 million in fiscal 2009. Planned expenditures primarily relate to new store construction and land purchases associated with future year store openings, as well as the reconditioning capacity expansions. Compared with the $253 million spent in fiscal 2008, the fiscal 2009 capital spending estimate reflects an increase in land purchases to support future year store openings and the increase in the number of stores planned to be opened. Fiscal 2009 Expectations The fiscal 2009 expectations discussed below are based on historical and current trends in our business and should be read in conjunction with Risk Factors, in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Fiscal 2009 Sales. We currently anticipate the change in comparable store used unit sales in the range of (2%) to 5% in fiscal 2009. The wide range reflects an expectation of continued softness in the economy and volatility in the market for late-model used cars. We expect total revenues to increase between 7% and 14%, reflecting our planned new store openings, the comparable store sales performance and anticipated declines in both used vehicle average selling prices and new car revenues. We are not anticipating any material change in credit availability for our customers in fiscal 2009, despite the fact that AmeriCredit Corp. is no longer one of our third-party financing providers effective April 1, 2008. We anticipate the majority of loans previously financed by AmeriCredit will be financed by other third-party providers. Fiscal 2009 Earnings Per Share. We currently expect fiscal 2009 earnings per share in the range of $0.78 to $0.94. The width of this range reflects the uncertainty of current market conditions, especially in the credit markets. We expect to maintain our used and wholesale gross profit dollars per unit at levels similar to those in fiscal 2008. We currently believe the CAF gain percentage on loans originated and sold in fiscal 2009 could be well below the normalized range of 3.5% to 4.5% reflecting the continued use of a 17% discount rate in calculating the gain on loans sold, and our expectations that funding costs and cumulative net loss rates will remain at higher-than-normal levels due to the stresses of the current economy. We are anticipating that the disruption in the credit markets will continue to adversely affect CAF income throughout fiscal 2009 relative to historical norms. In addition, based on the funding cost spreads achieved in recent comparable public securitizations, we estimate that CAF will have to absorb approximately $14 million of incremental funding costs upon the refinancing of the $855 million that was outstanding in the warehouse facility to the end of fiscal 2008. Our fiscal 2009 earnings estimates also reflect an expected increase in our SG&A ratio. The combination of the anticipated comparable store sales performance and the decline in used vehicle average selling prices, together with continued investments supporting our growth plan, will likely cause the SG&A ratio to increase in fiscal 2009. We expect average outstanding debt will rise in fiscal 2009, which will increase our interest expense. The higher debt levels primarily relate to planned capital spending, as well as the prospect of continuing to retain some subordinated bonds in connection with future CAF securitizations. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to CarMax, see Note 16. FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities . We generated net cash from operating activities of $79.5 million in fiscal 2008, $136.8 million in fiscal 2007 and $117.5 million in fiscal 2006. Cash generated by operating activities was $57.3 million lower in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. The decrease resulted from a higher level of working capital investment in fiscal 2008, combined with the $16.6 million decrease in net earnings. Our retained interest in securitized receivables increased by $68.5 million in fiscal 2008 reflecting our decision to retain the $44.7 million Table of Contents 30 face value of CAF subordinated bonds in the 2008-1 public securitization and the growth in the total managed receivables. Inventories increased by 17%, or $139.7 million, in fiscal 2008, which was higher than our 10% increase in vehicle revenues. The growth in inventories resulted from the increase in our store base and from a test underway in fiscal 2008 to determine whether increasing onsite vehicle inventory by approximately 50 to 100 cars per store would favorably affect sales. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, this test was being conducted in approximately 30% of our stores. We plan to continue this test in fiscal 2009. Cash generated from operating activities was $19.3 million higher in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. The $64.4 million increase in net earnings in fiscal 2007 was more than offset by the increased growth in inventories. Inventories increased $166.4 million in fiscal 2007 compared with a $93.1 million increase in fiscal 2006. The fiscal 2007 inventory increase related to store openings during fiscal 2007 and shortly after the end of the fiscal year, as well as to added vehicle inventory required to support our strong increase in fourth quarter comparable store used unit sales. The aggregate principal amount of outstanding auto loan receivables funded through securitizations, which are discussed in Notes 3 and 4, totaled $3.76 billion as of February 29, 2008; $3.24 billion as of February 28, 2007; and $2.71 billion as of February 28, 2006. During fiscal 2008, we completed three public securitizations of auto loan receivables, funding a total of $1.78 billion of auto loan receivables. In the 2008-1 public securitization, we held $44.7 million face value of subordinated bonds. As of February 29, 2008, the warehouse facility limit was $1.3 billion and unused warehouse capacity totaled $445.5 million. The warehouse facility limit was $825 million at the beginning of fiscal 2008, and it was increased to $1.0 billion at its annual renewal in July 2007 in response to the growth in our business. In December 2007, we arranged a temporary $300 million increase in the warehouse facility capacity to $1.3 billion through April 2008, in order to provide additional funding flexibility. The warehouse facility matures in July 2008, and we anticipate that we will be able to renew, expand or enter into new securitizations or other funding arrangements to meet CAF future funding needs. Note 4 includes additional discussion of the warehouse facility. Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $257.0 million in fiscal 2008, $187.2 million in fiscal 2007 and $116.1 million in fiscal 2006. Capital expenditures were $253.1 million in fiscal 2008, $191.8 million in fiscal 2007 and $194.4 million in fiscal 2006. In addition to store construction costs, capital expenditures for all three years included the cost of land acquired for future year store openings. In fiscal 2006, capital expenditures also included costs associated with our new home office, which was completed in October 2005. Historically, capital expenditures have been funded with internally generated funds, short- and long-term debt and sale-leaseback transactions. Net proceeds from the sales of assets totaled $1.1 million in fiscal 2008, $4.6 million in fiscal 2007 and $78.3 million in fiscal 2006. The majority of the sale proceeds in fiscal 2006 related to sale-leaseback transactions. In fiscal 2006, we entered into sale-leaseback transactions involving five superstores valued at $72.7 million. These transactions were structured with initial lease terms of either 15 or 20 years with four, five-year renewal options. As of February 29, 2008, we owned 32 superstores currently in operation, as well as our home office in Richmond, Virginia. In addition, five superstores were accounted for as capital leases. Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $171.0 million in fiscal 2008, $48.1 million in fiscal 2007 and $3.2 million in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2008, we increased total debt by $148.9 million, primarily to fund increased inventory and capital expenditures. We used cash generated from operations to reduce total debt by $9.5 million in fiscal 2007 and $6.8 million in fiscal 2006. We have a $500 million revolving credit facility, which is available until December 2011. Borrowings under this credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes, and are secured by our vehicle inventory, which was $975.8 million at the end of fiscal 2008. As of February 29, 2008, $300.2 million was outstanding under the credit facility, with the remainder fully available to us. The outstanding balance included $21.0 million classified as short-term debt, $79.2 million classified as current portion of long-term debt and $200.0 million classified as long-term debt. We classified $79.2 million of the outstanding balance as of February 29, 2008, as current portion of long-term debt based on our expectation that this balance will not remain outstanding for more than one year. Cash received on equity issuances, which primarily related to employee stock option exercises, was $14.7 million in fiscal 2008, $35.4 million in fiscal 2007 and $6.0 million in fiscal 2006. The increase in fiscal 2007 reflected exercises by the former chief executive officer in connection with his retirement, and other exercises prompted by the significant increase Table of Contents 31 in our stock price during that fiscal year. We expect that cash generated by operations and proceeds from securitization transactions or other funding arrangements, sale-leaseback transactions and borrowings under existing or expanded credit facilities will be sufficient to fund capital expenditures and working capital for the foreseeable future.

See Note 8. (6) Represents the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. The timing of payments associated with $30.3 million of these tax benefits could not be estimated as of February 29, 2008. See Note 7. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements CAF provides financing for our used and new car sales. We use a securitization program to fund substantially all of the auto loan receivables originated by CAF. We sell the auto loan receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entity that transfers an undivided interest in the receivables to a group of third-party investors. This program is referred to as the warehouse facility. We periodically use public securitizations to refinance the receivables previously securitized through the warehouse facility. In a public securitization, a pool of auto loan receivables is sold to a bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entity that in turn transfers the receivables to a special purpose securitization trust. Additional information regarding the nature, business purposes and importance of our off-balance sheet arrangement to our liquidity and capital resources can be found in the CarMax Auto Finance Income, Financial Condition and Market Risk sections of this MD&A, as well as in Notes 3 and 4.
