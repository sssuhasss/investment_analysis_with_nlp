ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For an overview of our business groups, including a discussion of products and services provided, see the Business discussion contained in Part I, Item 1, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT The nation engagement in combating threats to U.S. national security around the world, coupled with the need to equip and modernize U.S. military forces, drives Department of Defense funding levels. As a defense contractor, our financial performance is influenced by the allocation and prioritization of U.S. defense spending. For fiscal year (FY) 2011, the President requested $549 billion for the Department of Defense, including approximately $189 billion for procurement and research and development (R&D). Procurement and R&D budgets, also known as investment accounts, provide the majority of our U.S. defense revenues. As of February 18, 2011, the Congress has not approved the President FY 2011 budget request. Consequently, the U.S. government, including the Department of Defense, is operating under a continuing resolution (CR), which funds the Pentagon at FY 2010 funding levels through early March 2011. For FY 2010, Congress appropriated $531 billion for the Defense Department, including approximately $185 billion for investment accounts. We anticipate that Congress will further consider the FY 2011 defense spending bill in conjunction with the expiration of the current CR. This consideration would likely result in either an extension of the CR, thereby keeping FY 2011 funding at FY 2010 levels, or the passage of a 2011 funding bill. In the case of an extended CR, we are actively engaged with our customers and the Congress to ensure funding required for critical programs is not disrupted. In either case, budget expenditures generally lag congressional funding, and we expect that expenditures applied toward programs over the next few years will be consistent with defense funding appropriated in recent years. To fund the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, defense budgets have also included supplemental funding. While some of our programs have received supplemental funds, most of our funding is now derived from base budgets. For FY 2011, the President has requested approximately $159 billion in supplemental funding, including approximately 16 percent for investment accounts. Future-year spending plans forecast a reduction in supplemental funding levels consistent with the administration plan to gradually reduce troop levels in Iraq and Afghanistan. For FY 2012, the President has requested total defense funding of $671 billion, including $118 billion in supplemental funding. The 2012 budget requests $188 billion for investment accounts. The Pentagon five-year base spending plan, submitted with the FY 2012 funding request, reflects low-single-digit growth in the near-term with growth slowing in later years. This plan incorporates approximately $78 billion of projected cuts when compared with the previous five-year plan. Given force structure levels and current threat levels, the majority of those cuts are not manifested in investment accounts. Rather, investment accounts are projected to display low-single-digit growth over the five-year period, with procurement funding for mature programs growing and R&D funding for developmental programs declining over the period. In today dynamic budget environment, the success of our U.S. defense business is enhanced by the diversity of our exposure to different programs and customers within the budget, our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs, our ability to evolve our products to address a fast-changing threat environment, and our successful execution of the contracts we are awarded. While our nation budget deficits will influence government spending decisions, we expect defense funding to continue to be driven by the following: support for the warfighter in the face of threats posed by an uncertain global security environment; the number of troops deployed globally, coupled with the overall size of the U.S. military; the need to reset and replenish equipment and supplies damaged and consumed in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001; the need to maintain thousands of jobs that support the health of our nation economy and the need to modernize that infrastructure to address the evolving requirements of modern-day warfare. Given today tenuous geopolitical landscape, governments around the world continue to fund weapons and equipment modernization programs, leading to diverse defense export opportunities. We continue to pursue opportunities presented by international demand for military hardware and information technologies, both from our indigenous international operations and through exports from our U.S. businesses. While the revenue potential can be significant, international defense budgets are subject to unpredictable issues of contract award timing, changing priorities and overall spending pressures. As we broaden the customer base for our defense products around the world, we expect our international sales and exports to grow. General Dynamics Annual Report 2010 19 Table of Contents Business-jet market conditions continued to improve in 2010, in line with the broader economic recovery, particularly in the large-cabin market. Our Aerospace group benefitted from increased flying hours, higher aircraft services activity, improved new-aircraft order interest and declining customer defaults. Barring any further economic turmoil, we believe the diversity and duration of our business-jet backlog positions the Aerospace group for further improvement in 2011 and beyond. Continued investment in new aircraft products is expected to drive Aerospace long-term growth, particularly as the group begins producing its newest aircraft offerings, the G250 and the G650, in 2011. Similarly, we believe that aircraft-service revenues provide the group diversified exposure to aftermarket sales fueled by continued growth in the global installed business-jet fleet. In these dynamic markets, we are committed to creating shareholder value through innovative product development, disciplined program execution and continuous improvement initiatives. Our solid performance is measured in our sustained revenue and earnings growth, margin improvement and efficient conversion of earnings into cash. Our record of excellent cash-flow conversion has enabled us to execute our operational strategy while providing us the flexibility to deploy our capital to further enhance shareholder returns through acquisitions, payment of dividends and share repurchases. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of our results of operations focuses on the material financial measures we use to evaluate our performance, including revenues, operating earnings and margins, cash flow, and orders and backlog. A consolidated overview is followed by a more detailed review of operating performance for each of our business groups: Aerospace, Combat Systems, Marine Systems and Information Systems and Technology. For the Aerospace group, results are analyzed with respect to specific lines of products and services, consistent with how the group is managed. For the defense business groups, the discussion is based on the types of products and services each group offers with supplemental discussion of specific significant contracts and programs that drive the groups results. In the Aerospace group, we recognize revenue using the percentage-of-completion method. As discussed further in the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section, sales contracts for new aircraft have two major phases: the manufacture of the green aircraft and the aircraft completion, which includes exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics. We record revenues on these contracts at two milestones: when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer, and when the customer accepts final delivery of the aircraft. Revenues in the Aerospace group aircraft outfitting and service businesses are recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of the service. Changes in revenues in this group result from the number and mix of new aircraft deliveries (both green and outfitted), the progress toward completion of aircraft outfitting activities, the level of service activity during the period and the number of pre-owned aircraft sold. In general, operating earnings and margins in the Aerospace group are a function of the prices we charge for our aircraft, our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft, and the mix of aircraft deliveries among the higher-margin large-cabin and lower-margin mid-cabin aircraft. Additional factors affecting the group earnings and margins include the volume and profitability of services work performed, the number and type of pre-owned aircraft sold, and the level of general and administrative costs incurred by the group, which include selling expenses and R&D costs. In the defense business groups, the majority of the revenues are generated by long-term government contracts. We account for revenues under these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under this method, revenue is recognized as work progresses, either as products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered. As a result, changes in revenues are generally discussed in terms of volume. Year-over-year variances attributed to volume indicate increases or decreases in revenues due to changes in production or construction activity levels, delivery schedules or levels of services on individual contracts. Operating earnings and margins in the defense business groups are discussed in terms of changes in revenue volume, performance or contract mix (i.e., higher- vs. lower-margin work). Performance refers to changes in contract earnings rates during the term of the contract based on revisions to estimates of profit at completion on individual contracts. These revisions result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract or the estimated costs required to complete the contract. Contract mix can result in higher or lower earnings and margins due to contract type (e.g., fixed-price/cost-reimbursable) or the phase of work (e.g., development/production) within those contracts. The following discussion of results provides additional disclosure to the extent that a material or unusual event caused a change in the profitability of a contract (e.g., contract losses/claims). Year Ended December 31 2008 2009 2010 Revenues Operating Earnings Revenues Operating Earnings Revenues Operating Earnings Aerospace $ 5,512 $ 1,021 $ 5,171 $ 707 $ 5,299 $ 860 Combat Systems 8,194 1,111 9,645 1,262 8,878 1,275 Marine Systems 5,556 521 6,363 642 6,677 674 Information Systems and Technology 10,038 1,075 10,802 1,151 11,612 1,219 Corporate (75) (87) (83) $ 29,300 $ 3,653 $ 31,981 $ 3,675 $ 32,466 $ 3,945 20 General Dynamics Annual Report 2010 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW REVIEW OF 2010 VS. 2009 Year Ended December 31 2009 2010 Variance Revenues $ 31,981 $ 32,466 $ 485 1.5 % Operating earnings 3,675 3,945 270 7.3 % Operating margin 11.5 % 12.2 % General Dynamics revenues increased in 2010 compared with 2009, with higher revenues in the Aerospace, Marine Systems and Information Systems and Technology groups offset in part by lower Combat Systems revenues. Aerospace revenues improved primarily due to higher aircraft services volume. Growing activity in Marine Systems U.S. Navy ship programs resulted in increased revenues for the group in 2010. Increases across the Information Systems and Technology portfolio contributed to revenue growth in the group in 2010, particularly in the tactical communication systems and information technology services businesses. Revenues decreased in the Combat Systems group due primarily to reduced volume on U.S. military vehicle programs. Our operating earnings growth significantly outpaced our sales growth in 2010. Each of our four business groups reported earnings growth compared with 2009. Earnings performance was particularly strong in the Aerospace and Combat Systems groups, both of which realized significant operating leverage in 2010. In the Aerospace group, operating margins were up due to improved pricing on aircraft services work and large-cabin aircraft deliveries, and the absence of pre-owned aircraft losses, which negatively impacted 2009 operating margins. Combat Systems 2010 margin expansion resulted from productivity improvements across the group, particularly in the U.S. military vehicle business, and a favorable contract mix, including reduced engineering and development work. Operating margins were steady in the Marine Systems group and down slightly in the Information Systems and Technology group due to a shift in contract mix. As a result, our overall operating margins increased by 70 basis points in 2010 compared with 2009. REVIEW OF 2009 VS. 2008 Year Ended December 31 2008 2009 Variance Revenues $ 29,300 $ 31,981 $ 2,681 9.2 % Operating earnings 3,653 3,675 22 0.6 % Operating margin 12.5 % 11.5 % In 2009, strong performance in each of our defense businesses more than offset reduced business-jet deliveries in the Aerospace group, resulting in significant top-line revenue growth over 2008. The Combat Systems and Marine Systems groups generated double-digit revenue growth on the strength of military vehicle and shipbuilding and repair programs. In the Information Systems and Technology group, increased volume in each of the group U.S. operations drove the group revenue growth. Revenues decreased in the Aerospace group in 2009 following our decision to cut aircraft production and deliveries in response to a significant downturn in the business-jet market. Our operating earnings increased slightly in 2009 over 2008 as earnings growth in each of our defense businesses was offset by reduced earnings in the Aerospace group. Overall, our operating margins decreased by 100 basis points in 2009 compared with 2008. Operating margins were up significantly in the Marine Systems group due to strong program execution, while margins were steady in the Information Systems and Technology group and down in the Combat Systems and Aerospace groups. CASH FLOW Cash flows from operations in 2010 exceeded net earnings for the 12 th consecutive year. Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.1 billion in 2008, $2.9 billion in 2009 and $3 billion in 2010. Over the three-year period, we deployed our cash to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures, repurchase our common stock, pay dividends and repay maturing debt. Our net debt, debt less cash and equivalents and marketable securities, was $378 at year-end 2010 compared with General Dynamics Annual Report 2010 21 Table of Contents $1.2 billion at the end of 2009. This decrease in net debt was achieved after the following capital deployment activities: $1.2 billion of share repurchases, $631 of dividends paid, $508 of company-sponsored research and development, $370 of capital expenditures, $335 of contributions to our retirement plans and $233 spent on acquisitions during the year. BACKLOG AND ESTIMATED POTENTIAL CONTRACT VALUE Our total backlog, including funded and unfunded portions, was $59.6 billion at the end of 2010 compared with $65.5 billion at year-end 2009. Strong orders across our defense businesses resulted in a book-to-bill ratio (orders divided by revenues) higher than 2009, despite increased revenues in 2010. Orders in our defense businesses were complemented by improving order activity in the Aerospace group, particularly in the second half of the year. The Aerospace group total backlog was $17.8 billion at the end of 2010, compared with $19.3 billion at year-end 2009. Aerospace funded backlog was $17.4 billion at the end of 2010 compared with $18.9 billion at the end of 2009. Aerospace funded backlog represents aircraft orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer. Net orders, adjusted for customer defaults, increased sequentially each quarter in 2010. However, aircraft deliveries exceeded net orders in 2010, resulting in the backlog decline. The Aerospace unfunded backlog of $378 at the end of 2010 consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services. The total backlog for our defense businesses decreased in 2010 to $41.8 billion at the end of the year, compared with $46.2 billion at the end of 2009. The defense backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts. Over half of the decline in our defense backlog during 2010 was in Marine Systems, which traditionally receives large, multi-year awards and works down that backlog in subsequent periods. The funded portion of the defense backlog was $25.9 billion at the end of 2010. This includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the Congress and funded by the customer, as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments. While there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program, we have included in the backlog only firm contracts we believe are likely to receive funding. Our backlog does not include work awarded under unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts, unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts or options to purchase new aircraft, which we refer to collectively as estimated potential contract value. Customers use IDIQ contracts for several reasons, including expanding the field of available contractors to maximize competition under a given program or when they have not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed. These agreements, which set forth the majority of the contractual terms, including prices, are funded as delivery orders are placed. A significant portion of our estimated potential contract value is composed of multiple-award IDIQ contracts in which we are one of several companies competing for task orders. We include only our estimate of the value we will receive under these arrangements. The estimated contract value also includes IDIQ contracts for which we have been designated as the sole-source supplier to design, develop, produce and integrate complex products and systems over several years for the military or other government agencies. We believe our customers intend to fully implement these products and systems. Because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customer future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders, we recognize these contracts in backlog only when they are funded. Contract options in our defense businesses represent agreements to perform additional work beyond the products and services associated with firm contracts, if the customer exercises the option. These options are negotiated in conjunction with a firm contract and provide the terms under which the customer may elect to procure additional units or services at a future date. Contract options in the Aerospace group represent options to purchase new aircraft and long-term agreements with fleet customers. We recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order. On December 31, 2010, the estimated potential contract value associated with these IDIQ contracts and contract options was approximately $21.8 billion, up significantly from $17.6 billion at the end of 2009. This represents our estimate of the potential value we will receive. The actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower. The estimated potential contract value in the Combat Systems group doubled from year-end 2009, while the Information Systems and Technology group estimated potential contract value increased nearly 20 percent. We expect to realize this value over the next 10 to 15 years, reflecting continued demand for our products and services well into the future. OTHER INFORMATION Net interest expense was $66 in 2008, $160 in 2009 and $157 in 2010. Additional debt issued in 2008 and 2009 resulted in the increase from 2008 to 2009. The decrease in 2010 was due largely to the repayment of $700 of fixed-rate notes in the third quarter of 2010. 22 General Dynamics Annual Report 2010 Table of Contents We expect net interest expense of approximately $135 to $140 in 2011, subject to capital deployment activities during the year. Our effective tax rate was 31.2 percent in 2008, 31.5 percent in 2009 and 30.7 percent in 2010. The 2008 rate included a $35, or approximately $0.09 per-share, benefit from the settlement of tax refund litigation, which reduced the 2008 tax rate by 100 basis points. We anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 31 percent in 2011. For additional discussion of tax matters, see Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2008, we entered into an agreement to sell our Spanish nitrocellulose operation and recognized a pretax loss of $11 in discontinued operations in anticipation of the sale. The sale of this operation was completed in 2010. Our reported revenues exclude the revenues associated with this divested business. We have presented the operating results of this business, along with the loss from the sale, as discontinued operations, net of income taxes. REVIEW OF BUSINESS GROUPS AEROSPACE Review of 2010 vs. 2009 Year Ended December 31 2009 2010 Variance Revenues $ 5,171 $ 5,299 $ 128 2.5 % Operating earnings 707 860 153 21.6 % Operating margin 13.7 % 16.2 % Gulfstream aircraft deliveries (in units): Green 94 99 5 5.3 % Completion 110 89 (21 ) (19.1 )% The Aerospace group revenues increased in 2010 compared with 2009 due primarily to steady growth in aircraft services activity throughout the year. Aircraft manufacturing and outfitting revenues remained consistent with 2009 levels, with an increase in manufacturing volume offset by reduced outfitting work. Aircraft manufacturing revenues increased 9 percent in 2010, the result of additional deliveries and a more favorable mix of green Gulfstream aircraft. The decline in aircraft outfitting revenues was associated primarily with the group completions work for other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), reflecting decreased OEM production across the broader business-jet market. Aircraft services revenues, which include both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation maintenance and repair work, fixed-base operations and aircraft management services, increased 15 percent in 2010, reflecting the growing installed base of business-jet aircraft and increased utilization as the business-jet market recovers following the economic downturn. Revenues from sales of pre-owned aircraft were down slightly from 2009. The group operating earnings improved significantly in 2010 compared with 2009, with improvements in all areas of the group portfolio. The components of the earnings growth were as follows: Aircraft manufacturing and outfitting $ 68 Pre-owned aircraft 40 Aircraft services 29 SG&A/other 16 Total increase in operating earnings $ 153 The group aircraft manufacturing and outfitting earnings were up in 2010 compared with 2009 due to the increase in aircraft manufacturing volume, as well as improved pricing on large-cabin aircraft and mix shift within large-cabin models. This increase was offset in part by reduced liquidated damages associated with fewer customer defaults. Margins for these activities were up 190 basis points compared with 2009. Pre-owned aircraft earnings improved significantly from 2009, when the group wrote down the carrying value of its pre-owned aircraft inventory. Pricing in the pre-owned market has improved since mid-2009, particularly for large-cabin aircraft, although inventories across the industry remain higher than historic norms. In 2010, the Aerospace group realized modest profits on its pre-owned sales, took no pre-owned aircraft write-downs and ended the year with no pre-owned aircraft in inventory. Consistent with the increased volume, aircraft services earnings continued to improve from 2009. Margins associated with aircraft services were up 70 basis points in 2010 due to improved marketplace pricing. The group operating earnings in 2010 were also favorably impacted by the timing of R&D expenditures and the absence of severance costs associated with workforce reductions in 2009. As a result of the factors discussed above, the group overall operating margins increased 250 basis points in 2010 compared with 2009. Review of 2009 vs. 2008 Year Ended December 31 2008 2009 Variance Revenues $ 5,512 $ 5,171 $ (341 ) (6.2 )% Operating earnings 1,021 707 (314 ) (30.8 )% Operating margin 18.5 % 13.7 % Gulfstream aircraft deliveries (in units): Green 156 94 (62 ) (39.7 )% Completion 152 110 (42 ) (27.6 )% The Aerospace group revenues decreased in 2009, the result of a decline in sales of Gulfstream aircraft that was offset in part by the addition of Jet Aviation, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2008. We reduced Gulfstream 2009 aircraft production, primarily in the group mid-cabin General Dynamics Annual Report 2010 23 Table of Contents models, in response to the market downturn in late 2008. As a result, aircraft-manufacturing revenues decreased significantly in 2009 compared with 2008. Gulfstream aircraft-services revenues were down in 2009 due to reduced flying hours and customer deferral of aircraft maintenance. The group operating earnings declined in 2009 compared with 2008 due primarily to the factors noted above. The earnings decline associated with decreased Gulfstream aircraft deliveries was mitigated by cost-reduction initiatives, liquidated damages collected on defaulted aircraft contracts, and the fact that the majority of the reduction in deliveries was in our lower-margin mid-cabin aircraft. As a result, aircraft manufacturing margins increased in 2009 over 2008 despite the decline in volume during the year. Aircraft services earnings were steady, as the addition of Jet Aviation offset a decrease at Gulfstream. However, competitive marketplace pressures reduced margins. Operating earnings in 2009 were also negatively impacted by losses on pre-owned aircraft inventories and severance costs associated with workforce reductions. Overall, the group operating margins decreased 480 basis points in 2009 compared with 2008. Backlog and Estimated Potential Contract Value The Aerospace group finished 2010 with a total backlog of $17.8 billion, of which $17.4 billion was funded. The group booked the highest number of orders for new aircraft in 2010 since the introduction of the G650 in 2008. Customer demand improved throughout the year, with net orders, adjusted for customer defaults, improving sequentially in each quarter of 2010. However, aircraft deliveries exceeded net orders in 2010, resulting in the backlog decline. We expect net order activity to remain strong in 2011. The group large-cabin backlog remains well positioned, with an 18- to 24-month period between customer order and aircraft delivery. While improving, conditions in the mid-cabin market remain difficult, though these aircraft represent a small share of the group portfolio. Order activity has been further strengthened by the group newest aircraft models, the G650 and the G250. Both of these aircraft continue to perform well in flight testing and remain on track for 2011 aircraft certification. The G250 and the G650 are scheduled to enter service in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Over the past few years, the group customer base has become increasingly diverse, both in customer type and geographic region. Approximately two-thirds of the group year-end backlog is composed of private companies and individual buyers, though we are seeing renewed interest from large public companies. While the installed base of aircraft is predominately in North America, international customers comprise nearly 60 percent of the group backlog, with growing order interest in emerging markets, particularly from the Asia-Pacific region. Total backlog does not include options to purchase new aircraft or long-term agreements with fleet customers. These arrangements totaled $1.4 billion at the end of 2010 and are included in estimated potential contract value. 2011 Outlook We expect an increase of approximately 15 to 16 percent in the group revenues in 2011 compared with 2010, the result of increased large-cabin aircraft deliveries, including initial green deliveries of the G650, and continued growth in aircraft services activity. We expect the Aerospace group margins to be in the mid- to high-15 percent range, down modestly from 2010, due to reduced liquidated damages associated with fewer customer defaults and increasing service activity. COMBAT SYSTEMS Review of 2010 vs. 2009 Year Ended December 31 2009 2010 Variance Revenues $ 9,645 $ 8,878 $ (767 ) (8.0 )% Operating earnings 1,262 1,275 13 1.0 % Operating margin 13.1 % 14.4 % The Combat Systems group revenues were down in 2010 compared with 2009 due to reduced volume in the group U.S. and European military vehicle businesses. The decrease in the group revenues consisted of the following: U.S. military vehicles $ (600) Weapons systems and munitions 6 European military vehicles (173) Total decrease in revenues $ (767) In the group U.S. military vehicle business, lower Mine-Resistant, Ambush-Protected (MRAP) vehicle production and reduced engineering work represented the majority of the decline in revenues from 2009. The group deliveries of MRAP vehicles have fluctuated over the past two years in response to the customer urgent deployment needs. The reduction in activity on engineering programs related primarily to the 2009 cancellation of the manned ground vehicle portion of the Future Combat Systems (FCS) 24 General Dynamics Annual Report 2010 Table of Contents program and decreased volume on the Marine Corps Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV). These declines were offset in part by increased volume on the group foreign military sales (FMS) contracts to provide light armored vehicles (LAVs) and tanks to international customers. Revenues were steady in the group weapons systems and munitions businesses. Increased sales of axles, largely in the military market, and higher demand for the group propellant products and munitions in Canada, were offset in part by lower armor kit production and the completion of deliveries of detection systems that protect U.S. combat forces from improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Revenues in the group European military vehicle business decreased in 2010 as a result of the ramp-down of the Leopard tank program for the Spanish government and lower activity on the group Pandur and Piranha vehicle contracts for various international customers. Increased activity on other vehicle contracts, including the EAGLE vehicle for Germany, helped offset these decreases. Despite the decline in revenues, the Combat Systems group operating earnings increased slightly in 2010. Productivity improvements across the group, particularly in the U.S. military vehicle business, and a favorable contract mix that included reduced engineering and development work resulted in significant margin improvement in 2010. The group operating margins increased 130 basis points in 2010 compared with 2009. Review of 2009 vs. 2008 Year Ended December 31 2008 2009 Variance Revenues $ 8,194 $ 9,645 $ 1,451 17.7 % Operating earnings 1,111 1,262 151 13.6 % Operating margin 13.6 % 13.1 % In 2009, the Combat Systems group revenues increased significantly compared with 2008 due to strong contributions from each of the group businesses. In the group U.S. military vehicle business, increased Stryker wheeled combat vehicle and Abrams main battle tank volume was the primary contributor of the revenue growth. Revenues were up in the group weapons systems and munitions businesses due to the acquisition of AxleTech International in December 2008, increased production of armor kits and an increase in deliveries of Hydra-70 rockets. The group European military vehicle business generated strong revenue growth in 2009 as a result of higher activity on several wheeled vehicle production programs. The Combat Systems group operating earnings grew in 2009, though at a lower rate than revenues, resulting in a 50 basis-point decrease in operating margins compared with 2008. The operating margins in 2008 were influenced by a favorable program mix in the U.S. military vehicle business. Backlog and Estimated Potential Contract Value The Combat Systems group total backlog was $11.8 billion at the end of 2010, down from $13.4 billion at year-end 2009. Funded backlog decreased 5 percent in 2010 to $10.9 billion at year end. The group backlog consists primarily of long-term production contracts that have scheduled deliveries through 2016. The Army Stryker wheeled combat vehicle program comprised $1.8 billion of the group backlog at year end, including the production of vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2012. The group received over $1.7 billion of Stryker orders in 2010, including awards for contractor logistics support, vehicle production and engineering services. Stryker orders in 2010 also included awards for Stryker double-V-hulled vehicles, designed and developed in quick response to the customer urgent deployment requirements. The group backlog at the end of 2010 included $1.7 billion for M1 Abrams main battle tank modernization and upgrade programs. These programs include the M1A2 System Enhancement Package (SEP) under which we retrofit Abrams tanks with improved electronics, command-and-control capabilities and armor enhancements that are designed to improve the tanks effectiveness. The group continued work in 2010 on a multi-year contract awarded in 2008 to upgrade the remaining M1A1 Abrams tanks to the SEP configuration. Approximately half of the group Abrams backlog at year end was for the SEP program. In 2010, the group received awards from the Army totaling $380 for all Abrams-related programs. The group backlog at year end also included approximately $400 under the MRAP program, largely for upgrade kits for previously delivered RG-31 vehicles, and $305 for the EFV program. The Combat Systems group has several significant international military vehicle production contracts in backlog. The backlog at the end of the year included: $1.9 billion for LAVs under several FMS contracts, $520 for the production of Pizarro Advanced Infantry Fighting Vehicles scheduled for delivery to the Spanish army through 2016, $460 for Pandur vehicles for several international customers, General Dynamics Annual Report 2010 25 Table of Contents $215 from the Swiss government to provide Duro wheeled armored personnel vehicles, $200 for the design, integration and production of seven prototypes under the U.K. Specialist Vehicle program, in addition to the integration work being performed by the Information Systems and Technology group and $180 for a contract with the German government to provide EAGLE IV wheeled military vehicles. The Combat Systems group backlog at year end also included approximately $2.6 billion in weapons systems and munitions programs. In 2010, the group received awards totaling approximately $275 for the production of Hydra-70 rockets. The group also received awards worth approximately $180 from the Canadian government to supply various calibers of ammunition, $150 from the Army for armor for Stryker and Bradley vehicles and $75 from the Army for production of M2A1 machine guns. Combat Systems backlog does not include approximately $4.6 billion of estimated potential contract value associated with the group anticipated share of IDIQ contracts and unexercised options. The group estimated potential contract value doubled since year-end 2009 due to contracts awarded in 2010, including the Specialist Vehicle and Hydra-70 rocket programs. 2011 Outlook We expect Combat Systems revenues to remain in the $9 billion range in 2011 with growth in international vehicle contracts, steady volume on U.S. weapons and munitions programs, and a reduction in volume on some of the group U.S. vehicle programs. We expect the group operating margins to be approximately 14 percent, down modestly from 2010 due to a shift in program mix. MARINE SYSTEMS Review of 2010 vs. 2009 Year Ended December 31 2009 2010 Variance Revenues $ 6,363 $ 6,677 $ 314 4.9% Operating earnings 642 674 32 5.0% Operating margin 10.1 % 10.1 % The Marine Systems group revenues increased in 2010 compared with 2009 as growth in several U.S. Navy programs offset a decline in commercial ship construction. The increase in revenues consisted of the following: Multi-year Navy ship construction $ 170 Other Navy ship design, construction, engineering and repair 279 Commercial ship construction (135) Total increase in revenues $ 314 The group multi-year ship-construction programs for the U.S. Navy include Virginia-class submarines, DDG-51 and DDG-1000 destroyers, and T-AKE combat-logistics ships. The principal driver of revenue growth in 2010 was increased activity on the Virginia-class program as the group continued to ramp toward construction of two submarines per year in 2011. The group delivered the seventh boat under the program in 2010 while construction continued on the next five boats. Deliveries of the remaining 11 boats under contract are scheduled through 2018. In our surface combatant business, volume decreased on the DDG-51 Arleigh Burke program as the current multi-ship contract nears completion. Offsetting this decline was an increase in activity on the group design and construction contract for the first DDG-1000 Zumwalt-class destroyer. The remaining two DDG-51 destroyers under contract are scheduled for delivery in 2011 and 2012, and the first DDG-1000 delivery is scheduled in 2014. Activity on the group T-AKE program was down in 2010 as construction continued on the remaining four ships. The group delivered the ninth and 10th ships in 2010, and deliveries of the last four ships are scheduled through 2012. In 2010, the group also began advanced design efforts for the Mobile Landing Platform (MLP) program. In addition to these ship-construction programs, revenues were up significantly in 2010 on the group engineering programs, particularly work associated with the next-generation ballistic-missile submarine (SSBN). The group is performing initial concept studies, including design of a Common Missile Compartment for both the U.S. Navy and the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom. The group ship repair work has remained steady in 2010 following significant growth in 2009. In 2010, the group completed construction on the final two ships of a five-ship commercial product-carrier contract. Given the success of this program, the age of the fleet of Jones Act ships and environmental regulations that require double-hull tankers and impose emission control limits, we anticipate additional commercial shipbuilding opportunities as the economy recovers. The Marine Systems group operating earnings increased in 2010 consistent with the increase in revenues. Operating margins remained steady compared with 2009, though the group is undergoing a shift in contract mix. Activity on the group destroyer programs is moving from the fixed-price DDG-51 program to the cost-reimbursable DDG-1000 contract, and the Virginia-class program is transitioning from the mature Block II contract to the Block III contract. Favorable performance on the T-AKE and commercial product carrier programs in 2010 helped offset this mix shift. 26 General Dynamics Annual Report 2010 Table of Contents Review of 2009 vs. 2008 Year Ended December 31 2008 2009 Variance Revenues $ 5,556 $ 6,363 $ 807 14.5 % Operating earnings 521 642 121 23.2 % Operating margin 9.4 % 10.1 % Revenues were up significantly in 2009 across the Marine Systems group. Increased activity on the Virginia-class program in preparation of starting construction of two submarines per year contributed almost two-thirds of the group increase in 2009 revenues. Volume also increased on the DDG-1000 and the group engineering and repair programs for the Navy. Lower activity on the DDG-51 and T-AKE programs slightly offset the other volume increases in the group in 2009. The Marine Systems group operating earnings increased significantly in 2009. As a result of operational efficiencies realized at each of its businesses, the group increased program earnings rates in 2009 on the Virginia-class, DDG-51, DDG-1000 and commercial product carrier programs. These improvements increased the group overall margins by 70 basis points in 2009, a significant improvement following a 100-basis point margin increase in 2008. Backlog and Estimated Potential Contract Value The Marine Systems group backlog consists of long-term submarine and ship construction programs, as well as numerous repair and engineering contracts. The group generally receives large contract awards that provide backlog for several years. For example, in 2008, the group received a $14 billion contract for the construction of eight Virginia-class submarines to be delivered through 2018, increasing backlog to an all-time high of $26.4 billion at the end of 2008. Consistent with this historical pattern, as the group has performed on these multi-year contracts, the backlog has decreased to $20.1 billion at year-end 2010. The group funded backlog was $7.1 billion at the end of both 2009 and 2010. The Virginia-class submarine program was the group largest program in 2010 and is the largest contract in the group backlog. The group backlog at year end included $13.7 billion for 11 Virginia-class submarines. As the prime contractor on the Virginia-class program, we report the entire backlog and revenues associated with the program but share the construction activity and the earnings with our teaming partner. Navy destroyer programs represent another significant component of the group backlog. These include the Arleigh Burke-class DDG-51 and Zumwalt-class DDG-1000 destroyer programs. The group backlog at the end of 2010 included $855 for the ongoing design effort and construction of the first DDG-1000. In 2010, the group received approximately $420 in orders under the DDG-1000 program, including continued engineering and support services, long-lead construction for the second ship and long-lead material for the third ship. The group expects to be awarded construction contracts for the second and third DDG-1000 ships in 2011. At year end, the backlog also included approximately $220 for the remaining two DDG-51 destroyers under contract. The Navy plans to continue the DDG-51 program, and the group expects to receive an award for an additional DDG-51 in 2011 following funding for long-lead material for this ship in 2010. The Marine Systems group backlog at year end included approximately $965 for the four remaining ships under the Navy T-AKE combat-logistics ship program. In 2010, we received construction contracts for the last two ships of the program. The year-end backlog also included approximately $340 for the group second ship under the Navy Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program, scheduled for delivery in 2012, and $95 for the MLP program. The Navy plans to build three MLP auxiliary support ships, and the contract for construction of the first ship is scheduled to be awarded in 2011. In addition, the Marine Systems group backlog at year end included approximately $3.9 billion for engineering, repair, overhaul and other services, including engineering and design efforts for the next-generation SSBN. 2011 Outlook We expect the Marine Systems group revenues in 2011 to remain near 2010 levels as increased Virginia-class production and submarine engineering activity is offset by lower DDG-51, T-AKE and commercial volume. We expect the group operating margins to decline to the low-9 percent range due to the continued mix shift in ship-construction programs. General Dynamics Annual Report 2010 27 Table of Contents INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY Review of 2010 vs. 2009 Year Ended December 31 2009 2010 Variance Revenues $ 10,802 $ 11,612 $ 810 7.5 % Operating earnings 1,151 1,219 68 5.9 % Operating margin 10.7 % 10.5 % The Information Systems and Technology group generated strong top-line growth in 2010, with over 5 percent organic growth. The increase in revenues over 2009 was driven by the group tactical communication systems and information technology services businesses: Tactical communication systems $ 421 Information technology (IT) services 342 Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) systems 47 Total increase in revenues $ 810 Revenues in the tactical communication systems business increased significantly in 2010 due to higher volume in battlefield communication programs, in particular the Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T) mobile communication network, and ruggedized computing products. Revenues in the group United Kingdom-based operations also increased in 2010 as work began on the demonstration phase of the U.K. Ministry of Defence Specialist Vehicle program. In the IT services business, volume increased on the group IT support and modernization programs for the intelligence community and the Network-Centric Solutions (NETCENTS) program, which provides network support for federal agencies. Revenues also increased in this business as a result of the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) facility changes, including work on the New Campus East (NCE) contract for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center relocation and Fort Belvoir Community Hospital outfitting for the Army. Revenues were up in 2010 compared with 2009 in the group ISR business as a result of the acquisition of Axsys Technologies, Inc., in the third quarter of 2009. The group also experienced growth in cyber-related programs across its businesses in 2010, including systems that prevent network attacks, increase situational awareness and reduce network vulnerability. The Information Systems and Technology group operating earnings increased in 2010, although at a slightly lower rate than revenues, resulting in a modest decrease in margins compared with 2009. The reduction in margins resulted from a shift in the group contract mix to include a growing proportion of IT services work. Review of 2009 vs. 2008 Year Ended December 31 2008 2009 Variance Revenues $ 10,038 $ 10,802 $ 764 7.6 % Operating earnings 1,075 1,151 76 7.1 % Operating margin 10.7 % 10.7 % The Information Systems and Technology group generated revenue growth in each of the group market segments in 2009. Organic growth of more than 4 percent was augmented by acquisitions in the group IT services and ISR businesses. Revenues increased on the WIN-T program and ground-based satellite communications programs in the group tactical communication business. In the IT services business, higher volume on several IT infrastructure and support contracts, including NCE and NETCENTS, accounted for the increase in revenues. Growing levels of cyber security-related work and higher activity on several classified programs contributed to the growth in the group ISR business. Operating earnings increased in line with revenues in 2009, resulting in operating margins of 10.7 percent, consistent with 2008. Higher margins in the tactical communications and ISR businesses due to improved performance and a favorable shift in contract mix were offset by decreased margins in the IT services business. Backlog and Estimated Potential Contract Value The Information Systems and Technology group received the highest level of orders in the group history in 2010, generating a book-to-bill ratio of nearly one-to-one. As a result, the group ended the year with a backlog of $9.8 billion after reporting record-level revenues in 2010. The group backlog does not include approximately $15.2 billion of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of IDIQ contracts and unexercised options. In 2010, funding under IDIQ contracts and options contributed over $4.3 billion to the group backlog, or nearly 40 percent of the group orders. The estimated potential contract value in the Information Systems and Technology group increased nearly 20 28 General Dynamics Annual Report 2010 Table of Contents percent from year-end 2009, due most notably to unexercised options associated with the U.K. Specialist Vehicle and combat and seaframe control systems for the Independence Class of ships under the LCS program. When combined with backlog, the group total estimated potential contract value increased by 8 percent over 2009 to $25 billion. Unlike our other defense businesses, the Information Systems and Technology group backlog consists of thousands of contracts that largely have to be reconstituted each year with new program and task order awards. While the group has relatively few large-scale, long-term programs, there are several significant contracts that provide a solid foundation for the business. Programs for the U.K. Ministry of Defence comprised approximately $835 of the group backlog at the end of 2010, most notably the BOWMAN and the Specialist Vehicle programs. The group has successfully fielded the BOWMAN communications system, the secure digital voice and data communications system for the U.K. armed forces, and is now performing maintenance and long-term support and enhancement activities for the program. In 2010, the Ministry of Defence awarded the group a contract for the demonstration phase of its Specialist Vehicle program. In this phase, the group will manage the design, integration and production of seven prototype vehicles. Work and the backlog under the contract are shared with the Combat Systems group, including a significant portion of the future vehicle production effort. The group backlog at year-end 2010 included approximately $645 for the Army WIN-T program. Information Systems and Technology is the prime contractor on this battlefield communications network designed to provide warfighters with fast, secure, mobile command-and-control capabilities. In 2010, the group received approximately $405 of awards for WIN-T, bringing the total program value to $2.7 billion. The backlog does not include $920 of estimated potential contract value for the WIN-T program awarded under an IDIQ format. Approximately $340 of the group backlog at year end was for the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Project (MHP). Under the MHP program, the group is providing integrated mission systems, training and support for 28 state-of-the-art helicopters that are intended to replace Canada aging fleet of marine helicopters. The Information Systems and Technology group backlog at year end also included approximately $225 for the Common Hardware/Software III (CHS-3) program to provide commercial and ruggedized computers, network equipment and software to the U.S. armed forces and other U.S. federal agencies. In 2010, the group received over $500 in orders under this program, bringing the total contract value to more than $2.4 billion. The group backlog at the end of 2010 included approximately $960 for a number of facility infrastructure and support programs, including NCE, NETCENTS, and the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and Mark Center facilities. In addition to these programs, the group received a number of significant contract awards in 2010, including the following: $240 from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for the Space Network Ground Segment Sustainment (SGSS) project to modernize the ground segment of the satellite communications network used by NASA. $190 for the Warfighter Field Operations Customer Support (FOCUS) program to provide support for the Army live, virtual and constructive training operations. $150 from Austal USA for design, integration and testing of combat and seaframe control systems for one LCS. The contract includes options for nine additional ships that are scheduled to be exercised over the next five years and are included in the group estimated potential contract value. $110 for the Army Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Handheld, Manpack, Small Form Fit (HMS) radio program, bringing the total contract value to over $700. $80 from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to design, manufacture and install antennas for Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites-R (GOES-R). $55 from the Department of Homeland Security U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) to analyze and reduce cyber threats and vulnerabilities. Information Systems and Technology was awarded several significant IDIQ contracts during 2010, including the following: One of 46 awards from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) under the Information Technology Supplies and Support Services (ITSSS) program to provide technical services and engage in developmental projects and programs. The program has a maximum potential value of $30 billion among all awardees over eight years. One of 11 awards under the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) Solutions for the Information Technology Enterprise (SITE) program. The program has a maximum potential value of $6.6 billion among all awardees over five years. One of five awards under the Missile Defense Agency Engineering and Support Services (MiDAESS) program to provide systems engineering and testing services. The program has a maximum potential value of $1.6 billion among all awardees over five years. One of three awards under the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) System Engineering 2020 Research and Development/Mission Analysis Support program. Our award under this program has a maximum potential value of $1.2 billion over 10 years. General Dynamics Annual Report 2010 29 Table of Contents One of 14 awards from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency to develop satellite-based intelligence-gathering technology for the Total Application Services for Enterprise Requirements (TASER) program. The program has a maximum potential value of $1 billion among all awardees over five years. One of three awards under the Navy Common Afloat Local Area Network Infrastructure (CALI) program to provide ships and submarines with secure hardware, software and networking equipment. The program has a maximum potential value of $500 among all awardees. One of five contracts to support several of the Army healthcare construction projects, including modernization of current Army medical facilities and transition to newly constructed facilities. The program has a maximum potential value of over $400 among all awardees over four years. 2011 Outlook We expect revenues in the Information Systems and Technology group to grow approximately 3 to 5 percent in 2011. We expect each of the group businesses to contribute to the growth, particularly in the areas of IT support services for intelligence and federal civilian customers, and tactical communication systems. The group operating margins are expected to decline slightly but remain above 10 percent based on the projected contract mix in 2011. CORPORATE Corporate results consist primarily of compensation expense for stock options. Corporate operating expenses totaled $75 in 2008, $87 in 2009 and $83 in 2010. (See Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our stock options.) We expect 2011 Corporate operating expenses of approximately $90 to $95. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In the mid-1990s, General Dynamics embarked on a strategy of disciplined capital deployment, generating strong cash flow to enable a series of acquisitions designed to grow the company beyond our core platform businesses. This has resulted in a larger, more diversified company incorporating new products and technologies that meet the needs of an expanded customer base. We continue to place a strong emphasis on cash generation and capital allocation and deployment. This focus has afforded us the financial flexibility to deploy our cash resources to generate shareholder value while preserving a strong balance sheet to position us for future opportunities. Year Ended December 31 2008 2009 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,124 $ 2,855 $ 2,986 Net cash used by investing activities (3,663 ) (1,392 ) (408 ) Net cash used by financing activities (718 ) (806 ) (2,226 ) Net cash used by discontinued operations (13 ) (15 ) (2 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and equivalents (1,270 ) 642 350 Cash and equivalents at beginning of year 2,891 1,621 2,263 Cash and equivalents at end of year 1,621 2,263 2,613 Marketable securities 143 360 212 Short- and long-term debt (4,024 ) (3,864 ) (3,203 ) Net debt (a) $ (2,260 ) $ (1,241 ) $ (378 ) Debt-to-equity (b) 40.0 % 31.1 % 24.1 % Debt-to-capital (c) 28.6 % 23.7 % 19.4 % (a) Net debt is calculated as total debt less cash and equivalents and marketable securities. (b) Debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total equity. (c) Debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus total equity. Our cash balances are invested primarily in time deposits from highly rated banks, commercial paper rated A1/P1 or higher and repurchase agreements with direct obligations of the Spanish government as collateral. Our marketable securities balances are invested primarily in term deposits and high-quality corporate, municipal and U.S. government-sponsored debt securities. The marketable securities have an average duration of two months and an average credit rating of AA. We have not incurred any material losses associated with these investments. The following is a discussion of our major operating, investing and financing activities for each of the past three years, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 30 General Dynamics Annual Report 2010 Table of Contents OPERATING ACTIVITIES We generated cash from operating activities of $3.1 billion in 2008, $2.9 billion in 2009 and $3 billion in 2010. In all three years, the operating cash flow was attributed primarily to net earnings. In 2008 and 2009, increasing levels of customer deposits, particularly in the Aerospace group, reduced our operating working capital (OWC) and increased our operating cash flow. In addition, 2009 cash from operating activities reflected the collection of approximately $150 from the Czech Republic after we signed a renegotiated contract to provide Pandur II wheeled vehicles. Termination of A-12 Program. As discussed further in Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements, litigation on the A-12 program termination has been ongoing since 1991. If, contrary to our expectations, the default termination ultimately is sustained and the government prevails on its recovery theories, we, along with The Boeing Company, could collectively be required to repay the U.S. government as much as $1.4 billion for progress payments received for the A-12 contract, plus interest, which was approximately $1.5 billion at December 31, 2010. If this were the outcome, we would owe half of the total, or approximately $1.4 billion pretax. Our after-tax cash obligation would be approximately $725. We believe we have sufficient resources, including access to capital markets, to pay such an obligation, if required. INVESTING ACTIVITIES We used $3.7 billion in 2008, $1.4 billion in 2009 and $408 in 2010 for investing activities. The primary uses of cash in investing activities were business acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities. Investing activities also include proceeds received from the sale of assets and marketable securities. Business Acquisitions. In 2008, we completed five acquisitions for a total of $3.2 billion. In 2009, we completed two acquisitions for $811. In 2010, we completed three acquisitions for $233. We financed these acquisitions using cash on hand and commercial paper. (See Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the acquisitions.) Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures were $490 in 2008, $385 in 2009 and $370 in 2010. The decrease in 2009 and 2010 compared with 2008 resulted from the completion of several major facility improvement projects in the Aerospace and Marine Systems groups. During 2010, the Aerospace group announced a new $500, seven-year facilities expansion project at the group Savannah campus. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $550 in 2011, less than 2 percent of revenues. Marketable Securities. As a result of lower market interest rates, we have expanded our investments in available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities in recent years to generate additional return. Net sales/maturities of these securities were $17 in 2008 compared with net purchases of $235 in 2009 and net sales/maturities of $115 in 2010. FINANCING ACTIVITIES We used $718 in 2008, $806 in 2009 and $2.2 billion in 2010 for financing activities. Our financing activities include issuances and repayments of debt, payment of dividends and repurchases of common stock. Net cash from financing activities also includes proceeds received from stock option exercises. Debt Proceeds, Net. In 2008, we issued $904 of commercial paper, primarily to fund acquisitions during the year. During that year we also repaid $500 of fixed-rate notes, $150 of senior notes and $20 of term debt on their scheduled maturity dates. We issued $1 billion of five-year fixed-rate notes in December 2008 and another $750 of two-year fixed-rate notes in June 2009. We used the proceeds from the fixed-rate notes for general corporate purposes, including working capital requirements, capital expenditures and to term out our commercial paper borrowings. In August 2010, we repaid $700 of fixed-rate notes on their scheduled maturity date. We ended 2010 with no commercial paper outstanding, and our total debt balance was down approximately $660 from 2009, resulting in a debt-to-equity ratio of 24.1 percent, down 7 percentage points from year-end 2009. We have approximately $2 billion in bank credit facilities that have not been drawn upon. These facilities provide backup liquidity to our commercial paper program. We also have an effective shelf registration on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The next material repayment of long-term debt is $750 of fixed-rate notes scheduled to mature in July of 2011. As we approach the maturity date, we will determine whether to repay these notes with cash on hand or refinance the obligation. (See Note J to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our debt obligations, including scheduled debt maturities.) Dividends. Our board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share on March 3, 2010, the 13 th consecutive annual increase. The board had previously increased the quarterly dividend to $0.38 per share in March 2009 and $0.35 per share in March 2008. Share Repurchases. Our board of directors has historically supported management tactical repurchase of our shares, typically in repurchase authorizations of 10 million-share increments. We repurchased 20 million shares on the open market in 2008, 3.6 million shares in 2009 and 18.9 million shares in 2010. As a result, we reduced our shares outstanding by 3.5 percent in the past year and by 8 percent since 2008. On February 2, 2011, the board authorized management to repurchase up to an additional 10 million shares, about 3 percent of our total shares outstanding. We expect to continue to repurchase shares as part of our capital deployment activities in the future. General Dynamics Annual Report 2010 31 Table of Contents NON-GAAP MANAGEMENT METRICS We emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns. In 2010, for the 12 th consecutive year, net cash provided by operating activities exceeded net earnings. We deployed this cash to complete acquisitions, continue our trend of annual dividend increases and repurchase our outstanding shares. As described below, we use free cash flow and return on invested capital (ROIC) to measure our ability to efficiently convert net earnings into cash and to earn a return on the deployment of that capital. Free Cash Flow. We define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors, because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our core businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends. We use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management. The following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Year Ended December 31 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,156 $ 2,952 $ 3,124 $ 2,855 $ 2,986 Capital expenditures (334 ) (474 ) (490 ) (385 ) (370 ) Free cash flow from operations $ 1,822 $ 2,478 $ 2,634 $ 2,470 $ 2,616 Cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations: Net cash provided by operating activities 126 % 142 % 126 % 119 % 114 % Free cash flow from operations 107 % 119 % 106 % 103 % 100 % Over the past five years, we have generated free cash flow from operations well in excess of our earnings from continuing operations during the period, an average 106 percent conversion rate. We expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short- and long-term liquidity needs. We believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy. Return on Invested Capital. We believe ROIC is a useful measure for investors, because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations. We use ROIC to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management. We define ROIC as net operating profit after taxes divided by the sum of the average debt and shareholders equity for the year. Net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus after-tax interest and amortization expense.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Management Discussion and Analysis of our Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to long-term contracts and programs, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, workers compensation, warranty obligations, pre-owned aircraft inventory, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application: Revenue Recognition. We account for revenues and earnings in our defense and aerospace businesses using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we recognize contract revenue as the work progresses, either as the products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered, as applicable. We estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit General Dynamics Annual Report 2010 33 Table of Contents over the remaining life of the contract based on either input measures (e.g., costs incurred) or output measures (e.g., contract milestones or units delivered), as appropriate to the circumstances. Where an interim output measure is reliably determinable and representative of progress toward completion, we use such output measures. Otherwise, we use input measures. We generally measure progress toward completion on contracts in our defense businesses based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion or based on unit deliveries under the contract. Our contracts for the manufacture of business-jet aircraft usually provide for two major phases: the manufacture of the green aircraft (i.e., before exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics) and its completion. We record revenue at two contractual milestones: when green aircraft are delivered to, and accepted by, the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft. We do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless (1) a contract has been executed with the customer and (2) the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract, as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer and other factors. We include revisions of estimated profits on contracts in earnings under the reallocation method rather than the cumulative catch-up method. Under the reallocation method, the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term, while under the cumulative catch-up method such impact would be recognized immediately. If a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract, we recognize the loss in the period it is identified. Anticipated losses cover all costs allocable to the contracts, including general and administrative expenses on government contracts. We use the reallocation method because we believe the majority of factors that typically result in changes in estimates of total contract revenue, total costs or the extent of progress toward completion on our long-term contracts affect both the period in which the change is identified and future periods. We believe these changes generally reflect expectations as to future performance and, therefore, the reallocation method is the method that best matches our revenues and earnings in the periods in which they are earned. While we have applied this method consistently for more than 30 years, most contractors use the cumulative catch-up method. The percentage-of-completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion, and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications or other disputes. Contract estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years, including future labor productivity and availability, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials, the impact of delayed performance, the availability and timing of funding from the customer, and the timing of product deliveries. These estimates are based on our best judgment. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our contracts. We review our contract estimates regularly to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflect changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method. We recognize revenue arising from claims either as income or as an offset against a potential loss only when the amount of the claim can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. In evaluating these criteria, we consider the contractual/legal basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim. We recognize revenue from award or incentive fees when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee. Estimates of award or incentive fees are based on actual award experience and anticipated performance. Goodwill. Since 1995, we have acquired 57 businesses at a total cost of approximately $21 billion, including three in 2010. In connection with these acquisitions, we have recognized $12.6 billion of goodwill. Goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not. The test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process that requires a significant level of estimation by management, particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units. These estimates require the use of judgment. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations. This requires numerous assumptions, including the timing of work embedded in our backlog, our performance and profitability under our contracts, our success in securing future business and the appropriate interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows. This discounted cash flow analysis is corroborated by top-down analyses, including a market assessment of our enterprise value. Beyond the annual impairment test, we review for factors on a quarterly basis that may lead us to perform a goodwill impairment test, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit. We have recorded no goodwill impairment to date and do not anticipate any reasonably possible circumstances that would lead to an impairment in the foreseeable future. The fair value of each of our reporting units on December 31, 2010, substantially exceeded its carrying value. Commitments and Contingencies. We are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either out of the ordinary course of our business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment. We record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable. The ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known. 34 General Dynamics Annual Report 2010 Table of Contents Deferred Contract Costs. Certain costs incurred in the performance of our government contracts are recorded under GAAP but are not currently allocable to contracts. Such costs include a portion of our estimated workers compensation obligations, other insurance-related assessments, pension and other post-retirement benefits, and environmental expenses. These costs will become allocable to contracts generally after they are paid. We have elected to defer (or inventory) these costs in contracts in process until they can be allocated to contracts and recovered from the government. We expect to recover these costs through ongoing business, including existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts. This business base includes numerous contracts for which we are the sole source or one of two suppliers on long-term defense programs. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs under our current and probable follow-on contracts. This assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs, the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity. These estimates are based on our best judgment. If the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected. Retirement Plans. Our defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on a series of assumptions and estimates. The key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected long-term rates of return on plan assets. We determine the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period. We determine the long-term rate of return on assets based on historical returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy. These estimates are based on our best judgment, including consideration of current and future market conditions. In the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted, future pension and post-retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease. For the impact of hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for our commercial pension and post-retirement benefit plans, see Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As discussed under Deferred Contract Costs, our contractual arrangements with the U.S. government provide for the recovery of benefit costs for our government retirement plans. We have elected to defer recognition of the benefit costs that cannot currently be allocated to contracts to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses. Accordingly, the impact on the retirement benefit cost for these plans that results from annual changes in assumptions does not impact our future earnings either positively or negatively. We believe that our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented.
