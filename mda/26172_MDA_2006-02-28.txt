We sell our products to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and other customers worldwide. We have long-standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve, including DaimlerChrysler AG (DaimlerChrysler), Volvo AB, PACCAR Inc., International Truck and Engine Corporation (Navistar International Corporation), CNH Global N.V., Komatsu and Scania AB. We serve our customers through a network of more than 550 company-owned and independent distributor locations and approximately 5,000 dealer locations in more than 160 countries and territories. Our reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Power Generation, Components, and Distribution. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves. This type of reporting structure allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various industrial markets. The engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and RVs, as well as various industrial applications including construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail, and military. The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems selling engines, generator sets and alternators and providing rental of power equipment for both standby and prime power uses. The Components segment includes sales of filtration products, exhaust systems, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in selling engines, generator sets, and service parts, performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMs throughout the world. Our financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve, particularly the on-highway, construction and general industrial markets. Demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rate levels and the price of crude oil (fuel costs). OEM inventory levels, production schedules and work stoppages also impact our sales. Economic downturns in the markets we serve generally result in reduced sales, which affect our profits and cash flow. 27 We continued our strong performance in 2005 with record net sales and net earnings. Net earnings were $550 million, or $11.01 per diluted share, on sales of $9.9 billion, compared to 2004 net earnings of $350 million, or $7.39 per diluted share, on sales of $8.4 billion. The earnings improvement was driven by an 18 percent increase in net sales and a 30 percent increase in gross margin, as our segments continue to benefit from high levels of demand, pricing actions and our focus on cost improvements. All of our segments reported increased sales in 2005 with particularly strong demand in the North American heavy-duty truck market where engine sales increased 26 percent and total on-highway related sales accounted for 47 percent of the increase in sales as our market share continues to strengthen compared to a year ago. Our joint ventures and equity method investees contributed $131 million to our earnings in 2005 compared to $120 million in 2004, primarily due to an increase in equity earnings of $8 million from our North American distributors and an increase in equity earnings of $7 million from CCEC, offset by a decrease in equity earnings of $7 million from DCEC. Overall, 2005 was an exceptionally strong financial year for Cummins and we believe the programs we have in place position us for another year of growth in sales and profitability in 2006. Years ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Millions Consolidated Results Net sales $ 9,918 $ 8,438 $ 6,296 Gross margin 2,186 1,680 1,123 Investee equity, royalty and other income 131 120 74 Operating earnings 894 539 163 Net earnings 550 350 50 Diluted earnings per share $ 11.01 $ 7.39 $ 1.27 During 2005, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet, improve our cost structure and diversify our geographic markets. Some of the transactions and events that highlight this are as follows: In February 2005, we signed a feasibility study agreement with Shaanxi Automobile Group Company Ltd. on the formation of a joint venture to produce Cummins ISM 11-liter heavy-duty engine in China. In September 2005, we signed an agreement to form a 50/50 joint venture company, Xi an Cummins Engine Company, to produce the Cummins ISM engine in Xi an, the capital city of western China Shaanxi Province. Under the terms of the agreement, the partners will invest $24 million in the joint venture. Construction of the manufacturing facility began in the fourth quarter of 2005 with production expected to start in the fourth quarter of 2006. In March 2005, we repaid our $225 million 6.45% notes on their maturity date from available cash. The notes were issued in 1998. The payment had the impact of reducing our debt-to-capital ratio by 3.7 percentage points, and a reduction in our annual interest expense of approximately $7 million, net of a pre-tax gain related to the early termination of an interest rate swap agreement. In May 2005, we undertook a strategic reorganization designed to further promote execution and growth among Cummins operating segments. As a result of the reorganization, certain changes were required in the presentation of our segment information. Specifically, the fuel systems business was moved from the Engine segment to the Filtration and Other segment, which was renamed the Components segment. Results of our North American distribution business, previously reported in the Engine segment and the Power Generation segment, were combined with the International Distributor segment and renamed the Distribution segment. Prior period segment results were restated to conform to the new reorganization beginning with the second quarter. 28 In September 2005, we announced our intention to repay our $250 million 9.5% notes in December 2006, the first call date for the debt. The notes were issued in November 2002 and are expected to be repaid using cash generated from operations. In addition, we also announced our intention to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock. As of December 31, 2005, we had repurchased $38 million of our common stock under this program. During 2005, we made contributions of approximately $151 million to our pension plans. During 2005, we reduced our annual tax expense by $16 million of tax benefits on dividend distributions from foreign operations which qualify for a special one-year 85-percent deduction under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Jobs Act.) RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2005 vs. 2004 Years ended December 31, Change 2005 2004 Amount Percent Millions Net sales $ 9,918 $ 8,438 $ 1,480 18 % Cost of sales 7,732 6,758 974 14 % Gross margin 2,186 1,680 506 30 % Operating expenses and income Selling and administrative expenses 1,145 1,015 130 13 % Research and engineering expenses 278 241 37 15 % Investee equity, royalty and other income (131 ) (120 ) (11 ) 9 % Other operating expenses 5 (5 ) 100 % Operating earnings 894 539 355 66 % Interest income (24 ) (12 ) (12 ) 100 % Interest expense 109 111 (2 ) 2 % Other expenses 11 8 3 38 % Earnings before income taxes and minority interests 798 432 366 85 % Provision for income taxes 216 56 160 NM Minority interests in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries 32 26 6 23 % Net earnings $ 550 $ 350 $ 200 57 % Net Sales Net sales increased in all segments with the primary driver being a $1,233 million, or 23 percent, increase in Engine sales due to strong demand from heavy- and medium-duty truck OEMs, higher engine volumes for industrial and stationary power applications and increased shipments of light-duty engines. Engine and part sales to on-highway markets were 20 percent higher compared to last year with increased volumes in all market segments. Power Generation sales increased $157 million, or 9 percent, due to increased demand for commercial generator sets, generator drives, and alternators, partially offset by a moderate decrease in rental revenue and a slight decrease in sales to the consumer market. Components sales increased $217 million, or 12 percent, primarily reflecting increased demand from first-fit OEMs and the aftermarket channel. Distribution sales increased $218 million, or 22 percent, primarily due to increased demand for engines and power generation products internationally and sales growth from distributor acquisitions. See our Operating Segment Results and Outlook section for further details on sales by segment. 29 Gross Margin Gross margin improved primarily due to increased sales, the related absorption benefits on fixed manufacturing costs, and changes in sales mix, all of which increased gross margin by $453 million. In addition, pricing actions of $145 million in the current year enabled us to more than offset the increased material costs of steel and other commodities of $130 million. Other factors which impacted gross margin to a lesser extent were slightly increased warranty costs, the favorable impact of currency exchange rates and other miscellaneous cost reductions. As a result of the foregoing, gross margin percentage increased to 22.0 percent in 2005 from 19.9 percent in 2004. Warranty expense as a percent of sales decreased slightly to 2.7 percent in 2005 compared to 3.1 percent in 2004. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher compensation and related expenses of approximately $72 million, which included salaries, variable compensation and fringe benefits, as a result of improved financial performance of the company. In addition, incremental staffing added to the increased compensation and related expenses. Shipping and handling costs increased by approximately $11 million due to increased sales volumes. Other factors increasing selling and administrative to a lesser extent included marketing and administrative expenses, consulting fees and other outside services, which combined accounted for $23 million of the increase. Overall selling and administrative expenses were 11.5 percent of sales in 2005 compared to 12.0 percent of sales in 2004. Research and Engineering Expenses Research and engineering expenses increased primarily due to increased compensation expense and consulting and outside services, as well as higher spending on prototype development programs for future products. The Engine segment accounted for $38 million of the increase in research and engineering expenses along with a slight increase in the Components segment, offset by a slight decrease in the Power Generation segment. Other miscellaneous research and development expenses increased as well, however they were not significant individually or in the aggregate. Investee Equity, Royalty and Other Income Investee equity, royalty and other income increased primarily due to improved earnings from our North American distributors of $8 million and improved earnings from CCEC of $7 million. These increases were partially offset by decreased earnings from DCEC of $7 million due to reduced demand in China truck market in response to regulatory changes. Other Operating Expense The major components of other operating expenses are royalty income, amortization of intangible assets and loss on sale of fixed assets. The fluctuation from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to a decrease in the loss on sale of fixed assets. Interest Income Interest income increased primarily due to higher average cash balances in 2005 compared to 2004. The increased cash balances are due to increased earnings and stronger cash flows from operations in 2005. 30 Interest Expense Interest expense decreased slightly due to a combination of factors. Interest expense on debt in the current year was lower due to the repayment of long-term debt in the first quarter. The lower interest expense on debt was partially offset by increased interest expense on capital leases related to power generation equipment due to the conversion of operating leases to capital leases in late 2004. Other Expense The major components of other expense include foreign currency exchange gains and losses, bank charges and other miscellaneous expenses. The increase in other expense in 2005 compared to 2004 is primarily due to an increase in foreign currency exchange losses and a decrease in the gain on sale of marketable securities. These increases to other expense were partially offset by write-downs of investments in 2004 that did not recur in 2005. Provision for Income Taxes The higher 2005 tax provision reflects the increase in earnings before taxes. Our effective tax rate is normally below the U.S. corporate income tax rate of 35 percent, primarily because of research tax credits and reduced taxes on export earnings. Our 2005 effective tax rate of 27 percent is below the statutory rate because of the following nonrecurring benefits: The Jobs Act included a special one-year 85-percent dividend deduction for qualifying dividends repatriated from foreign operations in 2005. We used these one-time rules to reduce our 2005 income tax provision by $16 million. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we had a favorable resolution of prior year tax positions which had been in dispute resulting in an $8 million reduction of our 2005 tax provision. Excluding the unusual or nonrecurring benefits described above, our 2005 effective tax rate was 30 percent. This rate was lower than the 35 percent U.S. tax rate, primarily because of U.S. export tax benefits and research tax credits along with lower taxes on foreign earnings, especially foreign joint venture equity earnings recorded net of foreign taxes. We expect our 2006 effective tax rate to increase, but remain well below 35 percent. The Jobs Act phases out the export tax benefits (reduced 20 percent for 2005, 40 percent for 2006 and repealed thereafter) that have been a key factor in our low tax rate. Export benefits are replaced with a new U.S. manufacturer tax deduction which phases in beginning in 2005. However, we do not expect the manufacturer deduction to produce a comparable level of benefits. Minority Interests in Earnings of Consolidated Subsidiaries The increase in minority interests was primarily attributable to higher earnings at Cummins Eastern Canada LLP, a 51 percent owned-subsidiary and Cummins India Limited, a 51 percent owned-subsidiary. These two subsidiaries account for over seventy percent of the total minority interest in 2005. The remainder of the increase in minority interests was attributable to a combination of immaterial increases and decreases in earnings at the remaining consolidated subsidiaries. 31 2004 vs. 2003 Years ended December 31, Change 2004 2003 Amount Percent Millions Net sales $ 8,438 $ 6,296 $ 2,142 34 % Cost of sales 6,758 5,173 1,585 31 % Gross margin 1,680 1,123 557 50 % Operating expenses and income Selling and administrative expenses 1,015 830 185 22 % Research and engineering expenses 241 200 41 21 % Investee equity, royalty and other income (120 ) (74 ) (46 ) 62 % Other operating expenses 5 4 1 25 % Operating earnings 539 163 376 NM Interest income (12 ) (13 ) 1 8 % Interest expense 111 90 21 23 % Other expenses (income) 8 (5 ) 13 NM Earnings before income taxes, minority interests, dividends on preferred securities of subsidiary trust, and cumulative effect of change in accounting principles 432 91 341 NM Provision for income taxes 56 12 44 NM Minority interests in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries 26 14 12 86 % Dividends on preferred securities of subsidiary trust 11 (11 ) 100 % Earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting principles 350 54 296 NM Cumulative effect of change in accounting principles, net of tax (4 ) 4 100 % Net earnings $ 350 $ 50 $ 300 NM Net Sales All segments experienced strong increases in sales with the primary driver being a $1,842 million, or 51 percent increase, in Engine sales due to strong demand from heavy- and medium-duty truck OEMs, increased shipments of light-duty engines, and higher engine shipments to industrial OEMs. Engine and parts sales to on-highway markets were 41 percent higher than 2003 with increased shipments in all market segments, except bus applications. Power Generation sales increased $513 million, or 39 percent, due to increased demand for generator sets and alternators in international markets, as well as continued robust demand for RV and other consumer power generation products. Components sales increased $491 million, or 38 percent, primarily because of increased demand from North American OEMs, and Distribution sales increased $304 million, or 45 percent, primarily because of strong demand for power generation products. See our Operating Segment Results and Outlook section for further details on sales by segment. Gross Margin Gross margin increased primarily due to increased sales volume of $525 million and the related absorption benefits on fixed manufacturing costs of $125 million. These increases to gross margin were partially offset by increased warranty expenses of $69 million and higher material costs for steel and copper of $53 million. Other factors impacting gross margin to a lesser extent included favorable foreign currency translation and a one-time charge for inventory valuation. As a result of the foregoing, our gross margin percentage increased to 19.9 percent in 2004 from 17.8 percent in 2003. 32 Warranty expense as a percent of sales was relatively flat at 3.1 percent in 2004 compared to 3.0 percent in 2003. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher compensation and related expenses of $111 million due to improved financial performance and increased marketing program expenses of $18 million. Other factors contributing to the increased selling and administrative expenses to a lesser extent were the unfavorable impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates and increased consulting expenses, primarily Sarbanes-Oxley implementation costs. In addition, approximately $34 million of the increase in selling and administrative expenses resulted from consolidating entities under FIN 46R. Overall, selling and administrative expenses were 12.0 percent of sales in 2004 as compared to 13.2 percent of sales in 2003. Research and Engineering Expenses Research and engineering expenses increased primarily because of higher spending on 2005 and 2007 product development programs as well as increased compensation expense due to incremental staffing and increased variable compensation. Approximately $4 million of the increase in research and engineering expenses resulted from consolidating variable interest entities (VIEs) in 2004. There were increases in other general research and developmental expenses, none of which were significant. Investee Equity, Royalty and Other Income Investee equity, royalty and other income increased significantly, primarily due to improved earnings from our expanded joint venture in China, DCEC, where our earnings increased $19 million, and our North American distributor joint ventures, where earnings increased $9 million. We also saw increases to a lesser extent at our joint venture in India, Tata Cummins Ltd, and Cummins MerCruiser, our global marine joint venture. Other Operating Expense The major components of other operating expense are royalty income, amortization of intangible assets and loss on sale of fixed assets. The slight increase from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to a combination of an increase in loss on sale of fixed assets and an increase in amortization of intangibles offset by an increase in royalty income as a result of increased sales volumes. Interest Expense Interest expense increased primarily due to the consolidation of VIEs in 2004 and the adoption of SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity (SFAS 150), which required prospective classification of dividends on our preferred securities as interest expense, and interest from capital leases for power generation equipment. 33 Other Expense (Income) The major components of other expense (income) include impairment losses, foreign currency exchange gains and losses, bank charges, and other miscellaneous expenses. Other expense (income) fluctuated primarily due to an investment write-down in 2004. Provision for Income Taxes The higher 2004 tax provision reflects the increase in profit before taxes. Our effective tax rate is normally below the U.S. corporate income tax rate of 35 percent, primarily because of research tax credits and reduced taxes on export earnings. Our 2004 effective tax rate of 13 percent is also low not only because of the normal favorable effects of research credits and export tax benefits, but also because of the following nonrecurring benefits: As a result of continued earnings improvement and improved economic outlook, we reassessed the treatment of 2002 and 2003 foreign tax credits previously recognized as tax deductions and determined they could be used as full tax credits. The more favorable treatment of these credits reduced our 2004 income tax provision by $25 million. As a result of improved cash flow during 2004, we filed amended U.S. income tax returns to claim additional export tax benefits related to prior years which we had previously forgone to avoid the associated tax payments required on the non-exempt export income of our foreign sales corporation. These additional export tax benefits related to prior years reduced our 2004 income tax provision by $11 million. The 2004 earnings improvement also caused us to reassess our ability to realize state tax benefits from net operating losses generated in prior years. Previously, we had provided a valuation allowance to reduce the recorded tax value of these loss carryforwards to a lower estimated realizable value. Our reassessment determined that $16 million of this allowance was no longer needed and was recorded as a reduction of our 2004 income tax expense. In conjunction with our reassessment of the realizable value of state tax benefits, we also recognized a change in the estimated average state income tax rate used to value our deferred tax assets. This rate change reduced our 2004 income tax expense by $9 million. Excluding the unusual or nonrecurring benefits described above, our 2004 effective tax rate was 27 percent. This rate was lower than the 35 percent U.S. tax rate, primarily because of export tax benefits and research tax credits generated by 2004 operations. Minority Interests in Earnings of Consolidated Subsidiaries Approximately one-half of the increase in minority interests in 2004 compared to 2003 resulted from higher earnings at Wuxi Holset Ltd , a 55 percent owned subsidiary, and Cummins India Limited. The remainder of the increase in minority interests is attributable to consolidating VIEs in 2004. Dividends on Preferred Securities Effective July 1, 2003, these dividends were prospectively classified as interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings in accordance with SFAS 150. A description of our obligation relating to these preferred securities is provided in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principles In 2001, we entered into a sale-leaseback agreement whereby we sold and leased back heavy-duty engine manufacturing equipment from a grantor trust wholly-owned by a financial institution. In 34 December 2003, the grantor trust, which acts as a lessor in the sale-leaseback transaction, was consolidated when we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, (FIN 46R), issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Under FIN 46R, the lessor trust was deemed a VIE and we were deemed the primary beneficiary of the trust by virtue of our guaranteeing the leased equipment residual value. Accordingly, we recorded the cumulative effect of consolidating the VIE in our Consolidated Financial Statements as a change in accounting principle as of December 31, 2003. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the change in accounting and Note 18 for a description of the original leasing transaction. The consolidation of the VIE did not impact our 2003 Consolidated Statements of Earnings, other than the cumulative effect at December 31, 2003, nor did it affect compliance with any of our debt covenants. OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS AND OUTLOOK Our reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Power Generation, Components, and Distribution. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves. This type of reporting structure allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various industrial markets. The engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and RVs, as well as various industrial applications including construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military. The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems selling engines, generator sets and alternators and providing rental of power equipment for both standby and prime power uses. The Components segment includes sales of filtration products, exhaust systems, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in selling engines, generator sets, and service parts, performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMs. We use segment EBIT (defined as earnings (loss) before interest, taxes, minority interests, preferred dividends and cumulative effect of change in accounting principles) as a primary basis for the chief operating decision-maker to evaluate the performance of each of our operating segments. Segment amounts exclude certain expenses not specifically identifiable to segments. The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those applied in the Consolidated Financial Statements . We prepared the financial results of our operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We have allocated certain common costs and expenses, primarily corporate functions, among segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These include certain costs and expenses of shared services, such as information technology, human resources, legal and finance. We also do not allocate debt-related items, minimum pension liabilities or income taxes to individual segments. Segment EBIT may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. 35 A summary of operating results by segment for the years ended December 31, is shown below: Engine Power Generation Components Distribution Eliminations Total Millions 2005 Net sales $ 6,657 $ 1,999 $ 2,000 $ 1,191 $ (1,929 ) $ 9,918 Investee equity, royalty and other income 80 9 8 34 131 Segment EBIT 582 145 89 107 (16 ) 907 2004 Net sales $ 5,424 $ 1,842 $ 1,783 $ 973 $ (1,584 ) $ 8,438 Investee equity, royalty and other income 80 6 9 25 120 Segment EBIT 328 60 84 79 (8 ) 543 2003 Net sales $ 3,582 $ 1,329 $ 1,292 $ 669 $ (576 ) $ 6,296 Investee equity, royalty and other income 48 3 7 16 74 Segment EBIT 62 (19 ) 86 51 1 181 The tables below reconcile the segment information to the corresponding amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements: Years ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Millions Segment EBIT $ 907 $ 543 $ 181 Less: Interest expense 109 111 90 Earnings before income taxes, minority interests, dividends on preferred securities of subsidiary trust and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle $ 798 $ 432 $ 91 We made certain leadership changes effective May 2, 2005, within our management team. In connection with these changes, certain modifications were made to our internal reporting. These modifications are summarized below: The Filtration and Other segment was renamed the Components segment and now includes operating results of the fuel systems business which were previously included in the Engine segment. Historically, the fuel systems business transferred product within the Engine segment at cost. Beginning in the third quarter, those transfers now use a cost-plus based transfer price. As a result of this change, segment EBIT increased for the Components segment and decreased for the Engine segment but there was no impact to consolidated earnings. Revenues of the Components segment were also increased to reflect transfers to the Engine segment and eliminations were increased by a corresponding amount. The North American distribution business was combined with the International Distribution segment and renamed the Distribution segment. Previously, the North American distribution business was reported in the Engine and Power Generation segments as equity from investees and included the results of a partially-owned distributor that is consolidated. As a result, revenues of the 36 Engine segment were increased to reflect sales to the consolidated distributor that were previously eliminated and decreased for the revenues of the consolidated distributor which are now included in the Distribution segment. In addition, this change also caused earnings from equity investees in the Engine and Power Generation segments to decrease while earnings from equity investees in the Distribution segment increased by a corresponding amount. Due to the extent of intersegment sales activity and certain seasonality in inventory levels during the year, we have presented the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory resulting from intersegment transactions in the eliminations column of our segment reporting (see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) . This presentation better aligns segment revenues with segment costs and presents segment EBIT as if each segment was an independent, stand-alone entity. The impact of the above changes on operating results and net assets by segment for each year is shown in the table below: Engine Power Generation Components Distribution Eliminations Millions Increase (decrease) 2004 Net sales $ (76 ) $ (35 ) $ 299 $ 117 $ (305 ) Investee equity, royalty and other income (16 ) (7 ) 23 Segment EBIT (11 ) (9 ) 28 (8 ) Net assets (193 ) (3 ) 108 88 2003 Net sales $ (49 ) $ $ 236 $ $ (187 ) Investee equity, royalty and other income (9 ) (4 ) 13 Segment EBIT (8 ) (4 ) 11 1 Net assets (155 ) (2 ) 132 25 Prior to January 1, 2004, intersegment transfers between the Engine segment and the Power Generation segment and between the Components segment and the Engine segment were recorded at cost and a sale was not recorded by the transferor segment. Effective January 1, 2004, all intersegment sales of the transferor segments were recorded at a market-based transfer price discounted for certain items. Unit shipments are now also reflected in the sales volumes of the transferor segments. Certain intersegment cost allocations to the transferor segments have also been eliminated. In addition, certain engines manufactured by the Engine segment and sold to Distribution through Power Generation were previously recorded as a sale by Power Generation; however, under the new methodology Power Generation now records a sale commission on such sales. We believe this change allows our segment management to focus on those pricing decisions and cost structuring actions within their control. The impact of this change on 2004 segment results follows: Engine net sales increased $502 million, Components net sales increased $205 million, Power Generation net sales decreased $44 million, and Intersegment net sales eliminations increased $663 million. The net impact of this change did not have a material effect on segment EBIT for any of our segments. Segment results for 2003 were not restated to reflect the change to market-based transfer pricing as it was impracticable to do so. 37 Engine Results and Outlook 2005 vs. 2004 The net sales, investee income and segment EBIT for Engine were as follows (dollars in millions): Years ended December 31, Change 2005 2004 Amount Percent Net sales $ 6,657 $ 5,424 $ 1,233 23 % Investee equity, royalty and other income 80 80 Segment EBIT 582 328 254 77 % Segment EBIT as a percentage of net sales 8.7 % 6.0 % 2.7 percentage points The increase in net sales for this segment was primarily due to strong demand across all market sectors, particularly the light-duty automotive market with record engine sales to DaimlerChrysler, and the North American heavy-duty and medium-duty truck markets. Total on-highway-related engine sales were 63 percent of Engine segment net sales in 2005, compared with 65 percent in 2004. The improvement in segment EBIT was primarily due to the higher engine volumes across all major markets, the accompanying gross margin benefits of higher absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, pricing and favorable foreign exchange impacts, all of which resulted in a two point improvement in gross margin percentage over 2004. Gross margin increased $344 million, or 38 percent, over 2004. Selling and administrative expenses increased $63 million, or 13 percent, over 2004, however selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales improved almost a full percentage point. Research and engineering expenses increased $38 million, or 24 percent, compared to 2004 and remained flat as a percentage of net sales compared to the prior period. In addition, earnings from joint ventures remained flat compared with 2004, due to higher earnings from several joint ventures, which were offset by a $7 million decrease in earnings at DCEC in reaction to changes in the regulatory environment. A summary and discussion of Engine net sales by market follows (dollars in millions): Years ended December 31, Change 2005 2004 Amount Percent Heavy-duty truck $ 2,139 $ 1,700 $ 439 26 % Medium-duty truck and bus 918 693 225 32 % Light-duty automotive 1,164 1,129 35 3 % Total on-highway 4,221 3,522 699 20 % Industrial 1,791 1,380 411 30 % Stationary power 645 522 123 24 % Total net sales $ 6,657 $ 5,424 $ 1,233 23 % A summary of unit shipments by engine classification (including unit shipments to Power Generation) follows: Years ended December 31, Change 2005 2004 Amount Percent Midrange 419,200 368,700 50,500 14 % Heavy-duty 107,600 87,200 20,400 23 % High-horsepower 14,400 12,100 2,300 19 % Total unit shipments 541,200 468,000 73,200 16 % 38 Heavy-Duty Truck The increase in sales to the heavy-duty truck market was primarily driven by the recovery in the North American truck market as OEMs increased build rates to meet the growing demand from truck fleets replacing aging equipment and adding capacity. Unit shipments of heavy-duty truck engines were up 27 percent in 2005, compared to 2004, with North American shipments up 26 percent and international shipments up 33 percent. Medium-Duty Truck and Bus The increase in medium-duty truck and bus revenues is due to increased shipments of medium-duty truck and bus engines in North America and internationally. Shipments of medium-duty truck engines were up 24 percent to North American OEMs and up 12 percent to international OEMs compared with 2004. The increase in medium-duty truck engine shipments was driven primarily by economic growth as demand in this market typically correlates with demand in the heavy-duty market. Sales of bus engines and parts increased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to strong demand from North American OEMs with shipments up 53 percent and international shipments up 48 percent. International shipments were up due to strong demand in Asia and Latin America, slightly offset by lower volumes in Europe. Light-Duty Automotive Sales of light-duty automotive engines increased as a result of higher volumes. Total unit shipments were 187,000 in 2005, an increase of 4 percent compared to 2004. Most of the increase in light-duty automotive sales was driven by continued demand from DaimlerChrysler with record shipments of 160,000 units, or a 4 percent increase compared to 2004. Engine shipments to RV OEMs remained flat in 2005 compared with 2004. Industrial Total sales were up in most industrial markets, primarily due to strong demand as the capital goods sector of the economy expands. Unit shipments increased 24 percent year-over-year reflecting a slight change in sales mix to higher-priced engines. Approximately 56 percent of the shipments were to North American markets and 44 percent to international markets compared to 52 percent and 48 percent, respectively, in 2004. Both the construction and agricultural markets had increased sales of approximately 28 percent in 2005 over 2004, while sales for the mining and marine markets increased 34 percent and 43 percent, respectively, during the same time period. These markets make up over 90 percent of the total industrial market. The increased sales in these markets were seen both in North American and international markets with the exception of a slight decrease in sales to the international agriculture market. Stationary Power The increase in sales to stationary power markets is due to the increased net sales to our Power Generation segment. These net sales are eliminated in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings . See the Power Generation Results and Outlook for a discussion of the increase in net sales. 2004 vs. 2003 The net sales, investee income and segment EBIT for Engine were as follows (dollars in millions): Years ended December 31, Change 2004 2003 Amount Percent Net sales $ 5,424 $ 3,582 $ 1,842 51 % Investee equity, royalty and other income 80 48 32 67 % Segment EBIT 328 62 266 NM Segment EBIT as a percentage of net sales 6.0 % 1.7 % 4.3 percentage points 39 The increase in net sales for this segment was primarily due to the economic recovery evidenced by strong demand across all market sectors, particularly the North American heavy-duty and medium-duty truck markets and the light-duty automotive market with record engine sales to DaimlerChrysler. Total on-highway-related engine sales were 65 percent of Engine segment net sales in 2004 compared to 70 percent in 2003. The improvement in segment EBIT was primarily a result of improved gross margin resulting from higher engine volumes and service part sales and the accompanying benefits of fixed cost absorption at our manufacturing plants along with the consolidation of heavy-duty test and assembly operations. Gross margin improved $361 million, or 66 percent, over 2003. Gross margin percentage improved almost 1.5 percentage points over the prior period. Selling and administrative expense and warranty expense also increased due to the increase in sales volume and were the primary offsets to the improved gross margins. Selling and administrative expenses increased $75 million, or 19 percent, over 2003, however selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales improved almost 2.5 percentage points. Research and engineering expenses increased $30 million, or 23 percent, compared to 2003 but improved almost a full percentage point as a percentage of net sales compared to the prior period. Another item affecting segment EBIT in 2004 versus 2003 to a lesser extent was steel surcharges from higher steel prices. In addition, earnings from joint ventures increased $32 million compared to 2003, primarily from higher volumes which resulted in a $19 million improvement in earnings from DCEC. A summary and discussion of Engine net sales by market follows (dollars in millions): Years ended December 31, Change 2004 2003 Amount Percent Heavy-duty truck $ 1,700 $ 1,098 $ 602 55 % Medium-duty truck and bus 693 468 225 48 % Light-duty automotive 1,129 929 200 22 % Total on-highway 3,522 2,495 1,027 41 % Industrial 1,380 1,087 293 27 % Stationary power 522 n/a 522 NM Total net sales $ 5,424 $ 3,582 $ 1,842 51 % A summary of unit shipments by engine classification (including unit shipments to Power Generation) follows: Years ended December 31, Change 2004 2003 Amount Percent Midrange 368,700 280,800 87,900 31 % Heavy-duty 87,200 52,600 34,600 66 % High-horsepower 12,100 8,900 3,200 36 % Total unit shipments 468,000 342,300 125,700 37 % Heavy-Duty Truck The increase in sales to the heavy-duty truck market resulted from strong demand in the North American truck industry driven primarily by economic growth and the related increase in freight tonnage and higher replacement demand for trucks. Unit shipments of heavy-duty truck engines were up 70 percent in 2004, compared to 2003, with North American shipments up 97 percent and international shipments up 26 percent. 40 Medium-Duty Truck and Bus The increase in medium-duty truck and bus revenues is due to increased shipments of medium-duty truck engines in North America and internationally. Shipments of medium-duty truck engines were up 93 percent to North American OEMs and up 36 percent to international OEMs compared to 2003. The increase in medium-duty truck engine shipments was driven primarily by economic growth as demand in this market typically correlates with demand in the heavy-duty market. Worldwide shipments of bus engines were down 10 percent in 2004 compared to 2003. Most of the decline occurred in international markets with some demand recovery in China where volumes were up compared to 2003. However, lower sales to India and Europe/CIS more than offset the increase. Light-Duty Automotive Sales of light-duty automotive engines increased as a result of higher volumes. Total unit shipments were 180,000 in 2004, an increase of 20 percent compared to 2003. Most of the increase in light-duty automotive sales was driven by strong demand from DaimlerChrysler with shipments of 154,300 units, or a 20 percent increase compared to 2003. Engine shipments to RV OEMs decreased slightly, down 3 percent in 2004, compared to 2003, partially as a result of higher shipments in 2003 in advance of new product introductions and slightly lower market share in 2004. Industrial Total sales were up in all industrial markets, except for the government market which remained relatively flat. As is the case for the other engine markets, the increase in sales is primarily a function of volume. Unit shipments increased 26 percent year-over-year reflecting a slight change in sales mix to lower-priced engines. Approximately 52 percent of the shipments were to North American markets and 48 percent to international markets compared to 39 percent and 61 percent, respectively, in 2003. The shift between international and North American markets is due to the consolidation of entities in the North American market as a result of the adoption of FIN 46R in 2004. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Overall growth in industrial markets was driven by strong demand in 2004 as the capital goods sector of the economy experienced a significant recovery. Stationary Power Engine net sales to stationary power markets were $522 million in 2004. This new sales category arose from a change in 2004 where all intersegment engine sales from Engine to Power Generation are recorded at a market-based transfer price. Prior to 2004, intersegment transfers were recorded at cost and a sale was not recorded by Engine. Segment financial results for 2003 were not restated to reflect this change as it was impracticable to do so. 41 Outlook for 2006 As in 2004, this segment experienced much stronger than expected volumes in virtually all of its markets in 2005. Most indicators point toward continued improvement, however at a more moderate pace in most markets in 2006. We currently expect the North American heavy-duty truck market to remain flat in 2006 at approximately 315,000 units. While 2005 demand was driven partially from fleets adding capacity as freight volume increased, the majority of the increase resulted, similar to 2004, from the replacement of aging vehicles and improved industry financial health. In 2006, the market size increase will be primarily driven by increased freight tonnage and truck replacement. We project our sales to the North American heavy-duty truck market to increase due to some potential increase in our market share. We also expect sales of our midrange engines to the medium-duty markets to increase in 2006, as economic indicators for this market historically correlate with those of the heavy-duty market. Currently, we estimate our engine volumes for the medium-duty truck market to increase 10 percent in 2006, including an increase in market share. Sales of our 5.9 liter turbo diesel engine to DaimlerChrysler reached record levels in 2005 and we anticipate 2006 volumes will increase with a full year of availability of our engine in DaimlerChrysler products as demand for diesel-powered light vehicles increases. Our industrial markets expect continued growth in 2006, particularly overall demand for high-horsepower applications in the mining, marine, and oil and gas markets. We believe the favorable economic environment this segment has benefited from the past two years will continue in 2006. As a result of the growth anticipated in most markets, we anticipate this segment will incur an increase in sales, though not as strong as 2005 experienced, and we expect profitability to improve over 2005 as well. Power Generation Results and Outlook 2005 vs. 2004 The net sales, investee income and segment EBIT for Power Generation were as follows (dollars in millions): Years ended December 31, Change 2005 2004 Amount Percent Net sales $ 1,999 $ 1,842 $ 157 9 % Investee equity, royalty and other income 9 6 3 50 % Segment EBIT 145 60 85 NM Segment EBIT as a percentage of net sales 7.3 % 3.3 % 4.0 percentage points The increase in net sales in this segment was primarily due to increased volumes as a result of strong demand in the commercial generator set (gen-set) markets and alternator markets. Pricing actions also contributed to the increase in net sales. The improvement in segment EBIT was largely attributable to strong commercial generator set sales across all geographic markets, except China, and the related benefits of fixed cost absorption as well as price realization and cost reduction actions. These benefits were partially offset by increased costs of materials, primarily copper. Gross margin improved $67 million, or 25 percent, over 2004. Gross margin percentage improved over two percentage points compared to the prior period. Selling and administrative expenses decreased $3 million, or 2 percent, over 2004 and selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales improved one percentage point compared to the prior period. Research and engineering expenses decreased $8 million, or 28 percent, compared to 2004 and research and engineering expenses as a percentage of net sales improved by 0.5 of a percentage point compared to the prior period. 42 A summary of engine shipments used in power generation equipment by engine category follows: Years ended December 31, Change 2005 2004 Amount Percent Midrange 21,300 16,800 4,500 27 % Heavy-duty 7,200 6,700 500 7 % High-horsepower 8,300 7,400 900 12 % Total unit shipments 36,800 30,900 5,900 19 % 2004 vs. 2003 The net sales, investee income and segment EBIT for Power Generation were as follows (dollars in millions): Years ended December 31, Change 2004 2003 Amount Percent Net sales $ 1,842 $ 1,329 $ 513 39 % Investee equity, royalty and other income 6 3 3 100 % Segment EBIT 60 (19 ) 79 NM Segment EBIT as a percentage of net sales 3.3 % (1.4 %) 4.7 percentage points The increase in net sales in this segment was primarily due to the improved economic conditions in the commercial, consumer and alternator product markets. Unit shipments of commercial generator drives (g-drives) and generator sets (gen-sets), alternators, and gen-sets for the consumer and mobile/RV markets increased significantly in 2004 because of strong demand. Additionally, approximately $90 million of the net sales increase resulted from the consolidation of new entities including those consolidated under FIN 46R. The improvement in segment EBIT was largely attributable to strong commercial sales across all geographic markets and the related benefits of fixed cost absorption of $81 million as well as cost reduction actions of $29 million and price realization of $16 million. These benefits were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, increased costs of steel and copper and higher selling, administrative and research and engineering expenses. Gross margin improved a robust $109 million, or 67 percent, over 2003. Gross margin percentage improved 2.5 percentage points over the prior period. Selling and administrative expenses increased $36 million, or 22 percent, over 2003, however selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales improved 1.5 percentage points compared to 2003. Research and engineering expenses decreased $4 million, or 12 percent, compared to 2003, but improved almost a full percentage point as a percentage of net sales compared to the prior period. A summary of engine shipments used in power generation equipment by engine category follows: Years ended December 31, Change 2004 2003 Amount Percent Midrange 16,800 14,000 2,800 20 % Heavy-duty 6,700 5,300 1,400 26 % High-horsepower 7,400 5,200 2,200 42 % Total unit shipments 30,900 24,500 6,400 26 % 43 Outlook for 2006 Power Generation experienced a dramatic recovery in financial performance in 2004 and 2005 due to a combination of an improved economic environment in key markets and actions implemented in mid-2003, including cost reductions and pricing initiatives. In 2006, we expect continued growth across most power generation markets. We anticipate strong growth in North America and the Middle East and forecast growth in market share through our new lower cost products, especially in Europe and Latin America. We believe the softer levels experienced in the China power generation market in the latter half of 2005 will continue in 2006. We expect continued growth for 2006 in the commercial international markets for power generation and alternators, except for China, and strong growth in domestic markets. In our consumer business, we expect the markets to be relatively flat, compared to 2005, however, we anticipate a more favorable sales mix from market share gains in marine and our recently launched portable generator set products. As a result of the growth anticipated in a broad range of markets and improved sales mix, Power Generation revenues and profitability are expected to exceed 2006. Components Results and Outlook 2005 vs. 2004 The net sales, investee income and segment EBIT for Components were as follows (dollars in millions): Years ended December 31, Change 2005 2004 Amount Percent Net sales $ 2,000 $ 1,783 $ 217 12 % Investee equity, royalty and other income 8 9 (1 ) (11 %) Segment EBIT 89 84 5 6 % Segment EBIT as a percentage of net sales 4.5 % 4.7 % (0.2) percentage points Components net sales increased across all geographic markets primarily due to strong demand in the U.S., Latin America, and Asia. Sales of our turbochargers increased due to higher aftermarket sales to OEMs, partially offset by lower demand in China. Segment EBIT improved slightly, compared with 2004, primarily due to improved volume, however EBIT as a percentage of net sales declined slightly due to a lower gross margin percentage resulting from higher steel prices used in exhaust products and manufacturing filters as well as production inefficiencies from capacity constraints. Gross margin increased $33 million, or 11 percent, over 2004, however gross margin percentage decreased slightly. In addition, higher selling and administrative expenses and increases in research and engineering expenses contributed to the reduction in segment EBIT as a percentage of net sales. Selling and administrative expenses increased $18 million, or 10 percent, over 2004, but remained relatively flat year-over-year as a percentage of net sales. Research and engineering expenses increased due to the development of a number of new products that will be launched in 2006 and beyond. Research and engineering expenses increased $6 million, or 12 percent, compared to 2004 and remained flat year-over-year as a percentage of net sales. 44 2004 vs. 2003 The net sales, investee income and segment EBIT for Components were as follows (dollars in millions): Years ended December 31, Change 2004 2003 Amount Percent Net sales $ 1,783 $ 1,292 $ 491 38 % Investee equity, royalty and other income 9 7 2 29 % Segment EBIT 84 86 (2 ) (2 )% Segment EBIT as a percentage of net sales 4.7 % 6.7 % (2.0) percentage points This segment achieved higher net sales in 2004 reflecting demand improvement from OEMs and increased market share. Net sales increased in most geographic markets including the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Australia, with small declines in Canada. Sales of our turbochargers increased primarily due to higher aftermarket sales to OEMs and strong demand from our joint ventures in China. Segment EBIT declined slightly, compared with 2003, primarily due to a lower gross margin percentage resulting from higher steel prices used in manufacturing filters and exhaust products which approximated $17 million, net of $7 million in price recovery, as well as production inefficiencies from capacity constraints of $21 million. Gross margin increased $36 million, or 14 percent, over 2003, however gross margin percentage declined over 3.5 percentage points in the same period. In addition, higher selling and administrative expenses and increases in research and engineering expenses contributed to a decline in segment EBIT. Selling and administrative expenses increased $30 million, or 20 percent, over 2003, but improved 1.5 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in 2004. Research and engineering expenses increased $14 million, or 39 percent, compared to 2003 and remained flat as a percentage of net sales year-over-year. Outlook for 2006 The Components segment experienced strong revenue growth in 2005 throughout its businesses and within most major geographic markets. We expect this trend to continue in 2006. Within our filtration business we anticipate revenue growth in the oil, mining and marine segments of our business and we also expect growth in our aftermarket business for on-highway applications resulting from the launch of a number of new products. We expect growth in demand for our products in both the emission solutions business and our turbocharger business as a result of the adoption of Euro IV emissions standards in Europe. We expect some revenue growth in the fuel systems business in 2006 as demand for new and replacement fuel systems for heavy-duty applications remains strong. Demand from our European partner, Scania, is expected to be higher in 2006 than 2005. While we have experienced revenue growth in this segment for the past three years, profitability has not trended in a similar pattern. Therefore, we will implement a number of strategic cost reduction initiatives, particularly in our exhaust business, and targeted improvements in operations across the segment in 2006. As a result, we anticipate an improvement in operating margin in 2006, primarily in the second half of the year as we start to see the benefits of cost reduction actions impact results. 45 Distribution Results and Outlook 2005 vs. 2004 The net sales, investee income and segment EBIT for Distribution were as follows (dollars in millions): Years ended December 31, Change 2005 2004 Amount Percent Net sales $ 1,191 $ 973 $ 218 22 % Investee equity, royalty and other income 34 25 9 36 % Segment EBIT 107 79 28 35 % Segment EBIT as a percentage of net sales 9.0 % 8.1 % 0.9 percentage points Distribution net sales increased primarily due to strong demand in Europe, Latin America, Australia, North America and the Middle East, where sales at our Dubai distributorship were up 65 percent year-over-year, partially offset by lower sales in East Asia. In addition, net sales were favorably impacted by foreign exchange rates. Segment EBIT increased primarily due to higher gross margins resulting from increased sales of engines, parts and service, and power generation equipment, as well as pricing actions and favorable exchange rates. Gross margin improved $69 million, or 33 percent, over 2004, while gross margin percentage increased almost two percentage points over the prior year. The increase in gross margin was partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses, primarily from acquisitions, new branch openings and dealer development support. Increased profitability from North American and international joint ventures were also significant contributors to segment EBIT growth. Selling and administrative expenses increased $52 million, or 32 percent, and increased just over one percentage point as a percentage of net sales in the same period. Also contributing to the increase in segment EBIT year-over-year was a $9 million increase in investee equity earnings. This is primarily attributable to an $8 million increase in earnings at our North American distributors. 2004 vs. 2003 The net sales, investee income and segment EBIT for Distribution were as follows (dollars in millions): Years ended December 31, Change 2004 2003 Amount Percent Net sales $ 973 $ 669 $ 304 45 % Investee equity, royalty and other income 25 16 9 56 % Segment EBIT 79 51 28 55 % Segment EBIT as a percentage of net sales 8.1 % 7.6 % 0.5 percentage points Distribution had higher net sales in 2004, primarily due to increased parts and service revenue at almost all distributor locations and significant increases at distributorships in Dubai, Australia, China and South Africa. Additionally, sales of engines and power generation equipment increased in distributorships located in Europe/CIS, Singapore, India, Hong Kong, Japan, and Dubai. Also impacting net sales were favorable foreign exchange rates. 46 Segment EBIT increased primarily due to higher gross margins resulting from increased sales of engines, parts and service, and power generation equipment. Gross margin increased $60 million, or 41 percent, compared to 2003, while gross margin percentage declined slightly under one percentage point for the same period. The increase in gross margin was partially offset by higher volume variable selling expenses. Selling and administrative expenses increased $45 million, or 38 percent, compared to 2003, however selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales improved just under one percentage point. Outlook for 2006 In 2006, we expect an 8 to 10 percent increase in net sales primarily due to increases in our Greater Europe, South Pacific, and India regions. We anticipate sales growth in power generation, parts, services, and engines throughout all regions. Along with the estimated sales increase, we expect increased profitability from our North American and international joint ventures. As a result of the anticipated increases in sales and joint venture income, we expect higher profitability in this segment as we capitalize on a growing global customer base. Geographic Markets Sales to international markets were 51 percent of total net sales in 2005, compared with 48 percent of total net sales in 2004 and 47 percent of total net sales in 2003. A summary of net sales (dollar amount and percentage of total) by geographic territory follows (dollars in millions): Years ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 United States $ 4,832 49 % $ 4,363 52 % $ 3,356 53 % Asia/Australia 1,682 17 % 1,474 17 % 1,112 18 % Europe/CIS 1,406 14 % 1,145 14 % 827 13 % Mexico/Latin America 819 8 % 567 7 % 475 7 % Canada 728 7 % 549 6 % 292 5 % Africa/Middle East 451 5 % 340 4 % 234 4 % Total international 5,086 51 % 4,075 48 % 2,940 47 % Total consolidated net sales $ 9,918 100 % $ 8,438 100 % $ 6,296 100 % 47 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview of Capital Structure Cash provided by operations is the primary source of funding our working capital requirements. At certain times, cash provided by operations is subject to seasonal fluctuations, and as a result, we may use periodic borrowings, primarily our revolving credit facility and our accounts receivable sales program, to fund our working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2005, there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility or our receivable sales program. Cash and cash equivalents increased $168 million during 2005 and were $779 million at the end of the year compared to $611 million at the beginning of the year. Cash and cash equivalents were higher in 2005 as a result of an increase in cash provided by operations generated primarily by higher net earnings. Over the past two years our operations have generated significant amounts of cash as seen in the reduction of net debt as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Millions Total debt $ 1,367 $ 1,626 $ 1,429 Less: cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities (840 ) (673 ) (195 ) Net debt $ 527 $ 953 $ 1,234 At December 31, 2005, we believe our liquidity with cash and cash equivalents of $779 million, marketable securities of $61 million, $539 million available under our revolving credit facility, $200 million available under our accounts receivable program and $97 million available under international credit facilities (see the table below under Available Credit Capacity) provides us with the financial flexibility needed to satisfy future short-term funding requirements for working capital, debt service obligations, capital expenditures, projected pension funding, dividend payments and expansion in emerging markets. The Jobs Act provides for a temporary 85-percent dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one-year period. The deduction results in an approximate 5.25% federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings. We repatriated $71 million under the Jobs Act in 2005. Foreign earnings repatriated under the Jobs Act increased liquidity in the United States, with a corresponding reduction of liquidity in our foreign subsidiaries. On March 1, 2005, we repaid our 6.45% notes with a principal amount of $225 million from cash and cash equivalents. Our total debt was $1,367 million as of December 31, 2005, compared with $1,626 million at December 31, 2004. Total debt as a percent of our total capital, including total long-term debt, was 42.3 percent at December 31, 2005, compared to 53.7 percent at December 31, 2004. Included in long-term debt at December 31, 2005 and 2004, was $71 million and $81 million, respectively, attributable to consolidating a leasing entity under the provisions of FIN 46R (see Notes 2 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements ). Also included in short-term and long-term debt at December 31, 2005, was $96 million from the consolidation of four joint ventures previously reported under the equity method of accounting and now consolidated under the provisions of FIN 46R (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements ). The consolidation of these entities did not materially impact our 2005 or 2004 net earnings nor did it affect compliance with any of our debt covenants. We do not expect the consolidation of these entities to have a material impact on net earnings or affect our compliance with debt covenants in future periods. 48 Available Credit Capacity The table below provides the components of available credit capacity as of December 31(in millions): 2005 Revolving credit facility $ 539 International credit facilities accessible by local entities 63 International credit facilities accessible by corporate treasury 34 Accounts receivable 200 Total available credit capacity $ 836 Working Capital Summary 2005 2004 Current assets $ 3,916 $ 3,256 Current liabilities 2,218 2,180 Working capital $ 1,698 $ 1,076 Current ratio 1.77 1.49 Days sales in receivables 51 49 Inventory turnover 6.9 7.3 Most of the deterioration in days sales in receivables between 2004 and 2005 resulted from a higher mix of international receivables which typically have longer collection periods and the discontinuance of a major customer trade payables program that previously allowed for accelerated payment terms. The deterioration in inventory turnover primarily results from an increase in inventory necessary to meet expected demand. Cash Flows The following table summarizes the key elements of our cash flows for the years ended December 31: 2005 2004 2003 Millions Net cash provided by operating activities $ 760 $ 614 $ 158 Net cash used in investing activities (212 ) (181 ) (131 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (372 ) 66 (149 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (8 ) 4 6 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 168 $ 503 $ (116 ) 2005 versus 2004 Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities improved $146 million in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to $200 million of higher net earnings, a $175 million increase in the deferred tax provision, a $101 million increase in long-term liabilities and a $35 million change in equity earnings of investees, partially offset by an increase in working capital of $378 million. Net changes in working capital utilized $308 million in cash during 2005 compared to providing $70 million in 2004, or a net decrease in cash provided by working capital of $378 million year-over-year. The net increase of $378 million of cash used by changes in working capital compared to 2004 resulted primarily from lower accrued expenses of $148 million, higher accounts receivable of $146 million and lower accounts payable of $102 million, partially offset by lower inventory of $17 million and changes in other current assets of $1 million. Accounts receivable increased due to higher sales levels, a higher mix of international receivables, and the discontinuance of a major customer trade payables program that previously allowed 49 for accelerated payment terms. The net reduction in accounts payable was due to a larger ramp-up in production during 2004 and the decrease in accrued expenses was driven by a lower increase in accrued warranty of $86 million and a lower increase in accrued payrolls of $63 million. Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased $31 million in 2005 compared to 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher capital expenditures of $41 million, which includes investments in internal use software of $6 million and a decrease in cash inflows from net liquidations of marketable securities of $24 million, partially offset by a $16 million decrease in cash used for acquisition of businesses, investments in and advances to equity investees of $6 million, and an increase in proceeds from disposals of $9 million. The majority of our capital spending in 2005 was primarily for capacity increases, manufacturing equipment, and tooling for new products. Our 2006 capital spending program is currently expected to be approximately $250 million, primarily targeted at new product introduction and capacity expansion for future growth. Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $372 million in 2005 compared to a $66 million source of cash in 2004, or a net change in cash outflows of $438 million year-over-year. The majority of the change year-over-year is due to the March 1, 2005, repayment of the $225 million 6.45% notes, a significant decrease in the proceeds of common stock issued from the exercise of stock options of $118 million and $38 million in common stock repurchases in 2005. 2004 versus 2003 Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities improved $456 million in 2004 compared to 2003, primarily due to $300 million of higher net earnings, changes in working capital of $60 million, a $49 million increase in non-cash adjustments for depreciation and amortization expense and increased pension expense of $28 million. Net changes in working capital provided $70 million in cash during 2004 compared to $10 million in 2003. The increase was a result of increases in accounts payable of $110 million and accrued expenses of $215 million, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable of $99 million, inventories of $141 million and other current assets of $25 million. Accounts payable and inventory were higher in 2004 primarily from higher production levels necessary to meet increased demand and from the effects of consolidating entities under FIN 46R by $70 million and $73 million, respectively. Accounts receivable increased $72 million due to higher sales levels and the impact of FIN 46, while accrued expenses increased primarily from payroll and variable compensation accruals of $87 million, pension liability of $22 million and a $44 million impact relating to FIN 46R. Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased $50 million in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase was due to higher capital expenditures of $44 million, which includes investments in internal use software of $4 million, increased investment in and advances to equity investees of $15 million, $18 million for purchase of a distributorship, partially offset by cash inflows from net liquidations of marketable securities of $26 million. The majority of our capital spending in 2004 included equipment for new product support and capacity expansion in our Engine and Components segments. Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $66 million in 2004 compared to a net cash outflow of $149 million in 2003, or a net change in cash inflows of $215 million year-over-year. Most of the change occurred from a significant cash outflow in March 2003 from the payment of our $125 million 6.25% notes and significant cash inflows in 2004 from the proceeds of common stock issued from the exercise of a large number of stock options of $148 million. 50 Cash Dividends Cash dividends of $0.30 per common share were declared and paid in each quarter of 2005, 2004 and 2003. Dividends paid to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $56 million, $53 million and $50 million, respectively. Declaration and payment of dividends in the future depends upon our earnings and liquidity position, among other factors. Share Repurchases In September 2005, we announced our intention to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock over the next two years. The shares will be repurchased utilizing cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2005, we repurchased $38 million of our common stock under this program. Debt Repayment In September 2005, we announced our intention to repay $250 million 9.5% notes in December 2006, the first call date for the debt. The notes were issued in November 2002 and are expected to be repaid using cash generated from operations. Cash Requirements A summary of payments due for our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, as of December 31, 2005, is shown in the tables below: Contractual Cash Obligations 2006 2007-2008 2009-2010 After 2010 Total Millions Loans payable $ 40 $ $ $ $ 40 Long-term debt and capital lease obligations 114 148 13 1,052 1,327 Operating leases 59 85 60 93 297 Capital expenditures 100 8 108 Purchase commitments for inventory 332 6 338 Other purchase commitments 99 31 2 1 133 Pension funding obligations(1) 170 170 Total $ 914 $ 278 $ 75 $ 1,146 $ 2,413 (1) Pension funding obligations are included only for 2006 as the amount of our funding obligations beyond the next year are not yet determinable. Other Commercial Commitments 2006 2007-2008 2009-2010 After 2010 Total Millions Standby letters of credit under revolving credit agreement $ 105 $ 5 $ $ $ 110 International and other domestic letters of credit 29 5 34 Performance and excise bonds 16 11 1 28 Other guarantees 24 2 3 29 Total $ 174 $ 23 $ 1 $ 3 $ 201 51 Financial Covenants and Credit Rating A number of our contractual obligations and financing agreements, such as our revolving credit facility and our equipment sale-leaseback agreement, have restrictive covenants and/or pricing modifications that may be triggered in the event of downward revisions to our corporate credit rating. Our credit rating is determined by independent credit rating agencies and includes an annual assessment of the creditworthiness of our debt securities and other obligations. It is intended to measure the probability of timely repayment of principal and interest of our notes and short-term debt. Generally, a higher credit rating leads to a more favorable effect on the marketability and pricing of our debt instruments in the capital markets. A credit rating of Baa3 or higher by Moody Investor Service, a credit rating of BBB- or higher by Standard & Poor or a rating of BBB- or higher by Fitch Ratings, three of the major credit rating agencies, is considered investment grade. Our current ratings and outlook from each of the credit rating agencies are shown in the table below. On July 1, 2005, Fitch Ratings upgraded our senior unsecured notes to BB+ from BB- and maintained a stable outlook. On July 28, 2005, Standard & Poor raised its corporate ratings to BBB-, or investment grade, from BB+ and maintained a stable outlook. On September 16, 2005, Moody Investor Service raised the debt securities rating of our senior unsecured debt to BA1 from BA2 and changed their rating outlook to positive from stable. Credit Rating Agency Senior L-T Debt Rating S-T Debt Rating Outlook Moody Investors Service, Inc. Ba1 Non-Prime Positive Standard & Poor BBB- WR Stable Fitch BB+ BB+ Stable We believe that we have significantly improved our financial position and demonstrated an ability to generate more sustainable amounts of cash from operations over the past two years. As a result of our improved performance and liquidity position, we are hopeful of returning to investment grade status with each of the credit rating agencies in 2006, which would improve our ability to access the capital markets or borrow funds at more favorable rates. Off Balance Sheet Financing Sale of Accounts Receivable In January 2004, we entered into a three-year facility agreement with a financial institution to sell a designated pool of trade receivables to Cummins Trade Receivables, LLC (CTR), a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary. This facility replaced a similar program which expired in December 2003. As necessary, CTR may transfer a direct interest in its receivables, without recourse, to the financial institution. To maintain a balance in the designated pools of receivables sold, we sell new receivables to CTR as existing receivables are collected. Receivables sold to CTR in which an interest is not transferred to the financial institution are included in Receivables, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets . The maximum interest in sold receivables that can be outstanding at any point in time is limited to the lesser of $200 million or the amount of eligible receivables held by CTR. There are no provisions in this agreement that require us to maintain a minimum investment credit rating; however, the terms of the agreement contain the same financial covenants as our revolving credit facility. There was no interest in receivables sold under this program to the financial institution in 2005 and the interest in receivables sold in 2004 was not significant. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, there were no amounts outstanding under this program. Under our old program which expired on December 15, 2003, we had an agreement with a different financial institution where we sold a designated pool of trade receivables to Cummins Receivable Corporation (CRC), a special purpose subsidiary. Under this program, CRC transferred an interest in its 52 receivables, without recourse, to limited purpose receivable securitization companies (conduits) that were established and maintained by an independent financial institution. The conduits would then fund their purchases by issuing commercial paper. No accounts receivable sold to either subsidiary were written off during 2005, 2004, or 2003. The weighted-average interest rate on repayments during 2004 and 2003 was 2.6 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively. The sold receivables servicing portfolio, which is included in receivables at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the proceeds from the sale of receivables and other related cash flows are disclosed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. PowerRent Business In 1999, Power Generation entered into an ongoing leasing program in which it built and sold power generation equipment to a financial institution and leased the equipment and related components back under a three-month, non-cancelable lease arrangement with subsequent renewals on a monthly basis up to a maximum of 36 months. The equipment was sold at cost and pursuant to lease accounting rules, the excess of the fair value of the equipment sold over its cost was recognized as prepaid rent and reflected the normal profit margin that would have been realized at the time of sale. The margins on the equipment sales were deferred and the leases recorded as operating leases. The prepaid rent was amortized ratably over the accounting lease term. Upon termination of the leases through a sale of the equipment to a third-party, the previously deferred margins on the sale to the financial institution were recorded as income. We sublease the equipment to customers under short-term rental agreements with terms that vary based upon customer and geographic region. In June 2004, the master lease agreement associated with this arrangement was amended to allow deployment of the equipment in countries other than the U.S. The amendment required us to retain full residual risk on the equipment value at the end of the non-cancelable lease term. As a result of this amendment, the leases under this program were classified as capital leases. At the end of the non-cancelable lease term, we may either (1) extend the lease term for an additional period, (2) repurchase the equipment at the current guaranteed value, or (3) arrange for a sale of the equipment to a third-party and pay the difference between the guaranteed value and the proceeds recovered from the sale. During 2002 and 2003, we entered into new leases for portions of the equipment with a different lessor ($29 million and $34 million, respectively). The new leases had a minimum two-year non-cancelable lease term with monthly renewal options for the 2002 transaction and four six-month renewal options for the 2003 transaction. The deferred margin associated with the equipment that transferred to the new lessor remained unchanged, as there was not an ultimate sale to a third-party. In December 2004, the master lease agreement associated with these leases was also amended to allow deployment of the equipment in countries outside the U.S. This amendment required us to repurchase the equipment at the end of the two-year non-cancelable lease terms, and as a result, the leases were classified as capital leases. The financial impact of amending these leasing arrangements, which represent the substantial majority of the equipment under lease in our PowerRent program, resulted in an increase in our capital lease obligations by the present value of: (1) the remaining minimum lease payments, plus (2) any guaranteed residual or repurchase obligation at the time of amendment. In addition, we increased the amount of our property, plant and equipment by this same amount, reduced for the remaining deferred gains associated with the original sale-leaseback of the units discussed above. The equipment will be depreciated over its expected remaining useful life. The total increase in our property, plant and equipment at the time the leases were amended was $104 million. The balance of the capital lease obligations related to these programs at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $82 million and $103 million, respectively. 53 Future lease payments, including repurchase obligations, under each lease are included in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . T he reclassification of the leases did not have a material impact on net earnings or affect compliance with any of our debt covenants. Financing Arrangements for Related Parties In accordance with the provisions of various joint venture agreements, we may purchase products and components from the joint ventures, sell products and components to the joint ventures and the joint ventures may sell products and components to unrelated parties. The transfer price of products purchased from the joint ventures may differ from normal selling prices. Certain joint venture agreements transfer product to us at cost, some transfer product to us on a cost-plus basis and other agreements provide for the transfer of products at market value. We purchase significant quantities of midrange diesel and natural gas engines, components and service parts from Consolidated Diesel Company (CDC), a general partnership that was formed in 1980 with J. I. Case (Case) to jointly fund engine development and manufacturing capacity. Cummins and Case (now CNH Global N.V.) are general partners and each partner shares 50 percent ownership in CDC. Under the terms of the agreement, CDC is obligated to make its entire production of diesel engines and related products available solely to the partners. Each partner is entitled to purchase up to one-half of CDC actual production and a partner may purchase in excess of one-half of actual production to the extent productive capacity is available beyond the other partner purchase requirement. The partners are each obligated, unconditionally and severally, to purchase annually at least one engine or engine kit produced by CDC, provided a minimum of one engine or engine kit is produced. The transfer price of CDC engines to the partners must be sufficient to cover its manufacturing cost in such annual accounting period, including interest and financing expenses, but excluding depreciation expense (other than Scheduled Depreciation Expense as defined in the agreement). In addition, each partner is obligated to contribute one-half of the capital investment required to maintain plant capacity and each partner has the right to invest unilaterally in plant capacity, which additional capacity is available to the other partner for a fee. To date, neither partner has made a unilateral investment in plant capacity at CDC. We are not a guarantor of any of CDC obligations or commitments. However, we are required as a partner, to provide up to 50 percent of CDC base working capital as defined by the agreement. The amount of base working capital is calculated each quarter and if supplemental funding greater than the base working capital amount is required, the amount is funded through third-party financing arranged by CDC, or we may elect to fund the requirement, although we are under no obligation to do so. To date, when supplemental funding is required above the base working capital amount, we have elected to provide that funding to CDC. If the amount of supplemental funding required is less than the base working capital amount, it is funded equally by the partners. Excess cash generated by CDC is remitted to Cummins until CDC working capital amount is reduced to the base working capital amount. Any further cash remittances from CDC to the partners are shared equally by the partners. In the first quarter of 2004, we adopted certain provisions of FIN 46R. Under the provisions of FIN 46R, CDC and another engine manufacturing entity jointly owned and operated by us were considered VIEs and we were deemed the primary beneficiary of these VIEs by virtue of our pricing arrangements with them and substantial product purchases from them. As a result, we consolidated the assets and liabilities of CDC and the other engine manufacturer as of March 28, 2004. Previously, these joint ventures were accounted for under the equity method of accounting and included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Investments in and advances to equity investees. First quarter results for these entities were recorded as Investee equity, royalty and other income in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and results for the rest of the year were consolidated in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For a further discussion of the impact of adopting FIN 46R, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 54 APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this annual report which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives. There were no accounting policies adopted during 2005 that had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP that often require management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements. Our management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In any given reporting period, our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting estimates are defined as follows: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies, related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs, accounting for income taxes, pension benefits and annual assessment of recoverability of goodwill. Warranty Programs We estimate and record a liability for warranty programs, primarily base warranty, other than product recalls, at the time our products are sold. Our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs, the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action, which generally occurs when it is announced. Our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates, repair costs and the time of failure. Future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability. New product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. Product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch, with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch. We generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a factor based upon historical experience only in the first year, a blend of actual product and historical experience in the second year and product specific experience thereafter. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2005 and 2004 including adjustments to pre-existing warranties. Accounting for Income Taxes We determine our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2005, the Company has recorded net deferred tax assets of $853 million. These 55 assets include $143 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards that generally have a limited life and begin expiring in 2014. The ultimate realization of our net deferred tax assets will require a sustained level of profitability. Having assessed the future profit plans and tax planning strategies together with the years of expiration of carryforward benefits, a valuation allowance of $31 million has been recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believes is more likely than not to be realized. Should the Company operating performance deteriorate, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing certain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit. A more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Pension Benefits We sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the U.S. and the U.K., and to a lesser degree in various other countries. In the U.S. and the U.K. we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded. We account for our pension programs in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, (SFAS 87) which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis. As a result, our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans. These assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities, assumed rates of return on plan assets, future compensation increases, employee turnover rates, actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age, mortality rates and participant withdrawals. The actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions, participant life span, and withdrawal rates. These differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements in the future . The expected long-term return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension expense. The differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected long-term return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense over five years. The expected rate of return on U.S. pension plan assets used to develop our pension expense was 8.5 percent for each year ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. The expected rate of return on non-U.S. pension plan assets was 7.56 percent, 8.08 percent and 8.44 percent, respectively. In 2006, we plan to use an expected rate of return of 8.5 percent for U.S pension plan assets and 7.24 percent for non-U.S. pension plan assets. A lower rate of return will increase our net periodic pension expense and reduce profitability. The difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and, under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds 10 percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation (PBO), amortized over future years of service. This is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions. As of December 31, 2005, we had net unrecognized pension actuarial losses of $581 million and $329 million for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively. As these amounts exceed 10 percent of our PBO, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees. Our net periodic pension expense was $103 million in 2005, $89 million in 2004 and $61 million in 2003. Our net periodic pension expense is expected to be approximately $116 million in 2006. Another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension expense is the discount rate. The discount rate used to develop our net periodic pension expense in the U.S. was 5.75 percent, 6.25 percent and 7.00 percent for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. The discount rate for our non-U.S. pension expense was 5.30 percent, 5.66 percent and 5.91 percent. We will use 5.60 percent and 4.95 percent 56 for U.S. and non-U.S. pension expense in 2006. Changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension expense calculation and due to the fact that the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) is calculated on a present value basis, changes in the discount rate assumption will impact the current ABO. An increase in the ABO caused by a decrease in the discount rate may result in additional voluntary contributions to a pension plan as our funding strategy is to fund the plan approximately 90 percent on an ABO basis in the U.S. The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. The guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in EITF D-36 which suggests a high-quality corporate bond rate. We used bond information provided by Standard & Poors for the U.S. and iBoxx for the U.K. All bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the U.S. and U.K. were high-quality, noncallable bonds (AA or better) as of November 30, 2005. The average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to value the obligations of the plans subject to SFAS 87 and SFAS No. 106, Employer Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. Our model called for 60 years of benefit payments. For the U.S. plans, the sum of the cash flows from the 60 bonds matched the cash flow from the benefit payment stream upon completion of the process. The number of bonds purchased for each issue was used to determine the price of the entire portfolio. The discount rate benchmark was set to the internal rate of return needed to discount the cash flows to arrive at the portfolio price. In developing the U.K. discount rate, excess cash flows resulted in the early years of the 60 year period when the sum of the cash flow from the bonds maturing in later years exceeded the benefit payments in early years, thus no bonds maturing in early years are needed. As a result, the price of the entire portfolio of bonds was too high because all benefit payments were covered with excess cash flow remaining. We made no adjustment to the cash flow and the discount rate was determined as the internal rate of return needed to discount the cash flows to arrive at the portfolio price. Due to the flat shape of the yield curve, this methodology choice impacted the discount rate by less than two basis percentage points. The discount rate would have been slightly higher had the cash flows been allowed to reinvest. The table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2006 net periodic pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets Impact on Pension Expense Inc (Dec) Millions Discount rate used to value liabilities: 0.25 percent increase $ (6.4 ) 0.25 percent decrease 6.4 Expected rate of return on assets: 1 percent increase (22.1 ) 1 percent decrease 22.0 The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. It should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. We considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets, including historical returns and input from our external advisors. The long-term rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of long-term returns on an investment portfolio consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income, real estate and other miscellaneous investments. Based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our U.S. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20-year 57 projection period equal to or in excess of 7.55 percent approximately 50 percent of the time while returns of 9.11 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time. Our actual returns have exceeded 8.5 percent in each of the last two years. As a result, based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations, we believe an investment return assumption of 8.5 percent per year for U.S. pension assets is reasonable. The methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the U.K. was based on establishing an equity-risk premium over current long-term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations. Our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a long-term outlook. Therefore, the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a long-term horizon. Our pension plan asset allocation at December 31, 2005, 2004 and target allocation for 2006 are as follows: Target Allocation Percentage of Plan Assets at December 31, Investment description 2006 2005 2004 Equity securities 64.7 % 64.1 % 68.3 % Fixed income 33.1 % 33.5 % 24.9 % Real estate/Other 2.2 % 2.4 % 6.8 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Actual cash funding for our pension plans is governed by employee benefit and tax laws and the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002. This Act included temporary rules allowing companies to use, for funding purposes, discount rates for 2002 and 2003 equal to 120 percent of the weighted-average 30-year U.S. Treasury Bond yield. We may voluntarily make contributions to achieve our funding strategy described above. During 2005 and 2004, we made cash contributions to our pension plans of $151 million and $135 million, respectively, and we expect to make cash contributions of approximately $170 million in 2006. Contributions beyond 2006 will depend on the funded status of our plans at that time and the outcome of proposed changes to the funding regulations currently being considered by the U.S. Congress. Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity, the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements . Annual Assessment for Recoverability of Goodwill Under the provisions of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed annually. The fair value of each reporting unit was estimated by discounting the future cash flows less requirements for working capital and fixed asset additions. Our valuation method requires us to make projections of revenue, operating expenses, working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the reporting units over a multi-year period. Additionally, management must estimate its weighted-average cost of capital for each reporting unit for use as a discount rate. The discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and if less than the carrying value, a separate valuation of the goodwill is required to determine if an impairment loss has occurred. As of the end of the third quarter in 2005, we performed the annual impairment assessment required by SFAS 142 and determined that our goodwill was not impaired. At December 31, 2005, our recorded goodwill was $358 million. Changes in our projections or estimates, a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect or a significant increase in the discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units and result in a future impairment of goodwill. 58 RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153 Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 29 (SFAS 153). This statement amends Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that have no commercial substance. Under SFAS 153, if a nonmonetary exchange of similar productive assets meets a commercial-substance criterion and fair value is determinable, the transaction must be accounted for at fair value resulting in recognition of any gain or loss. SFAS 153 was effective for nonmonetary transactions in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 153 did not have any impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements . In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143 ( FIN 47). Under FIN 47, we are required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Any uncertainty about the amount and/or timing of future settlement should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value. The provisions of FIN 47 were required to be applied no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. As such, we adopted FIN 47 in the fourth quarter of 2005. The adoption of FIN 47 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements . ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs An Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4 (SFAS 151). SFAS 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead as an inventory cost. The new statement also requires that allocation of fixed production overhead costs to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions in SFAS 151 must be applied prospectively and become effective for us beginning January 1, 2006. We do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements . In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R). This statement requires financial statement recognition of compensation cost related to share-based payment transactions. Share-based payment transactions within the scope of SFAS 123R include stock options, restricted stock plans, performance-based awards, stock appreciation rights, and employee share purchase plans. The provisions of SFAS 123R are effective for the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2005. However, in April 2005, the SEC deferred the effective date of SFAS 123R for SEC registrants to the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. Accordingly, we expect to implement the revised standard in the first quarter of 2006. Currently, we account for stock-based employee awards issued after December 31, 2002, using the fair value method preferred by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. This statement also requires prospective presentation of the tax benefit on stock options exercised as a financing activity rather than an operating activity in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows . We do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements . In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3 (SFAS 154). This statement changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle and applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle. It also applies to changes required by an accounting 59 pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions. When a pronouncement includes specific transition provisions, those provisions should be followed. APB No. 20 required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle. This statement requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. The provisions of SFAS 154 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. As such we are required to adopt SFAS 154 by January 1, 2006. We do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements . DISCLOSURE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain parts of this annual report contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the industries in which we operate and management beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words, such as anticipates, expects, forecasts, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates or similar expressions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, which we refer to as future factors, which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. Future factors that could cause our results to differ materially from the results discussed in such forward-looking statements are discussed below. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Future factors that could affect the outcome of forward-looking statements include the following: price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors, including new entrants; rapid technological developments of diesel engines; the ability to continue to introduce competitive new products in a timely, cost-effective basis; the sales mix of products; the achievement of lower costs and expenses; domestic and foreign governmental and public policy changes, including environmental regulations; protection and validity of patent and other intellectual property rights; reliance on large customers; technological, implementation and cost/financial risks in increasing use of large, multi-year contracts; the cyclical nature of our business; the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings; continued availability of financing, financial instruments and financial resources in the amounts, at the times and on the terms required to support our future business; and other risk factors described in Part I of this report under the caption RISK FACTORS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS.
