ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes ( Notes ) included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements. This overview provides our perspective on the individual sections of MD&A. MD&A includes the following sections: Our Business a general description of our business; the value drivers of our business; and opportunities and risks; Results of Operations an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our financial statements; Liquidity and Capital Resources an analysis of our cash flows, sources and uses of cash and contractual obligations; 32 Accounting Policies and Pronouncements a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates including newly issued accounting pronouncements; Sales details of our sales measured on a quarterly basis in both dollars and cases; Inflation information about the impact that inflation may or may not have on our results; Forward Looking Statements cautionary information about forward looking statements and a description of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the company historical results or our current expectations or projections; and Market Risks Information about market risks and risk management. (See Forward Looking Statements and Part II, Item 7A. - Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risks ). Our Business Overview We develop, market, sell and distribute alternative beverage category natural sodas, fruit juices and juice drinks, energy drinks and energy sports drinks, fruit juice smoothies and functional drinks, non-carbonated ready-to-drink iced teas, children multi-vitamin juice drinks, Junior Juice juices and flavored sparkling beverages under the Hansen brand name. We also develop, market, sell and distribute energy drinks under the following brand names; Monster Energy , Lost Energy , Joker Mad Energy , Unbound Energy and Ace brand names as well as Rumba brand energy juice. We also market, sell and distribute the Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, natural sodas, premium natural sodas with supplements, organic natural sodas, seltzer waters, sports drinks and energy drinks under the Blue Sky brand name. Our fruit juices for toddlers are marketed under the Junior Juice brand name. We also market, sell and distribute vitamin and mineral drink mixes in powdered form under the Fizzit brand name. We have two reportable segments, namely DSD, whose principal products comprise energy drinks, and Warehouse, whose principal products comprise juice based and soda beverages. The DSD segment develops, markets and sells products primarily through an exclusive distributor network, whereas the Warehouse segment develops, markets and sells products primarily direct to retailers. Our sales and marketing strategy for all our beverages and drink mixes is to focus our efforts on developing brand awareness and trial through sampling both in stores and at events. We use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events where we sample our products to consumers. We utilize push-pull methods to achieve maximum shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets and maximum demand from consumers for our products, including advertising, in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials and racks, prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected public and extreme sports figures, coupons, sampling and sponsorship of selected causes such as cancer research and SPCAs, as well as extreme sports teams such as the Pro Circuit Kawasaki Motocross and Supercross teams, Kawasaki Factory Motocross and Supercross teams, Robby Gordon Racing Team, Kawasaki Factory International Moto GP Team, Kenny Bernstein Drag Racing Team, extreme sports figures and athletes, sporting events such as the Monster Energy Supercross Series, the Monster Energy Pro Pipeline surfing competition, Winter and Summer X-Games, marathons, 10k runs, bicycle races, volleyball tournaments and other health and sports related activities, including extreme sports, particularly supercross, motocross, freestyle, surfing, skateboarding, wakeboarding, skiing, snowboarding, BMX, mountain biking, snowmobile racing, etc., and we also participate in product demonstrations, food tasting and other related events. In store posters, outdoor posters, print, radio and television advertising, together with price promotions and coupons, may also be used to promote our brands. 33 We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation, such as making Hansen products visually distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different, better and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, and we will continue to reevaluate the same from time to time. During 2007, we continued to expand our existing product lines and further develop our markets. In particular, we continued to focus on developing and marketing beverages that fall within the category generally described as the alternative beverage category, with particular emphasis on energy type drinks. During the second quarter of 2006, we entered into the Off-Premise Agreements with AB. Under the Off-Premise Agreements, select AB Distributors distribute and sell, in markets designated by HBC, HBC Monster Energy and Lost Energy TM brands non-alcoholic energy drinks, Rumba brand energy juice and Unbound Energy brand energy drinks, as well as additional products that may be agreed between the parties. We intend to continue building our national distributor network primarily with select AB distributors as well as with our sales force throughout 2007 to support and grow the sales of our products. On April 28, 2006, HBC entered into a distribution agreement with Cadbury Bebidas for exclusive distribution by Cadbury Bebidas throughout Mexico, excluding Baja California, of our Monster Energy and Lost Energy energy products. On February 8, 2007, HBC entered into the On-Premise Agreement with AB. Under the On-Premise Agreement, AB will manage and coordinate the sales, distribution and merchandising of Monster Energy energy drinks to on-premise retailers including bars, nightclubs and restaurants in territories approved by HBC. On March 1, 2007, HBC entered into a distribution agreement with Pepsi Canada for the exclusive distribution by Pepsi Canada throughout Canada of our Monster Energy , Lost Energy and Hansen energy products. As discussed under Review of Historic Stock Option Granting Practices in Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, and Item 2 Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , included in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, a special committee of our Board of Directors concluded its review of our stock option grants and granting practices. In connection with this review, related litigation and other related matters, we incurred professional service fees of $9.8 million (net of $2.5 million insurance reimbursements) and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. No related costs were incurred for the year ended December 31, 2005. The following table summarizes the selected items discussed above for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: 34 2007 2006 (In Thousands) (In Thousands) Deferred Revenue: Receipts from newly appointed AB distributors $ 21,029 $ 20,851 Recognized Revenue $ 1,916 $ 411 Operating Expenses: Termination payments to prior distributors $ 15,266 $ 12,728 Professional fees associated with the review of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters $ 9,760 $ 3,753 net of $2.5 million insurance reimbursements As a result of the late filings of our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2006, our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, and our Form 10-Q for the three-months ended March 31, 2007, we will be ineligible to register our securities on Form S-3 for sale by us or resale by others until we have been current in our reporting obligations for a period of approximately one year. We expect to be eligible to register our securities on Form S-3 after July 1, 2008. The inability to use Form S-3 could adversely affect our ability to raise capital during this period. However, we are still eligible to register our securities on Form S-1. If we fail to timely file a future periodic report with the SEC and our stock were to be delisted, it could severely impact our ability to raise future capital and could have an adverse impact on our overall future liquidity. We again achieved record gross sales in 2007. The increase in gross sales in 2007 was primarily attributable to increased sales volume of certain of our existing products, particularly our Monster Energy brand energy drinks and to sales by volume or our Java Monster TM line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks. The percentage increase in gross sales was lower than the percentage increase in net sales, primarily due to a decrease in promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales, which decreased from 13.0% to 11.8%. The actual amount of promotional and other allowances increased to $121.3 million from $90.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. A substantial portion of our gross sales are derived from our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. Any decrease in sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. Competitive pressure in the energy drink category could adversely affect our operating results. (See Part I, Item 1A. - Risk Factors ) During the fourth quarter of 2007, we announced a price increase for our Monster Energy brand energy drinks and our Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that approximately 7% to 8% of our gross sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 were attributable to purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. We did not limit the amount of purchases our customers could execute at our existing 2007 fourth quarter prices. As a result, our future sales and operating results may be negatively impacted as a result of higher than normal distribution channel inventory levels. (See Part I, Item 1A. - Risk Factors ) Gross sales shipped outside of California represented 72.0%, 67.8% and 61.5% of our gross sales, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Gross sales to customers outside the United States amounted to $41.0 million, $19.3 million and $5.6 million for the years ended 35 December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Such sales were approximately 4.0%, 2.8% and 1.3% of gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our customers are typically retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, drug chains, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, full service beverage distributors, health food distributors and food service customers. Gross sales to our various customer types for 2007, 2006 and 2005 are reflected below. The allocations below reflect changes made by the Company to the categories historically reported. 2007 2006 2005 Retail Grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers 8% 12% 19% Club stores, drug chains & mass merchandisers 14% 14% 11% Full service distributors 73% 69% 65% Health food distributors 2% 2% 3% Other 3% 3% 2% Our customers include Cadbury Schweppes Bottling Group (formally known as Dr. Pepper Bottling/7UP Bottling Group), Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam Club), AB, Kalil Bottling Group, Trader Joe s, John Lenore & Company, Pepsi Canada, Swire Coca-Cola, USA, Costco, The Kroger Co., Safeway Inc. and Albertsons. A decision by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from the Company or to cease carrying our products could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. Cadbury Schweppes Bottling Group, a customer of the DSD division, accounted for approximately 16%, 19% and 18% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam Club), a customer of both the DSD and Warehouse divisions, accounted for approximately 12% of the Company net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In October 2006, we acquired the Unbound Energy trademark and assumed the production, marketing and sale of Unbound Energy energy drinks in 16-ounce cans. We subsequently introduced a lo-carb and juice version in 16-ounce cans. During 2004, we entered into exclusive WIC Contracts with the State of California to supply 100% apple juice and 100% blended juice in 64-ounce PET plastic bottles. The WIC Contracts commenced on July 12, 2004 and were due to expire in July 2007. The parties mutually agreed to extend the WIC Contracts until July 11, 2008. WIC-approved items are stocked by the grocery trade and by WIC-only stores. Products are purchased by WIC consumers with vouchers given by the DHS to qualified participants. Due to significant cost increases mainly for apple juice concentrates and PET plastic bottles, we are currently negotiating a mutually acceptable earlier termination of the WIC Contracts with the State of California. We have been informed that future WIC contracts will not be granted on an exclusive basis and that certain manufacturers (including HBC) will be eligible to sell certain qualifying products to WIC participants. The Company is informed and believes that the WIC program intends reducing the total quantity of fruit juice products that will be available to WIC participants. We anticipate that as a consequence of the above, our revenue from these products is likely to be lower in the future. However, we do not believe that such reduction in revenue will have a material impact on our future operations. (See Part I, Item 1. Business Manufacture and Distribution ). We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors. Value Drivers of our Business We believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following: Profitable Growth We believe functional, better for you brands properly supported by marketing and innovation, targeted to a broad consumer base, drive profitable growth. We 36 continue to broaden our family of brands. In particular, we are expanding and growing our specialty beverages and energy drinks to provide more alternatives to consumers. We are focused on maintaining profit margins. We believe that tailored brand, package, price and channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to accelerating profitable growth. Cost Management The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on supplies and cost reduction. One key area of focus, for example, is to decrease raw material costs, co-packing fees and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net operating revenues. Another key area of focus is the reduction in inventory levels. However, due to the expansion in the number of our products, increased sales levels in 2007, and the conclusion of the agreements with AB, overall inventory levels increased. During 2007, the costs of PET plastic bottles and certain aluminum cans, as well as the costs of glucose, high fructose corn syrup, certain juice concentrates, including apple, and certain packaging and freight costs also increased. Efficient Capital Structure Our capital structure is intended to optimize our costs of capital. We believe our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds if necessary at low effective cost and overall low costs of borrowing provide a competitive advantage. We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when properly implemented, will result in (1) maintaining our gross profit margin; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) optimizing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations. Gross and net sales, gross profits, operating income, and net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. In 2007, gross sales totaled $1,025.8 million, a 47.3% increase over 2006. Net sales totaled $904.5 million in 2007, an increase of 49.3% over 2006. Gross profit totaled $468.0 million in 2007, a 47.8% increase from 2006. Operating income totaled $231.0 million in 2007, an increase of 45.7% from 2006. Net income totaled $149.4 million in 2007, a 52.5% increase from 2006. Net income per diluted share was $1.51 as compared to net income per diluted share of $0.99 in 2006. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2008 and beyond. See also Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2006. In 2007, the Company had working capital of $187.3 million compared to $212.3 million as of December 31, 2006. In 2007, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $135.5 million as compared to $76.4 million in 2006. Principal uses of cash flows are purchases of inventory, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment and trademarks. Payment of accounts payable and income taxes payable are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds. (See also Part II, Item 7. - Liquidity and Capital Resources ). Opportunities, Challenges and Risks Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the beverage industry and our Company. Increase in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles represents a challenge. We recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and lo-carb beverages, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and waters and energy drinks. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. 37 Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality, health, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect companies that misjudge such preferences. In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our company future financial results include, but are not limited to: the impact of the slowing economy in the United States and other countries in which we operate; maintenance of our brand images and product quality; profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See also Part I, Item 1. - Business - Competition and Sales and Marketing ); restrictions on imports and sources of supply; duties or tariffs; changes in government regulations; protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and the continuous pursuit of new and innovative trademarks for our expanding product lines; limitations on available quantities of sucralose, a non-caloric sweetener that is used in many of our beverage products, due to demand for such sweetener exceeding the supplier production capacity, as well as limitations on available quantities of certain package containers such as the 24-ounce cap can, the 32-ounce can and copacking availability; the imposition of additional restrictions. (See also Part I, Item 1A. - Risk Factors ) for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. We believe that the following opportunities exist for us: growth potential for the alternative beverage category including energy drinks, sparkling beverages, carbonated soft drinks, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and water; new product introductions intended to contribute to higher profitability; premium packages intended to generate strong revenue growth; significant package, pricing and channel opportunities to maximize profitable growth; proper positioning to capture industry growth; and broadening distribution/expansion opportunities. 38 Results of Operations Percentage Change 2007 2006 2005 07 vs. 06 06 vs. 05 Gross sales, net of discounts & returns * $ 1,025,795 $ 696,322 $ 415,417 47.3% 67.6% Less: Promotional and other allowances** 121,330 90,548 66,531 34.0% 36.1% Net sales 904,465 605,774 348,886 49.3% 73.6% Cost of sales 436,452 289,180 166,343 50.9% 73.8% Gross profit 468,013 316,594 182,543 47.8% 73.4% Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales 51.7% 52.3% 52.3% Operating expenses 237,027 158,015 79,100 50.0% 99.8% Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 26.2% 26.1% 22.7% Operating income 230,986 158,579 103,443 45.7% 53.3% Operating income as a percent of net sales 25.5% 26.2% 29.6% Interest and other income, net 8,770 3,660 1,351 139.6% 170.9% Income before provision for income taxes 239,756 162,239 104,794 47.8% 54.8% Provision for income taxes 90,350 64,290 42,019 40.5% 53.0% Net income $ 149,406 $ 97,949 $ 62,775 52.5% 56.0% Net income as a percent of net sales 16.5% 16.2% 18.0% Net income per common share: Basic $ 1.64 $ 1.09 $ 0.71 50.3% 53.0% Diluted $ 1.51 $ 0.99 $ 0.65 52.6% 52.9% Case sales (in thousands) (in 192-ounce case equivalents) 98,453 72,740 48,214 35.3% 50.9% * Gross sales, although used internally by management as an indicator of operating performance, should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting requirements. However, gross sales is used by management to monitor operating performance including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and our overall performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. Management believes the presentation of gross sales allows a more comprehensive presentation of our operating performance. Gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from customers. ** Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the disclosure thereof does not conform with GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, the presentation of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of the impact thereof on the determination of net sales and illustrates the spending levels incurred to secure such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. 39 Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Gross Sales.* Gross sales were $1,025.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $329.5 million or 47.3% higher than gross sales of $696.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in gross sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks, which include Monster Energy drinks (introduced in April 2002), lo-carb Monster Energy drinks (introduced in August 2003), Monster Energy Assault TM energy drinks (introduced in September 2004) and Monster Energy Khaos TM energy drinks (introduced in August 2005), as well as sales of certain new products such as the Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks (introduced in April 2007), Monster M-80 TM energy drinks (introduced in March 2007), Monster MIXXD energy drinks (introduced in December 2007) and Monster Heavy Metal energy drinks (introduced in November 2007). To a lesser extent, the increase in gross sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice and juice blends, aseptic juices, Unbound Energy energy drinks (introduced in October 2006) and Junior Juice aseptic juices. The increase in gross sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of Lost Energy drinks (introduced in January 2004), iced teas, Joker Mad Energy drinks (introduced in January 2005) and Hansen's fruit juice smoothies. Changes in pricing did not have a material impact on the increase in gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2007. However, during the fourth quarter of 2007, we announced a price increase for our Monster Energy brand energy drinks and our Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that approximately 7% to 8% of our gross sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 were attributable to purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. Promotional and other allowances were $121.3 million for 2007, an increase of $30.8 million or 34.0% higher than promotional and other allowances of $90.5 million for 2006. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales decreased to 11.8% in 2007 from 13.0% in 2006. As a result, the percentage increase in gross sales in 2007 was lower than the percentage increase in net sales. *Gross sales see definition above. Net Sales. Net sales were $904.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $298.7 million or 49.3% higher than net sales of $605.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks, which include Monster Energy drinks, lo-carb Monster Energy drinks, Monster Energy Assault energy drinks and Monster Energy Khaos energy drinks, as well as sales of certain new products such as the Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, Monster M-80 energy drinks, Monster MIXXD energy drinks and Monster Heavy Metal energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in net sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice and juice blends, aseptic juices, sodas and Junior Juice aseptic juices. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of Lost Energy drinks, iced teas, Joker Mad Energy drinks, smoothies in cans and Hansen energy drinks. Changes in pricing did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007. However, during the fourth quarter of 2007, we announced a price increase to our Monster Energy brand energy drinks and our Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that approximately 7% to 8% of our net sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 were attributable to purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 98.5 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of 25.7 million cases or 35.3% higher than case sales of 72.7 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2006. The overall average net sales price per case increased to $9.19 for 2007 or 10.3% higher than the average net sales price per case of $8.33 for 2006. The increase in the average net sales prices per case was attributable to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products. 40 Net sales for the DSD segment were $809.8 million for year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $295.5 million or 57.5% higher than net sales of $514.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks, which include Monster Energy drinks, lo-carb Monster Energy drinks, Monster Energy Assault TM energy drinks and Monster Energy Khaos TM energy drinks, as well as sales of certain new products such as the Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks and Monster M-80 TM energy drinks. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of Lost Energy drinks and Joker Mad Energy drinks. Changes in pricing within the DSD segment did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007. However, during the fourth quarter of 2007, we announced a price increase to our Monster Energy brand energy drinks and our Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that approximately 7% to 8% of our net sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 were attributable to purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $94.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $3.2 million or 3.5% higher than net sales of $91.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice and juice blends, aseptic juices, sodas and Junior Juice aseptic juices. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of iced teas, smoothies in cans and Hansen energy drinks. Changes in pricing within the Warehouse segment did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007. Gross Profit.** * Gross profit was $468.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $151.4 million or 47.8% higher than the gross profit of $316.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 51.7% for 2007 as compared to 52.3% for 2006. Increases in sales volumes contributed to the increase in gross profit dollars. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in the percentage of sales within the DSD segment of certain packages that have lower gross profit margins. To a lesser extent, the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was also attributable to an increase in the cost of certain raw materials including certain sweeteners, certain containers and packaging materials and certain juice concentrates and increased reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventory. Such decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by increased sales of DSD segment products which have higher gross profit margins than those in the Warehouse segment, a decrease in promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales. ***Gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within another line item such as operating expenses. Operating Expenses . Total operating expenses were $237.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $79.0 million or 50.0% higher than total operating expenses of $158.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was 26.2% for 2007, slightly higher than 26.1% for 2006. The increase in operating expenses in dollars was partially attributable to increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $8.7 million primarily due to increased volume of shipments, increased expenditures of $18.4 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased expenditures of $10.3 million for commissions and royalties, increased expenditures of $4.9 million for sampling programs, increased payroll expenses of $12.1 million, increased expenditures of $8.6 million for professional services costs, including legal and accounting fees, and increased expenditures of $2.5 million relating to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors. Included in legal and accounting fees are costs of $9.8 million (net of $2.5 million insurance reimbursements) in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters. Total operating expenses, exclusive of expenditures of $15.3 million and $12.7 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributor and exlcusive of expenditures of $9.8 million (net of 2.5 million in 41 insurance reimbursements) and $3.8 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters, as a percentage of net sales, were 23.4% for both 2007 and 2006. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $281.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $93.8 million or 49.9% higher than contribution margin of $187.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales of Monster Energy brand energy drinks as well as sales of certain new products such as the Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks and Monster M-80 TM energy drinks. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, a decrease of approximately $2.2 million or 36.3% lower than contribution margin of $6.1 million for year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to a reduction in gross margin as a result of increased costs of raw materials and production. Operating Income. Operating income was $231.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $72.4 million or 45.7% higher than operating income of $158.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 25.5% for 2007 from 26.2% for 2006. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $151.4 million. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increased cost of sales as a percentage of net sales. Operating income, exclusive of recognition of deferred revenue of $1.9 million and $0.4 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, attributable to the AB Distribution agreements entered into with newly appointed AB Distributors, exclusive of expenditures of $15.3 million and $12.7 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors and exclusive of expenditures of $9.8 million (net of $2.5 million insurance reimbursements) and $3.8 for 2007 and 2006, respectively, in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters, as a percentage of net sales, was 28.2% for 2007 as compared to 28.9% for 2006. Interest and Other Income, net . Net interest and other income was $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $5.1 million from net interest and other income of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in net interest and other income was primarily attributable to increased interest revenue earned on our cash balances and short- and long-term investments, which have increased significantly over the prior year. Provision for Income Taxes . Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $90.3 million, as compared to provision for income taxes of $64.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2007 was 37.7%, which was lower than the effective tax rate of 39.6% for 2006. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to certain interest income earned on securities that is exempt from federal income taxes and a reduction in federal taxes attributable to the domestic production tax deduction. This decrease was partially offset by stock-based compensation relating to incentive stock options that is not deducted for federal or state income tax purposes. Net Income . Net income was $149.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $51.5 million or 52.5% higher than net income of $97.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit of $151.4 million and, to a lesser extent, an increase in net interest and other income of approximately $5.1 million. This was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $79.0 million and an increase in provision for income taxes of $26.1 million. 42 Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Gross Sales.* Gross sales were $696.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $280.9 million or 67.6% higher than the $415.4 million gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in gross sales for 2006 was primarily attributable to increased sales volumes of certain of our existing products, including the full year sales of Monster Energy Khaos TM energy drinks which were introduced in August 2005. Promotional and other allowances were $90.5 million for 2006 an increase of $24.0 million or 36.1% higher than promotional and other allowances of $66.5 million for 2005. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales decreased from 16.0% in 2005 to 13.0% in 2006. As a result the percentage increase in gross sales in 2006 was lower than the percentage increase in net sales. *Gross sales see definition above. Net Sales . Net sales were $605.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $256.9 million or 73.6% higher than net sales of $348.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks, which include Monster Energy drinks, lo-carb Monster Energy drinks, Monster Energy Assault TM energy drinks, as well as sales of Monster Energy Khaos TM energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in net sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of teas, lemonades and juice cocktails, Lost Energy drinks, sports drinks, Rumba brand energy juice, Junior Juice , Ace energy drinks and Unbound Energy energy drinks. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of Hansen energy drinks, smoothies in cans and Energade energy sports drinks. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents were 72.7 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of 24.5 million cases or 50.9% higher than case sales of 48.2 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2005. The overall average net sales price per case increased to $8.33 for 2006 or 15% higher than the net sales price per case of $7.24 for 2005. The increase in the average net sales prices per case was attributable to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products. Net sales for the DSD segment were $514.3 million for year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $251.4 million or 95.6% higher than net sales of $262.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks, which include Monster Energy drinks, lo-carb Monster Energy drinks, Monster Energy Assault TM energy drinks, as well as sales of Monster Energy Khaos TM energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in net sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of Lost Energy drinks, Rumba TM brand energy juice, Ace TM energy drinks and Unbound Energy energy drinks. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of Energade energy sports drinks. Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $91.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $5.5 million or 6.4% higher than net sales of $86.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of teas, lemonades and juice cocktails, Junior Juice and sports drinks. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of Hansen energy drinks and smoothies in cans. Gross Profit.*** Gross profit was $316.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $134.1 million or 73.4% higher than the gross profit of $182.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 52.3% for both 2006 and 2005. Increases in sales volumes contributed to an increase in gross profit dollars. Gross profit as a 43 percentage of net sales was affected by an increase in the percentage of sales within the DSD segment of certain packages that have lower gross profit margins. In addition, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was also affected by a significant increase in certain freight-in costs due to the addition of new co-packers and warehouses and an increase in the cost of certain raw materials including sucrose, PET and aluminum cans and apple juice concentrate. These factors were offset by increased sales of DSD segment products which have higher gross profit margins than those in the Warehouse segment. ***Gross Profit see definition above. Operating Expenses . Total operating expenses were $158.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $78.9 million or 99.8% higher than total operating expenses of $79.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 26.1% for 2006 from 22.6% for 2005. The increase in total operating expenses and total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increased selling and distribution, and general and administrative expenses. Selling and distribution expenses were $95.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $44.5 million or 87.8% higher than selling and distribution expenses of $50.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Selling and distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales for 2006 were 15.7%, which was higher than selling and distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales of 14.6% for 2005. The increase in selling and distribution expenses was partially attributable to increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $18.9 million primarily due to increased volumes of shipments and increased freight rates and fuel prices, as well as increased expenditures of $6.9 million for merchandise displays primarily in anticipation of the changeover to select AB distributors, $4.3 million for sponsorships and endorsements, $4.3 million for trade development activities with distributors and customers, $2.7 million for commissions and royalties , and $1.8 million for sampling programs. General and administrative expenses were $62.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $34.4 million or 121.6% higher than general and administrative expenses of $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for 2006 were 10.4%, which was higher than general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales of 8.1% for 2005. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors of $12.7 million, stock compensation expense of $8.3 million as a result of our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS ) No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ( SFAS No. 123R ) which was not expensed in the previous year including a cumulative adjustment of $1.3 million related to stock based compensation and related charges (See Part II, Item 8, Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies Other ), an increase in payroll expenses of $5.3 million, and an increase of $5.2 million in professional services costs, including legal and accounting fees. Included in legal and accounting fees are costs of $3.8 million relating to the Company special investigation of stock option grants. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin represents net sales by segment less the cost of sales and operating expenses which can be directly attributed to segment net sales. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $187.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $78.9 million or 72.4% higher than contribution margin of $109.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales of Monster Energy brand energy drinks. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $6.1 million for 2006, a decrease of approximately $4.3 million or 41.0% lower than contribution margin of $10.4 million for 2005. The decrease in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to reduced sales of Hansen energy drinks and a reduction in gross margin as a result of increased costs of raw materials and production. Operating Income. Operating income was $158.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $55.2 million or 53.4% higher than operating income of $103.4 million for 44 the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in operating income was attributable to higher gross profit, which was offset by increased selling, distribution, general and administrative expenses. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 26.2% for 2006 from 29.6% for 2005. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increased general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales. Interest and Other Income, net . Net interest and other income was $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $2.3 million from net interest income of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in net interest and other income was primarily attributable to increased interest revenue earned on the Company invested cash balances which have increased significantly over the year. Provision for Income Taxes . Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $64.3 million as compared to provision for income taxes of $42.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2006 was 39.6%, which was lower than the effective tax rate of 40.1% for 2005. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to certain interest income earned on securities that are exempt from federal income taxes and certain federal tax credits relating to export sales, and to a lesser extent, a decrease in state taxes due to the apportionment of sales to various states outside of California which have lower state tax rates. This decrease was partially offset by stock-based compensation relating to incentive stock options for which we received no tax benefit. Net Income . Net income was $97.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $35.1 million or 56.0% higher than net income of $62.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in net income was attributable to the increase in gross profit of approximately $134.1 million and the increase in net interest income of approximately $2.3 million, which was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of approximately $79.0 million and an increase in provision for income taxes of approximately $22.3 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows provided by operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $135.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $76.4 million in the comparable period in 2006. For 2007, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $149.4 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses consisting of $10.2 million of share-based compensation and $2.1 million of depreciation and other amortization. In 2007, cash provided by operations also increased due to a $31.8 million increase in income taxes payable, a $22.4 million increase in accounts payable, a $19.1 million increase in deferred revenue and a $1.5 million increase in accrued compensation. In 2007, cash provided by operating activities was reduced due to a $29.5 million increase in tax benefit from exercise of stock options, a $26.7 million increase in accounts receivable, a $21.1 million increase in inventories, a $14.2 million increase in deferred income taxes, a $0.1 million decrease in accrued liabilities and a $3.2 million decrease in customer deposit liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable was attributable to increased sales volumes as well as to increased sales to certain classes of customers who have longer payment terms. The increase in inventory is attributable to the addition of new copackers and warehouses, the introduction of new products and planned inventory levels to meet consumer demand. Cash flows used in investing activities Net cash used in investing activities was $194.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $95.2 million used in investing activities in the comparable period in 2006. For 2007, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of short- and long-term investments, particularly available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investments. Cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to sales and maturities of held-to-maturity and available-for-sale investments. For both periods, cash used in investing activities included the acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles and other equipment to support our marketing and promotional activities, production equipment, computer and office furniture 45 and equipment used for sales and administrative activities, as wells as certain leasehold improvements. Management expects that it will continue to use a portion of its cash in excess of its requirements for operations, for purchasing short- and long-term investments and for other corporate purposes. Management, from time to time, considers the acquisition of capital equipment, specifically items of production equipment required to produce certain of our products, storage racks, vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other promotional equipment as well as the introduction of new product lines and businesses compatible with the image of the Company brands. At December 31, 2007, we had $12.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and $290.2 million in short- and long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. government agencies, municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds meeting certain criteria. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by U.S. sub-prime mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. These market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a negative adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Our short-term investments include variable rate demand notes. Although the underlying maturities of these securities are long-term in nature, the investments are classified as short-term because they contain a put feature which allows the holder to tender the securities at par on seven days notice. The put feature is supported by a letter of credit or standby purchase agreement provided by a highly-rated commercial bank. The notes are issued by municipalities and other tax-exempt entities and the interest rate payable on these investments resets on a weekly basis. All of our short-term investments are held by major financial institutions. Our long-term investments are comprised of auction rate securities. These notes carry a AAA credit rating and certain of the notes are additionally backed by various federal agencies and/or monoline insurance companies. Liquidity for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process which allows holders to sell their notes and resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7 to 35 days. In February 2008, a large portion of the auctions for these auction rate securities failed. There is no assurance that auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed. The auction failures appear to have been attributable to inadequate buyers and/or buying demand. In the event that there is a failed auction, the indenture governing the security generally requires the issuer to pay interest at a default rate that is above market rates for similar instruments. The securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the predetermined default rates and be auctioned every 7 to 35 days until the auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities, they mature or we are able to sell the securities to third parties. As a result, our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities in the near term may be limited. Consequently these securities have been classified as long term investments in our consolidated financial statements. However, we anticipate that due to the higher interest rates now payable on certain of these securities and for other reasons, the issuers will take steps to refinance their notes to enable them to call and repay the securities and therefore avoid the higher interest rates now payable on such securities. If the issuers of these auction rate securities are unable to refinance their debts and call the notes or successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate, we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments. We may be required to wait until market stability is restored for these instruments or until the final maturity of the underlying notes (up to 40 years) to realize our investments recorded value. (See also Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors- Our investments in marketable debt securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments and Part I, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks ). 46 Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $36.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $7.7 million for the comparable period in 2006. For 2007, cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to a $29.5 million tax benefit in connection with the exercise of certain stock options and proceeds of $8.2 million received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of certain stock options. Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment, acquisition of trademarks, payments of accounts payable and income taxes payable are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash. Debt and other obligations HBC has entered into a credit facility with Comerica Bank ( Comerica ) consisting of a revolving line of credit which was amended in May 2007. In accordance with the amended provisions of the credit facility, HBC increased its available borrowings under the revolving line of credit to $10.0 million of non-collateralized debt. The revolving line of credit is effective through June 1, 2008. Interest on borrowings under the line of credit is based on Comerica base (prime) rate minus up to 1.5%, or varying LIBOR rates up to 180 days, plus an additional percentage of up to 1.75%, depending upon certain financial ratios maintained by HBC. We had no outstanding borrowings on this line of credit at December 31, 2007. Letters of credit issued on behalf of the Company totaling $0.3 million under this credit facility were outstanding as of December 31, 2007. The terms of the Company line of credit contain certain financial covenants, including certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with its covenants at December 31, 2007. If any event of default shall occur for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary, Comerica may declare all or any portion outstanding on the line of credit immediately due and payable, exercise rights and remedies available to them, including instituting legal proceedings. Noncancelable contractual obligations include our obligations related to sponsorships and other commitments. (See also Part II, Item 8 - Note 9, Commitments & Contingencies ). Purchase commitments include obligations made by the Company and its subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the manufacturing and packaging of our products. These obligations vary in terms. The following represents a summary of the Company contractual obligations and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2007: Payments due by period (in thousands) Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Noncancelable Contracts $ 45,317 $ 26,052 $ 17,552 $ 1,713 $ - Capital Leases 663 663 - - - Operating Leases 23,482 3,338 8,024 4,533 7,587 Purchase Commitments 7,428 7,428 - - - $ 76,890 $ 37,481 $ 25,576 $ 6,246 $ 7,587 In addition to the above obligations, pursuant to a can supply agreement between the Company and Rexam Beverage Can Company ( Rexam ), dated as of January 1, 2006, the Company has undertaken to purchase a minimum volume of 24-ounce resealable aluminum beverage cans over the four-year period commencing from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2009. Should the Company fail to purchase the minimum volume, the Company will be obligated to reimburse Rexam for certain 47 capital reimbursements on a pro-rated basis. The Company maximum liability under this agreement is $6.0 million, subject to compliance by Rexam with a number of conditions under this agreement. Management believes that cash available from operations, including cash resources and the revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, debt servicing, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as any purchases of capital assets or equipment, through at least the next twelve months. Based on the Company current plans, at this time the Company estimates that capital expenditures are likely to be less than $10.0 million through December 2008. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate. In September 2007, we relocated our corporate offices to newly leased offices in Corona, California. In October 2006, we also entered into a lease agreement pursuant to which we leased 346,495 square feet of warehouse and distribution space located in Corona, California. This lease commitment provides for minimum rental payments for 120 months, commencing March 2007, excluding renewal options. The monthly rental payments are $167,586 at the commencement of the lease and increase over the lease term by 7.5% at the end of each 30 month period. The new warehouse and distribution space replaced our previous warehouse and distribution space also located in Corona, California. In October 2006, we entered into an agreement to acquire 1.8 acres of vacant land for a purchase price of $1.4 million. The property is located adjacent to the newly leased warehouse and distribution space. We are reviewing the feasibility of constructing a new office building on such land, which will replace our existing office space. We have sublet in excess of 50% of our previous office, warehouse and distribution space for the remainder of that lease term which expires in October 2010. Accounting Policies and Pronouncements Critical Accounting Policies The Company consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements, including various allowances and reserves for accounts receivable and inventories, the estimated lives of long-lived assets and trademarks, as well as claims and contingencies arising out of litigation or other transactions that occur in the normal course of business. The following summarizes the most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices of the Company: Accounts Receivable The Company evaluates the collectability of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware of a specific customer inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on the Company recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. The Company regularly reviews its inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the Company's estimated forecast of product demand, production availability and/or its ability to sell the product(s) concerned. Demand for the Company's products can fluctuate significantly. Factors that could affect demand for the Company's products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences, general market conditions or other factors that may result in 48 cancellations of advance orders or reductions in the rate of reorders placed by customers and/or continued weakening of economic conditions. Additionally, management's estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate, which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. Long-Lived Assets Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment of property and equipment or amortizable intangible assets, then management prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated at the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management estimates of the business risks. No impairments were identified as of December 31, 2007. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of its long lived assets, including its trademarks, is a critical accounting estimate because: (1) the estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to make assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as net income, could be material. Management assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgment because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so. Intangibles Intangibles are comprised primarily of trademarks that represent the Company exclusive ownership of the Hansen trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages, water, non-beverage products and the Monster Energy trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of supplements and beverages. The Company also owns in its own right, a number of other trademarks in the United States, as well as in a number of countries around the world. The Company also owns the Blue Sky trademark, which was acquired in September 2000, and the Junior Juice trademark, which was acquired in May 2001. During 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ( SFAS ) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . Under the provisions on SFAS No. 142, the Company discontinued amortization on indefinite-lived trademarks while continuing to amortize remaining trademarks over one to 25 years. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we evaluate our trademarks annually for impairment or earlier if there is an indication of impairment. If there is an indication of impairment of identified intangible assets not subject to amortization, management compares the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized to write down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is less than the carrying amount. The fair value is calculated using the income approach. However, preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management's best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. Based on management impairment analysis performed for the year ended December 31, 2007, the estimated fair values of trademarks exceeded the carrying value. In estimating future revenues, we use internal budgets. Internal budgets are developed based on recent revenue data and future marketing plans for existing product lines and planned timing of future introductions of new products and their impact on our future cash flows. Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions The accounts of the Company foreign subsidiary are translated in accordance with SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation . The Company has determined that the functional currency of its subsidiary should be its local 49 currency. The accounts of this foreign subsidiary have been translated into United States dollars using the current exchange rate at the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and at the average exchange rate for the period for revenues and expenses. Cumulative translation gains or losses are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in interest and other income, net, at the time they occur. Gains and losses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2007 were insignificant. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Generally, ownership of and title to the Company products passes to customers upon delivery of the products to customers. Certain of the Company distributors may also perform a separate function as a copacker on the Company behalf. In such cases, ownership of and title to the Company products that are copacked on the Company behalf by those copackers who are also distributors, passes to such distributors when the Company is notified by them that they have taken transfer or possession of the relevant portion of the Company finished goods. Net sales have been determined after deduction of promotional and other allowances in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue ( EITF ) No. 01-09, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor Products) . Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on the Company historical experience. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of the Company finished products and certain quality control costs. Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, ingredients and packaging materials. Operating Expenses Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, commissions, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees including legal fees, termination payments made to certain of the Company prior distributors, entertainment, insurance, postage, depreciation and other general and administrative costs. Stock-Based Compensation Beginning in fiscal year 2006, the Company accounts for share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of its stock options at the date of grant. The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. The Company employee stock options, however, have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options. For example, employee stock options are generally subject to vesting restrictions and are generally not transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected life of an option and the number of awards ultimately expected to vest. Changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option. Furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee. The Company uses historical data to estimate the expected price 50 volatility, the expected option life and the expected forfeiture rate. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option. If actual results are not consistent with the Company assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions, the Company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense or income tax expense, which could be material to its results of operations. Income Taxes Current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year. A deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The Company considers future taxable income and ongoing, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of its deferred tax assets. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized, the Company will reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value, thereby decreasing net income. Evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on the Company's judgment. If the Company subsequently determines that the deferred tax assets, which had been written down, would be realized in the future, the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased, thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made. Newly Issued Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements , which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The FASB has deferred the implementation of SFAS No. 157 by one year for certain non-financial assets and liabilities such that this will be effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of adopting SFAS No. 157 on its consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159), which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The provisions of SFAS No.159 are effective as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS No. 159 on its consolidated financial statements. Sales The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A unit case means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings) or concentrate sold that will yield 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage. Unit case volume of the Company means number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of beverages directly or indirectly sold by the Company. Sales of food bars and cereals, which have been discontinued and are not material, are expressed in actual cases. The Company quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. Because the primary historical market for Hansen products is California, which has a year-long temperate climate, the effect of seasonal fluctuations on quarterly results may have been mitigated; however, such fluctuations may be more pronounced as the distribution of Hansen products expands outside of California. The Company experience with its energy drink products, suggests that they are less seasonal than traditional beverages. As the percentage of the Company sales that are represented by such products continues to increase, 51 seasonal fluctuations will be further mitigated. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of the sales of its finished products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses.
