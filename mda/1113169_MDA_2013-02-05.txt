Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. GENERAL. Our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to individual and institutional investors in our U.S. sponsored mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios. The other managed investment portfolios include separately managed accounts, subadvised funds, and other sponsored investment portfolios including collective investment trusts, and Luxembourg-based funds offered to investors outside the U.S. and portfolios offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the U.S. Investment advisory clients outside the U.S. account for 9.5% of our assets under management at December 31, 2012 . We manage a broad range of U.S., international and global stock, bond, and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios, which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors. Investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management. Accordingly, fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management affect our revenues and results of operations. We remain debt-free with substantial liquidity and resources that allow us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities; invest in key capabilities, including investment professionals, technologies, and new fund offerings; and, most importantly, provide our clients with strong investment management expertise and service both now and in the future. Page 19 Table of Contents BACKGROUND. Major equity indexes produced strong returns in 2012 despite a eurozone recession, the sovereign debt crisis, muted U.S. economic growth, uncertainty surrounding U.S. fiscal policy after 2012, and a slowdown in emerging economies. Equities were supported by solid U.S. corporate earnings, and actions taken by central banks around the world to stimulate economic growth. During the year, the Federal Reserve kept the federal funds rate near 0% and implemented a third-round of quantitative easing in the form of an open-ended policy of monthly agency mortgage-backed securities purchases. Further, the Federal Reserve announced at its December meeting that it would add open-ended monthly purchases of long-term Treasury securities when its current maturity extension program for Treasuries ends in 2013. It also confirmed that it expects to keep the federal funds rate very low at least through mid-2015. As 2013 began, equity markets had positive momentum as U.S. Congress passed legislation on January 1st that delayed deep spending cuts for two months and prevented many broad-based tax increases. Results of several major equity market indexes for the full year 2012 are as follows: Index 2012 S&P 500 Index 16.0 % NASDAQ Composite Index (excluding dividends) 15.9 % Russell 2000 Index 16.4 % MSCI EAFE (Europe, Australasia, and Far East) Index 17.9 % MSCI Emerging Markets Index 18.6 % Bonds produced good returns over the year. High yield and emerging market issues outperformed all others as income-seeking investors continued favoring securities with attractive yields in the low interest rate environment. Outside the U.S., investors also sought bonds issued by developing countries due to their lower debt levels and better growth prospects relative to developed countries. Long-term Treasury bond yields were essentially flat for the year and remained near historic lows in response to weak global economic growth and the Federal Reserve's maturity extension program noted above. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury at December 31, 2012 , was 1.8% , compared with 1.9% at the end of 2011. Results of several major bond market indexes for the full year 2012 are as follows: Index 2012 Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index 4.2 % Credit Suisse High Yield Index 14.7 % Barclays Municipal Bond Index 6.8 % Barclays Global Aggregate Ex-U.S. Dollar Bond Index 4.1 % JPMorgan Emerging Markets Index Plus 18.0 % ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. With this market environment as a backdrop, investors entrusted $17.2 billion to our management in 2012 . Total assets under management ended 2012 at a record $576.8 billion , an increase of $87.3 billion from the end of 2011. Assets under management (in billions) at the end of and changes over each of the last three years are detailed below. Assets under management by investment portfolio December 31, 2010 2011 2012 Sponsored mutual funds distributed in the U.S. $ 282.6 $ 289.4 $ 346.9 Other investment portfolios 199.4 200.1 229.9 Total $ 482.0 $ 489.5 $ 576.8 Page 20 Table of Contents Assets under management by asset class December 31, 2010 2011 2012 Stock and blended asset $ 360.6 $ 352.4 $ 421.1 Fixed income portfolios 121.4 137.1 155.7 Total $ 482.0 $ 489.5 $ 576.8 Components of changes in assets under management Year ended 2010 2011 2012 Assets under management at beginning of year $ 391.3 $ 482.0 $ 489.5 Net cash flows Sponsored mutual funds distributed in the U.S. 13.6 11.0 15.7 Other investment portfolios 16.7 3.1 1.5 30.3 14.1 17.2 Net market gains (losses) and income 60.8 (5.8 ) 70.7 Mutual fund distributions not reinvested (.4 ) (.8 ) (.6 ) Change during the period 90.7 7.5 87.3 Assets under management at end of year $ 482.0 $ 489.5 $ 576.8 Our 2010 net cash inflows were sourced most significantly from third-party financial intermediaries and from institutional investors around the world, whereas net cash flows in 2011 and 2012 were sourced primarily from third-party financial intermediaries. Our relative investment performance over much of this period and brand awareness contributed significantly to attracting net inflows to our firm. We incur significant expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients. These efforts often involve costs that precede any future revenues that we may recognize from increases to our assets under management. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 2012 versus 2011 . Investment advisory revenues were up 10.3% , or $243.0 million , to nearly $2.6 billion in 2012 , as average assets under our management increase d $52.3 billion to $549.4 billion . The average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 47.2 basis points during 2012 , virtually unchanged from the 47.3 basis points earned in 2011 . We continued to voluntarily waive a portion of our money market advisory fees in 2012 in order to maintain a positive or zero yield for fund investors. These fees were waived from each of our money market funds and trusts and totaled $35.0 million , or about 1% of total investment advisory revenues earned in 2012 , as compared to $36.4 million in 2011 . Combined net assets at December 31, 2012 of the funds and trusts in which we waived fees in 2012 was $15.4 billion , or 2.7% of our total assets under management. The firm expects that these fee waivers will continue in 2013 . Net revenues increase d $275.4 million , or 10.0% , to $3.0 billion in 2012 . Operating expenses were $1.7 billion in 2012 , an increase of $138.0 million , or 9.1% . Overall, net operating income for 2012 increase d $137.4 million , or 11.2% , to nearly $1.4 billion . The increase in our average assets under management and resulting advisory revenue lift ed our operating margin for 2012 to 45.1% from 44.7% in 2011 . Non-operating investment income of $70.8 million in 2012 included $32.6 million, or $.07 per share after income taxes, in gains realized from the sale of certain of our investments in sponsored funds to seed other sponsored funds in support of our distribution efforts outside the U.S. Net income, including these realized gains, increase d $110.4 million , or 14.3% , to $883.6 million in 2012 , and our diluted earnings per share on our common stock increase d 15.1% to $3.36 from the $2.92 earned in 2011 . Page 21 Table of Contents Revenues Investment advisory revenues earned from the T. Rowe Price mutual funds distributed in the U.S. were $1.8 billion in 2012 , an increase of 11.4% , or $182.7 million , on higher average mutual fund assets. Average mutual fund assets in 2012 were $326.6 billion , an increase of 11.8% from the 2011 average. Mutual fund assets at December 31, 2012 , were $346.9 billion , up $57.5 billion from the end of 2011 . Net inflows to the mutual funds during 2012 were $15.7 billion , including $8.6 billion into our stock and blended asset funds and $7.5 billion into our bond funds. Our money market funds had net outflows of $.4 billion . Mutual fund net inflows include $6.4 billion that originated in our target-date retirement funds, which in turn invest in a broadly diversified portfolio of other Price funds, and automatically rebalance to maintain their specific asset allocation weightings. These fund net inflow amounts are presented net of $4.5 billion that was transferred to the other investment portfolios during the year. These transfers were primarily from our target-date retirement funds to our target-date retirement trusts. Market appreciation and income , net of distributions not reinvested, added $41.8 billion to our mutual fund assets under management in 2012 . Investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increase d $60.3 million , or 8.1% , to $801.7 million . Average assets in these portfolios were $222.8 billion during 2012 , an increase of $17.8 billion , or 8.7% , from the 2011 year. Ending assets at December 31, 2012 , were $229.9 billion , an increase of $29.8 billion from the end of 2011 . Net inflows into these portfolios in 2012 were $1.5 billion , including $4.5 billion that was transferred from the mutual funds. Strong cash inflows in 2012 into our subadvised funds from third-party intermediaries were offset by outflows from institutional investors outside the U.S. These net outflows were primarily from institutional separate account portfolios that have experienced investment performance challenges, or changes in the clients' investment objectives. Market appreciation and income increased assets under management in these portfolios by $28.3 billion . Administrative fees increase d $11.4 million to $332.6 million in 2012 . The increase is attributable to our mutual fund servicing activities and defined contribution recordkeeping services for the mutual funds and their investors. Changes in administrative fees are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors. Distribution and servicing fees earned from 12b-1 plans of the Advisor, R, and VIP II classes of our sponsored mutual funds were $96.1 million in 2012 , an increase of $21.5 million from 2011 . The increase includes $13.0 million recognized on greater assets under management in these share classes, and $8.5 million earned primarily on R class shares in the first quarter of 2012 for which the comparable 2011 fees were netted against related distribution and servicing costs. The 12b-1 fees earned are offset entirely by the cost paid to third-party intermediaries who source these assets. These costs are reported as distribution and servicing costs on the face of the consolidated statements of income. Operating expenses Compensation and related costs were $1.0 billion , an increase of $77.8 million , or 8.0% , compared to 2011 . The largest part of the increase is attributable to a $33.7 million increase in salaries and related benefits, which results from a modest increase in salaries at the beginning of 2012 combined with a 2.1% increase in our average staff size from 2011. The 2012 change also includes a $32.0 million increase in our annual variable compensation programs. The remainder of the change from 2011 is attributable to increased use of outside contractors to meet growing business demands, higher non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and other employee related costs. At December 31, 2012 , we employed 5,372 associates, an increase of 2.2% from the end of 2011 , to support both business growth and added capabilities. Advertising and promotion expenditures were $89.8 million in 2012 compared to $90.8 million in 2011 . We currently estimate that advertising and promotion expenditures for 2013 will be similar to 2012 levels. We vary our level of spending based on market conditions and investor demand as well as our efforts to expand our investor base globally. Distribution and servicing costs paid to third-party intermediaries who source assets into the Advisor, R, and VIP II classes of our sponsored mutual funds were $96.1 million in 2012 , an increase of $21.5 million from 2011 . The increase includes $13.0 million recognized on greater assets under management in these share classes, and $8.5 million incurred primarily on R class shares in the first quarter of 2012 for which the comparable 2011 costs were netted against related distribution and servicing fees. The costs are offset entirely by the 12b-1 fees we earn. These fees are reported as distribution and servicing fees on the face of the consolidated statements of income. Page 22 Table of Contents Occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increase d $18.6 million , or 9.9% , versus 2011 . The change includes the added costs incurred to expand our facilities around the world as well as update our technology capabilities, including related maintenance programs, to meet increasing business demands. Other operating expenses increase d $21.1 million , or 10.7% , from 2011 , including $16.4 million in certain third-party servicing costs incurred in 2012, for which the comparable 2011 costs were reported as reductions of advisory and administrative fee revenues. Non-operating investment income Our non-operating investment income, which includes interest income as well as the recognition of investment gains and losses, was up $47.1 million from the 2011 period. This increase includes $32.6 million in gains realized in the second half of 2012 from the sale of certain of our investments in sponsored funds to seed other sponsored funds in support of our distribution efforts outside the U.S. The balance of the change is primarily attributable to $8.4 million in higher net gains recognized on our cost-method investments and trading securities and $3.8 million in larger dividends earned on our mutual fund investments. Provision for income taxes Our effective tax rate for 2012 was 38.4% as compared to 38.2% in 2011 . The firm currently estimates its effective tax rate for 2013 will be about 38.5% . Our effective income tax rate reflects the relative contribution of pre-tax income generated by our non-U.S. subsidiaries that are subject to tax rates lower than our U.S. rates. Changes in the relative contribution of pre-tax income from U.S. and non-U.S. sources or changes in tax rates in relevant non-U.S. jurisdictions may affect our effective income tax rate and overall net income in the future. 2011 versus 2010 . Investment advisory revenues were up 15.9%, or $322.2 million, to $2.3 billion in 2011, as average assets under our management increased $74.5 billion to $497.1 billion. The average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 47.3 basis points during 2011 compared to 48.0 basis points earned in 2010. The decrease in our average annualized fee rate was primarily a result of the $11.3 million increase in money market management fees voluntarily waived by the firm in order to maintain a positive yield for fund investors. The firm waived $36.4 million in money market fees in 2011 compared to $25.1 million in 2010. Net revenues increased $379.9 million, or 16.0%, to $2.7 billion. Operating expenses were $1.5 billion in 2011, an increase of $189.5 million, or 14.2%. Overall, net operating income for 2011 increased $190.4 million, or 18.4%, to $1.2 billion. The increase in our average assets under management and resulting advisory revenue increased our operating margin for 2011 to 44.7% from 43.8% in 2010. Net income increased $101.0 million, or 15.0%, to $773.2 million from the 2010 period. Our diluted earnings per share on our common stock increased 15.4% to $2.92 from the $2.53 earned in 2010. Revenues Investment advisory revenues earned from the T. Rowe Price mutual funds distributed in the U.S. were $1.6 billion in 2011, an increase of 15.3%, or $213.3 million, on higher average mutual fund assets. Average mutual fund assets in 2011 were $292.1 billion, an increase of 16.5% from the 2010 average. Mutual fund assets at December 31, 2011, were $289.4 billion, up $6.8 billion from the end of 2010. Net inflows to the mutual funds during 2011 were $11.0 billion. These net inflows include $7.5 billion that originated in our target-date retirement funds, which in turn invest in a broadly diversified portfolio of other Price funds, and automatically rebalance to maintain their specific asset allocation weightings. Net cash inflows of $6.6 billion were added to our stock and blended asset funds, $3.9 billion to our bond funds, and $.5 billion were added to our money market funds. The Overseas Stock, International Stock, New America Growth, Emerging Markets Stock, and New Income funds each added more than $1.2 billion in net inflows for a combined total of $6.8 billion. Fund net inflow amounts in 2011 are presented net of $1.4 billion that was transferred to the other investment portfolios during the year. Market depreciation and income not reinvested lowered our mutual fund assets under management by $4.2 billion in 2011. Investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increased $108.9 million, or 17.2%, to $741.4 million. Average assets in these portfolios were $205.0 billion during 2011, an increase of $33.2 billion, or 19.3%, from the 2010 year. Ending assets at December 31, 2011, were $200.1 billion, an increase of $.7 billion from the end of 2010. Net inflows into these portfolios in 2011 were $3.1 billion. We experienced strong cash inflows into our subadvised funds from Page 23 Table of Contents third-party intermediaries, into our fixed income portfolios from institutional investors, and into our other sponsored portfolios during the year. These inflows were partially offset by outflows from our equity portfolios by a few institutional investors that were reducing risk in their portfolios in the wake of the volatile market environment experienced in 2011. Lower market valuations reduced assets under management in these portfolios by $2.4 billion. Administrative fees increased $26.9 million to $321.2 million in 2011. The increase is attributable to our mutual fund servicing activities and defined contribution recordkeeping services for the mutual funds and their investors. Changes in administrative fees are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors. Distribution and servicing fees earned from 12b-1 plans of the Advisor, R, and VIP II classes of our sponsored mutual funds were $74.6 million in 2011, an increase of $31.4 million from 2010. The increase includes $7.3 million recognized on greater assets under management in these share classes, and $24.1 million earned primarily on R class shares in the last nine months of 2011 for which the comparable 2010 fees were netted against related distribution and servicing costs. The 12b-1 fees earned are offset entirely by the cost paid to third-party intermediaries who source these assets. These costs are reported as distribution and servicing costs on the face of the consolidated income statements. Operating expenses Compensation and related costs were $969.8 million, an increase of $109.4 million, or 12.7%, compared to 2010. The largest part of the increase is attributable to a $46.9 million increase in salaries and related benefits, which results from a 5.6% annual increase in our average staff size. The 2011 change also includes a $36.4 million increase in our annual variable compensation programs. Greater use of outside contractors to meet growing business demands increased our 2011 costs by $11.2 million. The remainder of the change from 2010 is attributable to higher non-cash stock-based compensation expense and other employee related costs. At December 31, 2011, we employed 5,255 associates, an increase of 4.0% from the end of 2010, to support both business growth and added capabilities. Advertising and promotion expenditures were $90.8 million, up $3.9 million, or 4.5%, compared to 2010. We vary our level of spending based on market conditions and investor demand as well as our efforts to expand our investor base globally. Occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased $15.3 million, or 8.9%, versus 2010. The change includes the impact of placing our new technology support facility into service in February 2011, as well as the added costs to update our technology capabilities, including related maintenance programs, to meet increasing business demands. Other operating expenses increased $29.5 million, or 17.5%, from 2010. The charitable contribution made to the T. Rowe Price Foundation in 2011 was higher than in 2010, and we increased our spending on professional fees, information and other third-party services, and travel to meet increasing business demands. The increases in these costs were offset by the $16.4 million charge incurred in 2010 from the one-time contribution made to certain money market funds that did not reoccur in 2011. Non-operating investment income Our non-operating investment income, which includes interest income as well as the recognition of investment gains and losses, was down $9.8 million from the 2010 period. This decrease is primarily due to the 2010 period including $7.6 million in gains realized on the sale of certain mutual fund investments and $2.2 million recognized in early 2010 on the settlement and valuation of the forward contracts used to hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with our investment in UTI Asset Management Company Limited (UTI). The 2011 period includes $6.4 million in net earnings from our investment in UTI, an increase of $1.1 million over the earnings recognized in 2010. Provision for income taxes Our effective tax rate for 2011 is 38.2% as compared to 37.2% in 2010. The increase is primarily attributable to higher effective state tax rates as well as greater discrete tax benefits recognized in 2010 from the settlement of state income tax positions and the firm international reorganization. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY. During 2012 , stockholders equity increase d from $3.4 billion to $3.8 billion . In 2012 , we expended $135.2 million to repurchase 2.3 million common shares and paid $2.36 per share in dividends, including a $1.00 per share special dividend paid in December 2012, from existing cash balances and cash generated from operations. Tangible book value is $3.2 billion at Page 24 Table of Contents December 31, 2012 , and our cash and our fund investment holdings total $2.0 billion . Given the availability of these financial resources, we do not maintain an available external source of liquidity. At December 31, 2012 , we had outstanding commitments to make additional contributions totaling $36.5 million to various investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment. We presently anticipate funding 2013 property and equipment expenditures of about $125 million from our cash balances and operating cash inflows. 2012 versus 2011 . Operating activities during 2012 provided cash flows of $902.8 million , down $45.6 million from 2011 , due in part to the $92.7 million in net investments made by the consolidated sponsored funds we seeded during the first half of 2012 for which we have a controlling financial interest. Timing differences in the cash settlement of our accounts receivable and accrued revenues, payables and accrued liabilities, and other assets and liabilities decrease d our operating cash flows by $42.5 million compared to the 2011 year. The cash flows from operating activities in 2012 also includes a reduction for the $35.1 million in gains recognized on the sale of certain fund investments as the related cash flow activity is reflected in net cash used in investing activities. These operating cash flow decreases are offset by a $110.4 million increase in net income and increases in non-cash expenses for depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation, which are added back to net income to determine cash from operations. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $310.1 million , up $145.1 million from 2011 . We made $218.3 million more net investments in our sponsored funds during 2012 compared with 2011 . This increase was offset by greater net cash proceeds of $73.4 million in 2012 from the sale of more debt securities held by our savings bank subsidiary. Net cash used in financing activities was $611.5 million in 2012 , down $87.1 million from the comparable 2011 period. During 2011, we expended $344.5 million more for stock repurchases, including the repurchase of 6.4 million more shares than in 2012. This reduction in cash used was partially offset by the change in customer deposits at our savings bank subsidiary during 2012 compared to 2011 as well as a $285.5 million increase in dividends paid. The increase in dividends paid in 2012 is due to a $.03 increase in our quarterly per-share dividend and the payment of a $1.00 per share special dividend in December 2012. The balance of the decrease from 2011 in cash used is due to greater proceeds and tax benefits related to our stock-based compensation plans on increased exercise activity in late 2012. 2011 versus 2010 . Operating activities during 2011 provided cash flows of $948.4 million, up $215.6 million from 2010, including a $101.0 million increase in net income. The increase also includes an $81.7 million change in the timing differences in the cash settlement of our income taxes, accounts receivable and accrued revenues and payables, and accrued liabilities. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $165.0 million, down $111.9 million from the 2010 period. Cash flows in 2010 included $143.6 million in cash used to purchase our 26% equity interest in UTI. We spent $35.7 million less in property and equipment expenditures in 2011 compared to 2010 due to the construction of our technology support facility being substantially complete at the end of 2010. These reductions in cash used in 2011 were offset by an increase of $57.0 million in net investments made into our sponsored funds compared to the 2010 period. Net cash used in financing activities was $698.6 million in 2011, up $312.5 million from the 2010 period. We increased our stock repurchases by expending $239.7 million more in 2011 compared to the 2010 year. Dividends paid during 2011 increased $39.0 million from the 2010 period due primarily to a $.04 increase in our quarterly per-share dividend. The impact of dividends paid and stock repurchases was greater in 2011, as proceeds related to our stock-based compensation plans decreased $47.8 million on reduced exercise activity. Page 25 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. The following table presents a summary of our future obligations (in millions) under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at December 31, 2012 . Other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated, under certain conditions that may involve termination fees. Because these obligations are generally of a normal recurring nature, we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations. The information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2013 and future years. The information also excludes the $4.9 million of uncertain tax positions discussed in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements because it is not possible to estimate the time period in which a payment might be made to the tax authorities. Total 2013 2014-15 2016-17 Later Noncancelable operating leases $ 154 $ 31 $ 60 $ 45 $ 18 Other purchase commitments 127 89 34 4 Total $ 281 $ 120 $ 94 $ 49 $ 18 We also have outstanding commitments to fund additional contributions to investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment totaling $36.5 million at December 31, 2012 . CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. The preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives. Further, significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, the revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of income, and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements. Making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time. Accordingly, actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements, significant accounting policies, and notes. We present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2012 Annual Report. In the following discussion, we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements. Other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities . We generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored funds and the debt securities held for investment by our savings bank subsidiary as available-for-sale. At the end of each quarter, we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. We next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary. In determining whether a mutual fund holding is other-than-temporarily impaired, we consider many factors, including the duration of time it has existed, the severity of the impairment, any subsequent changes in value, and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value. Subject to the other considerations noted above, with respect to duration of time, we believe a fund holding with an unrealized loss that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarter-ends is generally presumed to have an other-than-temporary impairment. We may also recognize an other-than-temporary loss of less than six months in our consolidated statements of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a near-term recovery is possible. An impaired debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary is considered to have an other-than-temporary loss that we will recognize in our consolidated statements of income if the impairment is caused by a change in credit quality that affects our ability to recover our amortized cost or if we intend to sell the security or believe that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering cost. Minor impairments of 5% or less are generally considered temporary. Other-than-temporary impairments of equity method investments . We evaluate our equity method investments, including our investment in UTI, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value, and the decline in fair value is other than temporary. Page 26 Table of Contents Goodwill . We internally conduct, manage,and report our operations as one investment advisory business. We do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business. Accordingly, we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit our investment advisory business. We evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach. Goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business. Our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business (our market capitalization) exceeds our carrying amount (our stockholders equity) and, therefore, no impairment exists. Should we reach a different conclusion in the future, additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the non-cash impairment charge to be recognized. We must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred. The maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our consolidated balance sheets, $665.7 million . Stock options . We recognize stock option-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of income using a fair value based method. Fair value methods use a valuation model for shorter-term, market-traded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations, including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date, the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period, and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time. Our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted. Unlike most of our expenses, the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a non-cash charge that is never measured by, or adjusted based on, a cash outflow. Provision for income taxes . After compensation and related costs, our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense. We operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income, expenses, and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions. Accordingly, our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations. Annually, we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities. Each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations. From time to time, we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to, or in the process of, being audited by various tax authorities. Because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates, it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements. As a result, we recognize additions to, or reductions of, income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled. We recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined. NEWLY ISSUED BUT NOT YET ADOPTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. We have also considered all other newly issued accounting guidance that is applicable to our operations and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, including that which we have not yet adopted. We do not believe that any such guidance will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operation. FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION. From time to time, information or statements provided by or on behalf of T. Rowe Price, including those within this report, may contain certain forward-looking information, including information or anticipated information relating to: our revenues, net income, and earnings per share on common stock; changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management; our expense levels; our estimated effective income tax rate; and our expectations regarding financial markets, future transactions, dividends, investments, capital expenditures, and other conditions. Readers are cautioned that any forward-looking information provided by or on behalf of T. Rowe Price is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward-looking information because of various factors including, but not limited to, those discussed below and in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K Annual Report. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management. Such changes result from many factors including, among other things: cash inflows and outflows Page 27 Table of Contents in the T. Rowe Price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios, fluctuations in global financial markets that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management, our introduction of new mutual funds and investment portfolios, and changes in retirement savings trends relative to participant-directed investments and defined contribution plans. The ability to attract and retain investors assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence; the relative investment performance of the Price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios as compared to competing offerings and market indexes; the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels; competitive conditions in the mutual fund, asset management, and broader financial services sectors; and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business. Our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the Price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the Price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements. Non-operating investment income will also fluctuate primarily due to the size of our investments, changes in their market valuations, and any other-than-temporary impairments that may arise or, in the case of our equity method investments, our proportionate share of the investee net income. Our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: changes in the level of our advertising expenses in response to market conditions, including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the U.S. and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the U.S.; variations in the level of total compensation expense due to, among other things, bonuses, stock option and other equity grants, other incentive awards, changes in our employee count and mix, and competitive factors; any goodwill or other asset impairment that may arise; fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations; expenses and capital costs, such as technology assets, depreciation, amortization, and research and development, incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients; and disruptions of services, including those provided by third parties, such as facilities, communications, power, and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems. Our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation, and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax, and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results, including, but not limited to, effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in mutual funds and investing in general or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments.
