Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-looking statements This report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business or others on our behalf, our beliefs and our management assumptions. In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward-looking statements in press releases or written statements, or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls. Such words as expect, anticipate, outlook, could, target, project, intend, plan, believe, seek, estimate, should, may, assume and continue, as well as variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We describe our respective risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome or results of operations in Item 1A. Risk Factors. We have based our forward-looking statements on our management beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecast by our forward-looking statements. Reference is made in particular to forward-looking statements regarding product sales, regulatory activities, clinical trial results, reimbursement, expenses, earnings per share (EPS), liquidity and capital resources, trends and planned dividends and stock repurchases. Except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements after the distribution of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise. Overview The following management discussion and analysis (MD&A) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen business. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our results of operations discussed in MD&A are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Amgen is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics. This approach begins by using tools like advanced human genetics to unravel the complexities of disease and understand the fundamentals of human biology. Amgen focuses on areas of high unmet medical need and leverages its biologics manufacturing expertise to strive for solutions that improve health outcomes and dramatically improve people's lives. A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be the world's largest independent biotechnology company, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential. Amgen operates in one business segment: human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis. Our principal products include Neulasta , NEUPOGEN , ENBREL, Aranesp , EPOGEN , XGEVA , Prolia and Sensipar /Mimpara . For additional information about our products, see Item 1. Business Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products. Revenues increased 8% driven by strong performance across the portfolio. Product sales grew 10% in the United States and 8% in the rest of the world (ROW). We also continued paying quarterly dividends in 2013, and in December 2013, we declared a dividend of $0.61 per share of common stock payable in March 2014, representing a 30% increase over the quarterly dividend paid in each of the past four quarters. In addition to delivering strong operating results, we invested heavily in the business in 2013 and that is reflected in our pipeline advancements. We had positive readouts for evolocumab, talimogene laherparepvec and trebananib and also made progress on our biosimilars as we commenced pivotal trials for three of our six programs. We are now present in more than 75 countries including Japan, China and other emerging markets. This expansion was helped, in part, by our reacquiring rights to filgrastim and pegfilgrastim in Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa, effective January 1, 2014. Finally, we added Kyprolis to our marketed products portfolio through the acquisition of Onyx and in-licensed the U.S. commercial rights to ivabradine from Servier. We expect 2014 to be a data-rich year with various opportunities to continue growing our business. We believe the currently approved indications for XGEVA and Prolia represent significant commercial opportunities. Longer-term growth may also be achieved by the successful development of 10 innovative molecules in our later stage pipeline, including Kyprolis and evolocumab in both the United States and internationally. (See Item 1. Business Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates.) Additionally, longer-term growth may be achieved by continued expansion into emerging markets and through strategic business development opportunities. Our continued focus on increasing cost efficiencies will assist in providing the necessary resources to fund many of these future opportunities. 39 Our business will, however, continue to face various challenges. Certain of our products will face increasing competitive pressure as a result of competitive product launches. Additionally, certain of the existing patents on our principal products including NEUPOGEN , EPOGEN , Neulasta and Aranesp recently expired or will expire over the next few years, and we expect to face increasing competition from competitive products including biosimilars. For additional information, including information on the expiration of patents for various products, see Item 1. Business Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products Patents. Current global economic conditions also pose challenges to our business, including continued pressure to reduce healthcare expenditures. Efforts to reduce healthcare costs are being made by third-party payers including governments and private payers. In the United States, various actions have been taken aimed at reducing healthcare spending. The continuing prominence of U.S. budget deficits increases the risk that taxes, fees, rebates, or other federal measures that would further reduce our revenues or increase our expenses may be enacted. As a result of economic conditions, the industry continues to experience significant pricing pressures and other cost containment measures in certain European countries also. Our long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. The discovery and development of safe and effective new products, as well as the development of additional indications for existing products, are necessary for the continued strength of our business. We must develop new products over time in order to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity or competing products are launched, as well as in order to provide for revenue and earnings growth. We devote considerable resources to R&D activities. However, successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain. We are also confronted by increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy both before and after products launch. Finally, our product sales are subject to certain influences throughout the year, including wholesaler and end-user buying patterns (e.g., wholesaler and end-user stocking, contract-driven buying and patients delaying certain purchasing or physician visits). Such factors can result in higher demand for our products and/or higher wholesaler inventory levels and, therefore, higher product sales for a given three-month period, generally followed by a decline in product sales in the subsequent three-month period. For example, sales of certain of our products in the United States for the three months ended March 31 can be slightly lower relative to the immediately preceding three-month period. While this can result in variability in quarterly product sales on a sequential basis, these effects have generally not been significant when comparing product sales in the three months ended March 31 with product sales in the corresponding period of the prior year. See Item 1. Business Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products and Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the factors that could impact our future product sales. Selected financial information The following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per share data): 2013 Change 2012 Product sales: U.S. $ 14,045 10 % $ 12,815 ROW 4,147 8 % 3,824 Total product sales 18,192 9 % 16,639 Other revenues 484 (23 )% 626 Total revenues $ 18,676 8 % $ 17,265 Operating expenses $ 12,809 10 % $ 11,688 Operating income $ 5,867 5 % $ 5,577 Net income $ 5,081 17 % $ 4,345 Diluted EPS $ 6.64 20 % $ 5.52 Diluted shares 765 (3 )% 787 In the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to unit growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. The increase in U.S. product sales for 2013 reflects growth across the portfolio except for Aranesp , which declined 4%. The growth was driven primarily by increases in average net sales prices and, to a lesser extent, unit growth. The increase in ROW product sales for 2013 reflects growth for all of our marketed products except Aranesp , which declined 7%, and NEUPOGEN , which declined 9%. The ROW increase was driven by unit growth. 40 The decrease in other revenues for 2013 was due primarily to revenue recognized in the prior year related to changes in our motesanib collaboration with Takeda and milestone payments received in the prior year from AstraZeneca and Astellas Pharma Inc. The modification to the Takeda arrangement resulted in revenue recognition of $230 million in 2012 and resulted in Takeda receiving an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize motesanib. The increase in operating expenses for 2013 was driven primarily by R&D and Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) spending including the addition of Onyx effective October 1, 2013. The increase in net income for 2013 was due primarily to a lower effective income tax rate as well as higher Operating income. The increase in diluted EPS for 2013 was driven primarily by an increase in net income and, to a lesser extent, by the favorable impact of our stock repurchase program in 2012 and the first quarter of 2013, which reduced the number of shares used to compute diluted EPS. We did not repurchase any shares during the second, third or fourth quarters of 2013. Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material in 2013, 2012 or 2011. Results of Operations Product sales Worldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2013 Change 2012 Change 2011 Neulasta /NEUPOGEN $ 5,790 8 % $ 5,352 3 % $ 5,212 ENBREL 4,551 7 % 4,236 14 % 3,701 Aranesp 1,911 (6 )% 2,040 (11 )% 2,303 EPOGEN 1,953 1 % 1,941 (5 )% 2,040 XGEVA 1,019 36 % 748 * 351 Prolia 744 58 % 472 * 203 Sensipar /Mimpara 1,089 15 % 950 18 % 808 Other products 1,135 26 % 900 33 % 677 Total product sales $ 18,192 9 % $ 16,639 9 % $ 15,295 Total U.S. $ 14,045 10 % $ 12,815 9 % $ 11,725 Total ROW 4,147 8 % 3,824 7 % 3,570 Total product sales $ 18,192 9 % $ 16,639 9 % $ 15,295 * Change in excess of 100% Future sales of our products will depend, in part, on the factors discussed in the Overview, Item 1. Business Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products Competition, Item 1A. Risk Factors and any additional factors discussed in the individual product sections below. 41 Neulasta /NEUPOGEN Total Neulasta and total NEUPOGEN sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2013 Change 2012 Change 2011 Neulasta U.S. $ 3,499 9 % $ 3,207 7 % $ 3,006 Neulasta ROW 893 1 % 885 (6 )% 946 Total Neulasta 4,392 7 % 4,092 4 % 3,952 NEUPOGEN U.S. 1,169 16 % 1,007 5 % 959 NEUPOGEN ROW 229 (9 )% 253 (16 )% 301 Total NEUPOGEN 1,398 11 % 1,260 % 1,260 Total Neulasta /NEUPOGEN $ 5,790 8 % $ 5,352 3 % $ 5,212 The increase in global Neulasta sales for 2013 was driven by an increase in the average net sales price in the United States, offset partially by a decline in units. The increase in global NEUPOGEN sales for 2013 was driven by a $155-million order from the U.S. government. Excluding the special order, U.S. sales grew only 1% and global sales declined 1%. Units declined in 2013 in both the United States and ROW. The increase in U.S. Neulasta sales for 2012 was driven by an increase in the average net sales price. The decrease in ROW Neulasta sales for 2012 was due primarily to a decrease in unit demand from loss of share to biosimilars in Europe and a decrease in the average net sales price. The increase in U.S. NEUPOGEN sales for 2012 was driven by an increase in the average net sales price. The decrease in ROW NEUPOGEN sales for 2012 was driven by a decrease in unit demand from loss of share to biosimilars in Europe. Our material U.S. patents for filgrastim (NEUPOGEN ) expired in December 2013. We now face competition in the United States, which may have a material adverse impact over time on future sales of NEUPOGEN and, to a lesser extent, Neulasta . Our outstanding material U.S. patent for pegfilgrastim (Neulasta ) expires in 2015. Future Neulasta /NEUPOGEN sales will also depend, in part, on the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients. ENBREL Total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2013 Change 2012 Change 2011 ENBREL U.S. $ 4,256 7 % $ 3,967 15 % $ 3,458 ENBREL Canada 295 10 % 269 11 % 243 Total ENBREL $ 4,551 7 % $ 4,236 14 % $ 3,701 The increase in ENBREL sales for 2013 was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price offset partially by slight unit declines. The increase in ENBREL sales for 2012 was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price and, to a lesser extent, an increase in unit demand. ENBREL also faces increased competition. See Item 1. Business Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products Competition. Aranesp Total Aranesp sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2013 Change 2012 Change 2011 Aranesp U.S. $ 747 (4 )% $ 782 (21 )% $ 986 Aranesp ROW 1,164 (7 )% 1,258 (4 )% 1,317 Total Aranesp $ 1,911 (6 )% $ 2,040 (11 )% $ 2,303 42 The decreases in U.S. Aranesp sales for both 2013 and 2012 were driven by declines in unit demand. The unit declines reflect changes in practice patterns resulting from changes to the label and to the reimbursement environment that occurred during 2011. The decrease in ROW Aranesp sales for 2013 reflects unit declines and price pressure in Europe. In 2012, the ROW decline was driven by a decrease in the average net sales price. EPOGEN Total EPOGEN sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2013 Change 2012 Change 2011 EPOGEN U.S. $ 1,953 1 % $ 1,941 (5 )% $ 2,040 EPOGEN sales for 2013 increased by 1% due to unit growth. The decrease in EPOGEN sales for 2012 was driven by a 23% decrease in unit demand, driven by reductions in dose utilization due to changes to the label and to the reimbursement environment that occurred in 2011. This decrease was offset partially by reductions in customer discounts, as part of new provider contracts that became effective January 1, 2012, and by a year-over-year favorable change in accounting estimates of $96 million. Future EPOGEN sales will also depend, in part, on such factors as: response to changes in reimbursement including recent reduction to the ESRD payment bundle effective January 1, 2014; potential increased competition in the U.S. dialysis setting; and changes in dose utilization as healthcare providers continue to refine their treatment practices in accordance with approved labeling. See Item 1. Business Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products Competition. XGEVA and Prolia Total XGEVA and total Prolia sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2013 Change 2012 Change 2011 XGEVA U.S. $ 764 19 % $ 644 88 % $ 343 XGEVA ROW 255 * 104 * 8 Total XGEVA 1,019 36 % 748 * 351 Prolia U.S. 462 58 % 292 * 130 Prolia ROW 282 57 % 180 * 73 Total Prolia 744 58 % 472 * 203 Total XGEVA /Prolia $ 1,763 45 % $ 1,220 * $ 554 * Change in excess of 100% The increases in global XGEVA and Prolia sales for 2013 and 2012 were driven primarily by unit growth. Sequentially, global XGEVA and Prolia sales increased 10% and 33%, respectively, in the quarter ended December 31, 2013, compared with the quarter ended September 30, 2013. In 2013, XGEVA was launched in several additional countries including France and Spain and is now available in all major markets. XGEVA also faces increased competition. See Item 1. Business Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products Competition. 43 Sensipar /Mimpara Total Sensipar /Mimpara sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2013 Change 2012 Change 2011 Sensipar U.S. $ 757 18 % $ 639 23 % $ 518 Sensipar /Mimpara ROW 332 7 % 311 7 % 290 Total Sensipar /Mimpara $ 1,089 15 % $ 950 18 % $ 808 The increases in global Sensipar /Mimpara sales for 2013 and 2012 were driven primarily by unit growth and increases in the average net sales price in the United States. Other products Other product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2013 Change 2012 Change 2011 Vectibix U.S. $ 126 3 % $ 122 % $ 122 Vectibix ROW 263 11 % 237 19 % 200 Nplate U.S. 241 13 % 214 31 % 163 Nplate ROW 186 21 % 154 15 % 134 Kyprolis U.S. 71 N/A N/A Kyprolis ROW 2 N/A N/A Other ROW 246 42 % 173 * 58 Total other product sales $ 1,135 26 % $ 900 33 % $ 677 Total U.S. other products $ 438 30 % $ 336 18 % $ 285 Total ROW other products 697 24 % 564 44 % 392 Total other product sales $ 1,135 26 % $ 900 33 % $ 677 * Change in excess of 100% Operating expenses Operating expenses were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2013 Change 2012 Change 2011 Operating expenses: Cost of sales $ 3,346 5 % $ 3,199 18 % $ 2,708 % of product sales 18.4 % 19.2 % 17.7 % Research and development $ 4,083 21 % $ 3,380 7 % $ 3,167 % of product sales 22.4 % 20.3 % 20.7 % Selling, general and administrative $ 5,184 8 % $ 4,814 7 % $ 4,499 % of product sales 28.5 % 28.9 % 29.4 % Other $ 196 (34 )% $ 295 (67 )% $ 896 Cost of sales Cost of sales decreased to 18.4% of product sales for 2013, driven primarily by lower royalties and higher average net sales prices, offset partially by changes in product mix. The excise tax imposed by Puerto Rico on the gross intercompany purchase price of goods and services from our manufacturer in Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico excise tax) also slightly contributed to the decrease. The rate was 4.0% in 2011, 3.75% in 2012, 2.75% in the first half of 2013 and 4.0% effective July 1, 2013 through December 31, 2017. See Note 4, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Puerto Rico excise tax. Cost of sales increased to 19.2% of product sales for 2012, driven primarily by product mix and the Puerto Rico excise tax. 44 Excluding the impact of the excise tax, cost of sales would have been 16.4%, 17.2% and 16.3% of product sales for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Research and development R&D costs are expensed as incurred and include primarily salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; facilities and overhead costs; clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs; contract services and other outside costs; information systems costs and amortization of acquired technology used in R&D with alternative future uses. R&D expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with K-A and third-party R&D arrangements, including upfront fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies which had not reached technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use. Net payment or reimbursement of R&D costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. The Company groups all of its R&D activities and related expenditures into three categories: (1) Discovery Research and Translational Sciences, (2) later stage clinical programs and (3) marketed products. These categories include the Company R&D activities as set forth in the following table: Category Description Discovery Research and Translational Sciences R&D expenses incurred in activities substantially in support of early research through the completion of phase 1 clinical trials. These activities encompass our discovery research and translational sciences functions, including drug discovery, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism, and process development. Later stage clinical programs R&D expenses incurred in or related to phase 2 and phase 3 clinical programs intended to result in registration of a new product or a new indication for an existing product in the United States or the EU. Marketed products R&D expenses incurred in support of the Company marketed products that are authorized to be sold in the United States or the EU. Includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the United States or the EU has been obtained. R&D expense by category was as follows (in millions): 2013 2012 2011 Discovery Research and Translational Sciences $ 1,233 $ 1,137 $ 1,125 Later stage clinical programs 1,950 1,285 983 Marketed products 900 958 1,059 Total R&D expense $ 4,083 $ 3,380 $ 3,167 The increase in R&D expense for 2013 was driven primarily by an increase of $665 million in our later stage clinical programs, including evolocumab and Kyprolis ; and an increase of $96 million in Discovery Research and Translational Sciences activities, offset partially by reduced expenses associated with marketed product support of $58 million. The increase in R&D expense for 2012 was driven primarily by an increase of $302 million in our later stage clinical programs, including evolocumab and romosozumab; and an increase of $12 million in Discovery Research and Translational Sciences activities, offset partially by reduced expenses associated with marketed product support of $101 million. Selling, general and administrative SG&A expenses are comprised primarily of salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel; facilities and overhead costs; outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses; the annual U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee; and other general and administrative costs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. SG&A expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with marketing and promotion efforts under certain collaboration arrangements. Net payment or reimbursement of SG&A costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or when we become entitled to the cost recovery. The increase in SG&A expense for 2013 was driven primarily by the addition of Onyx of $276 million, of which $215 million was acquisition-related and does not have a continuing impact on the combined company operating results. Included in these costs are advisory, legal and regulatory costs, and compensation related payments. The compensation payments include cash 45 payments for accelerated vesting of equity awards as part of the acquisition that were previously granted under the Onyx equity award programs which would not have otherwise vested. SG&A also increased by $98 million related primarily to favorable changes in 2012 to the estimated U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee. The increase in SG&A expense for 2012 was driven primarily by higher ENBREL profit share expenses of $207 million as well as international expansion, offset partially by lower U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee expense of $106 million in 2012 compared with 2011, which includes a $61 million favorable adjustment related to the 2011 fee. Historically, under our ENBREL collaboration agreement, we paid Pfizer a percentage of annual gross profits on our ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada on a scale that increased with gross profits. The ENBREL co-promotion term expired on October 31, 2013, and we are now required to pay Pfizer residual royalties on a declining percentage of net ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada of 12% through October 31, 2014, 11% through October 31, 2015 and 10% through October 31, 2016. Other Other operating expenses for 2013 included $113 million of adjustments to our estimated contingent consideration liability related to the BioVex Group, Inc. (BioVex) business combination, certain charges related to our cost savings initiatives of $71 million, which includes severance expenses, and $12 million of other charges related primarily to legal proceedings. Other operating expenses for 2012 included charges of $175 million related to our cost savings initiatives, which includes severance and expenses associated with abandoning leased facilities, legal charges of $64 million and other operating expenses of $56 million, which includes adjustments to our estimated contingent consideration liability related to the BioVex business combination. Other operating expenses for 2011 included primarily a legal settlement charge of $780 million and charges related to cost savings initiatives, primarily severance, of $109 million. See Item 1. Government Regulation Other Regulation and Note 8, Other charges, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our legal settlement. Non-operating expenses/income and provision for income taxes Non-operating expenses/income and provisions for income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2013 2012 2011 Interest expense, net $ 1,022 $ 1,053 $ 610 Interest and other income, net $ 420 $ 485 $ 448 Provisions for income taxes $ 184 $ 664 $ 467 Effective tax rate 3.5 % 13.3 % 11.3 % Interest expense, net The decrease in interest expense, net in 2013 was due primarily to the decrease in non-cash interest resulting from the settlement of our 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes in February 2013 offset partially by increases resulting from the higher average balance of other outstanding debt and financing fees paid in association with the acquisition of Onyx. The increase in interest expense, net in 2012 was due primarily to a higher average debt balance. Interest and other income, net The decrease in interest and other income, net for 2013 was due primarily to lower net gains on sales of investments recognized in the current year. The increase in interest and other income, net for 2012 was due primarily to higher interest income due to a higher average balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities offset partially by lower yields and lower net gains realized on investments. Income taxes The decrease in our effective rate for 2013 was due primarily to three significant events occurring in 2013: (i) the acquisition of Onyx, which resulted in a tax benefit of $182 million ; (ii) the $187 million settlement of our examination with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009 in which we agreed to certain adjustments proposed by the IRS and remeasured our unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) accordingly; and (iii) the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit for 2012 and 2013. Because the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was not enacted until 2013, certain provisions of the Act benefiting the Company's 2012 federal taxes, including the retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit for 2012, were not 46 recognized in the Company's 2012 financial results and instead are reflected in the Company's 2013 financial results. The tax benefit of the retroactive extension of the 2012 R&D tax credit that was recognized in 2013 was $70 million. Additionally, our rate was further reduced by the indefinitely reinvested earnings of our foreign operations. The increase in our effective tax rate for 2012 was due primarily to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses and the exclusion of the federal R&D tax credit in 2012, offset partially by the favorable resolution of certain state tax matters related to prior years. The effective tax rates for 2013, 2012 and 2011 would have been approximately 9.2%, 18.7%, and 18.0%, respectively, without the impact of the tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax. As permitted under U.S. GAAP, we do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. See Summary of Critical Accounting Policies Income taxes and Note 4, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Selected financial data was as follows as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 (in millions): 2013 2012 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 19,401 $ 24,061 Restricted investments 3,412 Total cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted investments $ 22,813 $ 24,061 Total assets 66,125 54,298 Current portion of long-term debt 2,505 2,495 Long-term debt 29,623 24,034 Stockholders equity 22,096 19,060 The Company intends to continue to return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends, reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. Whether and when we declare dividends and the size of any dividend could be affected by a number of additional factors. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends). In April 2011, the Board of Directors approved a dividend policy related to our common stock and subsequently declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.28 per share of common stock during the second half of 2011. Subsequently, the Board of Directors declared a 29% increase in our quarterly cash dividends to $0.36 per share of common stock in 2012, and a 31% increase in our quarterly cash dividends to $0.47 per share of common stock in 2013. In December 2013, the Board of Directors declared a 30% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.61 per share of common stock, payable in March 2014. The Company has also returned capital to stockholders through its stock repurchase program. During 2011, 2012 and 2013, we spent $8.3 billion, $4.6 billion and $832 million, respectively, to repurchase shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2013, $1.6 billion remains available under the Board of Directors-approved stock repurchase program; however, we do not expect to make significant repurchases of our common stock during 2014 and 2015. In connection with the acquisition of Onyx in October 2013, we entered into a Repurchase Agreement and a Term Loan Credit Facility. See Note 2, Business combinations to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pursuant to the Repurchase Agreement, we sold 34,097 Class A preferred shares of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, ATL Holdings Limited, on September 30, 2013. We are obligated to repurchase the Class A preferred shares from the counterparties on or before September 28, 2018, for the aggregate sale price of $3.1 billion. Under the Repurchase Agreement, which is accounted for as long-term debt, we are obligated to make payments to the counterparties based on the sale price of the outstanding preferred shares at a floating interest rate of London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) plus 1.1%. The Repurchase Agreement contains customary events of default, and we have the right to repurchase all or a portion of the Class A preferred shares at any time prior to the required repurchase date. On October 1, 2013, we borrowed $5.0 billion under a Term Loan Credit Facility which bears interest at a floating rate based on LIBOR plus additional interest, initially 1%, which can vary based on the credit ratings assigned to our long-term debt by Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC (S&P) and Moody's Investor Service, Inc. (Moody's). A portion of the principal amount of this debt is to be repaid at the end of each quarter equal to 2.5% of the original amount of the loan, or $125 million, with the balance due on October 1, 2018. 47 In February 2013, our 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes matured/converted, and accordingly, the $2.5 billion principal amount was settled in cash. In addition, in May 2013, warrants to acquire 32 million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $104.80 originally sold in connection with the issuance of the 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes were exercised resulting in a net cash payment of $100 million. We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities, in each case for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our revolving credit agreement and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively referred to as U.S. funds ) are adequate to continue to meet our U.S. obligations (including our plans to pay dividends with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business. A significant portion of our operating cash flows is dependent on the timing of payments from our customers located in the United States and, to a lesser extent, our customers outside the United States, which include government-owned or -supported healthcare providers (government healthcare providers). Payments from these government healthcare providers are dependent in part on the economic stability and creditworthiness of their applicable country. Historically, some payments from a number of European government healthcare providers have extended beyond the contractual terms of sale, and regional economic uncertainty continues. In particular, credit and economic conditions in Southern Europe, particularly in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, continue to adversely impact the timing of collections of our trade receivables in this region. As of December 31, 2013 , accounts receivable in these four countries totaled $419 million, of which $301 million was past due. Although economic conditions in this region may continue to affect the average length of time it takes to collect payments, to date we have not incurred any significant losses related to these receivables; and the timing of payments in these countries has not had nor is it currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our overall operating cash flows. However, if government funding for healthcare were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse adjustments to past payment practices were to occur, we might not be able to collect the entire balance of these receivables. We will continue working closely with these customers, monitoring the economic situation and taking appropriate actions as necessary. Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted investments Of our total cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted investment balances totaling approximately $22.8 billion as of December 31, 2013 , approximately $20.9 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits debt security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer. Financing arrangements The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2013 , were $ 2.5 billion and $ 29.6 billion, respectively. The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2012 , were $ 2.5 billion and $ 24.0 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2013, S&P, Moody's and Fitch, Inc. assigned credit ratings to our outstanding senior notes of A with a stable outlook, Baa1 with a negative outlook and BBB with a negative outlook, respectively, which are considered investment grade. Unfavorable changes to these ratings may have an adverse impact on future financings and would affect the interest rate paid under our Term Loan Credit Facility. We issued long-term debt during the three years ended December 31, 2013 , including $8.1 billion, $5.0 billion, and $10.5 billion aggregate principal amounts in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We repaid debt of $3.4 billion, $123 million, and $2.5 billion during the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011, respectively. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap contracts qualified and were designated as fair value hedges. In 2013, we entered into interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $4.4 billion. In addition, we previously had interest rate swap contracts on debt with an aggregate face value of $3.6 billion which, due to historically low interest rates, were terminated in May 48 2012. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest rate swap contracts. To hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros/pounds sterling to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , we had cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $2.7 billion. See Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our cross-currency swap contracts. As of December 31, 2013 , we have a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working capital needs. At December 31, 2013 and 2012 , we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. In December 2011, we entered into a $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $500 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank which is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. This term may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.1% based on our current credit rating. Generally, we would be charged interest at LIBOR plus 0.9% for any amounts borrowed under this facility. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , no amounts were outstanding under this facility. In March 2011, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC which allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depository shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires in March 2014 and is expected to be renewed before its expiration date. In 1997, we established a $400 million medium-term note program under which medium-term debt securities may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , no securities were outstanding under this medium-term note program. Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement and Term Loan Credit Facility each includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of December 31, 2013 . See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our financing arrangements. Cash flows A summary of our cash flow activity was as follows (in millions): 2013 2012 2011 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 6,291 $ 5,882 $ 5,119 Net cash used in investing activities (8,469 ) (9,990 ) (786 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 2,726 419 (674 ) Operating Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2013 due primarily to the 2012 impacts of the payment associated with a previously disclosed litigation settlement and higher payments to taxing authorities, offset partially by cash receipts in 2012 of $397 million in connection with the termination of interest rate swap agreements and $197 million received under a government-funded program in Spain with regard to trade receivables. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2012 compared with 2011 due primarily to the timing and amount of receipts from customers, timing of payments to vendors and taxing authorities, cash received in connection with the termination of our interest rate swap agreements discussed above and the impact of decreased inventory-related expenditures. These increases were offset partially by a payment associated with the previously disclosed litigation settlement. 49 Investing Capital expenditures, which were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Ireland and Puerto Rico, as well as other site developments, totaled $ 693 million, $ 689 million and $ 567 million in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. We currently estimate 2014 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $800 million. Cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, also included the cost of acquiring certain businesses, net of cash acquired, which totaled $ 9.4 billion , $ 2.4 billion and $ 701 million , respectively. Net sales of marketable securities were $ 2.2 billion for 2013 , compared to net purchases of $ 6.9 billion for 2012 and net sales of $ 437 million for 2011 . Financing Cash provided by financing activities during 2013 was due to net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $ 8.1 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Company's equity award programs of $ 296 million . These receipts were offset partially by the repayment of long-term debt of $ 3.4 billion , the payment of dividends of $ 1.4 billion , and repurchases of our common stock of $ 832 million . Cash provided by financing activities during 2012 was due to net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $ 4.9 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Company's equity award programs of $ 1.3 billion , offset partially by repurchases of common stock of $ 4.6 billion and the payment of dividends of $ 1.1 billion . Cash used in financing activities during 2011 was due to the repurchases of our common stock of $8.3 billion; repayment of long-term debt of $2.5 billion; and payment of dividends of $500 million, offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $10.4 billion. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 15, Stockholders equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. The following table represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013 , aggregated by type (in millions): Payments due by period Year Years Years Years Contractual obligations Total 1 2 and 3 4 and 5 6 and beyond Long-term debt obligations (1) (2) (3) (4) $ 50,245 $ 3,625 $ 5,007 $ 12,412 $ 29,201 Operating lease obligations 905 140 239 181 345 Purchase obligations (5) 2,249 895 450 245 659 UTBs (6) Total contractual obligations $ 53,399 $ 4,660 $ 5,696 $ 12,838 $ 30,205 (1) Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments which are included in our financing arrangements at the fixed contractual coupon rates. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2013, in computing net amounts to be paid or received under our interest rate swap contracts which resulted in an aggregate net increase in future interest payments of $68 million. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest swap contracts. 50 (2) Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments under our Master Repurchase Agreement and Term Loan at LIBOR-based variable rates of interest. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2013, in computing interest payments on these debt obligations. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these debt obligations. (3) Long-term debt obligations include contractual interest payments and principal repayment of our debt obligations. In order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our pound sterling and euro denominated long-term debt issued in 2012 and 2011, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts that effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment on this debt from pounds sterling/euros to U.S. dollars. For purposes of this table, we used the contracted exchange rates in the cross-currency swap contracts to compute the net amounts of future interest payments and principal repayments on this debt. See Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our cross-currency swap contracts. (4) Interest payments and the repayment of principal on our 4.375% 2018 euro Notes were translated into U.S. dollars at the foreign currency exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2013. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our long-term debt obligations. (5) Purchase obligations relate primarily to (i) our long-term supply agreements with third-party manufacturers, which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity; (ii) R&D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (iii) capital expenditures; and (iv) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. (6) Liabilities for UTBs (net of foreign tax credits and federal tax benefit of state taxes) and related accrued interest and penalties totaling approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2013 , are not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities. In addition to amounts in the table above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts, which in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred or assumed in the acquisitions of BioVex and Onyx. These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above, and, except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2013 , the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is approximately $3.3 billion, including $875 million of contingent consideration payments in connection with the acquisitions of BioVex and Onyx. See Note 2, Business combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 51 Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Product sales and sales deductions Revenues from sales of our products are recognized when the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, cash discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions ) and returns, which are established at the time of sale. We analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions): Rebates Chargebacks Other deductions Total Balance as of January 1, 2011 $ 844 $ 173 $ 127 $ 1,144 Amounts charged against product sales 1,795 2,626 670 5,091 Payments (1,592 ) (2,600 ) (717 ) (4,909 ) Balance as of December 31, 2011 1,047 199 80 1,326 Amounts charged against product sales 1,480 2,709 659 4,848 Payments (1,680 ) (2,741 ) (624 ) (5,045 ) Balance as of December 31, 2012 847 167 115 1,129 Amounts charged against product sales 1,784 3,008 669 5,461 Payments (1,736 ) (2,924 ) (682 ) (5,342 ) Balance as of December 31, 2013 $ 895 $ 251 $ 102 $ 1,248 For the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , total sales deductions were 23%, 23% and 25% of gross product sales, respectively. Included in these amounts are immaterial adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. Such amounts represent 3% or less of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales in each of the three years ended December 31, 2013 . In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in the EU are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the product is sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales deductions and returns. Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold. Rebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which vary by product, by payer and individual payer plans. As we sell product, we estimate the amount of rebate that will be paid by us based on the product sold, contractual terms, estimated patient population, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels and accrue these rebates in the period the related sale is recorded. We then adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect actual claims experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part, due to the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability, which can take more than one year. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. For example, we had managed Medicaid rebate adjustments of $164 million in 2013. Including this adjustment, changes in annual estimates related to prior annual periods were less than 10% of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, and less than 5% for the year ended December 31, 2011. A 10% change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebates recognized 52 in 2013 would have had an impact of approximately $180 million, or approximately 1% of our 2013 product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity. Wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase price and the contractual price between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers, and we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks. Product returns Returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. In each of the last three years, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior year sales return provisions have historically been insignificant. Income taxes The Company provides for income taxes based on pretax income, applicable tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense. Certain items are included in the Company's tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements and cause temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amount. Such temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which the Company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either: (i) tax expenses recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred; (ii) expenses for which the Company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized the expense in the financial statements; or (iii) liabilities for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible assets acquired in many business combinations, as future expenses associated with these assets most often will not be tax deductible. The Company is a vertically integrated enterprise with operations in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company is subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdictions where it conducts activities based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and the functions, risks and activities performed therein. The Company pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, the Company conducts significant operations outside the United States in Puerto Rico pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet its worldwide product demand. Income from the Company operations in Puerto Rico is subject to a tax incentive grant that expires in 2020. Our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Substantially all of this benefit is attributable to the Company foreign income associated with the Company operations conducted in Puerto Rico. If future events, including material changes in cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, under current tax laws an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable income tax rates which could have a material adverse effect on both our future effective tax rate and our financial results. 53 Our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors The adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability. Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, governmental investigations and class action suits which are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinations We have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPR&D product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in a business combination. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to: determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date; projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates; estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows. Significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the acquisition date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of various contingent consideration obligations incurred or assumed in the acquisitions of businesses (see Note 2, Business combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements) were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included, but were not limited to, the probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations. We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates. Impairment of long-lived assets We review the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment and our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset's fair value and its carrying value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, composed of IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination which have not reached technological feasibility, are reviewed annually for impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 54 carrying amount may not be recoverable. We determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference and its carrying value is reduced accordingly. Estimating future cash flows of an IPR&D product candidate for purposes of an impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of costs to complete the project and the amount, timing and probability of achieving revenues from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project was determined, as described above. There are often major risks and uncertainties associated with IPR&D projects as we are required to obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to market these products. Such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&D project may vary from its estimated fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPR&D impairment charges may occur in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We believe our estimations of future cash flows used for assessing impairment of long-lived assets are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments.
