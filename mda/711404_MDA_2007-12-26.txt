Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Note numbers refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We discuss below the results of our operations for fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 and the results of our operations for fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. We began recording share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2006 using the modified prospective transition method whereby prior periods are not restated and do not include such expense. We acquired Ocular on January 6, 2005, and include Ocular in our results from that date. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. We discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under Capital Resources and Liquidity. Outlook We believe that CVI will continue to compete successfully in the worldwide contact lens market with its disposable spherical, PC Technology and specialty contact lenses. In the U.S., market demographics are favorable, as the teenage population, the age when most contact lens wear begins, is projected to grow considerably over the next two decades. The reported incidence of myopia continues to increase worldwide. CVI expects greater market penetration in Europe and Asia as practitioners increasingly prescribe more specialty lenses. We are in the process of developing and launching a number of new contact lens products that we believe will result in CVI continuing to have a broad and competitive product line. New products planned for introduction over the next two years include lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials and new lens designs, including multifocal lenses. Contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials have grown significantly, and this material is a major product material in the industry. The Company has launched Biofinity , a silicone hydrogel contact lens product, with sales in Europe, the United States and Australia. While initial customer reaction from Biofinity has been favorable, our future growth may be limited by several critical factors relating to silicone hydrogel materials. We face normal challenges associated with manufacturing a new material on a new manufacturing platform and are incurring additional manufacturing costs as we attempt to ramp up production volumes and improve efficiencies. We believe that our ability to succeed with silicone hydrogel products will be an important factor affecting future levels of sales growth and profitability. During fiscal 2007, we were engaged in litigation with regard to our silicone hydrogel product and certain lens design patents. In November 2007, we reached a global settlement agreement with CIBA Vision, the eye care unit of Novartis AG, that resolves all disputes with respect to current patent infringement litigation between the companies. Under the terms of the settlement, the companies have agreed to cross license rights to these patents, and CVI agreed to pay a royalty on its future net U.S. contact lens sales of Biofinity until 2014 and on net sales outside of the United States until 2016. Our operating results reflect the progression through our integration plan that is designed to optimize operational synergies of our acquisition of Ocular. Integration activities began in January 2005 and are 41 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) expected to continue through mid calendar year 2008 and include integrating duplicate facilities and expanding utilization of preferred manufacturing and distribution practices. Our geographic mix of income changed during 2007, and certain expenses associated with the integration plan impacted jurisdictions with lower tax rates. As a result, our effective tax rate has increased correspondingly. CSI has built an extensive product portfolio through acquisition and internal development, and we anticipate that CSI will continue to consolidate the women healthcare market. CSI expects to benefit from favorable demographic trends as the women of the baby-boomer generation are now reaching the age when gynecological procedures that utilize CSI products are performed most frequently. In November 2006, CSI expanded its hospital market presence by acquiring Lone Star, a manufacturer of medical devices that improve the management of the surgical site and are used in a wide variety of surgical procedures. The acquisition of Lone Star complements CSI expansion into surgical products that began in November 2005 with the acquisition of NeoSurg Technologies, Inc. (NeoSurg), a manufacturer of a patented combination reusable and disposable trocar access system used in laparoscopic surgery, and Inlet Medical, Inc. (Inlet), a manufacturer of trocar closure systems and pelvic floor reconstruction procedure kits. Regarding capital resources, we believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand of $3.2 million plus cash from operating activities and existing credit facilities will fund future operations, capital expenditures, cash dividends and smaller acquisitions. We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2008 of approximately $160 $180 million, primarily to expand silicone hydrogel and single-use lens manufacturing capacity, complete the consolidation of distribution centers and for information technology. 2007 Compared with 2006 Highlights: 2007 vs. 2006 Net sales up 11% to $950.6 million from $859.0 million in fiscal year 2006. Gross profit down 1%; gross margin decreased to 55% of net sales including production start-up costs and integration and restructuring items, from 61%. Operating income down 59% to $45.9 million from $112.9 million. Operating margin at 5% of net sales including integration and restructuring items. We recorded tax expense of $11.9 million for fiscal year 2007 compared to $7.1 million for fiscal year 2006. Diluted loss per share 25 cents down from earnings per share of $1.44. Results for 2007 include $15.9 million of share-based compensation expenses, $7.2 million write-off of acquired in-process research and development, $34.4 million of production start up costs, $13.4 million of distribution rationalization costs, $52.8 million of other restructuring and integration costs, $10.4 million of intellectual property and securities litigation costs and $0.9 million write-off of the debt issuance costs of our amended and restated credit agreement. Results from 2006 included $66.3 million of similar items. 42 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Selected Statistical Information Percentage of Net Sales and Growth Years Ended October 31, 2007 % Growth 2006 % Growth 2005 Net sales 100% 11% 100% 6% 100% Cost of sales 45% 29% 39% 7% 38% Gross profit 55% (1% ) 61% 6% 62% Selling, general and administrative expense 43% 14% 42% 20% 37% Research and development expense 4% 15% 4% (19% ) 5% Restructuring costs 1% 52% 1% (25% ) 1% Amortization of intangibles 2% 13% 1% 22% 2% Operating income 5% (59% ) 13% (17% ) 17% Net Sales Cooper two business units, CVI and CSI generate all its sales. CVI develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of soft contact lenses for the worldwide vision care market. CSI develops, manufactures and markets medical devices, diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories used primarily by gynecologists and obstetricians. Our consolidated net sales grew by 11% in 2007 and 6% in 2006. CVI achieved 8% net sales growth primarily on growth of disposable lenses, including single-use lenses, and the launch of a silicone hydrogel lens. CSI achieved 24% net sales growth in 2007 driven by acquisitions and organic growth. Net Sales Growth ($ in millions) 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Business unit CVI $ 61.7 8% $ 36.2 5% CSI $ 30.0 24% $ 16.1 15% CVI Net Sales Practitioner and patient preferences in the worldwide contact lens market continue to change. The major shifts are from: Conventional lenses replaced annually to disposable and frequently replaced lenses. Disposable lenses are designed for either daily, two-week or monthly replacement; frequently replaced lenses are designed for replacement after one to three months. Commodity lenses to specialty lenses including toric, multifocal and cosmetic lenses. Commodity spherical lenses to value-added spherical lenses such as continuous wear lenses and lenses to alleviate dry eye symptoms as well as lenses with aspherical optical properties or higher oxygen permeable lenses such as silicone hydrogels. 43 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) These shifts generally favor CVI core product lines of specialty lenses, PC Technology brand spherical lenses, silicone hydrogel spherical lenses and single-use spherical lenses, 70% of CVI worldwide business. Additionally, it is important that CVI develop a range of silicone hydrogel products. CVI has launched Biofinity , its silicone hydrogel lens, with sales in Europe, the United States and Australia and is in the process of expanding its manufacturing capacity to grow sales. CVI anticipates launching a second silicone hydrogel spherical lens in April/May 2008 and commencing the marketing of a silicone hydrogel toric lens at the end of calendar 2008. In addition to CVI silicone hydrogel lens, during 2007 CVI introduced these new products: Biomedics EP , a multifocal lens for emerging presbyopes. Proclear 1 Day, a single-use spherical lens. Proclear toric multifocal, a lens designed to address both astigmatism and presbyopia. Definitions: Contact lens revenue includes sales of conventional, disposable, long-term extended wear lenses and single-use spherical lenses, some of which are aspherically designed, and specialty lenses - toric lenses, cosmetic lenses and multifocal lenses. Aspheric lenses correct for near- and farsightedness and have additional optical properties that help improve visual acuity in low light conditions and can correct low levels of astigmatism and low levels of presbyopia, an age-related vision defect. Toric lens designs correct astigmatism by adding the additional optical properties of cylinder and axis, which correct for irregularities in the shape of the cornea. Cosmetic lenses are opaque and color enhancing lenses that alter the natural appearance of the eye. Multifocal lens designs correct presbyopia. Proclear lenses, manufactured using proprietary phosphorylcholine (PC) Technology , help enhance tissue/device compatibility and offer improved lens comfort. CVI Net Sales by Market ($ in millions) 2007 2006 Growth Americas $ 360.5 $ 351.9 2% Europe 306.4 273.3 12% Asia Pacific 129.0 109.0 18% $ 795.9 $ 734.2 8% CVI worldwide net sales grew 8%, 5% in constant currency. Americas sales grew 2%, the same in constant currency, primarily due to market gains of multifocal and daily disposable lenses offset by the continued market shift in favor of silicone hydrogel products. European sales grew 12%, 3% in constant currency, driven by significant increases in sales of disposable toric and disposable sphere products. Sales to the Asia Pacific region grew 18%, the same in constant currency, primarily due to significant sales growth of single-use and other sphere products and disposable toric products. 44 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Net sales growth includes increases in single-use spheres up 29%, at $113.7 million, all disposable spheres up 10% and total spheres up 8%. Biofinity , CVI silicone hydrogel spherical lens, had sales of $9.8 million primarily in Europe and the United States. Disposable toric sales grew 13% with total toric sales up 8% and disposable multifocal sales up 25%. CVI line of specialty lenses grew 10%. Cosmetic lenses grew 5%, and older conventional lens products declined 13%. Proclear products continued global market share gains as Proclear toric sales increased 47% to $51.9 million, Proclear spheres, including Biomedics XC and Proclear 1 Day, increased 22% to $102.5 million and Proclear multifocal lenses, including Biomedics XC , increased 52% to $31.8 million. CVI sales growth is driven primarily through increases in the volume of lenses sold as the market continues to move to more frequent replacement. While unit growth and product mix have influenced CVI sales growth, average realized prices by product have not materially influenced sales growth. CSI Net Sales CSI net sales increased 24% to $154.8 million with organic sales growth of about 9%. Sales of products marketed directly to hospitals grew 51% and now represent 27% of CSI sales. Women healthcare products used primarily by obstetricians and gynecologists generate more than 94% of CSI sales. The balance are sales of medical devices outside of women healthcare which CSI does not actively market. CSI acquisitions during the year did not significantly affect Cooper consolidated results of operations. While unit growth and product mix have influenced organic sales growth, average realized prices by product have not materially influenced organic sales growth. 2006 Compared with 2005 Highlights: Fiscal Year 2006 vs. Fiscal Year 2005 Net sales up 6% to $859 million. Gross profit up 6%; gross margin decreased to 61% of net sales including integration and restructuring items. Operating income down 17% to $112.9 million. Operating margin at 13% of net sales including integration and restructuring items. Effective tax rate (provision for income taxes divided by income before income taxes) down to 9.7% from 15.4%. Diluted earnings per share down 29% to $1.44 from $2.04, with a 3% increase in the number of dilutive shares. Results for 2006 include $13.6 million of stock option expenses, $8.9 million in losses and costs associated with phasing out corneal health products and the write-off of associated unrealizable net assets, $7.5 million write-off of acquired in-process research and development, $6.7 million of production start up costs, $10.1 million of distribution rationalization costs, $12.1 million of other restructuring and integration costs, $3.3 million of intellectual property and securities litigation costs and $4.1 million write-off of the debt issuance costs of our amended and restated credit agreement. 45 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Selected Statistical Information Percentage of Net Sales and Growth Years Ended October 31, 2006 % Growth 2005 % Growth 2004 Net sales 100% 6% 100% 65% 100% Cost of sales 39% 7% 38% 77% 36% Gross profit 61% 6% 62% 58% 64% Selling, general and administrative expense 42% 20% 37% 55% 39% Research and development expense 4% (19% ) 5% 560% 1% Restructuring costs 1% (25% ) 1% Amortization of intangibles 1% 22% 2% 470% Operating income 13% (17% ) 17% 17% 24% Our consolidated net sales grew by 6% in 2006 and 65% in 2005. CVI achieved 5% net sales growth primarily due to the January 6, 2005 acquisition of Ocular. CSI achieved 15% net sales growth in 2006, driven by acquisitions and organic growth. Net Sales Growth ($ in millions) 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Business unit CVI $36.2 5% $ 309.3 80% CSI $ 16.1 15% $ 7.2 7% CSI Net Sales Women healthcare products used primarily in obstetricians and gynecologists practices generate over 90% of CSI revenue. The balance are sales of medical devices outside of women healthcare where CSI does not actively market. CSI 2006 sales increased 15%, 6% on an organic basis, to $124.8 million, $16.1 million above 2005. Sales growth was primarily due to Inlet products, acquired on November 1, 2005. While unit growth and product mix influenced organic revenue growth, average realized prices by product did not materially influence such growth. Results of operations of acquired companies are included in our consolidated results beginning on the acquisition date. CVI Net Sales by Market ($ in millions) 2006 2005 Growth Americas $ 351.9 $ 343.0 3% Europe 273.3 250.1 9% Asia Pacific 109.0 104.9 4% $ 734.2 $ 698.0 5% CVI worldwide net sales grew 5%, 7% in constant currency. Americas sales grew 3%, 2% in constant currency. European sales grew 9%, 12% in constant currency. Sales to the Asia Pacific region grew 4%, 10% in constant currency. 46 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) CVI Net Sales Net sales growth includes increases in disposable toric sales up 16%, single-use spheres up 21%, disposable multifocals up 31% and total toric sales up 11%. CVI core product lines grew 11% and Proclear products, including Biomedics XC , grew 29%. Proclear toric sales grew 42%, Proclear spheres up 15% and Proclear multifocal lenses up 101%. Total sphere sales excluding single-use lenses declined 3% with total sphere sales up 2%. Single-use sales growth remained below expectations due largely to slower than anticipated acceptance of new products and delays in our transition to the new strip-blister packaging configuration. A majority of our lines have now been converted, and we expect all lines to be converted by February 2007. Sales growth is driven primarily through increases in the volume of lenses sold as the market continues to move to more frequent replacement. While unit growth and product mix influenced sales growth, average realized prices by product did not materially influence sales growth. CVI results include Ocular beginning on January 6, 2005, when Cooper acquired Ocular. To present CVI organic growth, this paragraph discusses reported sales adjusted by adding Ocular net sales of $51.6 million for November 1, 2004, through January 5, 2005, when Cooper did not own Ocular, to CVI reported net sales of $697.9 million for Cooper fiscal 2005. As so adjusted, organic net sales declined 2%, 1% in constant currency. Americas sales declined 2%, 3% in constant currency, European sales grew 2%, 5% in constant currency, and Asia Pacific sales declined 9%, 4% in constant currency. CVI core product lines grew 5% with single-use lens growth of 3%. Disposable lens sales were flat with disposable toric sales up 11%, disposable multifocal lens sales up 25% and disposable spheres declining 6%. CVI New Products and Markets During calendar 2006 CVI introduced these new products: Biofinity silicone hydrogel monthly sphere in a limited launch in the United States and selected markets in Asia Pacific. Biomedics XC disposable sphere, a two-week aspheric lens featuring Proclear technology, in the United States, Europe and selected markets in Asia Pacific. A second base curve of Proclear toric, effectively doubling the number of Proclear parameters available for astigmatic patients. Single-use sphere in new strip-blister packaging. Single-use toric in Japan. Aspheric, two-week, 55% water content sphere in Japan. Biomedics EP , a multifocal specifically designed for emerging presbyopic patients. 47 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2007 Compared to 2006 and 2006 Compared to 2005 Cost of Sales/Gross Profit Gross Profit Percentage of Net Sales 2007 2006 2005 CVI 54% 62% 62% CSI 59% 58% 57% Consolidated 55% 61% 62% CVI margin was 54% in fiscal 2007 compared with 62% in fiscal 2006, as a result of the cost of integration activities and manufacturing inefficiencies related to new products and changing product mix that impacted cost of sales. The changing product mix included a shift to lower margin sphere products, including single-use spheres that represented 14% of lens sales in fiscal 2007 compared to 12% in fiscal 2006. CVI fiscal 2007 cost of sales includes share-based compensation expense, production start-up costs for our new silicone hydrogel products and the write off of manufacturing assets associated with Ocular integration activities. These costs amounted to $71.4 million or 9% of sales in the period. For 2006, cost of sales included share-based compensation expense, integration costs, production start up costs for our new silicone hydrogel products and profits and losses associated with product lines being phased out, which were about 2% of sales in the period. Manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the ramp up of new products and plant realignment activities are expected to significantly decline in 2008. CSI margin improved to 59% in fiscal 2007 compared with 58% in fiscal 2006. Gross margin reflects continuing efficiencies associated with recent acquisitions. Selling, General and Administrative Expense (SGA) (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 CVI $ 322.0 $ 284.3 $ 243.0 CSI 54.5 44.7 37.9 Headquarters 31.5 28.8 17.1 $ 408.0 $ 357.8 $ 298.0 Consolidated SGA increased by 14% in 2007, 20% in 2006 and 56% in 2005. As a percentage of net sales, consolidated SGA increased to 43% in fiscal 2007 from 42% in 2006 and 37% in 2005. The increase in SGA is primarily due to costs supporting increased sales levels as well as integration costs, including the rationalization of distribution centers, lenses used in marketing programs and litigation costs. CVI SGA increased 13% in 2007, primarily due to costs related to the rationalization of distribution centers, lenses used in marketing programs and intellectual property litigation; and 17% in 2006, primarily due to share-based compensation expenses, integration costs and intellectual property litigation costs. SGA as a percentage of net sales increased to 40% in 2007 from 39% in 2006 and 35% in 2005. 48 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) CSI 2007 SGA increased 22% over 2006, which supported the 24% increase in sales, and 2006 SGA increased 18% over 2005. Selling and marketing costs increased to support organic sales growth and integration costs contributed to the increase partially offset by a $3.2 million gain on the sale of a cardiovascular cryosurgery product line not related to women healthcare. Corporate headquarters SGA, which increased 9% to $31.5 million in 2007 and 64% to $28.8 million in 2006, were 3% of consolidated net sales in both periods. The growth in 2007 was primarily due to share-based compensation expense. The growth in 2006 was primarily due to share-based compensation and securities litigation expense. The growth since 2005 includes added costs due to the Ocular acquisition, continued expenses for projects and staff to maintain the Company global trading arrangement and costs to comply with corporate governance requirements. Research and Development Expense Research and development (R&D) expense grew 15% over 2006 and was 4% of sales in both periods and 5% of sales in 2005: $39.9 million in 2007, $34.5 million in 2006 and $42.9 million in 2005. R&D expense included acquired in-process research and development of $7.2 million in 2007 and $7.5 million in 2006 for CSI, and $20.0 million in 2005 for CVI. CVI research and development expenditures were $27.6 million, up 17% in 2007, and $23.5 million in 2006, up 19% net of acquired in-process R&D in 2005. CVI research and development activities include programs to develop disposable silicone hydrogel products and product lines utilizing PC Technology . CSI research and development expenditures were $5.1 million, up 45% in 2007, and $3.5 million, up 13% over 2005, net of acquired in-process R&D. CSI research and development activities were for newly acquired laparoscopic surgical devices and the upgrade and redesign of many CSI osteoporosis, in-vitro fertilization, incontinence and assisted reproductive technology products and other obstetrical and gynecological product development activities. Restructuring Expense Restructuring expenses were $9.7 million in 2007, including $9.2 million related to the integration of Ocular and $0.5 million related to CSI integration activities; $6.4 million in 2006, including expenses of CVI related to the integration of Ocular and the phase out of corneal health product lines, and $8.5 million in 2005, resulting from the integration of Ocular with CVI and CSI integration activities. In connection with the January 6, 2005, acquisition of Ocular, CVI has progressed through our integration plan, optimizing operational synergies of the combined companies. As of October 31, 2007, we have recorded $47.2 million for integration activities that included integrating duplicate facilities and expanding utilization of preferred manufacturing and distribution practices. We estimate that the total restructuring costs under this integration plan will be approximately $50 million, of which approximately $25 $30 million are cash related and will be reported as charges to cost of sales or restructuring costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 3. Acquisition and Restructuring Costs. 49 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Amortization of Intangibles Amortization of intangibles was $16.2 million in 2007, $14.3 million in 2006 and $11.7 million in 2005. Amortization expense increased in both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 primarily due to acquired intangible assets, including the addition of $130 million of other intangible assets from Ocular in fiscal 2005. Operating Income Operating income declined $89.9 million, or 66%, between 2005 and 2007. Years Ended October 31, ($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005 CVI $ 57.2 $ 126.6 $ 135.5 CSI 20.1 15.1 17.4 Headquarters (31.4 ) (28.8 ) (17.1 ) $ 45.9 $ 112.9 $ 135.8 Percent (decline) growth (59% ) (17% ) 17% Interest Expense Interest expense increased 14% to $42.7 million in 2007, 26% to $37.3 million in 2006 and 395% to $29.7 million in 2005. The increases in interest expense are primarily due to higher average debt balances to support capital investments and acquisitions including the acquisition of Ocular in fiscal 2005. We had $717.0 million in loans on our credit facility on October 31, 2007, compared to $605.3 million outstanding on October 31, 2006. On January 31, 2007, Cooper refinanced its existing $750 million syndicated bank credit facility, which consisted of a $250 million term loan and a $500 million revolving credit facility, with a new $650 million syndicated Senior Unsecured Revolving Line of Credit (Revolver) and $350 million aggregate principal amount 7.125% Senior Notes. The refinancing extended the maturity and provided additional borrowing flexibility along with lower overall pricing relative to the prior agreement. In addition, the Company has the ability from time to time to increase the size of the Revolver by up to an additional $250 million. KeyBank led the Revolver refinancing, which resulted in a number of the banks retaining or increasing their participation in the agreement. The Revolver matures on January 31, 2012. Interest rates for the Revolver are based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus additional basis points determined by certain ratios of debt to pro forma earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), as defined in the credit agreement. These range from 75 to 150 basis points. As of October 31, 2007, the additional basis points were 125. 50 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Other (Expense) Income, Net Years Ended October 31, (In thousands) 2007 2006 2005 Interest income $ 474 $ 386 $ 1,002 Foreign exchange loss (3,047 ) (1,417 ) (376 ) Gain on derivative instruments 1,945 Other income (expense) 74 (1,201 ) (223 ) $ (2,499 ) $ (2,232 ) $ 2,348 In fiscal 2007, we recognized a net loss of about $3.0 million primarily related to the British pound and Euro strengthening against the U.S. dollar. Provision for Income Taxes We recorded tax expense of $11.9 million for fiscal year 2007 compared to $7.1 million for fiscal year 2006. Our geographic mix of income changed during 2007, and certain expenses associated with the Ocular integration plan have impacted jurisdictions with lower tax rates; resulting in net operating losses in jurisdictions with lower tax rates and net operating income in jurisdictions with higher tax rates. Share-Based Compensation Plans Effective November 1, 2005, the Company began recording compensation expense associated with stock options and other forms of equity compensation in accordance with Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (Revised), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R). Prior to November 1, 2005, the Company accounted for stock options according to the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25), and related interpretations, and, therefore, no related compensation expense was recorded for awards granted with no intrinsic value. The Company adopted the modified prospective transition method provided for under SFAS 123R and, consequently, has not retroactively adjusted results from prior periods. Under this transition method, compensation cost associated with stock options recognized in fiscal 2006 includes: 1) amortization related to the remaining unvested portion of all stock option awards granted prior to November 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123; Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS 123) and 2) amortization related to all stock option awards granted on or subsequent to November 1, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. 51 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The compensation and related income tax benefit recognized in the Company consolidated financial statements for stock options and restricted stock awards were as follows: October 31, (In millions) 2007 2006 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 12.9 $ 13.2 Cost of products sold 1.5 0.7 Research and development expense 0.7 0.3 Restructuring expense 0.8 Capitalized in inventory 1.8 0.5 Total compensation $ 17.7 $ 14.7 Related income tax benefit $ 4.3 $ 3.2 Cash received from options exercised under all share-based payment arrangements for fiscal years 2007 and 2006 was $9.3 million and $3.0 million, respectively. The Company continues to estimate the fair value of each share-based award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. Previously, under SFAS 123, the Company did not utilize separate employee groupings in the determination of option values. The Company now estimates option forfeitures based on historical data for each employee grouping and adjusts the rate to expected forfeitures periodically. The adjustment of the forfeiture rate resulted in a $1.9 million reduction in share-based compensation expense in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2007. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 2007 Highlights Operating cash flow $134.0 million, down 11%. Paid acquisition costs of $81.0 million. Expenditures for purchases of property, plant and equipment $183.6 million vs. $142.7 million in 2006. Comparative Statistics Years Ended October 31, ($ in millions) 2007 2006 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3.2 $ 8.2 Total assets $ 2,560.3 $ 2,352.6 Working capital $ 231.0 $ 180.3 Total debt $ 876.6 $ 742.7 Stockholders equity $ 1,423.6 $ 1,378.5 Ratio of debt to equity 0.62:1 0.54:1 Debt as a percentage of total capitalization 38% 35% 52 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Operating Cash Flows Cash flow provided from operating activities continued as Cooper major source of liquidity, totaling $134.0 million in fiscal 2007 and $150.5 million in 2006. Operating cash flow decreased as we have utilized cash to build inventory in support of new product launches, for costs associated with our Ocular integration plan and for the reduction of accounts payable. Working capital increased $50.7 million in fiscal 2007 due to increases of $17.9 million in receivables, $31.4 million in inventory, $12.5 million in prepaid and other current assets, $3.7 million in deferred tax assets and decreases of $14.9 million in short-term debt and $4.7 million in accounts payable. This activity was partially offset as cash decreased $5.0 million and accrued liabilities increased $29.4 million. The significant increase in working capital is primarily due to the refinancing of Cooper credit facility, which reduced the current portion of debt, along with building inventory in support of new product launches, distribution center consolidations and increasing sales levels. In addition, CSI acquisitions of Lone Star and Wallach increased net working capital and were funded with long-term debt. At the end of fiscal 2007, Cooper inventory months on hand (MOH) were 5.9 compared to 8.0 at fiscal year-end 2006. However, our adjusted MOH is 7.4, net of $27.3 million of charges to costs of sales recorded in our fiscal fourth quarter 2007 associated with our Ocular integration plan, as we continue to build inventory in support of new product launches and distribution center consolidations. Also, our days sales outstanding (DSO) decreased to 60 days from 63 days at October 31, 2006. Based on our experience and knowledge of our customers and our analysis of inventoried products and product levels, we believe that our accounts receivable and inventories are recoverable. Investing Cash Flows The cash outflow of $264.6 million from investing activities was driven by payments of $81.0 million for acquisitions and capital expenditures of $183.6 million, used primarily to expand manufacturing capacity, consolidate distribution centers and continue the rollout of new information systems. Financing Cash Flows The cash inflow of $125.1 million from financing activities was driven by net proceeds from long-term debt of $110.8 million, net proceeds from short-term debt of $20.8 million and $9.3 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by payment of debt acquisition costs of $13.3 million and dividends on our common stock of $2.7 million paid in the first and third quarters of 2007. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS None. 53 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS As of October 31, 2007, we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments Due by Period (In millions) 2008 2009 & 2010 2011 & 2012 2013 & Beyond Contractual obligations: Long-term debt $ $ $ 367.0 $ 463.1 Interest payments on long-term debt 47.6 97.1 85.8 65.4 Operating leases 24.0 40.7 29.3 43.2 Total contractual obligations 71.6 137.8 482.1 571.7 Commercial commitments: Stand-by letters of credit 0.2 Total $ 71.8 $ 137.8 $ 482.1 $ 571.7 The expected future benefit payments for pension plans through 2017 are disclosed in Note 11. Employee Benefits. Risk Management Most of our operations outside the United States have their local currency as their functional currency. We are exposed to risks caused by changes in foreign exchange, principally our pound sterling, Euro, Canadian dollar and Japanese Yen denominated debt and receivables, and from operations in foreign currencies. We have taken steps to minimize our balance sheet exposure. We are also exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates, as the interest rate on our Revolver under our new credit facility varies with the London Interbank Offered Rate. Our significant increase in debt following the acquisition of Ocular has significantly increased the risk associated with changes in interest rates. We have decreased this interest rate risk by hedging approximately $275 million of variable rate debt effectively converting it to fixed rate debt for periods of 23 months to 48 months. See Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. On January 31, 2007, Cooper refinanced its existing $750 million syndicated bank credit facility, which consisted of a $250 million term loan and a $500 million revolving credit facility, with a new $650 million syndicated Senior Unsecured Revolving Line of Credit (Revolver) and $350 million aggregate principal amount of 7.125% of Senior Notes. The refinancing extended the maturity and provided additional borrowing flexibility along with lower overall pricing relative to prior agreement. In addition, the Company has the ability from time to time to increase the size of the Revolver by up to an additional $250 million. KeyBank led the Revolver refinancing, which resulted in a number of the banks retaining or increasing their participation in the agreement. The Revolver matures on January 31, 2012. See Note 7. Debt. Outlook We believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand of $3.2 million plus cash generated by operating activities and borrowing capacity under our existing credit facilities will fund future operations, capital 54 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) expenditures, cash dividends and smaller acquisitions. At October 31, 2007, we had $282.8 million available under our $650 million syndicated bank credit facility. Inflation and Changing Prices Inflation has had no appreciable effect on our operations in the last three fiscal years. New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). In SAB 108, the SEC staff established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on each of the company financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures. SAB 108 permits public companies to initially apply its provisions either by (i) restating prior financial statements or (ii) recording the cumulative effect as adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings. The Company implemented SAB 108 during fiscal 2007, and it did not have a significant impact on the Company results of operations or financial condition. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact SFAS 157, which is effective for the Company beginning in our fiscal year ending October 31, 2009, will have on its consolidated financial statements. In October 2007, the Company adopted SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 158, the Company accounted for its defined benefit postretirement plan under SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS 87). SFAS 87 required that a liability (minimum pension liability) be recorded when the accumulated benefit obligation liability exceeded the fair value of plan assets. The adjustment to initially apply SFAS 158 was approximately $1.5 million net of tax benefit of about $1.0 million, and was recorded as a non-cash charge to accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Under SFAS 87, changes in the funded status were disclosed but not immediately recognized; rather they were deferred and recognized ratably over future periods. In addition, SFAS 158 requires that the postretirement plan assets and obligations be measured as of the end of our fiscal year. We plan to adopt the measurement provisions of SFAS 158 in our fiscal year ending October 31, 2009, and are currently evaluating the impact of this provision of SFAS 158 on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 11. Employee Benefits. 55 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 provides the option to measure, at fair value, eligible financial instrument items, which are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value. The irrevocable decision to measure items at fair value is made at specified election dates on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Changes in that instrument fair value must be recognized in current earnings in subsequent reporting periods. If elected, the first measurement to fair value is reported as a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earning in the year of adoption. SFAS 159 also establishes additional disclosure requirements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements of the adoption of SFAS 159, if we elect to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value. This statement is effective for the Company beginning in our fiscal year ending October 31, 2009. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48) . FIN 48 applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to Statement SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). Under FIN 48, a company would recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. FIN 48 clarifies how a company would measure the income tax benefits from the tax position that are recognized, provides guidance as to the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and describes the methods for classifying and disclosing the liabilities within the financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits. FIN 48 also addresses when a company should record interest and penalties related to tax positions and how the interest and penalties may be classified within the income statement and presented in the balance sheet. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. For the Company, FIN 48 will be effective for our fiscal year ending October 31, 2008. Differences between the amounts recognized prior to and after the adoption of FIN 48 would be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings. Based on a preliminary analysis, management believes that adoption of FIN 48 will result in recording an increase to retained earnings of between $5 million and $6 million in the fiscal first quarter of 2008. However, the final analysis will be completed in the fiscal first quarter of 2008. Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies Management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). We believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods. Revenue recognition We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned, based on terms of sale with the customer, where persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, delivery has occurred, the seller price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. For 56 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) contact lenses as well as CSI medical devices, diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories, this primarily occurs upon product shipment, when risk of ownership transfers to our customers. We believe our revenue recognition policies are appropriate in all circumstances, and that our policies are reflective of our customer arrangements. We record, based on historical statistics, estimated reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs offered including cash discounts, promotional and advertising allowances, volume discounts, contractual pricing allowances, rebates and specifically established customer product return programs. While estimates are involved, historically, most of these programs have not been major factors in our business, since a high percentage of our revenue is from direct sales to doctors. The Company records taxes collected from customers on a net basis, as these taxes are not included in revenue. Allowance for doubtful accounts Our reported balance of accounts receivable, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, represents our estimate of the amount that ultimately will be realized in cash. We review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis, using historical payment trends and the age of the receivables and knowledge of our individual customers. When our analyses indicate, we increase or decrease our allowance accordingly. However, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, additional allowances may be required. While estimates are involved, bad debts historically have not been a significant factor given the diversity of our customer base, well established historical payment patterns and the fact that patients require satisfaction of healthcare needs in both strong and weak economies. Net realizable value of inventory In assessing the value of inventories, we must make estimates and judgments regarding aging of inventories and other relevant issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products and estimated prices at which those products will sell. On an ongoing basis, we review the carrying value of our inventory, measuring number of months on hand and other indications of salability, and reduce the value of inventory if there are indications that the carrying value is greater than market. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. While estimates are involved, historically, obsolescence has not been a significant factor due to long product dating and lengthy product life cycles. We target to keep, on average, about seven months of inventory on hand to maintain high customer service levels given the complexity of our specialty lens product portfolio. Valuation of goodwill We account for goodwill and evaluate our goodwill balances and test them for impairment in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142). We no longer amortize goodwill. The SFAS 142 goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. Initially, we compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill assigned to it. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. The valuation of each of our reporting units is determined using a combination of discounted cash flows, an income valuation approach, and the guideline company method, a market valuation approach. When available and as appropriate, we use comparative market multiples to corroborate fair value results. A reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment. 57 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Our reporting units are the same as our business segments CVI and CSI reflecting the way that we manage our business. We test goodwill for impairment annually during the fiscal third quarter and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist. We performed an impairment test in our fiscal third quarter 2007, and our analysis indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill. Business combinations We routinely consummate business combinations. We allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on our estimates and judgments of the fair value of net assets purchased, acquisition costs incurred and intangibles other than goodwill. On individually significant acquisitions, we utilize independent valuation experts to provide a basis in order to refine the purchase price allocation, if appropriate. Results of operations for acquired companies are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. Income taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for tax losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact, if any, of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets. To the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction, a valuation allowance is established. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. Frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates. To determine the quarterly tax rate, we are required to estimate full-year income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction. We update the estimated effective tax rate for the effect of significant unusual items as they are identified. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre-tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate, and such changes could be material. Share-Based Compensation Effective November 1, 2005, we adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R) as interpreted by SEC SAB No. 107, using the modified prospective transition method. Prior periods have not been restated. See Note 10. Stock Plans for a further description of the impact of the adoption of SFAS 123R and the Company share-based compensation plans. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating Cooper stock price volatility, employee stock option exercise behaviors and employee option forfeiture rates. 58 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The expected life of the share-based awards is based on the observed and expected time to post-vesting forfeiture and/or exercise. Groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected volatility is based on implied volatility from publicly-traded options on the Company stock at the date of grant, historical implied volatility of the Company publicly-traded options, historical volatility and other factors. The risk-free interest rate is based on the continuous rates provided by the U.S. Treasury with a term equal to the expected life of the award. The dividend yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share, divided by the stock price at the date of grant. As share-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. SFAS 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience. If factors change and the Company employs different assumptions in the application of SFAS 123R, the compensation expense that it records in future periods may differ significantly from what it has recorded in the current period. In 2005, prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company valued its share-based compensation using the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25) , and related interpretations. 59 Table of Contents
