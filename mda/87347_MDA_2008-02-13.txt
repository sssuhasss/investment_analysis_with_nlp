Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and resources. Such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Report. Executive Overview Oil markets exhibited considerable variation in 2007. The OPEC production cuts of November 2006 that provoked the recovery in the price per barrel entering the winter period in the Northern Hemisphere were overweighed by mild early winter weather conditions that lead to WTI (West Texas Intermediate) falling to the year low of $50.50-per-barrel by mid-January. However, price for WTI ending the year within striking distance of $100-per-barrel. Market fundamentals supported this upwards trend as evidenced by the need for an OPEC production increase in September and by the reduction in the days of forward cover of OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) oil stocks which had fallen below 53 days by the end of year. Spare production margins remained narrow, driven by geopolitical events and inherent production decline, while non-OPEC production levels continued to be revised downwards as project delays added further uncertainty to performance. In natural gas markets, the weak prices seen at the beginning of 2007 strengthened significantly as colder weather drove demand in North America. The region gas supply results from four separate components that include domestic production, LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) imports, Canadian exports to the US, and US exports to Mexico. Changes in any of these affect overall supply and during the year higher production and higher imports, particularly of LNG, led to above-average levels of natural-gas storage in the US with consequent weaker commodity pricing later in the year. Maintaining the production base for both oil and natural gas continues to face challenges. In both cases, the aging of reservoirs that have been in production for many decades gives rise to increasing production decline rates that require constant stemming, while weak reserves replacement ratios and heightened resource nationalism dictate that exploration for new hydrocarbon deposits in increasingly more remote areas and complex geologies must increase. Within this context, Schlumberger revenue in 2007 grew by 21%, driven by strong demand for oilfield services, particularly overseas. Year-on-year growth rates reached 31% in Middle East & Asia, 30% in Europe/CIS/Africa and 29% in Latin America. In North America however, revenue was essentially flat relative to 2006. All Oilfield Services Technologies showed double-digit improvement, with Drilling & Measurements, Well Testing and Integrated Project Management recording the highest overall growth rates year-on-year. The business pattern that emerged in 2007 with significant differences in growth inside and outside North America marked a change in the oil and gas industry growth cycle. There were two reasons for this. North American activity is largely driven by natural gas exploration and production and the number of active drilling rigs proved sufficient to maintain satisfactory levels of production at least in the short term. In addition, the strong international growth was mainly directed to oil and primarily land-based as the available offshore rig fleet reached full utilization particularly in deep water. New Schlumberger products and services contributed to growth in 2007. In line with the need for improved well performance for example, particularly through stimulation of natural gas wells, Schlumberger introduced the Contact* family of staged fracturing and completion services early in the year. These services penetrated a number of key markets with a broad range of efficient and effective stimulation technologies. In North America, Contact services demonstrated their ability to place fracture treatments more accurately while stimulating multiple productive sands in a single operation to increase production and lower cost. Contact technologies were also demonstrated and deployed in Gabon, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, with significant production improvements in every case. 17 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Within this landscape, Schlumberger made further progress in areas where competitive advantage exists in technology and business model. In Russia, Schlumberger further expanded operations through the acquisition of TyumenPromGeofizika, a West Siberian wireline logging company. Elsewhere in Siberia, manufacturing activities increased as Wireline and Well Services began assembly of perforating and pumping equipment in Tyumen. Research and engineering activity accelerated with the opening of the new Moscow research center and the extension of the engineering center in Novosibirsk. And to address the needs of the increased staff in Russia, the Siberian Training Center partially opened for a number of training courses at the end of the year with full operation expected early in 2008. Russia also benefited from expanding take-up of Integrated Project Management services in Siberia. Similar operations began in other GeoMarket regions in Europe/CIS/Africa, and there was further strong growth in the well construction businesses in Latin America, where a new phase of deeper, hotter and more complex operations started in Mexico. These events are consistent with our goal of growing project management services at a much higher rate than the rest of the business. Growth at WesternGeco, where full-year 2007 revenue increased by 20% over 2006, matched the overall trend set by Oilfield Services. This was driven by demand for marine seismic and multiclient data sales while Q-Technology* revenue increased again to a new high of $1.14 billion, up 57% versus 2006. Vessel utilization for the year reached 93%, with half of the marine fleet now equipped with Q-Technology systems. The strength of the seismic market, particularly in marine services, led us to review our long-term plans for the fleet, resulting in the acquisition of Eastern Echo in November. The six new high-performance, high-capacity vessels on order are ideally suited to the exploration and development markets of the future, and all six will be fitted with Q-Technology equipment. In addition to the acquisitions of TyumenPromGeofizika and Eastern Echo, technology-based growth was furthered through a number of smaller acquisitions made during the year. These included Insensys Oil & Gas fiber-optic technology for the expanding subsea market, VIPS reservoir software and interpretation expertise to accelerate Schlumberger strength in geomechanics, InnerLogix information management technology for data quality improvement and Geosystem electromagnetic technology to expand WesternGeco electromagnetics solutions. The technology portfolio was also boosted by the acquisition of a further 5.5% share in Framo Engineering AS to take the Schlumberger holding to a majority 52.75%. Framo is a Norwegian-based company providing multiphase booster pumps, flow metering equipment and swivel stack systems. We will begin consolidating the results of Framo in the first quarter of 2008. In early 2007, we reiterated our view that while Schlumberger would continue to see high growth through the end of the present decade, growth rates would ultimately slow from the breakneck pace of the earlier part of 2006. Strong growth was indeed seen in 2007, but the shorter-term outlook for 2008 has become more complex, with several factors set to influence the business in the coming year. On the positive side, growth in land activity outside North America will remain strong, and seismic exploration services worldwide will remain in high demand on land and offshore as the industry gears up for an expanded exploration phase. However, in North America we do not expect levels of natural gas drilling to vary greatly in the absence of severe winter weather. Overall growth will also be restricted by the high utilization of the existing offshore rig fleet and the fact that only limited new builds will enter the market over the next 12 months. This will make activity vulnerable to operating efficiency. Maintaining and increasing the production base for both oil and natural gas will continue to be challenging. The aging of reservoirs that have been in production for many decades requires high levels of activity in order to stem decline, while weak reserves replacement ratios and heightened resource nationalism dictate that exploration for new hydrocarbon deposits in ever more remote areas and complex geologies must increase. In the longer term, current levels of drilling are insufficient to meaningfully slow decline rates, improve reservoir recovery or add sufficient new production capacity. The explosion in exploration licenses awarded in the last three years, the continual expansion of the number of new offshore rigs being ordered for delivery 18 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 through and beyond the end of the decade, and the industry-wide, as well as our own plans to increase both capital expenditure and research and development spending, are clear indicators of future growth. The following discussion and analysis of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements . (Stated in millions) Total Year 2007 Total Year 2006 (1) % Change Total Year 2006 (1) Total Year 2005 (1) % Change OILFIELD SERVICES Revenue $ 20,306 $ 16,762 21 % $ 16,762 $ 12,647 33 % Pretax Operating Income $ 5,959 $ 4,644 28 % $ 4,644 $ 2,827 64 % WESTERNGECO Revenue $ 2,963 $ 2,476 20 % $ 2,476 $ 1,663 49 % Pretax Operating Income $ 1,060 $ 812 31 % $ 812 $ 295 176 % Fourth Qtr. 2007 Third Qtr. 2007 % change OILFIELD SERVICES Revenue $ 5,445 $ 5,128 6 % Pretax Operating Income $ 1,535 $ 1,505 2 % WESTERNGECO Revenue $ 798 $ 794 1 % Pretax Operating Income $ 272 $ 306 (11 )% 1. Effective January 1, 2007, a GeoMarket that had been included in the Middle East & Asia Area was reassigned to the European/CIS/Africa Area. Certain activities were also reallocated between Oilfield Services and WesternGeco. Prior period data has been reclassified to conform to the current organizational structure. Pretax operating income represents the business segments income before taxes and minority interest. Pretax operating income excludes corporate expenses, interest income, interest expense, amortization of certain intangibles, interest, stock-based compensation costs and the Charges and Credits described in detail in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as these items are not allocated to the segments. Oilfield Services Fourth Quarter 2007 Results Fourth-quarter revenue of $5.44 billion was 6% higher sequentially and 18% higher as compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. Sequential revenue increases were highest in the Middle East & Asia Area led by the Arabian, China/Japan/Korea and India GeoMarkets*, followed by the Latin America Area where growth was strongest in the Mexico/Central America, Latin America South and Peru/Colombia/Ecuador GeoMarkets. In the Europe/CIS/Africa Area, increases were led by the North Sea, Caspian and Continental Europe GeoMarkets. Growth was also recorded in North America, led primarily by the Canada and US Gulf Coast GeoMarkets. Among Schlumberger Technologies, Artificial Lift Systems, Completions Systems and Schlumberger Information Solutions (SIS) registered strong growth due to seasonal end-of-year product sales. Fourth-quarter pretax operating income of $1.54 billion increased 2% sequentially and 16% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. Sequentially, growth was driven by demand for higher-margin Drilling & Measurements services in the Middle East & Asia Area and by increased product sales in Artificial Lift Systems in Europe/CIS/Africa and Middle East & Asia, and by Completions Systems product sales in the Middle East & Asia and Latin America. However, these increases were offset by pricing erosion for well stimulation related activities on land in the US; exceptional weather-related and operational delays in Mexico/Central America; and weather and seasonal effects in the US West, North Sea and East Russia GeoMarkets. These events resulted in an overall pretax operating margin in the fourth quarter of 28.2% as compared to 29.4% in the third quarter of 2007. 19 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 North America Revenue of $1.33 billion increased 3% sequentially but decreased 7% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. Pretax operating income of $338 million decreased 3% sequentially and 23% year-on-year. Sequentially, revenue in the Canada GeoMarket continued to grow led by demand for Well Services and Wireline technologies. In the US Gulf Coast GeoMarket, activity partially recovered from the slowdown experienced during the hurricane season of the third quarter with higher demand for Wireline, Well Testing and Well Services technologies. In addition, higher SIS product sales were recorded across the Area. This performance was largely offset by the continuing pricing erosion in well stimulation related activities in the US land GeoMarkets, seasonal land access constraints in the west, and by lower activity in Alaska. Pretax operating margin for the Area declined sequentially from 26.9% to 25.4% due to the lower pricing environment for well stimulation related services in the US land and Canada GeoMarkets, as well as lower operating leverage in Alaska and Canada. This was partially offset by a more favorable activity mix and higher operating efficiency in the US Gulf Coast GeoMarket together with the Area-wide SIS product sales. Latin America Revenue of $943 million increased 9% sequentially and 40% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. Pretax operating income of $208 million increased 2% sequentially and 47% year-on-year. Sequential revenue growth was recorded in all GeoMarkets primarily driven by IPM activities in Mexico/Central America, Peru/Colombia/Ecuador and Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago. Increased demand for Well Testing technologies and higher sales of Artificial Lift Systems, Completions Systems and SIS products in Latin America South, together with higher sales of Artificial Lift Systems and Completions Systems products in the Mexico/Central America and Peru/Colombia/Ecuador GeoMarkets, also contributed to growth. Pretax operating margin declined sequentially from 23.7% to 22.1% primarily due to the activity mix in the Mexico/Central America GeoMarket, which was affected by higher IPM project startup and third-party costs as well as by flooding in the south and operational delays offshore. These startup costs are expected to continue for the next few quarters. A lower mix of higher-margin Drilling & Measurements activity in Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago and higher-margin Wireline technology in Peru/Colombia/Ecuador also contributed to this result. Europe/CIS/Africa Revenue of $1.77 billion increased 4% sequentially and 23% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. Pretax operating income of $493 million was flat sequentially but increased 28% year-on-year. Sequentially, the North Sea GeoMarket recorded the highest revenue growth driven by increased demand for Wireline and Well Services technologies together with higher Artificial Lift Systems and SIS product sales. Higher demand for Drilling & Measurements technologies in the Caspian GeoMarket, increased Artificial Lift Systems product sales in North Russia, and high demand for Drilling & Measurements, Well Services and Well Testing technologies in Continental Europe also contributed to growth. This performance was partially offset by the seasonal slowdown in Sakhalin and subdued activity in Nigeria. Pretax operating margin declined sequentially from 29.2% to 27.9% due to the seasonal slowdown in Sakhalin, and to weather-related delays which led to reduced demand for higher- margin Drilling & Measurements and Well Testing technologies in the North Sea. A less favorable activity mix in the West & South Africa and North Africa GeoMarkets also contributed to this result. Middle East & Asia Revenue of $1.35 billion increased 10% sequentially and 30% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. Pretax operating income of $473 million increased 8% sequentially and 40% year-on-year. 20 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 The sequential growth in revenue resulted from high demand for Drilling & Measurements and Wireline technologies together with higher Completions Systems, Artificial Lift Systems and SIS product sales in the Arabian GeoMarket; higher demand for exploration-related Drilling & Measurements technologies and for Artificial Lift Systems products in Qatar; increased demand for Drilling & Measurements and Well Testing services in China/Japan/Korea; and higher deepwater exploration-driven demand for Wireline and Drilling & Measurements technologies together with higher SIS product sales in India. The pretax operating margin of 35.0% as compared to 35.7% in the third quarter resulted from the more favorable activity mix in the Arabian and India GeoMarkets being offset by reduced demand for higher-margin Wireline, Well Services and Well Testing technologies in the Indonesia, Thailand/Vietnam and Australia/Papua New Guinea GeoMarkets. Total Year 2007 Results Full-year 2007 revenue of $20.31 billion increased 21% versus 2006, led by Area growth of 31% in the Middle East & Asia, followed by 30% in Europe/CIS/Africa and 29% in Latin America while North America remained essentially flat. Pretax operating income of $5.96 billion in 2007 was 28% higher than 2006. Pretax operating margins of 29.3% improved 164 basis points (bps) in 2007 versus 2006. Higher activity and expansion of higher-margin new technology deployment across Europe/CIS/Africa, Middle East & Asia and Latin America Areas were the principal contributors to this performance. In North America, pricing erosion in pressure-pumping well-stimulation activities moderated year-on-year margin growth within the Area. Among the GeoMarkets, the greatest increases in revenue were recorded in the North Sea, followed by Mexico, West & South Africa, Arabian and Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago GeoMarkets. Significant demand was seen for all Technologies led by Drilling & Measurements, Wireline, Well Testing, and Completions Systems as customers continued to improve exploration and production performance in the search for new hydrocarbon reserves and in the need to increase production and boost recovery from existing fields. To adapt the existing Schlumberger GeoMarket structure to expanding activity levels worldwide, Qatar was established as a separate GeoMarket and new GeoMarkets were established in Russia and on land in the US, bringing the total number of GeoMarkets to 31. North America Revenue of $5.34 billion increased marginally over 2006 primarily due to higher demand for Drilling & Measurements, Well Testing and Wireline activities in the US Land Central, US Land North and the US Gulf Coast GeoMarkets. However, this performance was offset by pricing erosion in well stimulation activities across the Area. Activity across US Land continued to grow driven by the increase in rig count and higher service intensity in unconventional natural gas reservoirs. However, weakness in natural gas prices and excess well stimulation-related pressure pumping capacity led to a year-on-year decline in pricing in stimulation related activities. The US Gulf Coast GeoMarket continued to grow driven by demand for exploration related activities. In Canada year-on-year revenue declined sharply due to operator slowdown driven by weakness in natural gas prices and uncertainty over the fiscal regime. Pretax operating margin declined by 167 bps to 28.8% primarily due to lower pricing in well stimulation related activities across the Area together with lower activity in Canada. 21 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Latin America Revenue of $3.30 billion in 2007 increased 29% over 2006 led by a surge in IPM related activity in Mexico following the budget-related slowdowns in the previous year, followed by the growth in exploration-related activities in the Peru/Columbia/Ecuador and Latin America South GeoMarkets. The Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago GeoMarket also grew with higher rig count-driven activity in addition to finalization of the contracts related to drilling barges. The Mexico GeoMarket recorded robust growth with the start of several integrated projects. Peru/Columbia/Ecuador and Latin America South witnessed strong growth in exploration-related activities. Demand was strong for all Technologies led by IPM, followed by Drilling & Measurements, Wireline and Well Testing services. Pretax operating margin increased strongly by 358 bps to reach 22.9%. This increase resulted mainly from a favorable activity mix and improved pricing. Europe/CIS/Africa Revenue of $6.59 billion in 2007 increased 30% over 2006 with the highest growth recorded in the North Sea, West & South Africa and North Africa GeoMarkets. Strong revenue increases were recorded in the North Sea, West & South Africa and North Africa driven by the expansion of exploration-related activities. GeoMarkets in Russia continued to grow strongly due to a combination of organic growth and the completion of the acquisition of Tyumenpromgeofizika during the second quarter of the year. Pretax operating margins increased by 299 bps to reach 28.5%. This performance was due to a combination of increased activity, improved pricing and accelerated new technology deployment across most GeoMarkets partially offset by a pricing decline in well stimulation activities in the East Russia and subdued activity in Nigeria. Middle East & Asia Revenue of $4.88 billion in 2007 increased 31% over 2006 with the largest increases recorded in the Arabian GeoMarket, followed by East Mediterranean, Australia/Papua New Guinea, Qatar, Gulf and India. The Australia/Papua New Guinea GeoMarket recorded the highest growth rate in the Area driven by higher exploration related activity. Growth in East Mediterranean, Qatar, Gulf and India resulted from higher exploration and development activity while the Arabian GeoMarket continued to grow, albeit at a lower rate than the previous year, as new rig additions slowed down in Saudi Arabia. Pretax operating margin increased by 299 bps to an impressive 35.1%. This performance was driven by continued increase in activity and pricing increases together with deployment of higher-margin Wireline and Drilling & Measurements new technologies. Total Year 2006 Results Revenue of $16.76 billion increased 33% in 2006 versus 2005 driven by growth in oilfield services activities as operators responded strongly to increasing global hydrocarbon demand through renewed exploration and increased focus on production operations. Within the geographic Areas, North America revenue increased 40%, Europe/CIS/Africa increased 36%, Middle East & Asia increased 31% and Latin America increased 16%. Pretax operating income of $4.64 billion in 2006 grew by 64% over 2005 resulting in operating margins climbing by 535 bps to reach 27.57%. Stronger activity, accelerating higher-margin new technology deployment and increased pricing across all Areas were the principal contributors to this performance. 22 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Among the GeoMarkets, the greatest increases in revenue were recorded in US Land, followed by the Arabian, Russian, North Sea, US Gulf Coast, Canada, West & South Africa, Nigeria and North Africa GeoMarkets. The growth in Russia was driven by a combination of activity within the established GeoMarkets and the impact of the acquisition of PetroAlliance Services. Significant demand was seen for all Technologies as customers sought to improve exploration and production performance while mitigating technical risk in the search for new hydrocarbon reserves and in the need to increase production and boost recovery from existing fields. A number of key acquisitions were made during the year. These included the acquisition of the outstanding 49% of PetroAlliance Services in Russia; as well as TerraTek a global leader in geomechanics measurements and analysis; Odegaard a leader in advanced surface seismic data inversion software; and Reslink a leading supplier of advanced completion solutions which offer a broad spectrum of engineering applications and products for sand management, zonal isolation and intelligent well completions. North America Revenue of $5.27 billion increased 40% over 2005 mainly driven by the US Land and US Gulf Coast GeoMarkets, which benefited from strong Well Services, Drilling & Measurements and Wireline activities coupled with continued pricing improvements. Increasing demand for Well Testing activities offshore also contributed to growth. Sharply increased activity in the US Land GeoMarket led to strong equipment and personnel utilization, higher pricing and increased demand for high-tier, new-technology services. The US Gulf Coast GeoMarket rebounded strongly from the effects of the disastrous 2005 hurricane season with growth driven by a combination of new exploration and increased production-related activities. Canada continued to grow due to strong demand for Drilling & Measurements and Wireline technologies. Growth was somewhat offset by lower Well Services activity in the coal bed methane and shallow gas areas in the second half of the year. Pretax operating income of $1.60 billion was 72% higher than in 2005 led by the US Land and US Gulf of Mexico GeoMarkets. The steep growth was primarily due to continuing strength in pricing, particularly for Well Services, Wireline and Drilling & Measurements technologies, and a more favorable activity mix resulting from the deployment of higher-margin new-technology Drilling & Measurements, Wireline and Well Testing services. Latin America Revenue of $2.56 billion in 2006 increased 16% over 2005 led by the Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago GeoMarket, followed by the Latin America South and Peru/Colombia/Ecuador GeoMarkets. Growth in the Area was impacted by budget-related activity slowdowns in Mexico together with geopolitical concerns in other parts of the region. The Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago GeoMarket recorded strong growth due to solid demand for Drilling & Measurements technologies. Well Services, Wireline, Completions and Artificial Lift technologies also contributed to growth. In Venezuela, discussions regarding new contracts for the drilling barges work and the settlement of certain outstanding receivables had progressed at the end of the year. Pending finalization of these new contracts, revenue recognition was deferred on certain work performed in the third and fourth quarters. As the costs associated with this work were also deferred, this did not have a significant impact on the Area pretax operating income. The Latin America South GeoMarket registered strong growth due primarily to increased Well Services, Drilling & Measurements, IPM and Well Testing activities, while growth in the Peru/Colombia/Ecuador GeoMarket resulted from significant demand for Drilling & Measurements, Wireline and Artificial Lift technologies. 23 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Pretax operating income of $495 million in 2006 increased 50% versus 2005. This increase resulted mainly from a favorable activity mix in IPM projects and improved operating efficiencies in Drilling & Measurements and Well Testing services. Europe/CIS/Africa Revenue of $5.05 billion in 2006 increased 36% over 2005 with the highest growth recorded in the North Sea, North Africa, Nigeria GeoMarkets and in Russia. Strong revenue increases were recorded in Russia and other CIS countries despite the weather-related slowdown in the first quarter, due to a combination of organic growth within Schlumberger Technology lines and the impact of the acquisition of PetroAlliance Services. Renewed customer focus on exploration resulted in steep growth in the North Sea and North Africa GeoMarkets, while the West & South Africa and Nigeria GeoMarkets maintained a robust growth momentum. Pretax operating income of $1.29 billion in 2006 increased 67% compared to 2005. All GeoMarkets contributed significantly through increased activity, improved pricing and accelerated new technology deployment. Middle East & Asia Revenue of $3.72 billion in 2006 increased 31% over 2005 with the largest increases recorded in the Arabian, East Africa & East Mediterranean and Gulf GeoMarkets. Saudi Arabia continued aggressive growth rates as activity increased rapidly, distinguishing the Arabian GeoMarket as the fastest growing of all of the GeoMarkets. Growth in the East Africa & East Mediterranean and Gulf GeoMarkets was principally attributed to higher activity in Drilling & Measurements and Wireline services. The Brunei/Malaysia/Philippines, Australia Papua New Guinea and Thailand/Vietnam/Myanmar GeoMarkets also contributed to growth. All Technologies witnessed solid growth as activity increased and demand for new technology increased with significant progress in the deployment of Drilling & Measurements PowerDrive* and Scope* technologies to enable successful drilling of a number of complex borehole trajectories. Pretax operating income of $1.20 billion in 2006 increased 49% compared to 2005. The steady increase in operating income and operating margins throughout the year was due to activity improvement across all GeoMarkets, significant price increases and accelerated new technology deployment. WesternGeco Fourth Quarter 2007 Results Fourth-quarter revenue of $798 million increased 1% over the prior quarter and increased 11% compared to the same period last year. Pretax operating income of $272 million decreased 11% sequentially but increased 4% year-on-year. Sequentially, Multiclient revenue increased 83% due to higher sales in North America, Africa and Asia. However, this increase was largely offset by a decrease in Marine revenue due to vessel transits between projects, several vessel dry docks, and lower vessel utilization. Pretax operating margin declined sequentially from 38.6% to 34.1% as the high-margin Multiclient activity was more than offset by the lower Marine vessel utilization. 24 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Total Year 2007 Results Full-year 2007 revenue of $2.96 billion increased 20% versus 2006. Pretax operating income of $1.06 billion in 2007 was 31% higher than 2006. Pretax operating margin reached 35.8% an increase of 299 bps in 2007 versus 2006 demonstrating continued high vessel utilization, pricing increases in Marine and accelerating demand for exploration-driven seismic services. Q-Technology revenue reached $1.14 billion, representing 38% of 2007 full-year revenue. Revenue backlog reached $1.2 billion at the end of 2007 compared to $1.1 million at the end of 2006. Marine revenue grew 17% due mainly to strong activity in Asia, Middle East, India, Europe and North America as operators continued to focus on new exploration horizons. High vessel utilization, continued adoption of Q-Technology and improved pricing contributed to this performance. Multiclient revenue increased 30% driven by higher sales in North America as the demand for E-Dog and E-Cat surveys remained strong during the first half of the year augmented by strong demand for E-Octopus surveys during the second half. Data Processing revenue increased 26%, reflecting higher acquisition volumes, higher levels of Q processing, and higher activity in India, Asia, North Africa, Europe and the Caspian. Land revenue increased 6% with the continued adoption of Q-Land* technology in Africa and in the Middle East. During the second quarter of the year, the seventh Q-Technology equipped vessel the Western Spirit was launched. The eighth and ninth Q vessels will be launched, as previously announced, in 2008 and 2009, respectively. As previously discussed, Schlumberger acquired Eastern Echo to meet demand for market-leading WesternGeco Q-Marine* seismic technology services. Total Year 2006 Results Operating revenue of $2.48 billion increased 49% in 2006 versus 2005. This strong performance was due to the continued market acceptance of Q-Technology* services and strong performance from Marine, Land, Data Processing and Multiclient services. During the second quarter, Schlumberger acquired the remaining Baker Hughes 30% minority interest in WesternGeco from Baker Hughes Incorporated. Revenue backlog reached $1.1 billion at the end of 2006 compared to $790 million at the end of 2005, reflecting increasing exploration and production activity. Q-Technology revenues reached $726 million in 2006, representing 29% of total revenue in 2006, significantly in excess of the $399 million revenue achieved in 2005. Utilization of the six Q-equipped vessels reached 100% in the fourth quarter of 2006. Multiclient sales increased 51% to $770 million, mainly in the US Gulf of Mexico due to strong sales of the world largest and most complex depth migration project known as E-Dog which covers an area of 20,250 sq km and extends over 800 blocks in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Also contributing to the strong increase were higher sales in Latin America, Asia and West Africa reflecting the strengthening exploration activity. Marine revenue grew 65% due mainly to strong activity in Asia, Middle East, India, Europe and North America. Higher vessel utilization, accelerated adoption of Q-Technology and increasing prices contributed to this performance. Land revenue increased 28% driven by higher sales of Q-Land, strong activity in the Middle East and South America, and a steep growth in North Africa. 25 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Data Processing revenue increased 22%, reflecting higher acquisition volumes, higher levels of Q processing, and higher activity in India, Asia, North Africa, Europe and the Caspian. During the year, WesternGeco opened a new data processing and reservoir services center in Mumbai, India. The new center, staffed with more than 40 geologists and geophysicists, is one of the most powerful WesternGeco computing facilities worldwide. The center is equipped to provide customers with a full suite of advanced data processing services, including depth imaging and reservoir seismic services such as reservoir characterization and 4D (time-lapse) processing and analysis. Pretax operating income reached $812 million in 2006 compared to $295 million in 2005 due to accelerating demand for Q technology coupled with improved pricing and increased vessel utilization, together with strong Multiclient sales. Increased demand for Q-Marine services led to the commissioning of the sixth Q-Technology equipped vessel the Western Monarch during the second quarter. In addition, and in response to further demand, WesternGeco announced the launch of the seventh, eighth and ninth Q vessels in 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income consisted of the following: (Stated in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Interest income $ 162 $ 117 $ 100 Equity in net earnings of affiliated companies 244 179 109 Gain on sale of workover rigs 1 25 Loss on liquidation of investments to fund the WesternGeco transaction 1 (9 ) Gain on sale of facility in Montrouge, France 1 163 Gain on sale of Hanover Compressor investment 1 21 Gains on sales of other assets 15 $ 431 $ 287 $ 408 1. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details. Interest Income The average return on investments increased to 5.2% in 2007 from 4.5% in 2006 and the weighted average investment balance of $3.1 billion in 2007 increased $531 million compared to 2006. The average return on investments increased to 4.5% in 2006 from 3.3% in 2005 and the weighted average investment balance of $2.6 billion in 2006 decreased $452 million compared to 2005. Equity in Net Earnings of Affiliated Companies The equity in net earnings of affiliated companies primarily represents Schlumberger share of the results of its 40% interest in the M-I SWACO drilling fluids joint venture with Smith International Inc. Interest Expense Interest expense of $275 million in 2007 increased by $40 million compared to 2006. The weighted average borrowing rates of 5.0% increased in 2007 from 4.6% in 2006. The weighted average debt balance of $5.5 billion in 2007 increased by $420 million compared to 2006, primarily due to the funding, in the second quarter of 2006, of the WesternGeco transaction described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 26 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Interest expense of $235 million in 2006 increased by $38 million compared to 2005. The weighted average borrowing rates of 4.6% increased in 2006 from 4.4% in 2005. The weighted average debt balance of $5.1 billion in 2006 increased by $609 million compared to 2005, primarily due to the funding, in the second quarter of 2006, of the WesternGeco transaction described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Gross margin was 33.5%, 31.4% and 25.7% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increases in gross margins are primarily due to record activity levels in 2007 and 2006, increased pricing, stronger demand for higher-margin technologies, and operating efficiency improvements. As a percentage of revenue, Research & engineering, Marketing and General & administrative expenses are as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Research & engineering 3.1 % 3.2 %* 3.5 % Marketing 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % General & administrative 2.2 % 2.4 % 2.5 % * Research & engineering in 2006 included $27 million of in-process research and development charges.

See discussion of Charges and Credits in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 2. Includes $16 million of cost in 2006 associated with Schlumberger relocation of its United States research center from Ridgefield to Boston. Income Taxes The reported effective tax rate, including Charges and Credits , was 21.9% in 2007, 24.0% in 2006 and 22.9% in 2005. The Charges and Credits noted below decreased the effective rate by 1.5% in 2005. The impact of Charges and Credits on the effective tax rate in 2007 and 2006 was not significant. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2007, as compared to 2006, was primarily attributable to the geographic mix of earnings. Both Oilfield Services and WesternGeco had a lower proportion of pretax earnings in North America. Outside North America, various GeoMarkets with lower tax rates contributed a greater percentage to pretax earnings. The effective tax rate in 2005 reflects the impact of the $163 million gain on the sale of the Montrouge facility. This transaction allowed for the utilization of a deferred tax asset that was previously offset by a valuation allowance and had the effect of lowering the effective tax rate during 2005 by 1.3%. Excluding the impact of this transaction, the effective tax rate was relatively flat in 2006 as compared to 2005. Charges and Credits During each of 2007, 2006 and 2005, Schlumberger recorded significant charges and credits. These charges and credits, which are summarized below, are more fully described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 27 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 The following is a summary of the 2007 Charges and Credits: (Stated in millions) Pretax Tax Minority Interest Net Income Statement Classification Charges and Credits Gain on sale of workover rigs $ (24.5 ) $ 7.1 $ $ (17.4 ) Interest and other income The following is a summary of the 2006 Charges and Credits: (Stated in millions) Pretax Tax Minority Interest Net Income Statement Classification Charges and Credits WesternGeco in-process R&D charge $ 21.0 $ $ $ 21.0 Research & engineering Loss on liquidation of investments to fund WesternGeco transaction 9.4 9.4 Interest and other income WesternGeco visa settlement 9.7 0.3 (3.2 ) 6.8 Cost of goods sold and services Other in-process R&D charges 5.6 5.6 Research & engineering Net Charges $ 45.7 $ 0.3 $ (3.2 ) $ 42.8 The following is a summary of the 2005 Charges and Credits: (Stated in millions) Pretax Tax Net Income Statement Classification Charges and Credits Gain on sale of Hanover Compressor stock $ (20.9 ) $ $ (20.9 ) Interest and other income Gain on sale of Montrouge facility (163.4 ) (163.4 ) Interest and other income Other real estate related charges 12.1 (0.8 ) 11.3 Cost of goods sold and services Net Credits $ (172.2 ) $ (0.8 ) $ (173.0 ) Stock-based Compensation and Other Stock-based compensation expense was $136 million in 2007 compared to $114 million in 2006 and $40 million in 2005. The $22 million increase in stock-based compensation expense in 2007, as compared to 2006, was attributable to (i) the fact that Schlumberger began granting restricted stock in 2006 to a targeted population of employees in order to promote retention and the fair value of the restricted stock is expensed over the vesting period, which is generally three years and (ii) the impact of increased valuations of stock-based compensation awards due to the upward movement in Schlumberger stock price as compared to prior years. The $74 million increase in stock-based compensation expense in 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily attributable to (i) the impact of Schlumberger adoption of FAS 123R and FAS 123 as discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements , (ii) valuations of stock-based compensation awards increasing due to the upward movement in Schlumberger stock price as compared to prior years and (iii) the impact of the implementation of the restricted stock program in 2006. Stock-based compensation expense is currently estimated to be approximately $180 million in 2008. This represents an increase of $44 million as compared to 2007 and will be primarily attributable to increased valuations of stock-based compensation awards due to Schlumberger higher stock price in recent years as compared to prior years, as well as the continued effect of the restricted stock program. During 2006, Schlumberger relocated its United States corporate office from New York to Houston and its United States research center from Ridgefield to Boston. Schlumberger incurred approximately $30 million of incremental expenses in connection with these moves in 2006. The vast majority of these costs were incurred in the third and fourth quarters of 2006 ($10 million in the third quarter; $15 million in the fourth quarter). 28 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Cash Flow Net Debt represents gross debt less cash, short-term investments and fixed income investments, held to maturity. Management believes that Net Debt provides useful information regarding the level of Schlumberger indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt.

Net assets acquired included $320 million of cash and investments and $182 million of long-term debt. On April 28, 2006, Schlumberger acquired the remaining 30% minority interest in WesternGeco from Baker Hughes Incorporated for $2.4 billion in cash. Approximately 50% of the purchase price was funded from Schlumberger cash and investments. The remaining 50% was financed through existing Schlumberger credit facilities. 29 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 In September 2006, Schlumberger Finance B.V. issued 400 million Guaranteed Floating Rate Notes due 2009. Interest is payable quarterly at the rate of 10 basis points over 3-month Euribor. Schlumberger entered into an agreement to swap these Euro notes for US dollars on the date of issue until maturity, effectively making this US dollar denominated debt on which Schlumberger Finance B.V. will pay interest in US dollars at the rate of 3-month LIBOR plus 0.0875%. The proceeds from these notes were used to repay commercial paper borrowings. On July 22, 2004, the Board of Directors of Schlumberger approved a share repurchase program of up to 30 million shares of common stock to be acquired in the open market before December 2006, subject to market conditions. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. On April 20, 2006, the Board of Directors of Schlumberger approved another share repurchase program of up to 40 million shares of common stock to be acquired in the open market before April 2010, subject to market conditions, of which approximately 29.9 million shares of common stock have been repurchased as of December 31, 2007. The following table summarizes the activity under these share repurchase programs during 2007, 2006 and 2005: (Stated in thousands except per share amounts and prices) Total cost of shares purchased Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share 2007 $ 1,355,000 16,336.1 $ 82.95 2006 $ 1,067,842 17,992.7 $ 59.35 2005 $ 611,641 15,274.8 $ 40.04 During 2007, 2006 and 2005, Schlumberger announced that its Board of Directors had approved increases in the quarterly dividend of 40%, 19% and 12%, respectively. On January 18, 2008, Schlumberger announced that its Board of Directors approved a 20% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.21 per share effective commencing with the dividend payable on April 4, 2008. Total dividends paid during 2007, 2006 and 2005 were approximately $771 million, $568 million and $482 million, respectively. Cash flow provided by operations was $6.3 billion in 2007, $4.8 billion in 2006 and $3.0 billion in 2005. These improvements were driven by the significant revenue and net income increases experienced in 2007 and 2006. Capital expenditures, including multiclient seismic data costs, were $3.2 billion in 2007, $2.6 billion in 2006 and $1.7 billion in 2005. These increases were a result of the increased activity levels experienced in recent years. Capital expenditures, including multiclient seismic data costs, are expected to approach $4.2 billion in 2008. Schlumberger believes that at December 31, 2007, cash and short-term investments of $3.2 billion and available and unused credit facilities of $2.3 billion were sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next twelve months. 30 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Summary of Major Contractual Commitments (Stated in millions) Payment Period Contractual Commitments Total 2008 2009 - 2010 2011 - 2012 After 2012 Debt 1 $ 5,444 $ 1,672 $ 1,541 $ 2,231 $ Operating Leases $ 902 $ 213 $ 275 $ 135 $ 279 Purchase Obligations 2 $ 2,297 $ 2,097 $ 200 $ $ 1. Excludes future payments for interest. Includes amounts relating to the $769 million of Convertible Debentures which are described in Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements . 2. Represents an estimate of contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business. Although these contractual obligations are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow Schlumberger the option to reschedule and adjust their requirements based on business needs prior to the delivery of goods. Refer to Note 19 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding Schlumberger pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. As discussed in Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements , included in the Schlumberger Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2007 is approximately $858 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over 100 jurisdictions in which Schlumberger conducts business. Due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded, Schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities. Schlumberger has outstanding letters of credit/guarantees which relate to business performance bonds, custom/excise tax commitments, facility lease/rental obligations, etc. These were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where Schlumberger operates. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires Schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by Schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain. A summary of all of Schlumberger significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Multiclient Seismic Data The WesternGeco segment capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data. The carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $182 million, $227 million and $222 million, respectively. Such costs are charged to Cost of goods sold and services based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that Schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data. However, except as described below under WesternGeco Purchase Accounting , under no circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4-year straight-line amortized value. 31 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 The carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred. Adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues, which involve significant judgment on the part of Schlumberger, would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys. Significant adverse changes in Schlumberger estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period. For purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library, future cash flows are analyzed based on two pools of surveys: United States and non-United States. The United States and non-United States pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including (i) various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and (ii) the focus of the sales force and related costs. WesternGeco Purchase Accounting As described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements , on April 28, 2006, Schlumberger acquired the remaining 30% minority interest in WesternGeco from Baker Hughes Incorporated for $2.4 billion in cash. As a result of this transaction, Schlumberger attained 100% ownership of WesternGeco. During the process of allocating the purchase price to the proportionate share of net assets acquired based upon their estimated fair values, Schlumberger made certain significant estimates and assumptions relating to the accounting for WesternGeco vessels and multiclient seismic data. In analyzing the fair value of the WesternGeco vessels, it was determined that the remaining estimated useful lives of these assets exceeded the remaining estimated life currently being used to calculate depreciation expense. Therefore, the estimated remaining useful lives of the vessels were extended an additional 4 years (on a weighted average basis) as of the date of the acquisition. The impact of the fair value adjustments for all fixed assets, combined with the change in estimate regarding the depreciable lives of the vessels, resulted in a net reduction in depreciation expense of approximately $2 million in 2006. The carrying value of the multiclient library immediately after the acquisition increased to $243 million from $202 million, reflecting the impact of a $41 million fair value adjustment. These capitalized costs are being charged to Cost of goods sold and services based on the percentage of the total costs on the balance sheet to the estimated total revenue that Schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data. Schlumberger policy has been that under no circumstance will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4-year straight-line amortized value. After consideration of the estimated number of future years that revenues are expected to be derived from the multiclient seismic data at the time of the acquisition, Schlumberger concluded that the remaining minimum amortization period should be 3 years for all surveys in the multiclient seismic library at the time of the transaction, effectively resetting the minimum amortization period. Therefore, the $243 million of capitalized multiclient seismic data costs will be charged to expense over a period no longer than the next 3 years from the date of the transaction. Surveys comprising the $202 million of multiclient seismic data costs prior to this transaction had a weighted average remaining life for purposes of computing the minimum amortization of approximately 1.8 years. Given the current emphasis on requiring multiclient projects to be significantly prefunded before a project commences, Schlumberger currently estimates that the majority of revenues to be derived from sales of new surveys will be achieved within a 4-year period. Therefore, Schlumberger will continue its policy that under no circumstance will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4-year straight-line amortized value for all surveys added to the library after the date of this transaction. The net impact of the $41 million fair value adjustment combined with the resetting of the minimum amortization period resulted in an approximate $28 million net reduction in multiclient amortization expense in 2006 as compared to what multiclient amortization expense would have been had this transaction not been consummated. 32 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value. A significant amount of judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve. Allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible, including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices, customer satisfaction claims and pricing discrepancies. Depending on how such potential issues are resolved, or if the financial condition of Schlumberger customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, adjustments to the allowance may be required. Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets Schlumberger records as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of Schlumberger individual reporting units to their carrying amount to determine if there is a potential goodwill impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. For purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill as required by SFAS 142, Schlumberger reporting units are primarily the geographic areas comprising the Oilfield Services segment in addition to the WesternGeco segment. Schlumberger estimates the fair value of these reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis and/or applying various market multiples. From time to time a third-party valuation expert may assist in the determination of fair value. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is a matter of judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Schlumberger estimates of the fair value of each of its reporting units were significantly in excess of their respective carrying values at the time of the annual goodwill impairment tests for 2007, 2006 and 2005. Long-lived assets, including fixed assets and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In reviewing for impairment, the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset recorded value, an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset to its estimated fair value. The determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long-lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management. In order to estimate the fair value of a long-lived asset, Schlumberger may engage a third-party to assist with the valuation. If there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value, Schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future. Schlumberger evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated amortization period. 33 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Income Taxes Schlumberger tax filings are subject to regular audit by the tax authorities in most of the over 100 jurisdictions in which it conducts business. These audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or, potentially, through the courts. Tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits. Estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances. However, due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates. In such an event, Schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Schlumberger pension benefit and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts, which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates. These assumptions are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each fiscal year, or more frequently upon the occurrence of significant events. The discount rate Schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations. The discount rate utilized to determine both the liability for Schlumberger United States pension plans and for Schlumberger United States postretirement medical plans was increased from 6.00% at December 31, 2006 to 6.50% at December 31, 2007. The discount rate utilized to determine expense for Schlumberger United States pension plans and postretirement medical plans was increased from 5.75% in 2006 to 6.00% in 2007. The change in the discount rate was made to reflect market interest rate conditions. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and decreases expense. The expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation, are expected to be paid. The expected rate of return for Schlumberger United States pension plans has been determined based upon expectations regarding future rates of return for the investment portfolio, with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class. The expected rate of return on plan assets was 8.50% in 2007 and 2006. A lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense. Schlumberger medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. The overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized in both 2007 and 2006 was 9% graded to 6% over the next four years and 5% thereafter. The following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for the United States pension plans: (Stated in millions) Change in Assumption Effect on 2007 Pretax Pension Expense Effect on Dec. 31, 2007 Liability 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$ 8 +$70 25 basis point increase in discount rate - $ 8 - $69 25 basis point decrease in expected return on plan assets +$ 4 $ 25 basis point increase in expected return on plan assets - $ 4 $ 34 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7, 7A The following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for Schlumberger United States postretirement medical plans: (Stated in millions) Change in Assumption Effect on 2007 Pretax Postretirement Medical Expense Effect on Dec. 31, 2007 Liability 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$ 3 +$ 27 25 basis point increase in discount rate - $ 3 - $ 27 100 basis point decrease per annum in medical cost trend rate - $ 18 - $ 81 100 basis point increase per annum in medical cost trend rate +$ 22 +$ 137
