Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition And Results of Operation Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly this Item 7, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable law. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent uncertainties and risks. It is important that you read SPECIAL NOTES REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS inside the front cover of this Annual Report of Form 10-K for more information about these forward-looking statements and their inherent uncertainties and risks. (1) FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity and Capital Resources Management assesses the Company liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting liquidity are: cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, dividends, adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit, and the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms. The Company generates substantial cash from operations and remains in a strong financial position, with enough liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions while managing the capital structure on a short and long-term basis. The following table is derived from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: Twelve Months Ended December 31, Cash Flows from Continuing Operations 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net Cash Flows Provided By (Used In): Operating activities $ 878,812 $ 570,304 Investing activities (846,593 ) (1,049,057 ) Financing activities 128,290 274,604 Cash flows provided by operating activities during 2006 increased $308.5 million over the prior period primarily reflecting higher earnings and margins from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization and lower tax payments. Cash used in investing activities during 2006 decreased $202.5 million compared to 2005, reflecting essentially flat acquisition spending, higher proceeds from the disposition of businesses in the 2006 period, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures, primarily in the oil & gas and micro-acoustics businesses. Acquisition expenditures in 2006 were $1,116.8 million compared to $1,089.7 million in 2005 while proceeds from the disposition of businesses increased $286.6 million over 2005 to $445.9 million. Capital expenditures of $194.7 million, which increased $64.2 million over the prior year, primarily funded investments in plant expansions, plant machinery and information systems. The Company currently anticipates that any acquisitions made during 2007 will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and, if necessary, through the issuance of commercial paper, established lines of credit or public debt markets. Capital expenditures for 2007 are expected to be consistent with 2006 levels. Cash provided by financing activities during 2006 decreased $146.3 million when compared to 2005. Acquisitions during 2006 were primarily funded through cash from operations and proceeds generated from dispositions. In addition, the Company repurchased $48.3 million of treasury shares and paid dividends of $144.8 million. Adjusted Working Capital (a non-GAAP measure; calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable) increased from December 31, 2005 by $262.5 million, primarily as a result of acquisitions, foreign exchange translation and the Company organic growth. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency, working capital would have increased by $41.3 million from December 31, 2005. Average Annual Adjusted 17 Table of Contents Working Capital as a percentage of revenue (a non-GAAP measure; calculated as the five quarter average balance of accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable divided by the trailing twelve months of revenue) decreased to 18.9% from 20.7% at year end 2005 and inventory turns improved to 6.5 turns from 5.7 turns in the prior year. In addition to measuring its cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating, investing and financing classifications included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow, the Company also measures free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure). Management believes that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions, pay dividends, repay debt and repurchase Dover common stock. For further information, see Non-GAAP Disclosures at the end of this Item 7. Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $684.1 million or 10.5% of revenue compared to $440.0 million or 8.2% of revenue in the prior year. The 2006 increase in free cash flow reflected higher earnings and margins from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization, and lower tax payments, partially offset by higher capital expenditures. The following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flows from operating activities. Twelve Months Ended December 31, Free Cash Flow 2006 2005 (In thousands) Cash flow provided by operating activities $ 878,812 $ 570,304 Less: Capital expenditures (194,735 ) (130,492 ) Free cash flow $ 684,077 $ 439,812 Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue 10.5 % 8.2 % At December 31, 2006, the Company net property, plant, and equipment totaled $856.8 million compared to $706.7 million at the end of 2005. The increase in net property, plant and equipment reflected acquisitions of $83.7 million, capital expenditures of $194.7 million, partially offset by decreases related to foreign currency fluctuation of $21.9 million, and depreciation. The aggregate of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities decreased from a $307.5 million net liability at the beginning of the year to a net liability of $298.3 million at year-end 2006. This resulted primarily from decreases in current tax liabilities, increases in deferred tax assets from accruals, a decrease in deferred tax liabilities as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 (see below) and net operating loss carryforwards (primarily acquisition related), partially offset by an increase in deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets. Dover consolidated benefit obligation related to defined and supplemental retirement benefits increased by $52.0 million in 2006. The increase was due principally to net obligations of $50.5 million related to acquisitions. Offsetting this increase was a plan asset increase of $37.6 million due to gains on plan investments during the year and Company contributions of $3.0 million, which were partially offset by benefit payouts. During 2006, plan amendments, primarily from union negotiated contracts, created an increase in the benefit obligation of $8.5 million. Due to the decrease in the net funded status of the plans and the increase in the amortization of unrecognized losses, it is estimated that pension expense will increase from $42.8 million to approximately $45.2 million in 2007. Effective December 31, 2006 Dover adopted SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an Amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) ( SFAS No. 158 ). See notes 2 & 13 in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the adoption of this standard. 18 Table of Contents The Company utilizes the net debt to total capitalization calculation (a non-GAAP measure) to assess its overall financial leverage and capacity and believes the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason. The following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to total capitalization to the most directly comparable GAAP measures: At December 31, At December 31, Net Debt to Total Capitalization Ratio 2006 2005 (In thousands) Current maturities of long-term debt $ 32,267 $ 1,201 Commercial paper and other short-term debt 258,282 192,961 Long-term debt 1,480,491 1,344,173 Total debt 1,771,040 1,538,335 Less: Cash and cash equivalents 373,616 185,832 Net debt 1,397,424 1,352,503 Add: Stockholders equity 3,811,022 3,329,523 Total capitalization $ 5,208,446 $ 4,682,026 Net debt to total capitalization 26.8 % 28.9 % Net debt at December 31, 2006 remained relatively flat as increased cash flow from operations and cash generated from dispositions were used to fund Dover acquisition program. The percentage decrease in net debt to total capital, after record acquisition spending, reflects strong operational free cash flow and the proceeds from dispositions of $445.9 million. Dover long-term debt instruments had a book value of $1,512.8 million on December 31, 2006 and a fair value of approximately $1,502.9 million. On December 31, 2005, the Company long-term debt instruments had a book value of $1,345.4 million and a fair value of approximately $1,406.0 million. The Company believes that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future. Acquisition spending could potentially increase Company debt. However, management anticipates that the debt to capital ratio will remain generally consistent with historical levels. Operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy the Company various cash flow requirements, including acquisitions and capital expenditures. Management is not aware of any potential impairment to the Company liquidity, and the Company is in compliance with all of its long-term debt covenants. It is anticipated that in 2007 any funding requirements above cash generated from operations will be met through the issuance of commercial paper or, depending upon market conditions, through the issuance of long-term debt or some combination of the two. As of December 31, 2006, there were two interest rate swap agreements outstanding for a total notional amount of $100.0 million, designated as fair value hedges on part of the Company $150.0 million 6.25% Notes due on June 1, 2008. One $50 million interest rate swap exchanges fixed-rate interest for variable-rate interest. The other $50 million swap is designated in foreign currency and exchanges fixed-rate interest for variable-rate interest, and also hedges a portion of the Company net investment in foreign operations. The swap agreements have reduced the effective interest rate on the notes to 5.78%. There is no hedge ineffectiveness, and the fair value of the interest rate swaps outstanding as of December 31, 2006 was determined through market quotation. During the third quarter of 2006, the Company closed a structured five-year, non-interest bearing, $165.1 million amortizing loan with a non-US lender which also included a participation fee received by the Company of $9.9 million. The loan was recorded at face value. The Company also expects to incur a total of $5.7 million in debt related issuance costs. Beginning in April 2007, the repayment schedule requires payments every April and September with the final payment to be made in July 2011. The participation fee will be amortized ratably into Other Expense (Income), Net over the term of the loan and is recorded in Other Deferrals in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The loan agreement includes a put and call provision that can be exercised starting in June 2008 though the end of the loan term. 19 Table of Contents At December 31, 2006, the Company had open foreign exchange forward purchase contracts expiring through March 2007 related to fair value hedges of foreign currency exposures as follows: Currencies Sold U.S. Average Average Singapore Average Dollar Contract Euro Contract Dollar Contract Currencies Purchased Value Rate Value Rate Value Rate (In thousands) Euro $ 62,480 1.3127 4,481 2.0420 Singapore Dollar 9,121 0.4897 Swiss Franc 5,071 0.8097 1,331 0.6297 The Company credit ratings, which are independently developed by the respective rating agencies, are as follows for the years ended December 31,: 2006 2005 Short term Long term Short term Long term Moody P-1 A2 P-1 A2 Standard & Poor A-1 A A-1 A Fitch F1 A F1 A A summary of the Company undiscounted long-term debt, commitments and obligations as of December 31, 2006 and the years when these obligations are expected to be due is as follows: Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter (In thousands) Long-term debt $ 1,512,758 $ 32,267 $ 185,863 $ 34,995 $ 33,102 $ 1,226,531 Interest expense 984,858 79,435 73,966 70,059 70,059 691,339 Rental commitments 174,443 42,959 34,108 25,393 18,286 53,697 Purchase obligations 28,536 27,744 721 71 Capital leases 16,688 2,608 2,379 1,822 1,289 8,590 Supplemental & post- retirement benefits 189,000 15,000 14,000 17,000 33,000 110,000 Other long-term obligations 4,872 1,504 991 678 529 1,170 Total obligations $ 2,911,155 $ 201,517 $ 312,028 $ 150,018 $ 156,265 $ 2,091,327 (2) RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2006 COMPARED TO 2005 Consolidated Results of Operations Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased 22% over 2005, due to increases at all six segments led by increases of $322.6 million at Resources and $334.6 million at Electronics. Resources revenue increased due to positive market fundamentals, acquisitions and improved operating efficiencies while Electronics revenue increased due to acquisitions and strong organic growth. Overall, Dover organic revenue growth was 14%, acquisition growth was 8% and the impact from foreign exchange was negligible. Gross profit increased 25% to $2,348.0 million from 2005 while the gross profit margin increased 80 basis points to 36.1%. Selling and administrative expenses of $1,436.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $224.8 million over the comparable 2005 period, primarily due to increased revenue activity and $26.4 million of equity compensation expense related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 123(R), Share Based Payment ( SFAS No. 123(R) ), which required companies to expense the fair value of equity compensation, such as stock options and stock-settled stock appreciation rights ( SSARs ), primarily over the related vesting period. The Company used the modified prospective method to adopt SFAS No. 123(R), which did 20 Table of Contents not require the restatement of prior periods. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 22.1% from 22.7% in 2005. Excluding the effect of SFAS No. 123(R), selling and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been $1,409.8 million or 21.7% of revenue. Interest expense, net, increased 6.6% to $77.0 million for 2006, compared to $72.2 million for 2005 due to higher average outstanding borrowings and average commercial paper rates. Other (Income) Expense, net for 2006 of $12.0 million was driven primarily by foreign exchange losses. Other (Income) Expense, net of ($12.3) million for 2005 included foreign exchange gains of $7.5 million. The 2006 tax rate for continuing operations was 26.7%, reflecting the effect of the full year retroactive extension of the U.S. federal research credit, a favorable mix of foreign earnings in low-taxed overseas jurisdictions, a lower relative U.S. federal tax exclusion for foreign sales in 2006 and the inclusion of a $7.8 million net benefit primarily related to the resolution of a state income tax issue. The 2005 tax rate for continuing operations of 26.5% included a $9.5 million provision related to the repatriation of $373.7 million of dividends and a $25.5 million benefit primarily related to the resolution of U.S. tax issues and a $5.5 million benefit related to a favorable federal tax court decision. Excluding the repatriation provision, the full year 2005 tax rate for continuing operations was 24.9%. Earnings from continuing operations for 2006 were $822.9 million or $2.94 per diluted share compared to $607.3 million or $2.19 per diluted share. For 2006, net earnings were $561.8 million, or $2.73 per diluted share, which included a $41.5 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, loss from discontinued operations, compared to $510.1 million, or $2.50 per diluted share for 2005, which included $63.9 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, in earnings from discontinued operations. Refer to Note 8 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on discontinued operations.

Operating margin decreased 50 basis points as the impact of the revenue growth was offset by softness in markets served by the Industrial Equipment group. Backlog reached a record high on a 6% increase in bookings for the year. Industrial Equipment revenue was up 3% over the prior year, mainly due to the commercial aerospace market. Earnings decreased 6%, as the leverage on increased revenue was offset by softness in light construction and agricultural markets, the cost of productivity initiatives, higher material costs, and lower margin aerospace revenue. Bookings decreased 5% and backlog increased 2% over the prior year. Process Equipment group revenue increased 18% over the prior year due to robust heat exchanger and energy markets. Improved pricing and productivity partially offset by weak demand for print control systems contributed to the 25% earnings growth over the prior year. Bookings and backlog increased 28% and 64%, respectively, when compared to the prior year. 21 Table of Contents Electronics Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2006 2005 % Change (In thousands) Revenue $ 880,685 $ 546,043 61 % Segment earnings 119,425 46,888 155 % Operating margin 13.6 % 8.6 % Bookings 888,244 571,983 55 % Book-to-Bill 1.01 1.05 Backlog 150,143 141,102 6 % The increases in revenue and earnings at Electronics compared to the prior year were due to the third quarter 2005 acquisitions of Knowles Electronics and Colder Products and significant organic revenue growth of 21% for the year due to strength in the core Components businesses. Components revenue increased 81%, while operating earnings increased 187% compared to the prior year, as a result of the Knowles and Colder acquisitions and strong organic growth, particularly in the frequency controls and micro acoustics markets. Acquisitions accounted for 52% and 63% of the revenue and earnings growth, respectively. Bookings and backlog increased 72% and 7%, respectively, when compared to the prior year. Commercial equipment revenue increased 9% while earnings decreased 8%, due to weakness in the ATM business. Bookings increased 8%, while backlog decreased 8%, when compared to the prior year.

Overall, the segment had organic revenue growth of 13% during the year, with the remainder primarily from acquisitions. Oil and Gas Equipment delivered strong results throughout 2006 with revenue and earnings increases of 37% and 52%, respectively, over the prior year. Commodity pricing for oil and gas began moderating in the second quarter of 2006, however, strong activity in exploration, production and drilling continued to drive the positive 2006 results. The group continues to add capacity judiciously to meet increasing levels of demand. Bookings increased by 37% and backlog increased 72% when compared to the prior year. Fluid Solutions revenue and earnings increased 8% and 3%, respectively, when compared to the prior year. The revenue increase was due to improvements in mobile transport equipment, global demand for retail petroleum equipment and support equipment for the growing ethanol business. Product mix had a negative impact on earnings and margin. Bookings increased 9% and backlog increased 27% when compared to the prior year. Material Handling revenue increased 20% while earnings increased 13% compared to the prior year .

Bookings increased 26% and backlog increased 2% compared to the prior year. Product Identification ( PI ) revenue increased 21% and earnings increased 37% over the prior year, reflecting successful results from all product lines and regions as well as the impact of the Markem and O Neil acquisitions which contributed 12% to the group revenue growth for the year. Bookings increased 18% and backlog increased 64%. 2005 COMPARED WITH 2004 Consolidated Results of Operations Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased 19.1% or $853.9 from 2004, primarily driven by increases at all six segments led by $278.7 million at Resources and $142.2 million at Electronics. Resources revenue increased due to positive market fundamentals, acquisitions and improved operating efficiencies. Electronics revenue was impacted by the acquisition of two significant Components companies in the third quarter of 2005 along with operating improvements in the core businesses. Overall, Dover organic revenue growth was 10%, acquisition growth was 9%, and the foreign exchange impact was negligible. Gross profit increased 17.3% to $1,878.7 million, while gross profit margin of 35.2% decreased 50 basis points. Selling and administrative expenses for 2005 were $1,211.5 million, or 22.7% of revenue, compared to $1,053.1 million or 23.5% of revenue in 2004. The increase in selling and administrative expenses included increases in compensation and pension benefits along with the impact of the 2005 acquisitions. Operating earnings of $667.2 million for 2005 increased $119.1 million compared to the prior year due primarily to the 19.1% increase in revenue, benefits from improved operating efficiencies and improved global economic conditions. Operating margin for 2005 increased 30 basis points to 12.5%. Net interest expense increased 18.1% to $72.2 million for 2005, compared to $61.1 million for 2004, primarily due to the increase in net interest expense from higher outstanding borrowings used to fund 2005 acquisitions. Other (Income) Expense, net for 2005 of ($12.3) million was driven primarily by foreign exchange gains. Other (Income) Expense, net of ($5.1) million for 2004 included favorable settlements and miscellaneous credits of $11.8 million, which were largely offset by foreign exchange losses of $6.7 million. 24 Table of Contents The 2005 effective tax rate for continuing operations was 26.5% compared to 26.4% in 2004 and included a $9.5 million U.S. tax provision related to the repatriation of $373.7 million of dividends, a $25.5 million benefit primarily related to the resolution of U.S. tax issues, and a $5.5 million first quarter benefit related to a favorable federal tax court decision. Excluding the repatriation provision, the full year 2005 effective tax rate for continuing operations was 24.9%. Earnings from continuing operations for 2005 were $446.2 million or $2.19 per diluted share compared to $362.4 million or $1.77 per diluted share in 2004. For 2005, net earnings were $510.1 million or $2.50 per diluted share, which included $63.9 million or $0.31 per diluted share in earnings from discontinued operations, compared to $412.8 million or $2.02 per diluted share for 2004, which included $50.3 million or $0.25 per diluted share in earnings from discontinued operations.

Industrial Equipment revenue and earnings increased 29% and 19%, respectively, over the prior year. The revenue increase was driven primarily by strength in the aerospace and construction markets. The margin decrease resulted from unfavorable product mix and acquisition-related costs, partially offset by volume increases and moderating raw material pricing. The automotive and powersports business was down as gains from the North American professional racing market were not enough to offset a weak powersports market. Bookings increased 26% and backlog increased 25%. Process Equipment full-year revenue and earnings rose 19% and 33%, respectively, and margin grew to over 15%, reflecting double digit revenue growth in all areas, and significant earnings and margin growth in the oil and gas market for bearings. In addition, overall growth was driven by the expanding HVAC markets for heat exchangers, as well as productivity gains. Bookings increased 20% and backlog grew 30%.

Components operating earnings increased 207% in 2005 compared to the prior year on a 57% increase in revenue, reflecting the acquisitions, and revenue and earnings growth in almost all of the other Components businesses. The margin grew to exceed 12% and was aided by the two acquisitions and included $5.3 million of integration costs related to a 2004 Vectron acquisition. Bookings increased 65% and backlog grew 89%. Commercial Equipment full year revenue was flat, with earnings down 23% and a substantial decrease in margin, reflecting some market softness and the effect of Hurricane Katrina, which disrupted the ATM operations significantly in the third quarter of 2005. Bookings decreased 2% and backlog grew 23%.

Industries earnings increase was partially offset by a decrease at the Service Equipment group. Bookings and backlog both exceeded prior-year levels on improved strength in the environmental and military markets. Strong military sales and strength in the oil field industry contributed to Mobile Equipment revenue and earnings increases of 15% and 41%, respectively, with significant margin improvement. Earnings were also positively impacted by a gain of approximately $1 million on the sale of a facility and cost control initiatives. Bookings increased 14% driven by strong demand for trailer and refuse products and backlog increased 15%. Service Equipment revenue and margin were flat while earnings declined moderately, reflecting overall end market conditions and weakness in the automotive service industry. Earnings were negatively impacted by product mix, new product introduction costs, and a facility shutdown. Bookings were essentially flat, while backlog increased 18%.

Bookings were up 11%, and backlog was up 10%. Material Handling realized an increase in revenue of 14% while earnings, which included strategic realignment costs at one of the businesses, grew 6%. The increase in revenue was driven by demand in the construction, crane, aerial lift, petroleum, and military markets, partially offset by slow demand from the automotive industry. Bookings were up 11% and backlog was up 20%.

A&M revenue was essentially flat and earnings declined 25% in 2005 compared to the prior year, reflecting restructuring charges of approximately $6 million, principally related to certain facility closures, and general sales 27 Table of Contents declines, except at the screen printer rework equipment companies. Bookings increased 9% and backlog increased 59%. PI reported a revenue increase of 41%, while earnings increased 30%. The revenue and earnings increases were primarily attributable to the impact of the Datamax acquisition at the end of 2004, partially offset by approximately $2 million of restructuring costs, weakness in printing equipment markets and price competitiveness for marking equipment. Bookings increased 41% and backlog increased 3%. Critical Accounting Policies The Company consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ). GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in the public disclosures of the Company, including information regarding contingencies, risk and its financial condition. The Company believes its use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conform to GAAP and are consistently applied. Valuations based on estimates are reviewed for reasonableness on a consistent basis throughout the Company. Primary areas where the financial information of Dover is subject to the use of estimates, assumptions and the application of judgment include the following areas: Revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, b) price is fixed or determinable, c) collectibility is reasonably assured, and d) delivery has occurred. In revenue transactions where installation is required, revenue can be recognized when the installation obligation is not essential to the functionality of the delivered products. Revenue transactions involving non-essential installation obligations are those which can generally be completed in a short period of time at insignificant cost and the skills required to complete these installations are not unique to the Company and in many cases can be provided by third parties or the customers. If the installation obligation is essential to the functionality of the delivered product, revenue recognition is deferred until installation is complete. In addition, when it is determined that there are multiple deliverables to a sales arrangement, the Company will allocate consideration received to the separate deliverables based on their relative fair values and recognize revenue based on the appropriate criteria for each deliverable identified. In a limited number of revenue transactions, other post shipment obligations such as training and customer acceptance are required and, accordingly, revenue recognition is deferred until the customer is obligated to pay, or acceptance has been confirmed. Service revenue is recognized and earned when services are performed. Allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated at the individual operating companies based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances. Estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses, adjusting for current economic conditions and, in some cases, evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss. The establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances. Due to the fact that Dover operates in many different markets, changes in economic conditions in specific markets generally should not have a material effect on reserve balances required. Inventory for the majority of the Company subsidiaries, including all international subsidiaries and the Technologies segment, are stated at the lower of cost, determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis, or market. Other domestic inventory is stated at cost, determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis, which is less than market value. Under certain market conditions, estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventory are employed by the Company to properly value inventory. Technologies companies tend to experience higher levels of inventory value fluctuations, particularly given the relatively high rate of product obsolescence over relatively short periods of time. Occasionally, the Company will establish restructuring reserves at an operation in accordance with appropriate accounting principles. These reserves, for both severance and exit costs, require the use of estimates. Though Dover believes that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs, actual results may be different than the estimated amounts. 28 Table of Contents Dover has significant tangible and intangible assets on its balance sheet that include goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and amortization lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates. The testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines (including SFAS No. 142) for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to the identification of reporting units and the determination of fair market value. Dover assets and reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or when indicators of impairment exist. The Company believes that its use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting principles. Changes in business conditions could potentially require adjustments to the valuations. The valuation of Dover pension and other post-retirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assets/liabilities. These assumptions include discount rates, investment returns, projected salary increases and benefits, and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used in Dover pension reporting are reviewed annually and are compared with external benchmarks to assure that they accurately account for Dover future pension obligations. Changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on Dover pension expenses and related funding requirements. Dover expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual returns, economic trends and portfolio allocation. Dover discount rate assumption is determined by constructing a portfolio of bonds to match the expected benefit stream to be paid from the Company pension plans. The benefit payment stream is assumed to be funded from bond coupons and maturities, as well as interest on the excess cash flows from the bond portfolio. Dover has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly. These assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies. Reserves are also estimated for ongoing audits regarding federal, state and international issues that are currently unresolved. The Company routinely monitors the potential impact of these situations and believes that it is properly reserved. Valuations related to tax accruals and assets can be impacted by changes in accounting regulations, changes in tax codes and rulings, changes in statutory tax rates, and the Company future taxable income levels. Dover has significant accruals and reserves related to its risk management program. These accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability. The Company estimates losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions, Dover experience, and relevant industry data. Dover considers the current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and Company experience. Dover has established reserves for environmental and legal contingencies at both the operating company and corporate levels. A significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify Dover ultimate exposure in these matters. The valuation of reserves for contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis at the operating and corporate levels to assure that Dover is properly reserved. Reserve balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional reserves for emerging issues. While Dover believes that the current level of reserves is adequate, future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations. The Company from time to time will discontinue certain operations for various reasons. Estimates are used to adjust, if necessary, the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations to their estimated fair value less costs to sell. These estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of the sale. The adjustments to fair market value of these operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold. Changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially require future adjustments to these estimates. The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of SSARs and stock options that are granted to employees. The model requires management to estimate the expected life of the SSAR or option and the volatility of Dover stock using historical data. For additional information related to the assumptions used, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 29 Table of Contents New Accounting Standards Effective January, 1 2006, Dover adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. See Notes 1 and 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the adoption of this standard. Effective December 31, 2006, Dover adopted SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an Amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) ( SFAS No. 158 ). See Notes 2 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the adoption of this standard. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes ( FIN 48 ). FIN 48 clarifies the way companies are to account for uncertainty in income tax reporting and filing and prescribes a consistent recognition threshold and measurement attribute for recognizing, derecognizing, and measuring the tax benefits of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, on a tax return. Any change in net assets as a result of adopting the new standard is required to be recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to Dover opening retained earnings balance as of January 1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company retained earnings balance as of January 1, 2007. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current year Financial Statements ( SAB 108 ), which provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. SAB 108 is effective as of the end of Dover 2006 fiscal year, allowing a one-time transitional cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings as of January 1, 2006 for errors that were not previously deemed material, but are material under the guidance in SAB 108. The adoption of SAB 108 as of December 31, 2006 had no impact on Dover financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ( SFAS No. 157 ), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement is effective for fiscal periods beginning after November 15, 2007 and does not require any new fair value measurements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 157 on its overall results of operations or financial position. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections ( SFAS No. 154 ), which replaces APB No. 20 Accounting Changes, and SFAS No. 3 Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. SFAS No. 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle, and applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles, as well as changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that it does not include specific transition provisions. Specifically, SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements, unless it is impracticable to determine the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No. 154 does not change the transition provisions of any existing pronouncement. SFAS No. 154 is effective for Dover for all accounting changes and corrections of errors made beginning January 1, 2006 and had no impact on Dover. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, An Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4 ( SFAS No. 151 ). SFAS No. 151 requires that abnormal amounts of idle capacity and spoilage costs be excluded from the cost of inventory and expensed when incurred. The provisions of SFAS No. 151 were applicable to inventory costs incurred beginning January 1, 2006. The effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 151 was immaterial to Dover consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Non-GAAP Disclosures In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company results as determined by GAAP, the Company also discloses non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow, net debt, total capitalization, operational working capital, revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities, debt or equity, revenue 30 Table of Contents and working capital as determined in accordance with GAAP and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes the net debt to total capitalization ratio and free cash flow are important measures of operating performance and liquidity. Net debt to total capitalization is helpful in evaluating the Company capital structure and the amount of leverage it employs. Free cash flow provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions, pay dividends, repay debt and repurchase Dover common stock. Reconciliations of free cash flow and net debt can be found above in this Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis. Management believes that reporting operational working capital (also sometimes called adjusted working capital ), which is calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable, provides a meaningful measure of the Company operational results by showing the changes caused solely by revenue. In addition, management believes that reporting operational working capital and revenue at constant currency, which excludes the positive or negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, provides a meaningful measure of the Company operational changes, given the global nature of Dover businesses. Management also believes that reporting organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions, provides a useful comparison of the Company revenue performance and trends between periods.
