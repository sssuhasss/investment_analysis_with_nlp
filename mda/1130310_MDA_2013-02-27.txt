Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in combination with our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 herein. OVERVIEW Background We are a public utility holding company whose indirect wholly owned subsidiaries include: CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC (CenterPoint Houston), which engages in the electric transmission and distribution business in a 5,000-square mile area of the Texas Gulf Coast that includes the city of Houston; and CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. (CERC Corp. and, together with its subsidiaries, CERC), which owns and operates natural gas distribution systems in six states. Subsidiaries of CERC Corp. own interstate natural gas pipelines and gas gathering systems and provide various ancillary services. A wholly owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. offers variable and fixed-price physical natural gas supplies primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities. Business Segments In this Management Discussion and Analysis, we discuss our results from continuing operations on a consolidated basis and individually for each of our business segments. We also discuss our liquidity, capital resources and certain critical accounting policies. We are first and foremost an energy delivery company and it is our intention to remain focused on this segment of the energy business. The results of our business operations are significantly impacted by weather, customer growth, economic conditions, cost management, competition, rate proceedings before regulatory agencies and other actions of the various regulatory agencies to whose jurisdiction we are subject. Our electric transmission and distribution services are subject to rate regulation and are reported in the Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment, as are impacts of generation-related stranded costs and other true-up balances recoverable by the regulated electric utility. Our natural gas distribution services are also subject to rate regulation and are reported in the Natural Gas Distribution business segment. A summary of our reportable business segments as of December 31, 2012 is set forth below: Electric Transmission & Distribution Our electric transmission and distribution operations provide electric transmission and distribution services to retail electric providers (REPs) serving over two million metered customers in a 5,000-square-mile area of the Texas Gulf Coast that has a population of approximately six million people and includes the city of Houston. On behalf of REPs, CenterPoint Houston delivers electricity from power plants to substations, from one substation to another and to retail electric customers in locations throughout CenterPoint Houston certificated service territory. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (ERCOT) serves as the regional reliability coordinating council for member electric power systems in Texas. ERCOT membership is open to consumer groups, investor and municipally-owned electric utilities, rural electric cooperatives, independent generators, power marketers, river authorities and REPs. The ERCOT market represents approximately 85% of the demand for power in Texas and is one of the nation largest power markets. Transmission and distribution services are provided under tariffs approved by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (Texas Utility Commission). Natural Gas Distribution CERC owns and operates our regulated natural gas distribution business (Gas Operations), which engages in intrastate natural gas sales to, and natural gas transportation for, approximately 3.3 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas. Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services CERC operations also include non-rate regulated natural gas sales to, and transportation services for, commercial and industrial customers in 21 states in the central and eastern regions of the United States. 30 Interstate Pipelines CERC interstate pipelines business owns and operates approximately 8,000 miles of natural gas transmission lines primarily located in Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. It also owns and operates six natural gas storage fields with a combined daily deliverability of approximately 1.3 billion cubic feet (Bcf) and a combined working gas capacity of approximately 59 Bcf. It owns a 50% interest in Southeast Supply Header, LLC (SESH). SESH owns a 1.0 Bcf per day, 274-mile interstate pipeline that runs from the Perryville Hub in Louisiana to Coden, Alabama. Most storage operations are in north Louisiana and Oklahoma. Field Services CERC field services business owns and operates approximately 4,600 miles of gathering pipelines and processing plants that collect, treat and process natural gas primarily from three regions located in major producing fields in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. Other Operations Our other operations business segment includes office buildings and other real estate used in our business operations and other corporate operations which support all of our business operations. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Factors Influencing Our Business We are an energy delivery company. The majority of our revenues are generated from the gathering, processing, transportation and sale of natural gas and the transmission and delivery of electricity by our subsidiaries. We do not own or operate electric generating facilities or make retail sales to end-use electric customers. To assess our financial performance, our management primarily monitors operating income and cash flows from our business segments. Within these broader financial measures, we monitor margins, operation and maintenance expense, interest expense, capital spending and working capital requirements. In addition to these financial measures we also monitor a number of variables that management considers important to the operation of our business segments, including the number of customers, throughput, use per customer, commodity prices and heating and cooling degree days. We also monitor system reliability, safety factors and customer satisfaction to gauge our performance. To the extent adverse economic conditions affect our suppliers and customers, results from our energy delivery businesses may suffer. Reduced demand and lower energy prices could lead to financial pressure on some of our customers who operate within the energy industry. Also, adverse economic conditions, coupled with concerns for protecting the environment, may cause consumers to use less energy or avoid expansions of their facilities, resulting in less demand for our services. Performance of our Electric Transmission & Distribution and Natural Gas Distribution business segments is significantly influenced by the number of customers and energy usage per customer. Weather conditions can have a significant impact on energy usage, and we compare our results on a weather adjusted basis. The Houston area experienced extremely hot and dry weather during 2011, and each month from April through September was one of the ten warmest months on record. In 2012, we experienced a return to more normal weather in the summer months. However, every state in which we distribute natural gas had the warmest winter on record. In recent years, customers have typically reduced their energy consumption, and reduced consumption can adversely affect our results. However, due to more affordable energy prices and continued economic recovery in the areas we serve, the trend toward lower usage has slowed in some of the areas we serve. In addition, in many of our service areas, particularly in the Houston area and in Minnesota, we have benefited from growth in the number of customers that also tends to mitigate the effects of reduced consumption. We anticipate that this growth will continue as the regions experience a continued economic recovery. The profitability of our businesses is influenced significantly by the regulatory treatment we receive from the various state and local regulators who set our electric and gas distribution rates. In recent rate filings, we have sought rate mechanisms that help to decouple our results from the impacts of weather and variations in usage from levels reflected in rates, but such rate mechanisms have not yet been approved in all jurisdictions. We plan to continue to pursue such decoupling mechanisms in our future rate filings. Our Field Services and Interstate Pipelines business segments are currently benefiting from their proximity to significant natural gas producing regions in Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. In our Field Services business segment, the development of shale formations has helped offset declines in production from more traditional basins. The recent decline in natural gas prices has contributed to reductions in drilling activity in dry gas shale formations as well, including those served by our Field Services business segment. Many producers have shifted their focus to liquids-rich natural gas or crude oil basins. A 31 reduction in drilling activity may result in lower throughput volumes on our systems as the wells decline over time. However, a significant amount of the volumes gathered by systems we recently developed in shale basins such as the Haynesville and Fayetteville shales are supported by contracts with annual volume commitments, or price adjustment mechanisms that provide for minimum returns on capital deployed. In monitoring performance of the segments, we focus on throughput of the pipelines and gathering systems, and in the case of Field Services, on the number of well-connects. Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment contracts with customers for transportation, storage and sales of natural gas on an unregulated basis. Its operations serve customers in the central and eastern regions of the United States. The segment benefits from favorable price differentials, either on a geographic basis or on a seasonal basis. While this business utilizes financial derivatives to hedge its exposure to price movements, it does not engage in speculative or proprietary trading and maintains a low value at risk level, or VaR, to avoid significant financial exposures. Lower geographic and seasonal price differentials during 2010, 2011 and 2012 adversely affected results for this business segment. The nature of our businesses requires significant amounts of capital investment, and we rely on internally generated cash, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from commercial paper and issuances of debt and equity in the capital markets to satisfy these capital needs. We strive to maintain investment grade ratings for our securities in order to access the capital markets on terms we consider reasonable. Our goal is to continue to improve our credit ratings over time. A reduction in our ratings generally would increase our borrowing costs for new issuances of debt, as well as borrowing costs under our existing revolving credit facilities, and may prevent us from accessing the commercial paper markets. Disruptions in the financial markets can also affect the availability of new capital on terms we consider attractive. In those circumstances, companies like us may not be able to obtain certain types of external financing or may be required to accept terms less favorable than they would otherwise accept. For that reason, we seek to maintain adequate liquidity for our businesses through existing credit facilities and prudent refinancing of existing debt. We expect to make contributions to our pension plan aggregating approximately $83 million in 2013 and may need to make larger contributions in subsequent years. Consistent with the regulatory treatment of such costs, we can defer the amount of pension expense that differs from the level of pension expense included in our base rates for our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment and our Gas Operations in Texas. Significant Events Acquisition On July 31, 2012, we purchased the 50% interest that we did not already own in Waskom Gas Processing Company (Waskom), a Texas general partnership, which owns and operates a natural gas processing plant and natural gas gathering assets, as well as other gathering and related assets from a third-party for approximately $273 million. The amount of the purchase price allocated to the acquisition of the 50% interest in Waskom was approximately $201 million, with the remaining purchase price allocated to the other gathering assets, based on a discounted cash flow methodology. The purchase of the 50% interest in Waskom was determined to be a business combination achieved in stages, and as such we recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $136 million on July 31, 2012, which is the result of remeasuring our original 50% interest in Waskom to fair value. As a result of the purchase, we recorded goodwill of $24 million, which includes $17 million related to Waskom (including the re-measurement of our existing 50% interest) and $7 million related to the other gathering and related assets. Goodwill Impairment We performed our annual impairment test in the third quarter of 2012 and determined that a non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the amount of $252 million was required for the Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services reportable segment. We also determined that no impairment charge was required for any other reportable segment. The adverse wholesale market conditions facing our energy services business, specifically the prospects for continued low geographic and seasonal price differentials for natural gas, led to a reduction in the estimate of the fair value of goodwill associated with this reporting unit. Debt Financing Transactions In January 2012, CenterPoint Energy Transition Bond Company IV, LLC (Bond Company IV) issued $1.695 billion of transition bonds in three tranches with interest rates ranging from 0.9012% to 3.0282% and final maturity dates ranging from April 15, 2018 to October 15, 2025. Through the issuance of these transition bonds, CenterPoint Houston recovered the additional true-up balance of $1.695 billion, less approximately $10.4 million of offering expenses. The transition bonds will be repaid through a charge imposed on customers in CenterPoint Houston service territory. 32 In February 2012, we purchased $275 million aggregate principal amount of pollution control bonds issued on our behalf at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued interest pursuant to the mandatory tender provisions of the bonds. The purchased pollution control bonds will remain outstanding and may be remarketed. Prior to the purchase, the pollution control bonds had fixed interest rates ranging from 5.15% to 5.95%. Additionally, in March 2012, we redeemed $100 million aggregate principal amount of pollution control bonds issued on our behalf at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued interest pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of the bonds. The redeemed pollution control bonds had a fixed interest rate of 5.25%. In August 2012, CenterPoint Houston issued $300 million of 2.25% general mortgage bonds due 2022 and $500 million of 3.55% general mortgage bonds due 2042. The net proceeds from the sale of the bonds were used to fund a portion of the redemption of the general mortgage bonds discussed below. In August 2012, CenterPoint Houston redeemed $300 million principal amount of its 5.75% general mortgage bonds due 2014 at a price of 107.332% of their principal amount and $500 million principal amount of its 7.00% general mortgage bonds due 2014 at a price of 109.397% of their principal amount. Redemption premiums for the two series aggregated approximately $69 million. CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE EARNINGS Our past earnings and results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future earnings and results of operations. The magnitude of our future earnings and results of our operations will depend on or be affected by numerous factors including: state and federal legislative and regulatory actions or developments affecting various aspects of our businesses, including, among others, energy deregulation or re-regulation, pipeline integrity and safety, health care reform, financial reform, tax legislation and actions regarding the rates charged by our regulated businesses; state and federal legislative and regulatory actions or developments relating to the environment, including those related to global climate change; timely and appropriate rate actions that allow recovery of costs and a reasonable return on investment; the timing and outcome of any audits, disputes and other proceedings related to taxes; problems with construction, implementation of necessary technology or other issues with respect to major capital projects that result in delays or in cost overruns that cannot be recouped in rates; industrial, commercial and residential growth in our service territory and changes in market demand, including the effects of energy efficiency measures and demographic patterns; the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices, particularly natural gas and natural gas liquids, the competitive effects of excess pipeline capacity in the regions we serve, and the effects of geographic and seasonal commodity price differentials, including the effects of these circumstances on re-contracting available capacity on our interstate pipelines ; the timing and extent of changes in the supply of natural gas, particularly supplies available for gathering by our field services business and transporting by our interstate pipelines, including the impact of natural gas and natural gas liquids prices on the level of drilling and production activities in the regions we serve; competition in our mid-continent region footprint for access to natural gas supplies and markets; weather variations and other natural phenomena, including the impact on operations and capital of severe weather events; any direct or indirect effects on our facilities, operations and financial condition resulting from terrorism, cyber-attacks, data security breaches or other attempts to disrupt our businesses or the businesses of third parties, or other catastrophic events; the impact of unplanned facility outages; timely and appropriate regulatory actions allowing securitization or other recovery of costs associated with any future hurricanes or natural disasters; 33 changes in interest rates or rates of inflation; commercial bank and financial market conditions, our access to capital, the cost of such capital, and the results of our financing and refinancing efforts, including availability of funds in the debt capital markets; actions by credit rating agencies; effectiveness of our risk management activities; inability of various counterparties to meet their obligations to us; non-payment for our services due to financial distress of our customers; the ability of GenOn Energy, Inc.

Year Ended December 31, 2010 2011 2012 Revenues $ 8,785 $ 8,450 $ 7,452 Expenses 7,536 7,152 6,414 Operating Income 1,249 1,298 1,038 Gain on Marketable Securities 67 19 154 Gain (Loss) on Indexed Debt Securities (31 ) 35 (71 ) Interest and Other Finance Charges (481 ) (456 ) (422 ) Interest on Transition and System Restoration Bonds (140 ) (127 ) (147 ) Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates 29 30 31 Return on True-Up Balance 352 Step acquisition gain 136 Other Income, net 12 23 38 Income Before Income Taxes and Extraordinary Item 705 1,174 757 Income Tax Expense 263 404 340 Income Before Extraordinary Item 442 770 417 Extraordinary Item, net of tax 587 Net Income $ 442 $ 1,357 $ 417 Basic Earnings Per Share: Income Before Extraordinary Item $ 1.08 $ 1.81 $ 0.98 Extraordinary Item, net of tax 1.38 Net Income $ 1.08 $ 3.19 $ 0.98 Diluted Earnings Per Share: Income Before Extraordinary Item $ 1.07 $ 1.80 $ 0.97 Extraordinary Item, net of tax 1.37 Net Income $ 1.07 $ 3.17 $ 0.97 2012 Compared to 2011 Net Income. We reported net income of $417 million ( $0.97 per diluted share) for 2012 compared to $1.357 billion ($3.17 per diluted share) for the same period in 2011. The decrease in net income of $940 million was primarily due to the resolution in 2011 of the true-up appeal resulting in an after-tax extraordinary gain of $587 million and a $352 million return on the true-up balance, a $260 million decrease in operating income (discussed by segment below), including a $252 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge, and a $106 million increase in the loss on our indexed debt securities, which were partially offset by a $136 million step acquisition gain related to the acquisition of an additional 50% interest in Waskom, a $135 million increase in the gain on our marketable securities, a $64 million decrease in income tax expense and a $14 million decrease in interest expense due to lower levels of debt. Income Tax Expense. We reported an effective tax rate of 44.9% for 2012 compared to 34.4% for the same period in 2011. The increase in the effective tax rate of 10.5% is due to goodwill impairment of $252 million which is non-deductible for tax purposes. It is partially offset by favorable tax adjustments, including the re-measurement of certain unrecognized tax benefits of $28 million related to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) settlement of tax years 2006 through 2009. 35 2011 Compared to 2010 Net Income. We reported net income of $1.357 billion ($3.17 per diluted share) for 2011 compared to $442 million ($1.07 per diluted share) for the same period in 2010. The increase in net income of $915 million was primarily due to the resolution of the true-up appeal resulting in an after-tax extraordinary gain of $587 million and a $352 million return on the true-up balance, a $66 million increase in the gain on our indexed debt securities, a $49 million increase in operating income and a $38 million decrease in interest expense due to lower levels of debt, which were partially offset by a $141 million increase in income tax expense and a $48 million decrease in the gain on our marketable securities. Income Tax Expense. We reported an effective tax rate of 34.4% for 2011 compared to 37.3% for the same period in 2010. The decrease in the effective tax rate of 2.9% is due to an $18 million reduction to the uncertain tax liability primarily related to the resolution of the tax normalization issue, a $21 million reduction to the deferred tax asset due to the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act recognized in 2010, a $24 million decrease to state tax expense due to the restructuring of certain subsidiaries in December 2010, and a $17 million state tax benefit primarily attributable to lower blended state tax rates and a reduction to the state deferred tax liability recorded in December 2011. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT The following table presents operating income (loss) (in millions) for each of our business segments for 2010 , 2011 and 2012 . Included in revenues are intersegment sales. We account for intersegment sales as if the sales were to third parties, that is, at current market prices.

Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment reported operating income of $639 million for 2012, consisting of $492 million from our regulated electric transmission and distribution utility operations (TDU) and $147 million related to transition and system restoration bond companies. For 2011, operating income totaled $623 million, consisting of $496 million from the TDU and $127 million related to transition and system restoration bond companies. TDU operating income decreased $4 million due to decreased usage ($54 million), primarily due to a return to more normal summer weather when compared to the previous year, and the impact of the 2010 rate case implemented in September 2011 ($34 million), partially offset by higher equity returns ($28 million) primarily related to true-up proceeds, increased miscellaneous revenues ($24 million), primarily from right-of-way easement grants, customer growth ($24 million) from the addition of over 44,000 new customers and decreased labor and benefits costs ($6 million). 2011 Compared to 2010. Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment reported operating income of $623 million for 2011, consisting of $496 million from our TDU and $127 million related to transition and system restoration bond companies. For 2010, operating income totaled $567 million, consisting of $427 million from the TDU and $140 million related to transition and system restoration bond companies. TDU operating income increased $69 million due to increased usage ($51 million), primarily due to favorable weather, customer growth ($22 million) from the addition of over 45,000 new customers, lower depreciation expense ($16 million) and higher transmission-related revenues net of the costs billed by transmission providers ($13 million), partially offset by the impact of the 2010 rate case implemented in September 2011 ($12 million) and other operating expense increases ($12 million). 37 Natural Gas Distribution The following table provides summary data of our Natural Gas Distribution business segment for 2010 , 2011 and 2012 (in millions, except throughput and customer data): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2011 2012 Revenues $ 3,213 $ 2,841 $ 2,342 Expenses: Natural gas 2,049 1,675 1,196 Operation and maintenance 639 655 637 Depreciation and amortization 166 166 173 Taxes other than income taxes 128 119 110 Total expenses 2,982 2,615 2,116 Operating Income $ 231 $ 226 $ 226 Throughput (in Bcf): Residential 177 172 140 Commercial and industrial 249 251 243 Total Throughput 426 423 383 Number of customers at end of period: Residential 3,016,333 3,036,267 3,058,695 Commercial and industrial 246,891 246,220 246,413 Total 3,263,224 3,282,487 3,305,108 2012 Compared to 2011. Our Natural Gas Distribution business segment reported operating income of $226 million for each of 2012 and 2011. Operating income was unchanged despite substantially reduced revenues from near record mild temperatures in the first quarter of 2012 that were partially mitigated by weather hedges and weather normalization adjustments ($21 million), increased depreciation and amortization expense ($7 million) and increased property taxes ($4 million). These adverse impacts were offset by certain reduced operation and maintenance expenses ($5 million), lower bad debt expense ($7 million), the addition of over 22,000 customers ($6 million) and rate increases ($12 million). Decreased expense related to energy efficiency programs ($4 million) and decreased expense related to lower gross receipts taxes ($12 million) were offset by a corresponding reduction in the related revenues. 2011 Compared to 2010. Our Natural Gas Distribution business segment reported operating income of $226 million for 2011 compared to $231 million for 2010. Operating income decreased $5 million primarily as a result of higher benefit costs ($8 million), lower miscellaneous revenues ($7 million) and higher other expenses ($9 million). These were partially offset by the addition of 19,000 customers ($5 million), lower bad debt expense ($8 million) and rate increases ($7 million). Increased expense related to energy efficiency programs ($19 million) and decreased expense related to lower gross receipt taxes ($10 million) were offset by the related revenues. 38 Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services The following table provides summary data of our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment for 2010 , 2011 and 2012 (in millions, except throughput and customer data): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2011 2012 Revenues $ 2,651 $ 2,511 $ 1,784 Expenses: Natural gas 2,591 2,458 1,730 Operation and maintenance 38 41 45 Depreciation and amortization 4 5 6 Taxes other than income taxes 2 1 1 Goodwill impairment 252 Total expenses 2,635 2,505 2,034 Operating Income (Loss) $ 16 $ 6 $ (250 ) Throughput (in Bcf) 548 558 562 Number of customers at end of period (1) 12,193 14,267 16,330 ___________________ (1) These numbers do not include approximately 12,700 natural gas customers as of December 31, 2012 that are under residential and small commercial choice programs invoiced by their host utility. 2012 Compared to 2011. Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment reported operating income, excluding the goodwill impairment discussed below, of $2 million for 2012 compared to $6 million for 2011. The decrease in operating income of $4 million was primarily due to a $24 million negative impact of mark-to-market accounting for derivatives associated with certain forward natural gas purchases and sales used to lock in economic margins. 2012 included mark-to-market charges of $16 million compared to a $8 million benefit for the same period of 2011. Substantially offsetting this decrease was a $20 million improvement in operating margins primarily as a result of the termination of uneconomic transportation contracts and an increase in retail sales customers and volumes. 2011 Compared to 2010. Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment reported operating income of $6 million for 2011 compared to $16 million for 2010. The decrease in operating income of $10 million was primarily due to reduced basis spreads on pipeline transport opportunities and decreased seasonal storage spreads of $9 million in 2011, which included a $5 million charge related to an early capacity release on pipeline transportation, as compared to 2010. Additionally, an $11 million write-down of natural gas inventory to the lower of cost or market occurred in 2011 as compared to a $6 million write-down in 2010. Offsetting these decreases to operating income is an increase in operating income of $4 million related to the favorable impact of the mark-to-market valuation for non-trading financial derivatives for 2011 of $8 million versus the favorable impact of $4 million for 2010. Goodwill Impairment A non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $252 million for our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment was recorded in 2012. The adverse wholesale market conditions facing our energy services business, specifically the prospects for continued low geographic and seasonal price differentials for natural gas, led to a reduction in our estimate of the fair value of goodwill associated with this reporting unit. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the goodwill impairment charge. 39 Interstate Pipelines The following table provides summary data of our Interstate Pipelines business segment for 2010 , 2011 and 2012 (in millions, except throughput data): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2011 2012 Revenues $ 601 $ 553 $ 502 Expenses: Natural gas 93 67 57 Operation and maintenance 153 152 153 Depreciation and amortization 52 54 56 Taxes other than income taxes 33 32 29 Total expenses 331 305 295 Operating Income $ 270 $ 248 $ 207 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates $ 19 $ 21 $ 26 Transportation throughput (in Bcf) 1,693 1,579 1,367 2012 Compared to 2011. Our Interstate Pipeline business segment reported operating income of $207 million for 2012 compared to $248 million for 2011. Operating income decreased $41 million primarily due to lower margins resulting from a backhaul contract that expired in 2011 ($16 million), as well as the associated reduction in compressor efficiency ($8 million) on the Carthage to Perryville pipeline due to lower volumes, lower off-system transportation revenues ($8 million), lower seasonal and market-sensitive transportation contracts ($7 million) and ancillary services ($7 million). These margin decreases were partially offset by the effects of the 10-year agreement with our natural gas distribution affiliate ($5 million) which we restructured in 2010. Operating income decreases due to higher operations and maintenance expenses ($1 million) and higher depreciation and amortization expenses ($2 million) due to asset additions were offset by lower taxes other than income taxes ($3 million). 2011 Compared to 2010. Our Interstate Pipeline business segment reported operating income of $248 million for 2011 compared to $270 million for 2010. Operating income decreased $22 million primarily due to a backhaul contract that expired in 2011 ($22 million), as well as the effects of the restructured 10-year agreement with our natural gas distribution affiliate ($11 million) and lower off-system revenues ($11 million). These margin decreases were partially offset by new firm transportation contracts and higher ancillary revenues ($22 million). Operating income increases due to lower operation and maintenance expenses ($1 million) and lower taxes other than income ($1 million) were offset by increased depreciation and amortization expenses ($2 million) related to new assets. Equity Earnings. In addition, this business segment recorded equity income of $19 million, $21 million and $26 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively, from its 50% interest in Southeast Supply Header, LLC (SESH), a jointly-owned pipeline. The 2012 increase in equity earnings primarily resulted from restructuring and extending a long-term agreement with an anchor shipper at the end of 2011. These amounts are included in Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates under the Other Income (Expense) caption in the Statements of Consolidated Income. 40 Field Services The following table provides summary data of our Field Services business segment for 2010 , 2011 and 2012 (in millions, except throughput data): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2011 2012 Revenues $ 338 $ 412 $ 506 Expenses: Natural gas 72 68 122 Operation and maintenance 85 112 115 Depreciation and amortization 25 37 50 Taxes other than income taxes 5 6 5 Total expenses 187 223 292 Operating Income $ 151 $ 189 $ 214 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates $ 10 $ 9 $ 5 Gathering throughput (in Bcf) 650 823 896 2012 Compared to 2011. Our Field Services business segment reported operating income of $214 million for 2012 compared to $189 million for 2011. Operating income increased $25 million primarily from increased margins ($36 million) due to gathering projects in the Haynesville shale, including revenues from throughput guarantees, growth in gathering services and retained natural gas volumes, and acquisitions completed during 2012 ($13 million), partially offset by lower commodity prices ($28 million) on sales of retained natural gas. Operating income also increased ($3 million) due to the classification of earnings from the 50% partnership interest in Waskom which we already owned as operating income beginning in August 2012 instead of equity earnings as reported for prior periods, due to our July 31, 2012 purchase of the 50% interest in Waskom that we did not already own. Lower operation and maintenance expenses ($7 million) were partially offset by higher depreciation expense ($6 million). 2011 Compared to 2010. Our Field Services business segment reported operating income of $189 million for 2011 compared to $151 million for 2010. Operating income increased $38 million primarily from increased margins due to gathering projects in the Haynesville and Fayetteville shales and growth in core gathering services, including revenues from throughput guarantees ($88 million), partially offset by lower commodity prices ($10 million) from sales of retained natural gas and reduced processing margins. Increases in operation and maintenance expenses ($6 million), depreciation expense ($12 million) and taxes other than income ($1 million) resulted primarily from the expansion of the Magnolia and Olympia gathering systems in North Louisiana. In addition, operating expenses in 2010 benefited from a gain on the sale of non-strategic gathering assets ($21 million). Equity Earnings. In addition, this business segment recorded equity income of $10 million, $9 million and $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively, from its 50% interest in Waskom. These amounts are included in Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates under the Other Income (Expense) caption in the Statements of Consolidated Income. As discussed above, beginning on August 1, 2012, financial results for Waskom are included in operating income. Other Operations The following table provides summary data for our Other Operations business segment for 2010 , 2011 and 2012 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2011 2012 Revenues $ 11 $ 11 $ 11 Expenses (Income) (3 ) 5 9 Operating Income $ 14 $ 6 $ 2 41 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Historical Cash Flows The net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for 2010 , 2011 and 2012 is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2011 2012 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,386 $ 1,888 $ 1,860 Investing activities (1,420 ) (1,206 ) (1,603 ) Financing activities (507 ) (661 ) 169 Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $28 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to increased net tax payments ( $251 million ) , which was partially offset by increased cash provided by net accounts receivable/payable ( $45 million ), increased cash provided by net regulatory assets and liabilities ( $35 million ), increased cash from non-trading derivatives ( $33 million ), increased cash related to gas storage inventory ($25 million), decreased net margin deposits ( $19 million ) and increased cash provided by fuel cost recovery ( $18 million ). Net cash provided by operating activities increased $502 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to increased tax refunds ($412 million), increased cash related to gas storage inventory ($41 million), decreased net margin deposits ($27 million) and increased cash provided by net regulatory assets and liabilities ($17 million), which were partially offset by decreased cash provided by net accounts receivable/payable ($108 million) and decreased cash provided by fuel cost recovery ($61 million). Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities increased $397 million in 2012 compared to 2011 due to increased cash paid for acquisitions ( $360 million ) and decreased cash received from the DOE grant ( $110 million ), which were partially offset by decreased capital expenditures ( $91 million ). Net cash used in investing activities decreased $214 million in 2011 compared to 2010 due to decreased capital expenditures ($206 million) and increased cash received from the DOE grant ($20 million). Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities increased $830 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to increased proceeds from long-term debt ( $1,945 million ) and decreased debt issuance costs ( $8 million ), which were partially offset by increased payments of long-term debt ( $681 million ), increased payments of commercial paper ( $387 million ), decreased short-term borrowings ( $33 million ), increased cash paid for debt retirement ( $11 million ) and increased payments of common stock dividends ( $9 million ). Net cash used in financing activities increased $154 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to decreased proceeds from the issuance of common stock ($410 million), increased payments of long-term debt ($126 million), decreased proceeds from commercial paper ($81 million), increased cash paid for debt exchange ($58 million), increased debt issuance costs ($22 million) and increased common stock dividend payments ($18 million), which were partially offset by increased proceeds from long-term debt ($550 million) and increased short-term debt borrowings ($11 million). 42 Future Sources and Uses of Cash Our liquidity and capital requirements are affected primarily by our results of operations, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, tax payments, working capital needs and various regulatory actions. Our principal anticipated cash requirements for 2013 include the following: capital expenditures of approximately $1.7 billion; the retirement of CenterPoint Houston and CERC long-term debt aggregating $815 million; scheduled principal payments on transition and system restoration bonds of $447 million; pension contributions aggregating approximately $83 million; and dividend payments on CenterPoint Energy common stock and interest payments on debt. We expect that cash on hand, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from commercial paper and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs in 2013 . Cash needs or discretionary financing or refinancing may result in the issuance of equity or debt securities in the capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. Issuances of equity or debt in the capital markets, funds raised in the commercial paper markets and additional credit facilities may not, however, be available to us on acceptable terms. The following table sets forth our capital expenditures for 2012 and estimates of our capital expenditures for currently identified or planned projects for 2013 through 2017 (in millions): 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Electric Transmission & Distribution $ 599 $ 720 $ 677 $ 557 $ 534 $ 512 Natural Gas Distribution 359 422 420 400 387 393 Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services 6 9 25 37 36 11 Interstate Pipelines 132 201 212 128 136 126 Field Services 52 271 114 88 70 71 Other Operations 40 43 30 45 56 52 Total $ 1,188 $ 1,666 $ 1,478 $ 1,255 $ 1,219 $ 1,165 Our capital expenditures are expected to be used for investment in infrastructure for our electric transmission and distribution operations, and our natural gas transmission, distribution and gathering operations. These capital expenditures are anticipated to maintain reliability and safety as well as expand our systems through value-added projects. 43 The following table sets forth estimates of our contractual obligations, including payments due by period (in millions): Contractual Obligations Total 2013 2014-2015 2016-2017 2018 and thereafter Transition and system restoration bond debt $ 3,847 $ 447 $ 726 $ 802 $ 1,872 Other long-term debt (1) 6,555 815 579 953 4,208 Interest payments transition and system restoration bond debt (2) 730 135 228 176 191 Interest payments other long-term debt (2) 3,759 327 579 497 2,356 Short-term borrowings 38 38 Capital leases 1 1 Operating leases (3) 48 12 15 8 13 Benefit obligations (4) Purchase obligations (5) 4 4 Non-trading derivative liabilities 16 14 2 Other commodity commitments (6) 1,389 430 558 245 156 Other 6 6 Total contractual cash obligations $ 16,393 $ 2,228 $ 2,687 $ 2,681 $ 8,797 ___________________ (1) 2.0% Zero-Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes due 2029 (ZENS) obligations are included in the 2018 and thereafter column at their contingent principal amount as of December 31, 2012 of $784 million. These obligations are exchangeable for cash at any time at the option of the holders for 95% of the current value of the reference shares attributable to each ZENS ($540 million at December 31, 2012 ), as discussed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. (2) We calculated estimated interest payments for long-term debt as follows: for fixed-rate debt and term debt, we calculated interest based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for variable-rate debt and/or non-term debt, we used interest rates in place as of December 31, 2012 . We typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operations and short-term borrowings. (3) For a discussion of operating leases, please read Note 13(c) to our consolidated financial statements. (4) In 2013, we expect to make contributions to our qualified pension plan aggregating approximately $83 million. We expect to contribute approximately $9 million and $18 million, respectively, to our non-qualified pension and postretirement benefits plans in 2013. (5) Represents capital commitments for material in connection with our Interstate Pipelines business segment. (6) For a discussion of other commodity commitments, please read Note 13(a) to our consolidated financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. Other than the guaranties described below and operating leases, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements. Prior to the distribution of our ownership in RRI to our shareholders, CERC had guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became RRI trading subsidiary. When the companies separated, RRI agreed to secure CERC against obligations under the guaranties RRI had been unable to extinguish by the time of separation. Pursuant to such agreement, as amended in December 2007, RRI (now GenOn) agreed to provide to CERC cash or letters of credit as security against CERC obligations under its remaining guaranties for demand charges under certain gas transportation agreements if and to the extent changes in market conditions expose CERC to a risk of loss on those guaranties based on an annual calculation, with any required collateral to be posted each December. The undiscounted maximum potential payout of the demand charges under these transportation contracts, which will be in effect until 2018, was approximately $73 million as of December 31, 2012 . Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2012 at the time the most recent annual calculation was made under the agreement, GenOn was not obligated to post any security. As a result, CenterPoint Energy returned to GenOn in the fourth quarter of 2012 the approximately $28 million of aggregate collateral previously posted by GenOn under the agreement. If GenOn should fail to perform the contractual 44 obligations, CERC could have to honor its guarantee and, in such event, any collateral then provided as security may be insufficient to satisfy CERC obligations. Regulatory Matters. Regulatory developments that have occurred since our 2011 Form 10-K was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are discussed below. CenterPoint Houston June 2010 Rate Case . The order on rehearing issued by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (Texas Utility Commission) in connection with CenterPoint Houston's 2010 rate case was appealed to the Texas courts by various parties and a trial was scheduled for December 2012. In December 2012, the parties entered into a settlement agreement prior to the trial dismissing all material provisions of the appeals. Other . In May 2012, CenterPoint Houston filed an application, subsequently modified consistent with the Texas Utility Commission's preliminary order, requesting approval to recover a total of approximately $47.5 million in 2013 consisting of: (1) estimated 2013 energy efficiency program costs of $42.9 million; (2) a credit of $1.8 million related to the over-recovery of 2011 program costs; (3) a performance incentive for 2011 program achievements of $6.3 million and (4) certain rate case expenses. In October 2012, the Texas Utility Commission approved a settlement agreement filed by the parties to recover a total of $46.2 million. The $1.3 million reduction was attributable to settlement spending from CenterPoint Houston's 2006 rate settlement included in the 2011 performance incentive calculation. The settlement preserves the right for CenterPoint Houston to appeal the reduction in its requested performance bonus amount. The rates took effect with the commencement of CenterPoint Houston's January 2013 billing month. Gas Operations Beaumont/East Texas Rate Case. In July 2012, the natural gas distribution business of CERC (Gas Operations) filed a general rate case with the Railroad Commission of Texas (Railroad Commission) and certain municipalities requesting an increase of approximately $8.6 million based on a proposed rate of return of 9.09%, a return on equity (ROE) of 11.00%, and a capital structure with 42% debt and 58% equity. Rates went into effect in August 2012 for 24 cities. All other cities suspended the rates for up to 90 days or denied any increase outright. The Railroad Commission suspended the rates for the environs and for the cities that have given up original jurisdiction for up to 150 days. On November 5, 2012, rates went into effect for another 13 cities. On November 15, 2012, a Unanimous Settlement Agreement was signed by all parties and resolved all issues resulting in a net revenue requirement increase of $6.2 million. On December 4, 2012, the Railroad Commission approved the Unanimous Settlement Agreement of $6.2 million and rates went into effect on December 7, 2012. Beginning January 2, 2013, a rate case expense surcharge of $0.16 was implemented and will only affect customers in the cities that gave up original jurisdictions and cities and environs of all parties involved in the Unanimous Settlement Agreement. The rate case expense surcharge will continue over the next 36 months or until all approved expenses are collected. Mississippi Regulatory Rate Adjustment (RRA) . In May 2012, Gas Operations and the Mississippi Public Utility Staff filed a joint stipulation for the revised RRA and initial Weather Normalization Adjustment which the Mississippi Public Service Commission (MPSC) approved in May 2012. In June 2012, Gas Operations requested an annual increase of approximately $2.2 million under the newly revised RRA based on calendar year 2011. New rates reflecting an increase of approximately $1.7 million, as approved by the MPSC, took effect on September 20, 2012. Minnesota Conservation Improvement Program (CIP) . In May 2012, Gas Operations filed a request with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) for a $4.6 million CIP incentive. The MPUC approved the incentive in December 2012. Oklahoma Performance Based Rate Change (PBRC) . In March 2012, Gas Operations filed a PBRC with the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC) showing that it had earnings for 2011 above the prescribed threshold and would refund approximately $1.9 million to customers beginning in July 2012. The OCC issued a final order approving the refund on June 6, 2012. Houston and South Texas Gas Reliability Infrastructure Programs (GRIP) . Gas Operations' Houston and South Texas Divisions each submitted annual GRIP filings on March 30, 2012. For the Houston division, the filing was to recover costs related to $51.2 million in incremental capital expenditures that were incurred in 2011. The increase in revenue requirements for this filing period was $9.4 million annually based on an authorized rate of return of 8.65%. For the South Texas division, the filing was to recover costs related to $14.5 million in incremental capital expenditures that were incurred since the last rate case. The increase in revenue requirements for this filing period was $2.4 million annually based on an authorized rate of return of 8.75%. In June 2012, the 45 Railroad Commission approved both GRIP applications as filed, and the new rates were implemented in July 2012 in the applicable cities, with the exception of Houston and Pasadena. Lower GRIP rates were implemented in July 2012 for these two cities, subject to final action by the Railroad Commission. In September 2012, the Railroad Commission approved the GRIP rates as originally filed and the rates were then implemented in the two remaining cities. City of Houston Gas Utility Rate Inquiry . In July 2012, the City Council of Houston adopted an ordinance to initiate a formal inquiry regarding the reasonableness of the rates charged by Gas Operations in its Houston service territory. On January 16, 2013, the City Council of Houston voted to require a rate filing by Gas Operations by March 22, 2013. Gas Operations and the City of Houston have agreed to postpone filing of a response to the rate inquiry until at least September 2013. Interstate Pipelines CenterPoint Energy-Mississippi River Transmission, LLC Rate Filing . In August 2012, our subsidiary, CenterPoint Energy-Mississippi River Transmission, LLC (MRT), an interstate pipeline that provides natural gas transportation, natural gas storage and pipeline services to customers principally in Arkansas, Illinois and Missouri, made a rate filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) pursuant to Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act. In its filing, MRT requested an annual cost of service of $103.8 million (an increase of approximately $47.3 million above the annual cost of service underlying the current FERC approved maximum rates for MRT's pipeline), new depreciation rates, an overall rate of return of 10.813% (based on a return on equity of 13.62%), a regulatory compliance cost (RCC) surcharge with a true-up mechanism to recover safety, environmental, and security costs associated with mandated requirements and billing determinants reflecting no adjustments for MRT's conversion of a portion of CenterPoint Energy Gas Transmission Company, LLC (CEGT) firm capacity to a lease. In August 2012, a number of parties filed protests in response to MRT's rate filing. In September 2012, the FERC issued an order accepting MRT's filing, suspending the filed tariff rates for the full statutorily permitted five month suspension period and setting certain issues for hearing. In particular, the FERC limited the scope of the RCC surcharge set for hearing to the recovery of only security costs. In October 2012, MRT requested rehearing as to the proper scope of the RCC surcharge. The procedural schedule for the rate filing contemplates a hearing at the FERC in the third quarter of 2013. CEGT Rate Settlement Proceeding . In an effort to avoid the expense of a rate case, in October 2012 CEGT initiated a settlement process with its customers. Should these discussions fail, CEGT will consider filing with the FERC for a general rate increase in 2013. CEGT will attempt to reach a mutually agreeable rate solution with its customers to recover the increased costs to maintain a safe and reliable system, but there can be no assurance that it will be successful or will avoid the initiation of a general rate case filing. Debt Financing Transactions . In January 2012, Bond Company IV issued $1.695 billion of transition bonds in three tranches with interest rates ranging from 0.9012% to 3.0282% and final maturity dates ranging from April 15, 2018 to October 15, 2025. Through the issuance of these transition bonds, CenterPoint Houston recovered the additional true-up balance of $1.695 billion, less approximately $10.4 million of offering expenses. The transition bonds will be repaid through a charge imposed on customers in CenterPoint Houston service territory. In February 2012, we purchased $275 million aggregate principal amount of pollution control bonds issued on our behalf at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued interest pursuant to the mandatory tender provisions of the bonds. The purchased pollution control bonds will remain outstanding and may be remarketed. Prior to the purchase, the pollution control bonds had fixed interest rates ranging from 5.15% to 5.95%. The purchases reduced temporary investments and leverage while providing us with the flexibility to finance future capital needs in the tax-exempt market through the remarketing of these bonds. Additionally, in March 2012, we redeemed $100 million aggregate principal amount of pollution control bonds issued on our behalf at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued interest pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of the bonds. The redeemed pollution control bonds had a fixed interest rate of 5.25%. In August 2012, CenterPoint Houston issued $300 million of 2.25% general mortgage bonds due 2022 and $500 million of 3.55% general mortgage bonds due 2042. The net proceeds from the sale of the bonds were used to fund a portion of the redemption of the general mortgage bonds discussed below. In August 2012, CenterPoint Houston redeemed $300 million principal amount of its 5.75% general mortgage bonds due 2014 at a price of 107.332% of their principal amount and $500 million principal amount of its 7.00% general mortgage bonds due 2014 at a price of 109.397% of their principal amount. Redemption premiums for the two series aggregated approximately $69 million. 46 Credit Facilities. As of February 14, 2013 , we had the following facilities (in millions): Date Executed Company Size of Facility Amount Utilized at February 14, 2013 (1) Termination Date September 9, 2011 CenterPoint Energy $ 1,200 $ 7 (2) September 9, 2016 September 9, 2011 CenterPoint Houston 300 4 (2) September 9, 2016 September 9, 2011 CERC Corp. 950 September 9, 2016 ___________________ (1) Based on the debt (excluding transition and system restoration bonds) to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) covenant contained in our $1.2 billion credit facility, we would have been permitted to utilize the full capacity of our credit facilities of $2.5 billion at December 31, 2012 . (2) Represents outstanding letters of credit. Our $1.2 billion credit facility can be drawn at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 150 basis points based on our current credit ratings. The facility contains a debt (excluding transition and system restoration bonds) to EBITDA covenant (as those terms are defined in the facility). The facility allows for a temporary increase of the permitted ratio in the financial covenant from 5 times to 5.5 times if CenterPoint Houston experiences damage from a natural disaster in its service territory and we certify to the administrative agent that CenterPoint Houston has incurred system restoration costs reasonably likely to exceed $100 million in a consecutive twelve-month period, all or part of which CenterPoint Houston intends to seek to recover through securitization financing. Such temporary increase in the financial covenant would be in effect from the date we deliver our certification until the earliest to occur of (i) the completion of the securitization financing, (ii) the first anniversary of our certification or (iii) the revocation of such certification. CenterPoint Houston $300 million credit facility can be drawn at LIBOR plus 125 basis points based on CenterPoint Houston current credit ratings. The facility contains a debt (excluding transition and system restoration bonds) to total capitalization covenant which limits debt to 65% of CenterPoint Houston total capitalization. CERC Corp. $950 million credit facility can be drawn at LIBOR plus 150 basis points based on CERC Corp. current credit ratings. The facility contains a debt to total capitalization covenant which limits debt to 65% of CERC total capitalization. Borrowings under each of the facilities are subject to customary terms and conditions. However, there is no requirement that the borrower make representations prior to borrowings as to the absence of material adverse changes or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect. Borrowings under each of the credit facilities are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of events of default that we consider customary. The facilities also provide for customary fees, including commitment fees, administrative agent fees, fees in respect of letters of credit and other fees. In each of the three revolving credit facilities, the spread to LIBOR and the commitment fees fluctuate based on the borrower's credit rating. The borrowers are currently in compliance with the various business and financial covenants in the three revolving credit facilities. Our $1.2 billion credit facility backstops our $1.0 billion commercial paper program. The $950 million CERC Corp. credit facility backstops a $915 million commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2012 , we and CERC Corp. had no commercial paper outstanding. Securities Registered with the SEC. CenterPoint Energy, CenterPoint Houston and CERC Corp. have filed a joint shelf registration statement with the SEC registering indeterminate principal amounts of CenterPoint Houston general mortgage bonds, CERC Corp. senior debt securities and CenterPoint Energy senior debt securities and junior subordinated debt securities and an indeterminate number of CenterPoint Energy shares of common stock, shares of preferred stock, as well as stock purchase contracts and equity units. Temporary Investments. As of February 14, 2013 , CenterPoint Houston had external temporary investments aggregating $502 million . Money Pool. We have a money pool through which the holding company and participating subsidiaries can borrow or invest on a short-term basis. Funding needs are aggregated and external borrowing or investing is based on the net cash position. The net funding requirements of the money pool are expected to be met with borrowings under our revolving credit facility or the sale of our commercial paper. 47 Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings. The interest on borrowings under our credit facilities is based on our credit rating. As of February 14, 2013 , Moody Investors Service, Inc. (Moody s), Standard & Poor Rating Services (S&P), a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, and Fitch, Inc. (Fitch) had assigned the following credit ratings to senior debt of CenterPoint Energy and certain subsidiaries: Moody S&P Fitch Company/Instrument Rating Outlook (1) Rating Outlook(2) Rating Outlook(3) CenterPoint Energy Senior Unsecured Debt Baa3 Positive BBB Stable BBB Stable CenterPoint Houston Senior Secured Debt A3 Positive A Stable A Stable CERC Corp. Senior Unsecured Debt Baa2 Stable BBB+ Stable BBB Stable ___________________ (1) A Moody rating outlook is an opinion regarding the likely direction of a rating over the medium term. (2) An S&P rating outlook assesses the potential direction of a long-term credit rating over the intermediate to longer term. (3) A Fitch rating outlook encompasses a one- to two-year horizon as to the likely ratings direction. We cannot assure you that the ratings set forth above will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are included for informational purposes and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing, the cost of such financings and the execution of our commercial strategies. A decline in credit ratings could increase borrowing costs under our $1.2 billion credit facility, CenterPoint Houston $300 million credit facility and CERC Corp. $950 million credit facility. If our credit ratings or those of CenterPoint Houston or CERC Corp. had been downgraded one notch by each of the three principal credit rating agencies from the ratings that existed at December 31, 2012 , the impact on the borrowing costs under our bank credit facilities would have been immaterial. A decline in credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on long-term debt to be issued in the capital markets and could negatively impact our ability to complete capital market transactions and to access the commercial paper market. CERC Corp. and its subsidiaries purchase natural gas from one of their suppliers under supply agreements that contain an aggregate credit threshold of $120 million based on CERC Corp. S&P senior unsecured long-term debt rating of BBB+. Under these agreements, CERC may need to provide collateral if the aggregate threshold is exceeded. Upgrades and downgrades from this BBB+ rating will increase and decrease the aggregate credit threshold accordingly. CenterPoint Energy Services, Inc. (CES), a wholly owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. operating in our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment, provides comprehensive natural gas sales and services primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities throughout the central and eastern United States. In order to economically hedge its exposure to natural gas prices, CES uses derivatives with provisions standard for the industry, including those pertaining to credit thresholds. Typically, the credit threshold negotiated with each counterparty defines the amount of unsecured credit that such counterparty will extend to CES. To the extent that the credit exposure that a counterparty has to CES at a particular time does not exceed that credit threshold, CES is not obligated to provide collateral. Mark-to-market exposure in excess of the credit threshold is routinely collateralized by CES. As of December 31, 2012 , the amount posted as collateral aggregated approximately $21 million. Should the credit ratings of CERC Corp. (as the credit support provider for CES) fall below certain levels, CES would be required to provide additional collateral up to the amount of its previously unsecured credit limit. We estimate that as of December 31, 2012 , unsecured credit limits extended to CES by counterparties aggregate $335 million and $6 million of such amount was utilized. Pipeline tariffs and contracts typically provide that if the credit ratings of a shipper or the shipper guarantor drop below a threshold level, which is generally investment grade ratings from both Moody and S&P, cash or other collateral may be demanded from the shipper in an amount equal to the sum of three months charges for pipeline services plus the unrecouped cost of any lateral built for such shipper. If the credit ratings of CERC Corp. decline below the applicable threshold levels, CERC Corp. might need to provide cash or other collateral of as much as $179 million as of December 31, 2012 . The amount of collateral will depend on seasonal variations in transportation levels. 48 In September 1999, we issued ZENS having an original principal amount of $1.0 billion of which $840 million remains outstanding at December 31, 2012 . Each ZENS note was originally exchangeable at the holder option at any time for an amount of cash equal to 95% of the market value of the reference shares of Time Warner Inc. common stock (TW Common) attributable to such note. The number and identity of the reference shares attributable to each ZENS note are adjusted for certain corporate events. As of December 31, 2012 , the reference shares for each ZENS note consisted of 0.5 share of TW Common, 0.125505 share of Time Warner Cable Inc. common stock (TWC Common) and 0.045455 share of AOL Inc. common stock (AOL Common). If our creditworthiness were to drop such that ZENS note holders thought our liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the ZENS notes were to become illiquid, some ZENS note holders might decide to exchange their ZENS notes for cash. Funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of TW Common, TWC Common and AOL Common that we own or from other sources. We own shares of TW Common, TWC Common and AOL Common equal to approximately 100% of the reference shares used to calculate our obligation to the holders of the ZENS notes. ZENS note exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax deferrals related to the ZENS notes and TW Common, TWC Common and AOL Common shares would typically cease when ZENS notes are exchanged or otherwise retired and TW Common, TWC Common and AOL Common shares are sold. The ultimate tax liability related to the ZENS notes continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year, and there could be a significant cash outflow when the taxes are paid as a result of the retirement of the ZENS notes. If all ZENS notes had been exchanged for cash on December 31, 2012 , deferred taxes of approximately $405 million would have been payable in 2012. Cross Defaults. Under our revolving credit facility, a payment default on, or a non-payment default that permits acceleration of, any indebtedness exceeding $75 million by us or any of our significant subsidiaries will cause a default. In addition, three outstanding series of our senior notes, aggregating $750 million in principal amount as of December 31, 2012 , provide that a payment default by us, CERC Corp. or CenterPoint Houston in respect of, or an acceleration of, borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations, in the aggregate principal amount of $50 million, will cause a default. A default by CenterPoint Energy would not trigger a default under our subsidiaries debt instruments or bank credit facilities. Possible Acquisitions, Divestitures and Joint Ventures . From time to time, we consider the acquisition or the disposition of assets or businesses or possible joint ventures or other joint ownership arrangements with respect to assets or businesses. Any determination to take any action in this regard will be based on market conditions and opportunities existing at the time, and accordingly, the timing, size or success of any efforts and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable. We may seek to fund all or part of any such efforts with proceeds from debt and/or equity issuances. Debt or equity financing may not, however, be available to us at that time due to a variety of events, including, among others, maintenance of our credit ratings, industry conditions, general economic conditions, market conditions and market perceptions. Other Factors that Could Affect Cash Requirements. In addition to the above factors, our liquidity and capital resources could be affected by: cash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain contracts, including our weather hedging arrangements, and gas purchases, gas price and gas storage activities of our Natural Gas Distribution and Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segments; acceleration of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts, under certain circumstances, as a result of increased gas prices and concentration of natural gas suppliers; increased costs related to the acquisition of natural gas; increases in interest expense in connection with debt refinancings and borrowings under credit facilities; various legislative or regulatory actions; incremental collateral, if any, that may be required due to regulation of derivatives; the ability of GenOn and its subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations in respect of GenOn indemnity obligations to us and our subsidiaries or in connection with the contractual obligations to a third party pursuant to which CERC is a guarantor; the ability of REPs, including REP affiliates of NRG and Energy Future Holdings, which are CenterPoint Houston two largest customers, to satisfy their obligations to us and our subsidiaries; 49 delays in cash collections attributable to billing delays; slower customer payments and increased write-offs of receivables due to higher gas prices or changing economic conditions; the outcome of litigation brought by and against us; contributions to pension and postretirement benefit plans; restoration costs and revenue losses resulting from future natural disasters such as hurricanes and the timing of recovery of such restoration costs; and various other risks identified in Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report. Certain Contractual Limits on Our Ability to Issue Securities and Borrow Money. CenterPoint Houston credit facility limits CenterPoint Houston debt (excluding transition and system restoration bonds) as a percentage of its total capitalization to 65% . CERC Corp. credit facility limits CERC debt as a percentage of its total capitalization to 65% . Our $1.2 billion credit facility contains a debt, excluding transition and system restoration bonds, to EBITDA covenant which will temporarily increase if CenterPoint Houston experiences damage from a natural disaster in its service territory that meets certain criteria. Additionally, CenterPoint Houston has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certain exceptions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates. An accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element, item or account in the financial statements. Accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events, or the present status of an asset or liability. The accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made. Additionally, different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The circumstances that make these judgments difficult, subjective and/or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments. These estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates. Accordingly, these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors. Accounting for Rate Regulation Accounting guidance for regulated operations provides that rate-regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment, our Natural Gas Distribution business segment and portions of our Interstate Pipelines business segment apply this accounting guidance. Certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet as regulatory assets or liabilities and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. Regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded when it is probable that these items will be recovered or reflected in future rates. Determining probability requires significant judgment on the part of management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings, proposed regulatory decisions, final regulatory orders and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals. If events were to occur that would make the recovery of these assets and liabilities no longer probable, we would be required to write off or write down these regulatory assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2012 , we had recorded regulatory assets of $4.3 billion and regulatory liabilities of $1.1 billion. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including goodwill and identifiable intangibles, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable, and at least annually for goodwill as required 50 by accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets. Unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in the value of long-lived assets and intangibles due to changes in estimates of future cash flows, interest rates, regulatory matters and operating costs could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge. We performed our annual impairment test in the third quarter of 2012 and determined that a non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the amount of $252 million was required for the Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services reportable segment. We also determined that no impairment charge was required for any other reportable segment. The adverse wholesale market conditions facing our energy services business, specifically the prospects for continued low geographic and seasonal price differentials for natural gas, led to a reduction in the estimate of the fair value of goodwill associated with this reporting unit. Fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques, including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties, present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures. The fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques. Unbilled Energy Revenues Revenues related to electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services are generally recognized upon delivery to customers. However, the determination of deliveries to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, deliveries to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated. Unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on daily supply volumes, applicable rates and analyses reflecting significant historical trends and experience. Unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes, estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect. As additional information becomes available, or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised. Consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates. Pension and Other Retirement Plans We sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements. We use several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management, within certain guidelines. In addition, our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded. Please read Other Significant Matters Pension Plans for further discussion. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2(o) to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us. OTHER SIGNIFICANT MATTERS Pension Plans. As discussed in Note 6(b) to our consolidated financial statements, we maintain a non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees. Employer contributions for the qualified plan are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes. Under the terms of our pension plan, we reserve the right to change, modify or terminate the plan. Our funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under ERISA. The minimum funding requirements for the qualified pension plan were $-0-, $35 and $73 million for 2010 , 2011 and 2012 , respectively. We made contributions of $-0-, $65 and $73 million in 2010 , 2011 and 2012 for the respective years. We expect to make contributions aggregating approximately $83 million in 2013 . Additionally, we maintain an unfunded non-qualified benefit restoration plan that allows participants to receive the benefits to which they would have been entitled under our non-contributory pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated. Employer contributions 51 for the non-qualified benefit restoration plan represent benefit payments made to participants and totaled $8 million, $10 million and $9 million in 2010 , 2011 and 2012 , respectively. Changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension expense in the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension expense recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants. As the sponsor of a plan, we are required to (a) recognize on our balance sheet as an asset a plan's over-funded status or as a liability such plan's under-funded status, (b) measure a plan's assets and obligations as of the end of our fiscal year and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of our plans in the year that changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income and regulatory assets. As of December 31, 2012 , the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plan assets of our pension plans by $618 million. Changes in interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plan during 2013 could materially, positively or negatively, change our funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions. Pension cost was $86 million, $78 million and $82 million for 2010 , 2011 and 2012 , respectively, of which $44 million, $49 million and $67 million impacted pre-tax earnings. The calculation of pension expense and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. Two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate. As of December 31, 2012 , our qualified pension plan had an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.00%, which was unchanged from the rate assumed as of December 31, 2011 . We believe that our actual asset allocation, on average, will approximate the targeted allocation and the estimated return on net assets. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance plan assets as appropriate. As of December 31, 2012 , the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of 4.00%, which is a 0.90% decrease from the 4.90% discount rate assumed in 2011 . The discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on high-quality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of our plan. Pension cost for 2013 , including the benefit restoration plan, is estimated to be $73 million, of which we expect $60 million to impact pre-tax earnings, based on an expected return on plan assets of 8.00% and a discount rate of 4.00% as of December 31, 2012 . If the expected return assumption were lowered by 0.50% from 8.00% to 7.50%, 2013 pension cost would increase by approximately $8 million. As of December 31, 2012 , the pension plan projected benefit obligation, including the unfunded benefit restoration plan, exceeded plan assets by $618 million. If the discount rate were lowered by 0.50% from 4.00% to 3.50%, the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation and 2013 pension expense by approximately $126 million and $6 million, respectively. In addition, the assumption change would impact our Consolidated Balance Sheet by increasing the regulatory asset recorded as of December 31, 2012 by $103 million and would result in a charge to comprehensive income in 2012 of $15 million, net of tax. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plan will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be. 52
