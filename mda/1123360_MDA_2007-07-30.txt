ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about our plans and expectations of what may happen in the future. Forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and our results could differ materially from the results anticipated by our forward-looking statements as a result of many known and unknown factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors of this report. See also Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements located above Item 1 Business. You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with Item 6 Selected Financial Data and Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data appearing elsewhere in this annual report. General We are a leading payment processing and consumer money transfer company. As a high-volume processor of electronic transactions, we enable merchants, multinational corporations, financial institutions, consumers, government agencies and other profit and non-profit business enterprises to facilitate payments to purchase goods and services or further other economic goals. Our role is to serve as an intermediary in the exchange of information and funds that must occur between parties so that a payment transaction or money transfer can be completed. We were incorporated in Georgia as Global Payments Inc. in September 2000, and we spun-off from our former parent company on January 31, 2001. Including our time as part of our former parent company, we have provided transaction processing services since 1967. We market our products and services throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. We operate in two business segments, merchant services and money transfer, and we offer various products through these segments. Our merchant services segment targets customers in many vertical industries including financial institutions, government, professional services, restaurants, universities, utilities, gaming, retail and health care. Our money transfer segment primarily targets immigrants in the United States and Europe. See Note 10 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional segment information. Our offerings in the merchant services segment provide merchants, independent sales organizations, or ISOs, and financial institutions with credit and debit card transaction processing, as well as check-related services. We use two basic business models to market our merchant services offerings. One model, referred to as direct merchant services, features a salaried and commissioned sales force, ISOs and independent sales representatives, all of whom sell our end-to-end services directly to merchants. Our other model, referred to as indirect merchant services, provides the same basic products and services as direct merchant services, primarily to financial institutions and a limited number of ISOs on an unbundled basis, that in turn resell our products and services to merchants. We also offer sales, installation, and servicing of ATM and point of sale, or POS, terminals and selected card issuing services, which are components of indirect merchant services, through Global Payments Europe, s.r.o., formerly known as MUZO, which is our subsidiary based in the Czech Republic. Our direct merchant services are marketed in the United States, Canada, and throughout the Asia-Pacific region, while our indirect merchant services are marketed in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Direct merchant services revenue is generated on services primarily priced as a percentage of transaction value, whereas indirect merchant services revenue is generated on services primarily priced on a specified amount per transaction. In both merchant services models, we also charge for other processing fees unrelated to the number of transactions or the transaction value. Our money transfer segment provides money transfer services. A majority of the revenue derived from our money transfer offering consists of our electronic money transfer services marketed under our DolEx brand to the growing population of first and second generation Latin Americans living in the United States. This consumer segment regularly transfers money to family and friends living in Latin America. Following the Europhil 26 Table of Contents acquisition in December 2004, we expanded our money transfer origination locations into Europe and our settlement locations to Morocco, the Philippines, Romania, Poland and other new destinations. Our products and services are marketed through a variety of distinct sales channels that include a dedicated direct sales force, ISOs, an internal telesales group, retail outlets, trade associations, alliance bank relationships and financial institutions. Executive Overview In the year ended May 31, 2007, or fiscal 2007, revenue increased 17% to $1,061.5 million from $908.1 million in the year ended May 31, 2006, or fiscal 2006. This revenue growth was primarily due to our domestic direct and new Asia-Pacific merchant services channels. Consolidated operating income was $218.1 million for fiscal 2007, compared to $201.1 million for fiscal 2006, which resulted in a decrease in operating margin to 20.5% for fiscal 2007 from 22.1% for fiscal 2006. Net income increased $17.5 million, or 14%, to $143.0 million in fiscal 2007 from $125.5 million in the prior year, resulting in a $0.22 increase in diluted earnings per share to $1.75 in fiscal 2007 from $1.53 in fiscal 2006. Merchant services segment revenue increased $140.6 million or 18% to $929.1 million in fiscal 2007 from $788.5 million in fiscal 2006, and money transfer segment revenue increased $12.8 million or 11% to $132.4 million in fiscal 2007 from $119.6 million in fiscal 2006. Merchant services segment operating income increased 16% to $259.7 million in fiscal 2007 from $224.2 million in fiscal 2006, with operating margins of 27.9% and 28.4% for fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. Money transfer segment operating income decreased 23% to $14.5 million in fiscal 2007 from $18.7 million in fiscal 2006, with operating margins of 10.9% and 15.7% for fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. The consolidated operating income and earnings per share amounts reflect restructuring and other charges of $3.1 million and $1.9 million in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. Restructuring and other charges represented 0.3% and 0.2% of revenue in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. These charges primarily relate to employee termination benefits, fixed asset abandonment and facility closure costs due to facility consolidations and the elimination of redundant activities. Please see Note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information. In March 2007, we decided to consolidate our technical support center located in St. Louis, Missouri into our operations center in Owings Mills, Maryland. We believe this consolidation will improve our customer service by allowing us to provide our customers with a single point of contact in one physical location. This consolidation will result in staff reduction, fixed asset abandonment and facility closure costs and is expected to be completed during our second quarter of fiscal 2008. In March 2007, we also decided to consolidate an operations facility in Denver, Colorado into our Niles, Illinois operations facility, which we believe will improve the efficiency of our check service offering. This consolidation, which resulted in staff reduction and facility closure costs, was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Components of Income Statement We derive our revenues from three primary sources: charges based on volumes and fees for services, charges based on transaction quantity, and equipment sales, leases and service fees. Revenues generated by these areas depend upon a number of factors, such as demand for and price of our services, the technological competitiveness of our product offerings, our reputation for providing timely and reliable service, competition within our industry, and general economic conditions. Cost of service consists primarily of the following costs: operational-related personnel, including those who monitor our transaction processing systems and settlement; assessment fees paid to card associations; transaction 27 Table of Contents processing systems, including third-party services such as the costs of settlement channels for money transfer services; transition services paid to HSBC in the Asia-Pacific market; network telecommunications capability, depreciation and occupancy costs associated with the facilities performing these functions; amortization of intangible assets; and provisions for operating losses. Sales, general and administrative expenses consists primarily of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel, non-revenue producing customer support functions and administrative employees and management, commissions to independent contractors and ISOs, advertising costs, other selling expenses, share-based compensation expenses and occupancy of leased space directly related to these functions. Other income and expense consists primarily of interest income and interest expense. Results of Operations Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2007 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2006 The following table shows key selected financial data for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2007 and 2006, this data as a percentage of total revenue, and the changes between fiscal years in dollars and as a percentage of fiscal 2006. 2007 % of Revenue (1) 2006 % of Revenue (1) Change % Change (dollar amounts in thousands) Revenues: Domestic direct $ 558,026 53 % $ 481,273 53 % $ 76,753 16 % Canada 224,570 21 208,126 23 16,444 8 Asia-Pacific 48,449 5 48,449 Central and Eastern Europe 51,224 5 47,114 5 4,110 9 Domestic indirect and other 46,873 4 51,987 6 (5,114 ) (10 ) Merchant services 929,142 88 788,500 87 140,642 18 Domestic 115,416 11 109,067 12 6,349 6 Europe 16,965 2 10,489 1 6,476 62 Money transfer 132,381 12 119,556 13 12,825 11 Total revenues $ 1,061,523 100 % $ 908,056 100 % $ 153,467 17 % Consolidated operating expenses: Cost of service $ 414,837 39.1 % $ 358,020 39.4 % $ 56,817 16 % Sales, general and administrative 425,509 40.1 347,070 38.2 78,439 23 Restructuring and other 3,088 0.3 1,878 0.2 1,210 64 Operating income $ 218,089 20.5 % $ 201,088 22.1 % $ 17,001 8 % Operating income for segments: Merchant services $ 259,670 $ 224,221 $ 35,449 16 % Money transfer 14,476 18,741 (4,265 ) (23 ) Corporate (52,969 ) (39,996 ) (12,973 ) (32 ) Restructuring and other (3,088 ) (1,878 ) (1,210 ) (64 ) Operating income $ 218,089 $ 201,088 $ 17,001 8 % Operating margin for segments: Merchant services segment 27.9 % 28.4 % (0.5 )% Money transfer segment 10.9 % 15.7 % (4.8 )% (1) Percentage amounts may not sum to the total due to rounding. 28 Table of Contents Revenues In fiscal 2007, revenue increased 17% to $1,061.5 million from $908.1 million for fiscal 2006. We attribute this revenue growth primarily to our domestic direct and new Asia-Pacific merchant services channels. We intend to continue to grow our domestic and international presence, build our ISO sales channel, increase customer satisfaction, assess opportunities for profitable growth through acquisitions, pursue enhanced products and services for our customers, and leverage our existing business model. We expect our fiscal 2008 consolidated revenue to range from $1,168 million to $1,220 million, reflecting growth of 10% to 15% over fiscal 2007. Merchant Services Segment Revenue from our merchant services segment for fiscal 2007 increased by $140.6 million or 18% to $929.1 million from $788.5 million for fiscal 2006. We have continued to grow our domestic direct merchant services channel by adding small and mid-market merchants in diversified vertical markets, primarily through our ISOs. For fiscal 2007, our credit and debit card processed transactions grew 25% and our revenue grew 16% for this channel compared to the prior year. The difference between our transaction growth and revenue growth is primarily a result of a mid single digit percentage decline compared to the prior year in our domestic direct credit card average dollar value of transaction, or average ticket, due to a shift toward smaller merchants added through our ISOs. Our average discount revenue per dollar value volume, or spread, was constant compared to the prior year and, therefore, did not impact the difference between our transaction growth and revenue growth. Our spread was favorably impacted by the shift towards smaller merchants added through our ISOs. Smaller merchants tend to have lower average tickets and higher spreads than larger merchants. This favorable impact on spread was offset by pricing compression relating to merchants added through our direct sales force. Aside from the decline in average ticket described above, the remaining difference between our transaction growth and revenue growth is due to our domestic direct revenue that is not based on the amount of transactions or average ticket described above. This type of revenue includes service fees, equipment fees and check-related services. The total of this revenue grew at a lesser rate than our credit and debit card transaction growth. For fiscal year 2008, we expect annual revenue growth in the low teen to high teen percentage range for this channel. For fiscal 2007, our Canadian direct credit and debit card processed transactions grew 4%, with overall Canadian revenue growth of 8% compared to the prior year. Our Canadian transaction growth was largely offset by mid single digit percentage declines in our average credit card spread, compared to the prior year. Our revenue growth for fiscal 2007 was primarily due to a favorable Canadian currency exchange rate and card association incentive revenue relating to various programs being implemented in the Canadian market. These card association incentives are not recurring in nature. For fiscal 2008, we expect annual revenue growth in the high single digit to low double digit percentage range for our Canadian channel. Our Asia-Pacific merchant services revenue for fiscal 2007 was $48.4 million. We completed the purchase of our ownership in HSBC merchant acquiring business on July 24, 2006, and began operating in this channel at that time. For fiscal 2008, we expect to achieve Asia-Pacific merchant services revenue growth of 30% to 40% compared to fiscal 2007. We expect to realize this growth through enhancing our Asia-Pacific direct sales force, in addition to the benefit of growth in the industry and the impact of reporting a full year of results in fiscal 2008 compared to a partial year in fiscal 2007. Our Central and Eastern European merchant services revenue for fiscal 2007 increased 9% compared to the prior year period, largely due to a favorable Czech currency exchange rate, the impact of our Diginet acquisition and growth in credit and debit card processed transactions of 15%. These factors were partially offset by the impact of price reductions granted on contract renewals. The deconversion process of the large customer that announced its intention to deconvert prior to the completion of our MUZO acquisition was substantially completed during fiscal 2007. We expect annual fiscal 2008 revenue growth for this channel in the mid single digit to low double digit percentage range. 29 Table of Contents We experienced continued and expected declines in our domestic indirect and other channel, with a 4% year-over-year decline in credit and debit card transactions processed and a 10% decline in revenue for fiscal 2007. We attribute these revenue declines to the industry consolidation of financial institutions and competitive pricing pressures. For fiscal 2008, we expect an annual revenue decline in the low single digit to high single digit percentage range for this channel. Money Transfer Segment For fiscal 2007, our domestic money transfer channel transactions grew 18% and revenue grew 6%, compared to fiscal 2006. The growth in transactions was driven primarily by same store sales growth and an increasing domestic branch footprint resulting in 875 domestic branches as of May 31, 2007, compared to 835 domestic branch locations as of May 31, 2006. The difference between our transaction growth and our revenue growth is due to lower pricing compared to the prior year, which is consistent with our strategy of price leadership. During fiscal 2007, we experienced a highly competitive pricing environment. We believe that fewer immigrants may be coming to the United States due to increased immigration legislation and enforcement and an improving Mexican economy, which may be contributing to this environment. Our fiscal 2007 revenue was also negatively impacted by one of our landlords entering the money transfer business and competing with us. As a result, we exited those locations, opened new locations nearby, and responded to aggressive price competition from this landlord to pursue the existing customer base. In Europe, we ended fiscal 2007 with 68 branch locations, compared to 40 locations as of May 31, 2006. For fiscal 2007, our European money transfer revenue grew 62%, with transaction growth of 73%. This growth is largely due to new branch locations compared to the prior year. For fiscal 2008, we expect annual revenue growth in the mid single digit to low double digit percentage range for our money transfer segment. We will continue to focus on expanding our domestic and European branch network and to operate as a low-cost provider of money transfer services targeted to immigrant consumers. For the long term, we will also focus on new product opportunities as part of our strategic objective to provide a host of financial services to our customers. Consolidated Operating Expenses Cost of service increased 16% to $414.8 million for fiscal 2007 compared to $358.0 million in fiscal 2006. As a percentage of revenue, cost of service decreased to 39.1% of revenue for fiscal 2007 from 39.4% in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2007, the decline in cost of service as a percentage of revenue is partially related to our revenue growth and the related economies of scale benefits. In addition, this decline is related to several cost factors, including savings from exiting our shared service agreement with our former parent company and a decline in year-over-year operating costs from our domestic and Canadian customer service and back-office centers, including our Dallas facility that we closed in November 2005. In addition, as described in Note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements, during the quarter ended August 31, 2005, we recognized an impairment loss of $2.2 million in connection with the MUZO trademark, which is included in cost of service in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for fiscal 2006. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by $78.4 million or 23% to $425.5 million for fiscal 2007 from $347.1 million for fiscal 2006. As a percentage of revenue, these expenses increased to 40.1% for fiscal 2007 compared to 38.2% for fiscal 2006. The increases in sales, general and administrative expenses are primarily due to growth in commission payments to ISOs resulting from the increased revenue in this sales channel. The ISO channel generally has a dilutive effect on our operating margin compared to our other channels due to the ongoing commission payments 30 Table of Contents to the ISOs. The ISO commission model differs from our other sales channels where the commissions are primarily paid for only a twelve-month period. The addition of our new Asia-Pacific channel also contributed to the increases in sales, general and administrative expenses due to the investment in the regional sales force and infrastructure. In addition, sales, general and administrative expenses increased for fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 as a result of our adoption, using the modified prospective method, of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004): Share-based Payment , or FAS 123R, on June 1, 2006. For additional information concerning our adoption of FAS 123R and our share-based awards and options, you should refer to Notes 1 and 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. The total share-based compensation cost that has been included in sales, general and administrative expenses for our share-based awards and option plans was $15.2 million for fiscal 2007. The total share-based compensation cost that has been included in sales, general and administrative expenses for our share-based awards and option plans was $2.8 million for fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2007, we recognized $12.4 million in incremental employee stock option expense as a result of FAS 123R. Operating Income and Operating Margin for Segments For the purpose of discussing segment operations, management refers to operating income as calculated by subtracting segment direct expenses from segment revenue. Overhead and shared expenses, including share-based compensation costs, are not allocated to the segments operations; they are reported in the caption Corporate. Similarly, references to operating margin regarding segment operations mean segment operating income divided by segment revenue. Merchant Services Segment Operating income in the merchant services segment increased 16% to $259.7 million for fiscal 2007 compared to $224.2 million for fiscal 2006. This change resulted in an operating margin of 27.9% for fiscal 2007, compared to 28.4% for fiscal 2006. Our operating margin decreased for fiscal 2007 primarily due to the increases in ISO commission payments and the addition of, and our investment in, our new Asia-Pacific channel, offset by merchant services revenue growth and the cost of service savings discussed above. We are expecting fiscal 2008 total merchant services operating income margin in the 25.5% to 25.9% range. The anticipated decline in this margin compared to fiscal 2007 is primarily due to strong expected growth in our ISO channel, which generally has a dilutive effect on our operating margin, as discussed above. Money Transfer Segment Operating income in the money transfer segment decreased 23% to $14.5 million for fiscal 2007 compared to $18.7 million for fiscal 2006. This decrease resulted in an operating margin of 10.9% for fiscal 2007, compared to 15.7% for fiscal 2006. This operating margin decline was primarily due to the increased price competition discussed above and our use of a fixed-cost, branch-owned model at the point of sale. We are expecting fiscal 2008 total money transfer operating income margin in the low double digit percentage range. Corporate Our corporate expenses primarily include costs associated with our Atlanta headquarters, insurance, employee incentive programs, Board of Directors fees, and certain corporate staffing areas, including finance, accounting, legal, human resources, marketing, and executive. For fiscal 2007, corporate also includes expenses associated with our share-based compensation. Our corporate costs increased 32% to $53.0 million for fiscal 2007 compared to $40.0 million for fiscal 2006. These increases are primarily due to share-based compensation costs related to our implementation of FAS 123R, as described above. For fiscal 2008, we expect corporate expenses to grow in the low single digit to mid single digit percentage range. 31 Table of Contents Restructuring and Other Charges During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we committed to plans to close two locations and consolidate their functions into existing locations, which is consistent with our strategy to leverage infrastructure and consolidate operations. These restructuring plans will require staff reduction and facility closure costs and are expected to be completed during our second quarter of fiscal 2008. We recorded restructuring and other charges of $3.1 million in fiscal 2007, and we expect to incur approximately $1.7 million in such charges during fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2006, we incurred $1.9 million in restructuring charges in connection with our 2005 restructuring plans. Consolidated Operating Income Consolidated operating income increased $17.0 million or 8% to $218.1 million for fiscal 2007 compared to $201.1 million for fiscal 2006. This change resulted in an operating margin of 20.5% for fiscal 2007 compared to 22.1% for fiscal 2006. We expect fiscal 2008 total company operating income margin of between 19.1% and 19.5%, excluding the impact of restructuring and other charges relating to our facility consolidation programs as discussed above. Consolidated Other Income/Expense, Net Interest and other income increased $7.8 million to $8.2 million for fiscal 2007 compared to $0.4 million for fiscal 2006. This improvement is largely due to higher interest income due to higher cash balances and investment rates. During fiscal 2008, we expect approximately $12 million to $15 million in income from the net of our interest and other income and interest and other expense. Provision for Income Taxes In fiscal 2007, our tax rate, reflected as the provision for income taxes divided by income before income tax and minority interest, decreased to 32.4% from 33.5% in fiscal 2006. The changes in our effective tax rate are due to tax planning initiatives and the impact of international growth. We anticipate our fiscal 2008 effective tax rate will be between 32% and 33%. See Note 7 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information. Minority Interest, Net of Tax Minority interest, net of tax increased $1.4 million to $9.9 million for fiscal 2007 compared to $8.5 million for fiscal 2006. This increase is due to our new HSBC merchant acquiring acquisition in the Asia-Pacific region. For fiscal 2008, we expect $9 million to $12 million in minority interest, net of tax. Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share Net income increased $17.5 million or 14% to $143.0 million for fiscal 2007 from $125.5 million for fiscal 2006. This increase resulted in a $0.22 increase in diluted earnings per share to $1.75 for fiscal 2007 compared to $1.53 for fiscal 2006. We expect diluted earnings per share to range from $1.85 to $1.94 for fiscal 2008, excluding the anticipated restructuring and other charges discussed above. Lastly, we expect approximately 82 million in average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2008, although this amount may be impacted by potential share repurchase activity. New Accounting Pronouncements Effective June 1, 2006, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004): Share-based Payment ( FAS 123R ). FAS 123R amends FAS 123 to require adoption of the fair-value method of accounting for employee stock options. Prior to adoption, we accounted for employee stock options at their intrinsic value, which generally did not result in the recognition of expense in the consolidated financial statements. We have elected to adopt FAS 123R using the modified prospective method of adoption as defined in FAS 123R, which requires us to expense the fair value of 32 Table of Contents the unvested portion of stock options granted prior to the adoption date over the options remaining vesting periods and to expense the fair value of stock options granted subsequent to the adoption date over the options full vesting periods. We have elected to recognize expense related to the fair value of stock options granted subsequent to the adoption date on a straight-line basis. The fair value of options granted prior to the adoption date had been amortized on an accelerated basis. Effective June 1, 2007, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 . This interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company financial statements and establishes guidelines for recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We currently estimate that our liability for uncertain tax positions, which totals $3 million at May 31, 2007 under FAS 109 and FAS 5, will be between $4 million and $6 million as calculated under the measurement provisions of FIN 48. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 is expected to be an increase in liabilities of between $1 million to $3 million with an equal, offsetting decrease to beginning retained earnings at June 1, 2007. FIN 48 will become effective for us on June 1, 2007. Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2006 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2005 The following table shows key selected financial data for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2006 and 2005, this data as a percentage of total revenue, and the changes between fiscal years in dollars and as a percentage of fiscal 2005. 2006 % of Revenue (1) 2005 % of Revenue (1) Change % Change (dollar amounts in thousands) Revenues: Domestic direct $ 481,273 53 % $ 410,047 52 % $ 71,226 17 % Canada 208,126 23 175,190 22 32,936 19 Central and Eastern Europe 47,114 5 40,598 5 6,516 16 Domestic indirect and other 51,987 6 62,033 8 (10,046 ) (16 ) Merchant services 788,500 87 687,868 88 100,632 15 Domestic 109,067 12 91,448 12 17,619 19 Europe 10,489 1 5,015 1 5,474 109 Money transfer 119,556 13 96,463 12 23,093 24 Total revenues $ 908,056 100 % $ 784,331 100 % $ 123,725 16 % Consolidated operating expenses: Cost of service $ 358,020 39.4 % $ 337,272 43.0 % $ 20,748 6 % Sales, general and administrative 347,070 38.2 283,232 36.1 63,838 23 Restructuring and other 1,878 0.2 3,726 0.5 (1,848 ) (50 ) Operating income $ 201,088 22.1 % $ 160,101 20.4 % $ 40,987 26 % Operating income for segments: Merchant services $ 224,221 $ 183,970 $ 40,251 22 % Money transfer 18,741 16,604 2,137 13 Corporate (39,996 ) (36,747 ) (3,249 ) (9 ) Restructuring and other (1,878 ) (3,726 ) 1,848 50 Operating income $ 201,088 $ 160,101 $ 40,987 26 % Operating margin for segments: Merchant services segment 28.4 % 26.7 % 1.7 % Money transfer segment 15.7 % 17.2 % (1.5 )% (1) Percentage amounts may not sum to the total due to rounding. 33 Table of Contents Revenues Merchant Services Segment For fiscal 2006, our credit and debit card processed transactions grew 18% and our revenue grew 17% for our domestic direct merchant services channel. This growth was largely due to success with our ISOs. For fiscal 2006, our Canadian direct credit and debit card processed transactions grew 2%, with overall Canadian revenue growth of 19%. This improvement in revenue was partially a result of strategic pricing initiatives implemented during the fiscal quarters ended August 31, 2005 and February 28, 2005, in addition to the benefit from no longer processing under our low margin, high-risk Air Canada contract. Our Canadian revenue was also favorably impacted by a stronger year-over-year Canadian currency exchange rate. Our Central and Eastern European merchant services revenue for the full year fiscal 2006 increased 16%, largely due to growth in credit and debit card processed transactions of 22%. Our revenue growth for this channel, however, slowed during the second half of fiscal 2006, primarily due to the impact of customer attrition, price reductions granted on contract renewals and an unfavorable year-over-year Czech currency exchange rate. We experienced continued and expected declines in our domestic indirect and other channel, with a 12% year-over-year decline in credit and debit card transactions processed and a 16% decline in revenue. We attribute these declines to the industry consolidation of financial institutions and competitive pricing pressures. Money Transfer Segment For the full fiscal year 2006, our domestic money transfer channel transactions grew 29%, with revenue growth of 19%. This expansion was driven primarily by strong same store sales growth and an increasing domestic branch footprint resulting in a total of 835 domestic branches as of the end of the fiscal year. In Europe, we completed the fiscal year with 40 branch locations and experienced an improved organic revenue growth rate during the three months ended May 31, 2006. For fiscal 2006, our European money transfer revenue grew 109%, primarily since our Europhil acquisition did not annualize until December 2005. Consolidated Operating Expenses Cost of service decreased to 39.4% of revenue for fiscal 2006, compared to 43.0% for fiscal 2005. This decline is partially related to our revenue growth and the related economies of scale benefits. In addition, this decline is related to several cost factors: savings on telecommunications expenses resulting from vendor re-negotiations; savings from exiting our shared service agreement with our former parent company; a $2.6 million decrease in our merchant card operating losses which came about primarily as a result of improved risk management technology tools, improved collection efforts, and other operational improvements, particularly related to our Canadian merchants; a $4.7 million decrease in depreciation and amortization of property and equipment due to the timing of fully-depreciated computer hardware and Canadian merchant terminals; and a decline in operating costs from our customer service centers in the United States, including our closed Dallas facility. These cost reductions were partially offset by increases in our check guarantee and gaming losses of $4.9 million resulting primarily from growth in the channel and the unfavorable impact of Hurricane Katrina on our collection efforts and claims. Finally, as described in Note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements, during our first fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2005, we recognized an impairment loss of $2.2 million in connection with the MUZO trademark. Cost of service increased by 6% to $358.0 million for fiscal 2006 compared to $337.3 for fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily due to growth in our money transfer branch network in the United States, assessments paid to Visa and MasterCard in connection with our credit card processed volume growth, the full year expense impact of our December 2004 Europhil acquisition, other variable costs associated with our revenue increases, and the other cost increases described above. 34 Table of Contents Sales, general and administrative expenses increased to 38.2% of revenue for fiscal 2006, compared to 36.1% for fiscal 2005 and also increased 23% to $347.1 million for fiscal 2006 compared to $283.2 million for fiscal 2005. These increases are primarily due to growth in commission payments to ISOs resulting from the increased revenue in this sales channel, partially offset by vendor rate reductions and other cost containment initiatives. The ISO channel generally has a dilutive effect on our operating margin compared to our other channels due to the ongoing commission payments to the ISOs. The ISO commission model differs from our other sales channels where the commissions are primarily paid for a twelve-month period. We completed our fiscal 2005 restructuring plans on November 30, 2005. These charges are discussed in Note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Operating Income and Operating Margin for Segments For the purpose of discussing segment operations, management refers to operating income as calculated by subtracting segment direct expenses from segment revenue. Overhead and shared expenses are not allocated to the segments operations; they are reported in the caption Corporate. Similarly, references to operating margin regarding segment operations mean segment operating income divided by segment revenue. Merchant Services Segment The 22% growth in our merchant services segment operating income for fiscal 2006 was driven primarily by the revenue increases discussed above and the improvement in operating margin to 28.4% in fiscal 2006 from 26.7% in fiscal 2005 for the segment. This operating margin improvement is a product of the merchant services revenue growth and cost of service savings discussed above, partially offset by the dilutive effect on operating margin of the growth of our ISO channel, also as discussed above. Money Transfer Segment The 13% growth in our money transfer segment operating income for fiscal 2006 was the result of the revenue increases discussed above, partially offset by the decline in operating margin to 15.7% in fiscal 2006 from 17.2% in fiscal 2005 for the segment. This operating margin decline was primarily a result of our Europhil acquisition. Due to the fixed-cost nature of our money transfer model and the relatively small size of our European presence, the Europhil branch network negatively impacted the overall money transfer operating margin by approximately 300 basis points during fiscal 2006. Corporate Our corporate expenses primarily include costs associated with our Atlanta headquarters, insurance, employee incentive programs, Board of Directors fees, and certain corporate staffing areas, including finance, accounting, legal, human resources, marketing, and executive. Our corporate costs declined as a percentage of total company revenue during fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. The 9% growth in our corporate costs for fiscal 2006 was primarily due to the impact of our revenue growth and recent acquisitions, in addition to increased spending on Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and other accounting and audit-related efforts. Restructuring and Other Charges During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we committed to plans to close a location and consolidate its and other functions into existing locations, which is consistent with our strategy to leverage infrastructure and consolidate operations. These restructuring plans required associated management and staff reductions and required contract termination and related facility closure costs in connection with an operating lease at one location during fiscal 2006. We recorded restructuring charges of $0.8 million in fiscal 2005 and incurred approximately $1.9 million in fiscal 2006 in connection with these plans. The fiscal 2005 charge was partially offset by a $0.4 million reduction to expenses arising from the favorable resolution of certain restructuring items related to the fiscal 2003 restructuring plans. In addition, during fiscal 2005 we recognized other charges of $3.3 million in connection with the termination of an executive officer, including $2.7 million related to acceleration of options, under his employment agreement. 35 Table of Contents Consolidated Operating Income The 26% growth in our consolidated operating income for fiscal 2006 was driven primarily by the revenue increases discussed above and the improvement in consolidated operating margin to 22.1%. This operating margin improvement was primarily due to the factors discussed above. Consolidated Other Income/Expense, Net The improvement in other income/expense, net to a slight income position was due to increased interest income resulting from higher accumulated cash balances, higher interest income investment rates, and reduced borrowings on our lines of credit during fiscal 2006. These favorable items were partially offset by increased interest expense related to our relationship with National Bank of Canada. Net Income The increase in net income resulted in a $0.37 increase in diluted earnings per share to $1.53 for fiscal 2006 from $1.16 in fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2006, our tax rate, reflected as the provision for income taxes divided by income before income tax and minority interest, decreased to 33.5% from 34.7% in fiscal 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity to meet our needs. At May 31, 2007, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $308.9 million. As of May 31, 2007, our cash and cash equivalents included $112.2 million related to Merchant reserves. While this cash is not restricted and can be used in our general operations, we do not intend to use it, as we believe that designating this cash to collateralize Merchant reserves strengthens our fiduciary standing with our member sponsors and is in accordance with the guidelines set by the card associations. See Cash and cash equivalents under Note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $191.1 million in fiscal 2007 from $234.8 million in fiscal 2006. The decrease in cash flow provided by operations was primarily due to unfavorable changes in working capital of $69.7 million, partially offset by an increase in net income. This working capital change was primarily due to the change in net settlement processing assets and obligations of $45.1 million and the change in income taxes payable of $25.6 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $4.2 million. The change in income taxes payable is attributed to the timing and amount of estimated tax payments this year compared to last year. The change in net settlement processing assets and obligations relates to timing differences, primarily relating to the merchant reserves held as collateral, and certain changes in settlement processing transactions in Canada. During fiscal 2006, we migrated a large portion of our Canadian Visa merchant portfolio away from same day value, which served to lower our settlement processing assets and caused a one-time cash inflow. Same day value is the practice of giving merchants value for credit card transactions on the date of the applicable sale even though we receive the corresponding settlement funds from Visa Canada/International at a later date. See Settlement processing assets and obligations under Note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details. Net cash used in investing activities increased to $116.6 million in fiscal 2007 from $30.0 million in fiscal 2006 primarily due to the increase in business acquisition activities in fiscal 2007. Business acquisition activity in fiscal 2007 required $81.3 million for the HSBC merchant acquiring acquisition, the Diginet acquisition, and the acquisition of money transfer branches. Business acquisition activity in fiscal 2006 required $4.9 million, relating to the acquisition of money transfer branches. Capital expenditures increased to $35.4 million in fiscal 2007 from $25.0 million in fiscal 2006. These expenditures primarily relate to software and infrastructure, including our planned consolidation of our two 36 Table of Contents domestic platforms to a single platform. We completed the relocation of our data center from our former parent facility to our own facility during fiscal 2006. The capital expenditures for fiscal 2007 also included DolEx branch expansion and Canadian merchant terminal spending. For fiscal 2008, we expect capital expenditures of $40 million to $50 million. This expected growth over fiscal 2007 is primarily due to increased merchant terminal spending in Canada and in the Asia-Pacific region. In fiscal 2007, $10.9 million, net was provided by financing activities compared to $54.3 million, net used in financing activities in fiscal 2006. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to no repayments on our Canadian and domestic credit facilities in fiscal 2007, as we had no borrowings as of May 31, 2007 and 2006. We believe that our current level of cash and borrowing capacity under our committed lines of credit described below, together with future cash flows from operations, are sufficient to meet the needs of our existing operations and planned requirements for the foreseeable future. As of May 31, 2007, we do not have any material capital commitments, other than commitments under capital and operating leases, and planned expansions see Commitments and Contractual Obligations below for more details. We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and acquisitions, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future, either through the issuance of debt, equity or otherwise. Our current cash flow strategy is to pay off debt, if any, to make planned capital investments in our business, to pursue acquisitions that meet our growth strategies, to pay dividends at the discretion of our Board of Directors, to repurchase our stock at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and to invest excess cash in high-quality, short-term marketable securities. Credit Facilities On November 16, 2006, we entered into a five year, $350 million unsecured revolving credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks based in the United States, which we refer to as our U.S. Credit Facility. The credit agreement contains certain financial and non-financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this nature. We complied with these covenants as of May 31, 2007. The facility expires in November 2011, and borrowings bear a variable interest rate based on a market short-term floating rate plus a margin that varies according to our leverage position. In addition, the U.S. Credit Facility allows us to expand the facility size to $700 million by requesting additional commitments from existing or new lenders. We plan to use the U.S. Credit Facility to fund future strategic acquisitions, to provide a source of working capital, and for general corporate purposes. As of May 31, 2007, we had no borrowings outstanding on our U.S. Credit Facility. As of May 31, 2006, we had no borrowings on our former U.S. credit facility, which we terminated on November 16, 2006 in conjunction with our entry into the U.S. Credit Facility. On November 16, 2006, we entered into an amendment to our credit facility, which we refer to as our Canadian Credit Facility, with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, or CIBC, as administrative agent and lender. The Canadian Credit Facility is an uncommitted facility which consists of a line of credit of $25 million Canadian dollars, or $23 million United States dollars based on the May 31, 2007 exchange rate. In addition, the Canadian Credit Facility allows us to expand the size of the uncommitted facility to $50 million Canadian dollars during the peak holiday season and does not have a fixed term. The Canadian Credit Facility has a variable interest rate based on the Canadian dollar London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin. The Canadian Credit Facility allows us to provide certain Canadian merchants with same day value for their Visa credit card deposits. Same day value is the practice of giving merchants value for credit card transactions on the date of the applicable sale even though we receive the corresponding settlement funds from Visa Canada/International at a later date. The amounts borrowed under the Canadian Credit Facility are restricted in use to pay Canadian Visa merchants and such amounts are generally received from Visa Canada/International on the following day. 37 Table of Contents Our obligations under the Canadian Credit Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in the members accounts receivable from Visa Canada/International and Interac Associates for our transactions processed through the CIBC Visa BIN and Interac debit network, the bank accounts in which the settlement funds are deposited, and by guarantees from certain of our subsidiaries. These guarantees are subordinate to any guarantees granted by such subsidiaries under our U.S. Credit Facility. The Canadian Credit Facility also contains certain financial and non-financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this nature. We complied with these covenants as of May 31, 2007. As of both May 31, 2007 and May 31, 2006, we had no borrowings outstanding on our Canadian Credit Facility. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interest, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or other obligations under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides us with financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk support other than the guarantee products described under Critical Accounting Estimates below. Commitments and Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of May 31, 2007: Payments Due by Future Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5+ Years (in thousands) Operating leases (Note 12) $ 68,081 $ 20,398 $ 29,474 $ 12,313 $ 5,896 Note: This table excludes other obligations that we may have, such as employee benefit plan obligations, and other current and long term liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. We do not have any material purchase commitments as of May 31, 2007. We believe that cash flows from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long-term needs for the operation of our business and the satisfaction of these obligations and commitments. Critical Accounting Estimates In applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements, we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Some of these accounting estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates. We base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. In many instances, however, we reasonably could have used different accounting estimates and, in other instances, changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period, with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates. The critical accounting estimates that we discuss below are those that we believe are most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements. Accounting estimates necessarily require subjective determinations about future events and conditions. Therefore, the following descriptions of critical accounting estimates are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by these forward-looking statements. You should read the following in conjunction with Note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and the risk factors contained in Item 1A Risk Factors of this annual report. 38 Table of Contents Reserve for operating losses As a part of our direct merchant credit card and debit card processing services and check guarantee services in the United States and Canada, we experience merchant losses and check guarantee losses, which we collectively refer to as operating losses. Merchant losses occur when we are unable to collect amounts from merchant customers for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder. Check guarantee losses occur when we are unable to collect the full amount of a guaranteed check from the checkwriter. Please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further explanation of these operating losses. We process credit card transactions for direct merchants and recognize revenue based on a percentage of the gross amount charged. Our direct merchant customers have the liability for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder. In the event, however, that we are not able to collect such amount from the merchants, due to merchant fraud, insolvency, bankruptcy or any other reason, we may be liable for any such reversed charges. We require cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit and other types of collateral by certain merchants to minimize any such contingent liability, and we also utilize a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant risk. We have, however, historically experienced losses due to merchant defaults. We account for our potential liability relating to merchant losses as guarantees. We estimate the fair value of these guarantees by adding a fair value margin to our estimate of losses. This estimate of losses is comprised of known losses and a projection of future losses based on an assumed percentage of our United States and Canadian direct merchant credit card and off-line debit card sales volumes processed, or processed volume. For the years ended May 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, our processed volume was $100.1 billion, $86.4 billion, and $75.8 billion, respectively. For these same periods, we recorded provisions for merchant losses of $3.1 million, $2.7 million, and $5.3 million, respectively. As a percentage of processed volume, these charges were 0.0031%, 0.0032%, and 0.0070%, respectively, during the above periods. This percentage has trended downward over the above periods, primarily due to processed volume growth, increasingly effective risk management efforts and a higher mix of processed volume from merchants referred to us by our ISOs. In many instances, our ISOs are responsible for absorbing merchant losses that we would have otherwise incurred. For these same years, we experienced actual losses of $3.3 million, $3.3 million, and $5.3 million, respectively. Since actual losses were similar to the merchant loss provisions provided above, we believe that our estimation process has been materially accurate on a historical basis. A 10% increase or decrease in our provision for merchant losses as a percentage of processed volume for the year ended May 31, 2007 would have resulted in a decrease or increase in net income of $0.2 million. Further, if our provision for merchant losses as a percentage of processed volume for our fiscal 2007 had equaled our provision for merchant losses as a percentage of processed volume of 0.0032% for the same prior year period, our net income would have decreased by $0.1 million. As of May 31, 2007 and 2006, $2.8 million and $3.1 million, respectively, has been recorded for guarantees associated with merchant card processing and is included in settlement processing obligations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In our check guarantee service offering, we charge our merchants a percentage of the gross amount of the check and guarantee payment of the check to the merchant in the event the check is not honored by the checkwriter bank. We have the right to collect the full amount of the check from the checkwriter but have not historically recovered 100% of the guaranteed checks. Our check guarantee loss reserve is also comprised of known losses and a projection of future losses based on an assumed percentage of the face value of our guaranteed checks. For the years ended May 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, we guaranteed total check face values of $2.6 billion, $2.5 billion, and $2.1 billion, respectively. For those same periods, we recorded provisions for check guarantee losses of $18.2 million, $17.9 million, and $13.0 million, respectively. As a percentage of the total guaranteed check face value, these charges were 0.70%, 0.71%, and 0.63%, respectively, during the years mentioned above. For these same years, we experienced actual losses of $18.8 million, $16.1 million, and $13.3 million, respectively. Since actual losses were similar to the check guarantee loss provisions provided above, we believe that our estimation process has been materially accurate on a historical basis. A 10% increase or decrease in our percentage assumption for the year ended 39 Table of Contents May 31, 2007 would have resulted in a decrease or increase in net income of $1.2 million. Further, if our guarantee loss as a percentage of guarantee volume for our fiscal 2007 had equaled our guarantee loss as a percentage of guarantee volume of 0.71% for the same prior year period, our net income would have decreased by $0.2 million. As of May 31, 2007 and 2006, we had a check guarantee reserve of $5.1 million and $5.8 million, respectively, which is included in claims receivable, net, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We derive our projected loss rate assumptions primarily based on a rolling twelve-month analysis of historic loss activity. These assumptions, however, bear the risk of change, which may occur as a result of several qualitative factors. For merchant losses, these factors include: a change in the creditworthiness of our merchant customers; a change in the levels of credit card fraud affecting our merchant customers; and a change in the effectiveness of our internal credit, risk management, and collection departments. For check guarantee losses, these factors include a change in the levels of dishonored consumer checks presented to our guarantee service merchant customers and a change in the effectiveness of our internal check guarantee procedures, customer acceptance and retention policies, or collection protocols. Application of our percentage assumptions involve uncertainty regarding changes in any of the factors above, especially those that are outside of our control, such as the financial health of the United States and Canadian economies at a regional or national level and the related impact on our customers. Our loss rate assumptions have not changed materially for the years ended May 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, and we expect that they will either remain constant or modestly fluctuate in the future, depending on changes in the above factors. Goodwill and long-lived asset valuations We regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amounts of goodwill, property and equipment, and other intangible assets may warrant revision or may not be recoverable. Goodwill and other indefinite-life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually by applying a fair value based test. Property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may exceed their fair values. When factors indicate that these assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, we assess the potential impairment of their carrying values by determining whether the carrying value of such long-lived assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted cash flows expected from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. We completed our most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-life intangible asset impairment test as of January 1, 2007 and determined that no impairment charges were required as of that date. Other intangible assets primarily represent customer-related intangible assets, such as customer lists and merchant contracts, non-compete agreements, and trademarks associated with acquisitions. Customer-related intangible assets, non-compete agreements, and certain trademarks are amortized over their estimated useful lives of up to 30 years. The useful lives for customer-related intangible assets are determined based primarily on forecasted cash flows, which include estimates for revenues, expenses, and customer attrition associated with the assets. The useful lives of non-compete agreements are equal to the terms of the agreements. The useful lives of amortizable trademarks are based on our plans to phase out the trademarks in the applicable markets. We have determined that the trademarks other than the amortizable trademarks have indefinite lives and, therefore, are not being amortized. For all periods through November 30, 2006, the straight-line method of amortization was employed for all customer-related intangible assets. On December 1, 2006, we adopted the accelerated method of amortization described below which is applied over the respective periods of expected cash flows for our then significant customer-related intangible assets. These particular assets reflected 90% of the carrying value of our total customer-related intangible assets as of November 30, 2006. In determining amortization expense under our accelerated method for any given period, we calculate the expected cash flows for that period that were used in determining the acquired value of the asset and divide that amount by the expected total cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We multiply that percentage by the initial carrying value of the asset to arrive at the 40 Table of Contents amortization expense for that period. In addition, if the cash flow patterns that we experience are less favorable than our initial estimates, we will adjust the amortization schedule accordingly. These cash flow patterns are derived using certain assumptions and cost allocations due to a significant amount of asset interdependencies that exist in our business. We believe that our accelerated method better approximates the distribution of cash flows generated by our acquired customer relationships. We adopted this method prospectively for our existing significant customer-related intangible assets described above and intend to adopt this method for future acquisitions of customer-related intangible assets. The use of this amortization method prior to December 1, 2006 would have resulted in amortization expense that is not materially different from the amount recognized under the straight-line method used by us during the same periods. Lastly, we will continue to use the straight-line method of amortization for the certain customer-related intangible assets that reflected 10% of the carrying value of our total such assets as of November 30, 2006. For these assets, the amortization expense using a straight-line method historically resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, amortization expense that is not materially different from the amount that would be recognized under the accelerated method of amortization described above. We will also continue to use the straight-line method of amortization for our non-compete agreements and amortizable trademarks. The other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets include software rights purchased in September 2001 for $5 million. These rights would allow us to perform certain processing and software support activities that are currently performed on our behalf by a third party. We expect this software code to be the foundation for a project planned to perform these services internally. This plan is still in the initial feasibility and design phase as of May 31, 2007. If, in the future, we were to decide to abandon our plans to perform these activities ourselves, the value of this asset may be substantially impaired. While we believe that the rights may have a resale value, the maximum potential impairment could equal the carrying value. In our opinion, the carrying values of long-lived assets, including goodwill, property and equipment, and other intangible assets, are not impaired at May 31, 2007 and May 31, 2006. 41 Table of Contents
