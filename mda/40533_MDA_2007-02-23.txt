ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (For an overview of the company business groups, including a discussion of products and services provided, see the Business discussion contained in Part I, Item 1, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.) MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW General Dynamics is a market leader in business aviation; land and expeditionary combat vehicles and systems, armaments, and munitions; shipbuilding and marine systems; and mission-critical information systems and technologies. The company operates through four business groups Aerospace, Combat Systems, Marine Systems and Information Systems and Technology. General Dynamics primary customers are the U.S. military, other government organizations, the armed forces of allied nations, and a diverse base of corporate and individual buyers of business aircraft. The company operates in two primary markets defense and business aviation. The majority of the company revenues derive from contracts with the U.S. military. 2006 Sales by Customer Base The nation engagement in the global war on terror, coupled with the need to modernize U.S. military forces, has driven steady Department of Defense funding increases since 2001. In particular, procurement and research and development (R&D) budgets, also known as investment accounts, provide the majority of the company revenues. These budget lines continue to enjoy sustained increases, demonstrating administration and congressional support. Defense Department funding has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 6 percent from fiscal 2001 through 2007, while procurement and R&D spending has grown 7 percent annually during that period. For fiscal year 2007, the Congress appropriated $435 billion for the Department of Defense, including approximately $156 billion for procurement and R&D. For fiscal year 2008, the President has requested that the Congress appropriate $481 billion for the Department of Defense, an 11 percent increase over the 2007 funding. This includes $177 billion for procurement and R&D, an increase of 13 percent over 2007. During this period of war, defense budgets have included the President budget submission, as well as supplemental funds requested over the course of the fiscal year to meet the emergent needs of the warfighter. For fiscal year 2007, the administration requested, and the Congress appropriated, approximately $70 billion in supplemental funding. Congress has recently been asked to provide an additional $93 billion, which, if approved, will bring total defense funding for fiscal year 2007 to approximately $600 billion, an 87 percent increase since 2001. Notably, approximately 28 percent, or $45 billion, of the 2007 anticipated supplemental funding is requested for additional investment spending. While these supplemental funding requests have increased total defense spending levels, some military service accounts are under pressure as the services move funds among accounts to cover short-term war needs. In addition, supplemental appropriations do not include the level of program detail typically provided in general defense appropriations. These two factors have made it increasingly difficult to forecast the timing and amount of the impact of supplemental funding on the company programs. Looking ahead, the company expects the defense budget top line to remain well funded for the near term, led by the need to continue to support the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. While the landscape will continue to evolve during this dynamic period, the company expects near-term defense funding to be driven by the following: continued support for the warfighter from the administration and the Congress, the size of the U.S. military, including the number of troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the need to reset and replenish equipment and supplies damaged and consumed during the war. Based on the recently approved and proposed defense budgets, the company expects the levels of funding available for its programs will likely continue to grow in 2007 and 2008. Defense Funding 2001 2008 General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report 19 Table of Contents Beyond the company U.S. defense market, governments around the world are increasingly funding weapons and equipment modernization programs, leading to expanding defense export opportunities. The company is committed to pursuing international opportunities presented by foreign demand for military hardware and information technologies. While the revenue upside can be significant, European and other foreign defense budgets are subject to unpredictable issues of contract award timing, defense priorities and overall fiscal spending pressures. As General Dynamics broadens the customer base for its defense products around the world, the company expects growing international sales. The business-aviation market also continues to expand, and 2006 was another strong year. In particular, the market for the company business jets outside the United States is growing at an increasingly rapid rate. In 2006, Gulfstream received 42 percent of its aircraft orders from outside North America. Of note, the European market, including Russia, made up more than 20 percent of the group orders in 2006, and demand remains strong. To meet this demand and maximize the company opportunities in the near term, the Aerospace group is increasing annual deliveries prudently while focusing on margins. Looking ahead, as part of a continual effort to bring new technology and products to market, the company is making investments in the Aerospace group facilities to support the robust global business-jet demand and a growing aircraft-services market. The company expects continued growth in the business-jet market, stemming from a strong product selection in the long-range and ultra-long-range markets, and robust sales of the company mid-size products. General Dynamics management is committed to creating shareholder value through ethical business practices, disciplined program management and continuous operational improvements. The company solid performance over the past 10 years is measured in its sustained revenue and earnings growth and strong cash flow. General Dynamics record as an industry leader in cash flow generation has enabled it to consistently deploy resources to enhance shareholder returns through strategic and tactical acquisitions, payment of dividends and share repurchases. CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW Results of Operations Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 Variance Net sales $ 24,063 $ 20,975 $ 3,088 15 % Operating earnings 2,625 2,179 446 20 % Operating margin 10.9 % 10.4 % General Dynamics net sales increased significantly in 2006, with each of the company business groups contributing to the sales growth. Increased new aircraft deliveries in the Aerospace group, strong demand for combat vehicles and armament and munitions products in the Combat Systems group, and acquisitions in the Information Systems and Technology group were the most significant drivers of the increase in sales. Higher activity on early-stage ship construction programs in the Marine Systems group also added to the sales increase. The growth in the company operating earnings outpaced the increase in sales in 2006. Double-digit earnings growth occurred in all four businesses. A key driver was performance in the Marine Systems group, which saw operating earnings rise over 50 percent. In the Aerospace group, operating earnings increased significantly on strong volume in new aircraft sales and continued pricing improvements. For the company as a whole, this led to a 50 basis-point increase in the company operating margins to 10.9 percent in 2006 from 10.4 percent in 2005. The company focus on operations has led to improved margins in each of the last three years, resulting in a 210 basis-point improvement since 2003. 20 General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report Table of Contents Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 Variance Net sales $ 20,975 $ 18,868 $ 2,107 11 % Operating earnings 2,179 1,931 248 13 % Operating margin 10.4 % 10.2 % The company produced strong growth in sales and operating earnings in 2005. The Information Systems and Technology group led the increase, generating over the half of the company sales growth over 2004. The Combat Systems and Aerospace groups also contributed to the increase in sales, while the Marine Systems group sales in 2005 were steady compared with 2004. Increased volume in the Information Systems and Technology, Combat Systems and Aerospace groups drove the growth in operating earnings. The company earnings were boosted by the Aerospace group, whose earnings increased at almost double the rate of sales in 2005, driven by continued strong demand for business jets. The growth was partly offset by program losses in the Marine Systems group during the year. The company margins increased to 10.4 percent in 2005 compared with 10.2 percent in 2004. Cash Flow The company cash flow from operating activities significantly exceeded net earnings in each of the past three years, continuing the company consistent record of generating substantial cash from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.1 billion in 2006 and 2005 and $1.8 billion in 2004. In addition, the company generated over $300 in cash in both 2006 and 2005 from the sale of several non-core businesses. Over the three-year period, the company used its cash to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures, repurchase its common stock, pay dividends and reduce its outstanding debt. Other Financial Information General and administrative (G&A) expenses as a percentage of sales were 6.2 percent in 2006 and 2005, and 6.1 percent in 2004. G&A was $1.5 billion in 2006, $1.3 billion in 2005 and $1.2 billion in 2004. The company expects 2007 G&A as a percent of sales to approximate the 2006 rate. Net interest expense was $101 in 2006 compared with $118 in 2005 and $148 in 2004. The decrease in 2006 and 2005 resulted from interest income generated by the company strong cash position during the year. The company expects net interest expense of approximately $85 in 2007. The company effective tax rate was 32.3 percent in 2006, 30.0 percent in 2005 and 32.7 percent in 2004. In 2005, the company favorably resolved its 1999 to 2002 audit with the Internal Revenue Service. This settlement resulted in a $66 non-cash benefit, which reduced the company 2005 tax rate by 3.2 percent. The company anticipates an effective tax rate of approximately 32 to 33 percent in 2007, excluding the effect of potential settlements or other discrete events. For additional discussion of tax matters, see Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Discontinued Operations In 2006, General Dynamics completed the sale of its aggregates operation. The company received approximately $315 in cash from the sale of this business and recognized an after-tax gain of approximately $220 in discontinued operations. In addition, in 2006 the company initiated a process to sell its coal mining operation and recognized an estimated after-tax loss of approximately $40 in discontinued operations in connection with the anticipated sale. With the sale of the aggregates business and the expected sale of the coal business, the operations previously reported as Resources have been reclassified as discontinued operations. In 2004, as part of its efforts to focus on performance, General Dynamics identified a number of operations that were not core to the company and could be divested. As a result, the company completed the sale of several small businesses in the second half of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005. The company received approximately $300 in cash, net of income taxes, and reported an after-tax loss of $8 in 2005 from the sale of these businesses. The company reported net sales for all periods presented exclude the revenues associated with these divested businesses, and their operating results are included as discontinued operations, net of income taxes. For additional discussion of the company divestiture activities and the results of discontinued operations, see Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Backlog General Dynamics total backlog increased 7 percent in 2006 to $43.7 billion at December 31. The funded backlog grew 21 percent, reaching $34 billion at year end. In 2006, the company received significant new orders in each of its business groups, totaling $26.5 billion, including a record level of order activity in the Aerospace group. General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report 21 Table of Contents The total backlog for the company defense businesses grew to $36 billion at the end of 2006, compared with $34.1 billion at year-end 2005. The defense backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts. The funded portion of this backlog was $27.1 billion at December 31, 2006. This includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the Congress and funded by the customer, as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments. The unfunded backlog for the defense businesses represents firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated. While there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program, the company has included in backlog only those programs it believes are likely to receive funding. The Aerospace group total backlog reached a new high of $7.7 billion at December 31, 2006, up 16 percent over the year-end 2005 backlog of $6.6 billion (each excluding aircraft options). The Aerospace funded backlog, an indicator of near-term demand, grew 19 percent to $6.9 billion at the end of 2006 as orders continued at a record pace. The funded backlog represents orders for which the company has definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer. The Aerospace unfunded backlog of $752 at December 31, 2006, consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services. The company backlog does not include work awarded under indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts, unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts or options to purchase new aircraft. IDIQ contracts are used when the customer has not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed. These agreements, which set forth the majority of the contractual terms, including prices, are funded as delivery orders are placed. A significant portion of the company IDIQ value represents contracts for which the company has been designated as the sole-source supplier to design, develop, produce and integrate complex products and systems over several years for the military or other government agencies. Management believes the customers intend to fully implement these systems. However, because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customer future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders, the company recognizes these contracts in backlog only when they are funded. Contract options in the company defense businesses represent agreements to perform additional work beyond the products and services associated with firm contracts, if the customer exercises the option. These options are negotiated in conjunction with a firm contract and provide the terms under which the customer may elect to procure additional units or services at a future date. Contract options in the Aerospace group represent options to purchase new aircraft. The company recognizes unexercised options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order. As of December 31, 2006, the potential value associated with these IDIQ contracts and contract options was approximately $13.1 billion, which may be realized over the next 15 years. This represents management estimate of potential value the company will receive. The actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower. REVIEW OF OPERATING SEGMENTS AEROSPACE Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 Variance Net sales $ 4,116 $ 3,433 $ 683 20 % Operating earnings 644 495 149 30 % Operating margin 15.6 % 14.4 % Aircraft Deliveries (in units): Green 113 89 Completion 104 84 The Aerospace group produced significant net sales growth in 2006 due largely to higher new aircraft deliveries to meet increased demand. In 2006, the group delivered 24 additional green aircraft, a 27 percent increase over 2005. Completions increased by 20 units, or 24 percent. A notable driver of the increased deliveries was the introduction of the mid-size G150 aircraft, which had 14 green deliveries and eight completions in 2006. Aircraft services volume also increased in 2006, while pre-owned aircraft sales were consistent with 2005. Of note, pre-owned aircraft deliveries as a percent of the group total unit deliveries declined to 9 percent in 2006 from 12 percent in 2005 and 16 percent in 2004, as more of the group customers chose to sell their pre-owned aircraft in the market rather than trading them in to the company. The group operating earnings and margins increased in 2006 as a result of the additional new aircraft volume and continued pricing improvements in all aircraft models. Improved margins on pre-owned aircraft sales also contributed to the earnings and margin growth in 2006. These increases in operating earnings were counteracted somewhat by a mix shift in the second half of the year that included proportionately more lower-margin, mid-size aircraft deliveries, as well as higher spending on research and development. The group resulting operating margins improved 120 basis points over 2005. 22 General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report Table of Contents The company expects substantial sales growth in the Aerospace group in 2007. The group is projecting 139 new aircraft deliveries in 2007, a 23 percent increase over 2006, and the 2007 production schedule is substantially sold out. Based on new-aircraft orders over the past two years, the group anticipates continued pricing improvements on units to be delivered in 2007. The company expects the effect of these pricing improvements and continued operational efficiencies to offset a further shift in aircraft mix toward mid-size aircraft and increasing product development spending. As a result, the company expects the group margins in 2007 to approximate those achieved in 2006. Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 Variance Net sales $ 3,433 $ 3,012 $ 421 14 % Operating earnings 495 393 102 26 % Operating margin 14.4 % 13.0 % Aircraft Deliveries (in units): Green 89 78 Completion 84 77 The Aerospace group net sales increased in 2005 because of higher new aircraft sales and increased aircraft services volume. Green aircraft deliveries were up 14 percent, and completions were up 9 percent. This growth was offset in part by lower pre-owned aircraft sales. Operating earnings and margins in 2005 grew significantly as a result of increased new aircraft volume, a more favorable mix of deliveries and improved pricing. Favorable cost performance in the aircraft services business and higher pre-owned aircraft earnings due to improved market conditions also contributed to the increase in earnings in 2005. Summary of Aircraft Statistical Information Sales contracts for new aircraft usually have two major milestones: the manufacture of the green aircraft and the aircraft completion, which includes exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics. The company records revenues at two points when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer, and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft. The following table summarizes key unit data for the Aerospace group orders and backlog: Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 New orders 159 124 96 Options exercised 1 Firm orders 159 124 97 As of December 31 Firm contracts in backlog 203 207 175 Completions in backlog* 49 42 39 * Represents aircraft that have moved from green production to the completion process as of year end. The backlog includes only the value of the completion effort on these aircraft. Backlog The Aerospace group backlog grew 16 percent in 2006 to $7.7 billion at year end. The group funded backlog was $6.9 billion at December 31, 2006, up 19 percent over 2005. The funded backlog made up over 90 percent of the group total backlog. In 2006, the group received a record level of orders for the third consecutive year. New aircraft orders have increased nearly 30 percent in each of the past three years. For seven out of the eight quarters in 2005 and 2006, the group achieved a book-to-bill ratio (orders divided by sales) greater than one. New Aircraft Book-to-Bill Ratio 2004 2006* * Represents ratio of new aircraft orders to deliveries (in units) during the year. The group backlog includes scheduled aircraft deliveries through 2011. NetJets Inc. (NetJets), a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and the leader in the fractional aircraft market, is responsible for a significant portion of the group backlog. NetJets purchases the aircraft for use in its fractional ownership program. The group funded backlog at year end included approximately $700 with NetJets, representing firm contracts for 32 aircraft, including 15 green aircraft that are scheduled for delivery in 2007. The unfunded backlog included approximately $550 with NetJets for maintenance and support services. The group also has 28 aircraft options with NetJets. Due to the uncertainty and extended time frames associated with the large-quantity aircraft orders historically placed by NetJets, particularly for mid-size aircraft, the company has removed from the backlog a NetJets order for 50 G150 aircraft. General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report 23 Table of Contents The company has also removed options for 50 G150s and 50 G200s that had been included in the Aerospace group potential contract value. Deliveries of aircraft to NetJets are scheduled from 2007 through 2011 and represent from 3 percent to 10 percent of projected new aircraft sales in those years. Scheduled Deliveries of Aerospace Funded Backlog The group remaining $6.2 billion of funded backlog at year-end 2006 consisted of contracts with a broad range of customers from a variety of industries and included approximately $375 of contracts with government customers. COMBAT SYSTEMS Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 Variance Net sales $ 5,983 $ 5,021 $ 962 19 % Operating earnings 677 576 101 18 % Operating margin 11.3 % 11.5 % The Combat Systems group generated substantial growth in net sales and operating earnings in 2006 compared with 2005. The group benefited from strong domestic and international demand for its combat vehicles and armaments and munitions products, due in part to ongoing U.S. operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Combat Systems operating margins were down slightly in 2006 because of a shift in mix from higher-margin products throughout the group, including the exit from commercial trading activities in the group European operations. The Stryker wheeled combat vehicle contract continued to be the group largest program, with total deliveries to date approaching 2,000 units. Stryker deliveries in 2006 included the Mobile Gun System and Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Reconnaissance vehicles, the final two of the 10 variants in the Stryker family of combat vehicles. The group also experienced higher activity on several other combat vehicle programs during 2006, including the Army Future Combat Systems (FCS) program and various domestic and international light armored vehicle (LAV) contracts. In particular, sales were up significantly in the group European business from volume that had been delayed on a number of vehicle production programs, including the Pandur II wheeled armored vehicle. High demand in the group armament business for systems that protect U.S. combat forces was also a strong contributor to the increased sales. In the group munitions business, a late-2005 award to provide small-caliber ammunition to the Army also made a significant contribution to the group growth in 2006. The group acquisition of Chamberlain Manufacturing Corporation Scranton operation (Scranton Operation) on July 7, 2006, contributed approximately 1 percent of the group sales growth over 2005. The Scranton Operation is a supplier of large-caliber projectile metal parts to the U.S. government. In January 2007, the group acquired SNC Technologies Inc. (SNC TEC), with operations in Quebec, Canada, from SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. SNC TEC is an ammunition systems integrator that supplies small-, medium- and large-caliber ammunition and related products to the Canadian Forces, other national defense customers and law enforcement agencies around the world. The company expects the Combat Systems group to experience sales growth in the low-double-digit range in 2007, including the effect of the SNC TEC acquisition. Operating margins in 2007 should improve somewhat over the 2006 margins. Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 Variance Net sales $ 5,021 $ 4,407 $ 614 14 % Operating earnings 576 522 54 10 % Operating margin 11.5 % 11.8 % The Combat Systems group produced solid growth in net sales and operating earnings in 2005. Higher production activity on the Stryker program was the largest contributor to this increase. Volume also increased on the M1A2 Abrams tank System Enhancement Package program, the Canadian RG-31 mine-protected personnel vehicle contract and the Saudi Arabian National Guard LAV contract. In the armaments and munitions businesses, demand increased in 2005 for reactive armor; systems that protect U.S. combat forces; and large-, medium- and small-caliber ammunition. These increases were offset in part by lower sales volume in the group European business stemming from delays in the timing of customer requirements and the completion of several international combat vehicle programs in 2004. 24 General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report Table of Contents Backlog The Combat Systems group generated $8.2 billion in new order activity in 2006. The group total backlog grew 28 percent to $12 billion at year-end 2006. Funded backlog increased 45 percent in 2006, reaching $10.1 billion at December 31. The group backlog consists primarily of long-term production contracts that have scheduled deliveries through 2014. The group backlog at December 31, 2006, included approximately $1.7 billion for the Army FCS program. The company is leading the system development of the Manned Ground Vehicle element of the program, as well as the development of the autonomous navigation systems for FCS ground vehicles. The company current contract extends through 2012. The Combat Systems group backlog at year end included approximately $1.2 billion for the Army Stryker wheeled combat vehicle program. In 2006, the group received orders under the Stryker program worth approximately $1.3 billion. These awards included approximately $750 for the production of 518 vehicles. The remainder of the awards in 2006 was for engineering and logistics support. In addition to the year-end backlog, the group was awarded a contract in January 2007 worth $145 for logistics support of the Stryker program. The M1 Abrams main battle tank also represents a significant portion of the group backlog. This includes both the M1A2 System Enhancement Package (SEP) and the M1A1 Abrams Integrated Management (AIM) programs. Under the SEP program, the company retrofits M1A2 Abrams main battle tanks with improved electronics, command-and-control capabilities and armor enhancements that are designed to improve the tank effectiveness. The group backlog at year end included approximately $1.1 billion for the SEP program. In 2006, the group received orders valued at over $1 billion. These awards included approximately $515 to upgrade 240 M1A2 Abrams tanks to the SEP configuration and a contract worth approximately $425 to reset and upgrade 72 M1A2 Abrams tanks returning from Operation Iraqi Freedom and procure long-lead material needed to reset and upgrade an additional 240 tanks in the future. In 2006, the group received contracts valued at over $450 for the refurbishment of approximately 500 M1A1 tanks through the AIM process. The year-end backlog included approximately $550 for the AIM program. Under this program, M1A1 Abrams main battle tanks are completely overhauled and returned to a like-new condition. The group backlog at year end included approximately $225 for the Marine Corps Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) program. The group is continuing the system design and development phase of the EFV program. Combat Systems also provides LAVs to the Marine Corps. The group was awarded a contract in 2006 worth over $300 to provide 151 eight-wheeled LAVs in various configurations. The vehicles are scheduled to be delivered in 2007 and 2008. Internationally, the group was awarded several significant combat vehicle contracts in 2006. The Belgian government selected the group Piranha wheeled armored vehicle for its Armored Infantry Vehicle program. The program calls for up to 242 vehicles and related logistics support and is worth approximately $600 if all options are exercised. The Czech Republic selected the group for a contract to produce 199 eight-wheeled Pandur II armored personnel carriers for the Czech army, for delivery between 2007 and 2012. The contract has an option for 35 additional vehicles and is worth up to $1 billion. The Combat Systems group has several other significant international, long-term combat vehicle production contracts in backlog. The group Leopard 2E program is a long-term battle tank manufacturing contract for the Spanish army using a design licensed from a German company. The group backlog at year end included approximately $400 for the production of 147 Leopard tanks, with deliveries scheduled through 2009. The group also produces Pizarro Advanced Infantry Fighting Vehicles for the Spanish army. The backlog at the end of the year included approximately $660 for the production of 191 Pizarro vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2013. The group backlog at year end also included approximately $450 for a contract with the government of Portugal for 260 Pandur II vehicles. In 2006, the group received a contract worth approximately $370 from the Spanish army to supply long-range SPIKE missile systems. Under this contract, the company has been asked to manufacture 260 launchers and 2,600 missiles and provide related logistics support. In addition, the Combat Systems group backlog at year end included approximately $1.9 billion in armament, munitions, detection systems and composite-structures programs. In 2006, the Army awarded the group a $165 delivery order for the production of Hydra-70 (70mm) rockets, motors and warheads. The order is part of a five-year requirements contract with a total value received to date of over $330. Additionally, the group received a contract modification from the Army valued at approximately $190 for small-caliber ammunition. This award extended through 2007 a contract previously awarded in 2005 and increased the contract value to approximately $380. The contract has a total potential value of approximately $1.2 billion if all options are exercised. The Army also awarded the group a contract worth approximately $130 for the production of reactive armor tile sets for Bradley Fighting Vehicles and a contract with a potential value of $60 for Abrams reactive armor tile sets. General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report 25 Table of Contents MARINE SYSTEMS Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 Variance Net sales $ 4,940 $ 4,695 $ 245 5 % Operating earnings 375 249 126 51 % Operating margin 7.6 % 5.3 % The Marine Systems group net sales increased in 2006 due primarily to an increase in volume on ship design and construction contracts for the U.S. Navy. Activity continued to increase in 2006 on the T-AKE combat logistics ship and Virginia-class submarine construction programs. In 2006, the company delivered the Lewis and Clark, the first ship under the current nine-ship T-AKE contract. Ships two through six are currently under construction. The Virginia-class program includes a four-ship cost-reimbursable Block I contract and a six-ship fixed-priced Block II contract. In 2006, the group delivered the Texas and the Hawaii, the second and third ships of the Block I contract. The fourth Block I ship is scheduled for delivery in 2008, and construction has begun on the first four ships of the Block II contract. The group also continued construction of its first Littoral Combat Ship and detail design of the DDG-1000 next-generation destroyer. The growth on these programs was offset in part by declining volume on the group contract to convert four ballistic-missile submarines to a conventional-strike configuration (SSGN) and its commercial tanker contract. The group returned to service the second and third SSGNs, the Florida and the Michigan, and completed the final commercial tanker in 2006. Marine Systems produced significant improvement in operating earnings in 2006, resulting in an increase in operating margins of 230 basis points over 2005. The most notable impact came from the group commercial tanker program and its submarine repair and overhaul business. In 2005, the group experienced $50 of cost growth on its contract to build four double-hull oil tankers, which negatively impacted operating earnings and margins. The final ship under this contract was delivered in 2006, two weeks ahead of schedule. Final settlement of the contract with the customer and efficiencies achieved in labor-hour performance on the completion of the contract generated positive earnings on the contract in 2006. The group also recorded losses on two submarine maintenance and overhaul contracts in 2005 totaling approximately $20. These losses resulted from customer-requested change orders that the group fulfilled prior to securing adequate contract protection. The group has implemented a more structured approach to managing customer change requirements, and the performance in the group overhaul and repair business improved significantly in 2006. Operating earnings and margins in 2006 also benefited from increased profitability on the group Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) destroyer construction program. In 2006, Marine Systems delivered the Farragut and the Gridley, the 26th and 27th ships of the class completed by the group. The group continues to generate significant labor-hour efficiencies and cost savings on the program, which includes delivery of seven more ships through 2011. The group experienced cost growth in 2005 on the Navy T-AKE program primarily from engineering- and design-related changes imposed by the customer. The company has submitted a formal request for equitable adjustment with the customer seeking approximately $600 of additional contract payments for the rework effort and scope growth caused by these changes. The Navy is evaluating the claim, and the company expects a resolution of this matter in 2007. The company is recording revenue at a break-even level based on the assumed recovery of a portion of this claim (see Note G to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The company expects sales in the Marine Systems group in 2007 to be similar to the 2006 volume, with improving margins as the Virginia-class, DDG-51 and T-AKE programs in particular continue to achieve efficiencies associated with program maturity and shipyard capital investments. Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 Variance Net sales $ 4,695 $ 4,726 $ (31 ) (1 )% Operating earnings 249 292 (43 ) (15 )% Operating margin 5.3 % 6.2 % In 2005, the Marine Systems group net sales were consistent with 2004. Higher volume on the Virginia-class submarine and T-AKE programs was offset by the completion of the Seawolf-class submarine program in 2004, lower activity on the group commercial tanker contract, and fewer repair and engineering contracts. Program losses in 2005 adversely affected the group operating earnings and margins. As previously discussed, the company recognized losses on its commercial tanker contract and two submarine maintenance and overhaul contracts in 2005, which depressed the group operating earnings and margins. Backlog 26 General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report Table of Contents The Marine Systems group backlog consists of long-term submarine and ship construction programs, as well as repair and engineering contracts. The group ended 2006 with a total backlog of $14 billion compared with $15.4 billion at year-end 2005. The group funded backlog was up 12 percent from $8.4 billion to $9.4 billion. The group generally receives large contract awards that provide backlog for several years. The current backlog includes shipbuilding programs through 2014. The backlog at year end included $7 billion for the Virginia-class submarine program, the group largest contract in backlog. The group has delivered three Virginia-class submarines, including two in 2006, and the backlog includes seven additional ships. Two submarines are scheduled for delivery in 2008, with one delivery per year beginning in 2010 for the remaining five ships under contract. The company is the prime contractor on the Virginia-class program, and construction is shared equally with its teaming partner. In 2006, the Navy awarded the group contract modifications worth over $2.6 billion that provide funding for the construction of the eighth and ninth submarines and advance procurement for the tenth ship. The group backlog at year end also included $1.4 billion for the construction of the remaining eight ships under contract under the Navy T-AKE program. The group delivered the lead ship of the T-AKE class in 2006. The Navy exercised an option in 2006 worth approximately $320 for the ninth T-AKE ship, bringing the total contract value to $2.8 billion. Deliveries of these ships are scheduled through 2010. Another significant component of the Marine Systems group backlog is the Arleigh Burke-class DDG-51 destroyer program. At year-end 2006, the backlog included $1.8 billion for seven DDG destroyers scheduled for delivery through 2011. In parallel with the completion of the DDG-51 program, the Navy and industry are transitioning to construction of the next-generation guided-missile destroyer, the DDG-1000 Zumwalt Class, formerly known as DD(X). In 2006, the Navy awarded the group one of two contracts, valued at approximately $115, for the detail design of the ship. In January 2007, the Navy exercised an option worth $257 to complete the design effort for DDG-1000. In 2006, the company signed a contract worth $1 billion with U.S. Shipping Partners, L.P., for the construction of nine product-carrier tankers. The ships are scheduled for delivery between 2009 and 2014. The contract includes options for five additional ships, which will be added to the group backlog if exercised. Marine Systems leads one of two teams selected for the development and construction of the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), the Navy newest class of high-speed surface combatants. The LCS is designed to operate in coastal areas against terrorist threats, high-speed swarm boats, mines and diesel submarines. In 2006, the Navy exercised an option worth $208 for the construction of a second LCS. The company first and second ships under the LCS program are scheduled for delivery in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The group backlog includes $135 for the SSGN program. Under this contract, the group is converting four Trident ballistic-missile submarines to an SSGN configuration, a multi-mission submarine optimized for tactical strike and special-operations support. The company delivered the second and third submarines under contract in 2006, and the conversion of the fourth submarine is scheduled for completion in 2007. In January 2007, the Navy awarded the group a seven-year contract for the maintenance and repair of LHA- and LHD-class amphibious assault ships. The contract has a potential value of $400, including options to extend the contract through 2013. INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 Variance Net sales $ 9,024 $ 7,826 $ 1,198 15 % Operating earnings 976 865 111 13 % Operating margin 10.8 % 11.1 % The Information Systems and Technology group net sales and operating earnings increased in 2006, due largely to business acquisitions in 2005 and 2006. In 2006, the company acquired Anteon International Corporation (Anteon) and FC Business Systems, Inc. (FCBS), to expand the group information technology (IT) and mission services business. The company completed three smaller acquisitions in the group tactical communications systems business in 2005. In addition to acquisitions, the group experienced solid growth in its domestic IT services and tactical communications systems businesses, including the following key programs: Intelligence Information, Command-and-Control Equipment and Enhancements (ICE2), which supports critical intelligence and command-and-control systems and networks for U.S. defense and intelligence operations worldwide; Network-Centric Solutions (NETCENTS), which provides information technology, networking, and voice, video and data communications products and services to support the U.S. Air Force; Common Hardware/Software III (CHS-3), which provides updated commercial and ruggedized computers, network equipment and software to the U.S. armed forces and other federal agencies worldwide; Canadian Maritime Helicopter Project (MHP), which provides integrated mission systems for 28 state-of-the-art helicopters that are intended to replace Canada aging fleet of marine helicopters; and Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), which enables on-the-move satellite connectivity for U.S. and allied forces. Increased demand for wireless network solutions for commercial wireless carriers also contributed to the group sales growth. General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report 27 Table of Contents The group sales growth in 2006 was tempered by the anticipated decline in activity on several programs, in particular the United Kingdom BOWMAN program and the Pentagon Renovation contract. BOWMAN is the secure digital voice and data communications system for the U.K. armed forces. In the second half of 2006, the BOWMAN program began transitioning from the production and installation phase to maintenance and long-term support activities. The group intelligence-systems business also experienced lower volume in 2006. The group resulting organic growth over 2005 was approximately 2 percent. In 2006, the group contract mix began to transition from a core holding of mature production programs to include more development-stage contracts, which typically carry lower margins and lower revenue levels. In addition, the group faced delays in some of its programs as the Defense Department shifted funds away from these contracts to support the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. These factors limited the group sales growth in 2006 and, when combined with the impact of lower margins contributed by recently acquired businesses, led to a slight decrease in the group operating margins for the year. In 2007, the company expects 7 to 8 percent sales growth for the group, with some reduction in operating margins as the group integrates the recent acquisitions and the shift in contract mix continues. Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 Variance Net sales $ 7,826 $ 6,722 $ 1,104 16 % Operating earnings 865 718 147 20 % Operating margin 11.1 % 10.7 % The group net sales and operating earnings improved substantially in 2005. The group experienced a significant increase in activity on its programs that provide secure communications and network systems to U.S. forces around the world, including ICE2, CHS-3, MUOS and the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) handheld/manpack/small form fit (HMS) radio. Internationally, the BOWMAN program and the MHP contract also contributed to the significant sales volume in 2005. Acquisitions in 2004 and 2005 contributed about 40 percent of the group 2005 sales growth. Operating margins in 2005 improved over 2004 due to the timing and mix of contract performance phases and customer deliveries, and cost savings achieved from the continued integration of acquired businesses. Backlog The Information Systems and Technology group backlog grew 6 percent in 2006 to $10 billion at year end. The group funded backlog increased 8 percent over 2005, reaching $7.5 billion. The group continued to generate significant order activity in 2006, achieving a book-to-bill ratio (orders divided by sales) greater than one for the fourth consecutive year. Unlike the company other defense businesses, the Information Systems and Technology group backlog consists primarily of a large number of mid-size contracts and programs, as well as several large-scale, long-term programs awarded over the past few years. Programs that made up a significant portion of the group year-end backlog included over $600 for the U.K. BOWMAN program, approximately $500 for the MHP contract, $515 for the MUOS program and $490 for ICE2. The group received over $650 in orders on the ICE2 program in 2006. In addition to these programs, the group received numerous significant contract awards in 2006. The Information Systems and Technology group was awarded one of two contracts to prepare a design and implementation plan for an initial service area of the Integrated Wireless Network (IWN). Following the design phase in 2007, the customer plans to select a single contractor to implement this system. IWN is a collaborative effort between the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security and the Treasury intended to provide secure, seamless, interoperable and reliable nationwide wireless voice, data and multimedia communications among 80,000 federal agents and law enforcement officers engaged in disaster response, law enforcement, protective services and homeland defense. The group was awarded a contract extension in 2006 worth approximately $100 to continue its support of the U.S. Joint Forces Command Joint Experimentation Program and Joint Futures Lab, bringing the total contract value to over $275. Under this program, the group is providing engineering, technical and administrative services for joint force concept development. The Army awarded the group two contracts worth a combined $125 to support the Joint Network Node (JNN) program, bringing the total contract value to date to $380. Under JNN, the company is installing and deploying a tactical communications network for the Army. 28 General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report Table of Contents The group also received an order worth approximately $190 under its JTRS HMS radio development contract. Under the JTRS contract, the group is developing small, lightweight software-defined radios for use by all branches of the U.S. military. The Marine Corps awarded the group a contract valued at $230 for 165 Combat Operation Centers. These mobile command and control systems are intended to meet an urgent operational need for regiment- and battalion-level Marine Corps operations centers in Iraq. The group backlog does not include approximately $9.2 billion of potential contract value associated with IDIQ contracts and unexercised options. The value of these arrangements grew by over 35 percent in 2006 and may be realized over the next 15 years. In 2006, funding under IDIQ contracts contributed over $2.5 billion to the group funded backlog. The group was awarded several significant IDIQ contracts during 2006, including one of 16 contracts from the Army to provide services under the Information Technology Enterprise Solutions 2 Services (ITES-2S) program. ITES-2S is an IDIQ contract with a $20 billion program ceiling and a nine-year performance period. Under the ITES-2S contract, the participating contractors will provide information technology services to the Army in support of its enterprise infrastructure goals. The Army selected the group for the first competitively awarded task order under the Total Engineering and Integration Services (TEIS) contract, an IDIQ multiple-award contract to provide IT engineering and technical support at customer sites worldwide. The TEIS contract has a ceiling value of approximately $800. The Department of Homeland Security awarded the group one of 25 IDIQ contracts under its Enterprise Acquisition Gateway for Leading Edge Solutions (EAGLE) program. This contract is for the procurement of IT services under four functional categories, including engineering design, development, implementation and integration; operations and maintenance; software development; and management support services. Information Systems and Technology was awarded one of six World-Wide Satellite Systems (WWSS) prime contracts to provide a family of military satellite communications terminals under a five-year IDIQ program worth up to $5 billion. The program is intended to support federal communications missions, including disaster relief and homeland security efforts. In addition, the group was awarded a prime contract under the Design Engineering Support Program II (DESP II), a multiple-award IDIQ contract with a total potential value of $1.9 billion over five years. This contract is for design and engineering technical support services for Department of Defense mission weapon systems, components and support equipment. CORPORATE Corporate results consist primarily of compensation expense for stock options and a portion of the earnings from the company commercial pension plans. In the second quarter of 2006, the company completed the sale of its aggregates business, as discussed in Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, the company has initiated a plan to sell its coal mining operation. With the sale of the aggregates business and the expected sale of the coal business, the operations previously reported as Resources have been reclassified to discontinued operations. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 Variance Net sales $ $ $ Operating expenses (47 ) (6 ) (41 ) The Corporate operating expense increased in 2006 over 2005 due to the company stock option expense.

General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report 29 Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In the mid-1990s, General Dynamics embarked on a strategy of disciplined capital deployment, generating strong cash flow to enable a series of acquisitions designed to grow the company beyond its core platform businesses. These acquisitions incorporated new products and technologies and expanded the company customer base. Since 1995, the company has acquired 43 businesses for a total cost of over $16 billion. These actions have resulted in a larger, more diversified company, while preserving a strong balance sheet and sustained financial flexibility. Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,128 $ 2,056 $ 1,803 Net cash used by investing activities (2,316 ) (181 ) (786 ) Net cash used by financing activities (539 ) (520 ) (902 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash and equivalents (727 ) 1,355 115 Cash and equivalents at beginning of period 2,331 976 861 Cash and equivalents at end of period 1,604 2,331 976 Short- and long-term debt 2,781 3,287 3,293 Net debt (a) $ 1,177 $ 956 $ 2,317 Debt-to-equity (b) 28.3 % 40.4 % 45.8 % Debt-to-capital (c) 22.1 % 28.8 % 31.4 % (a) Net debt is calculated as total debt less cash and equivalents. (b) Debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total equity. (c) Debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total debt plus total equity. General Dynamics management emphasizes the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns. In 2006, for the fourth consecutive year, net cash provided by operating activities significantly exceeded net earnings. The company employed this cash to complete acquisitions, continue its trend of annual dividend increases, repay maturing debt and repurchase its outstanding shares. As a result of this continued focus on cash generation and disciplined capital deployment, the company return on invested capital (ROIC) increased by 70 basis points during 2006 to 15.6 percent and has increased 320 basis points since 2003. Return on Invested Capital Management believes ROIC is a useful measure for investors, because it reflects the company ability to generate returns from the capital it has deployed in its operations. The company uses ROIC to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management. Management defines ROIC as net operating profit after taxes divided by the sum of the average debt and shareholders equity for the year. Net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus after-tax interest and amortization expense. ROIC for 2004 through 2006 is calculated as follows: Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Earnings from continuing operations $ 1,710 $ 1,448 $ 1,194 After-tax interest expense 106 108 106 After-tax amortization expense 90 70 62 Net operating profit after taxes 1,906 1,626 1,362 Average debt and equity 12,220 10,948 10,249 Return on invested capital 15.6 % 14.9 % 13.3 % The company free cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion in 2006 and 2005, compared with $1.5 billion in 2004. Management defines free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures. Management believes free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors, because it portrays the company ability to generate cash from its core businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing its common stock and paying dividends. The company uses free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of its earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management. The following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations $ 2,156 $ 2,033 $ 1,760 Capital expenditures (334 ) (262 ) (253 ) Free cash flow from operations $ 1,822 $ 1,771 $ 1,507 Cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations: Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations 126 % 140 % 147 % Free cash flow from operations 107 % 122 % 126 % 30 General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report Table of Contents Over the past ten years, the company has generated free cash flow from operations well in excess of its earnings from continuing operations during the period. With free cash flow from operations projected to approximate earnings from continuing operations in 2007, the company expects to continue to generate funds in excess of its short- and long-term liquidity needs. Management believes the company has adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute its financial and operating strategy. The following is a discussion of the company major operating, investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.1 billion in both 2006 and 2005 and $1.8 billion in 2004. In each year, net earnings was the primary driver of the company cash flow. Increasing levels of customer advances and deposits, particularly associated with new-aircraft order activity in the Aerospace group, also contributed to the strong cash provided by operating activities in each of these years. Termination of A-12 Program. As discussed further in Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements, litigation on the A-12 program termination has been ongoing since 1991. If, contrary to the company expectations, the default termination ultimately is sustained, the company and The Boeing Company could collectively be required to repay the U.S. government as much as $1.4 billion for progress payments received for the A-12 contract, plus interest, which was approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2006. If this were the outcome, the government contends the company would owe approximately $1.3 billion pretax. The company after-tax cash obligation would be approximately $665. The company believes it has sufficient resources to pay such an obligation, if required, while still retaining ample liquidity. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $2.3 billion in 2006, $181 in 2005 and $786 in 2004. The primary uses of cash in investing activities were business acquisitions and capital expenditures. In 2006 and 2005, these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from divestiture activities. Business Acquisitions. In 2006, the company completed three acquisitions for a total of $2.3 billion. On January 17, the company acquired FC Business Systems, Inc., of Fairfax, Virginia. On June 8, the company acquired Anteon International Corporation (Anteon) of Fairfax, Virginia. As a condition of the Anteon acquisition, the company divested several of Anteon program management and engineering services contracts. The company received approximately $150 of after-tax proceeds from the sale of these contracts, resulting in a net purchase price of approximately $2.1 billion. On July 7, the company acquired Chamberlain Manufacturing Corporation Scranton, Pennsylvania, operation. In 2005, the company completed three acquisitions for a total of approximately $275. On April 1, the company acquired MAYA Viz Ltd. of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. On August 16, the company acquired Tadpole Computer, Inc., of Cupertino, California. On September 2, the company acquired Itronix Corporation of Spokane, Washington. In 2004, the company completed three acquisitions at a total cost of approximately $500. On July 9, the company acquired Spectrum Astro, Inc., of Gilbert, Arizona. On September 17, the company acquired TriPoint Global Communications Inc. of Newton, North Carolina. On November 1, the company acquired Engineering Technology Inc. of Orlando, Florida. The company financed these acquisitions using commercial paper and cash on hand. In January 2007, General Dynamics completed its acquisition of SNC Technologies Inc. for approximately $275. The company financed the transaction using cash on hand. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures were $334 in 2006, $262 in 2005 and $253 in 2004. The company expects capital expenditures of approximately $500 in 2007. The anticipated increase over 2006 relates to planned facility improvements at Gulfstream and in the Marine Systems group. The company had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2006. Sale of Assets. In 2006, the company sold its aggregates business for approximately $315 in cash, after taxes. In 2005, the company completed the sales of several small, non-core businesses. The company received approximately $300 in cash, net of tax payments, from these divestiture activities. In 2004, the company sold two small, non-core businesses. Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $539 in 2006, $520 in 2005 and $902 in 2004. The company typical financing activities are issuances and repayments of debt, payment of dividends and repurchases of common stock. Net cash from financing activities also includes proceeds received from stock option exercises. Debt Proceeds, Net. In 2006, the company repaid $500 of its fixed-rate debt on the scheduled maturity date. There were no material debt repayments in 2005. In 2004, the company repaid $500 of floating-rate notes on the scheduled maturity date. The company also made net repayments of commercial paper of $182 in 2004. The company had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The company has approximately $2 billion in bank credit facilities that have not been drawn upon. These facilities are used to provide backup liquidity to the commercial paper program. The company does not have any significant scheduled debt repayments until 2008. General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report 31 Table of Contents Dividends. The company board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of $0.23 per share in March 2006, the ninth consecutive annual increase. The board had previously increased the quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share in March 2005 and to $0.18 per share in March 2004. Share Repurchases. In 2006, the company repurchased 1.2 million shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market at an average price of $63 per share. In 2005, the company repurchased 6.7 million shares at an average price of $54 per share. The company did not repurchase any shares during 2004. In June 2006, the company board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to 10 million shares of the company outstanding common stock on the open market. As of December 31, 2006, management was authorized to repurchase approximately 9.7 million shares approximately 2 percent of the company total shares outstanding. ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2006, other than operating leases, the company had no material off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantees; retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities; derivative instruments indexed to the company stock and classified in shareholders equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; or variable interests in entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company or engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the company.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to long-term contracts and programs, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, workers compensation, warranty obligations, pre-owned aircraft inventory, and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application: Revenue Recognition Government Contracts. The company accounts for sales and earnings under long-term government contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under the percentage-of-completion method, the company recognizes contract revenue as the work progresses either as the products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered, as applicable. The company estimates profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes that profit over the remaining life of the contract based on either input (e.g., costs incurred) or output (e.g., units delivered) measures, as appropriate to the circumstances. The company follows the guidelines of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts, except that revisions of estimated profits on contracts are included in earnings under the reallocation method, in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes , rather than the cumulative catch-up method. Under the reallocation method, the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term, while under the cumulative catch-up method such impact would be recognized immediately. If a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract, the company recognizes the loss in the period it is identified. Anticipated losses cover all costs allocable to the contracts, including G&A expenses. The percentage-of-completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion, and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications. Contract estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years, including future labor productivity and availability, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials, the impact of delayed performance, the availability and timing of funding from the customer, and the timing of product deliveries. These estimates are based on the company best judgment. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of the company contracts. The company reviews its contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflects changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method. The company recognizes revenue arising from claims either as income or as an offset against a potential loss only when the amount of the claim can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. In evaluating these criteria, management considers the contractual/legal basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim. The company recognizes revenue from award or incentive fees when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee. Estimates of award or incentive fees are based on actual award experience and anticipated performance. Business Aircraft. The company accounts for contracts for business-jet aircraft in accordance with Statement of Position 81-1. These contracts usually provide for two major milestones: the manufacture of the green aircraft (i.e., before exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics) and its completion. The company records revenue at two points: when green aircraft are delivered to, and accepted by, the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft. The company does not recognize revenue at green delivery unless (1) a contract has been executed with the customer and (2) the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract, as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer. Pre-owned Aircraft Inventories. In connection with orders for new aircraft, the company routinely offers customers trade-in options. Under these options, if exercised, the company will accept trade-in aircraft at a predetermined price based on estimated fair value. It is the company policy to limit the Aerospace group investment in pre-owned aircraft inventory at any point in time to $200, unless specifically authorized. Once acquired in connection with a sale of new aircraft, the company records pre-owned aircraft at the lower of trade-in value or estimated net realizable value. The company treats any excess of the trade-in price above the net realizable value as a reduction of revenue upon the recording of the new aircraft sales transaction. General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report 33 Table of Contents The company also regularly assesses the carrying value of pre-owned aircraft in inventory and adjusts the carrying value to net realizable value when appropriate. The company determines net realizable value by using both internal and external aircraft valuation information. These valuations involve estimates and assumptions about many factors, including current market conditions, future market conditions, the age and condition of the aircraft and the availability of the aircraft in the market. These estimates are based on the company best judgment. Gross margins on sales of pre-owned aircraft can vary from quarter to quarter depending on the mix of aircraft sold and current market conditions. Commitments and Contingencies. The company is subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either out of the ordinary course of its business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment. The company records a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is probable and when the company exposure is reasonably estimable. The ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may change as further facts and circumstances become known. Deferred Contract Costs. Certain costs incurred in the performance of the company government contracts are recorded under GAAP but are not currently allocable to contracts. Such costs include a portion of the company estimated workers compensation, other insurance-related assessments, pension and other post-retirement benefits, and environmental expenses. These costs will become allocable to contracts when they are paid. As permitted by AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Audits of Federal Government Contractors, the company has elected to defer these costs in contracts in process until they are paid, at which time the costs are charged to contracts and recovered from the government. The company expects to recover these costs through ongoing business, including existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts. This business base includes numerous contracts for which the company is the sole source or one of two suppliers on long-term defense programs. The company regularly assesses the probability of recovery of these costs under its current and probable follow-on contracts. This assessment requires the company to make assumptions about future contract costs, the extent of cost recovery under the company contracts and the amount of future contract activity. These estimates are based on management best judgment. If the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of the company remaining contracts could be adversely affected. Retirement Plans. The company defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions and estimates. The key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected long-term rates of return on plan assets. The company determines the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on high-quality fixed-income investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period. The company determines the long-term rate of return on assets based on historical returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy. These estimates are based on the company best judgment, including consideration of current and future market conditions. In the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted, future pension and post-retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease. Changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for the company commercial pension plans and post-retirement benefit plans would have had the following impact on 2006: Increase 25 bps Decrease 25 bps Increase (decrease) to net pension income from: Change in discount rate $ 2 $ (4 ) Change in long-term rate of return on plan assets 3 (3 ) Increase (decrease) to post-retirement benefit cost from: Change in discount rate $ (1 ) $ 1 Change in long-term rate of return on plan assets (1 ) 1 The company contractual arrangements with the U.S. government provide for the recovery of contributions to the company government retirement plans. As permitted by AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Audits of Federal Government Contractors , the company has elected to defer recognition of the cumulative net unfunded benefit cost in its government plans to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses. As such, the company future earnings are not subject to the consequences of changes in the assumptions associated with these plans. Management believes that its judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented. New Accounting Standards In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by setting forth the required methodology for recognizing income tax contingencies in the financial statements. FIN 48 is effective in the first quarter of 2007. The company expects the adoption of FIN 48 to result in an immaterial reduction to its reserve for tax contingencies. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP. SFAS 157 also expands the required disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective in the first quarter of 2008. The company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 to have a material effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 34 General Dynamics 2006 Annual Report Table of Contents
