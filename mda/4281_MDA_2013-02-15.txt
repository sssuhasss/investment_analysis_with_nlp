Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (dollars in millions, except per-share amounts and ingot prices; production and shipments in thousands of metric tons [kmt]) Overview Our Business Alcoa is the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina combined, through its active and growing participation in all major aspects of the industry: technology, mining, refining, smelting, fabricating, and recycling. Aluminum is a commodity that is traded on the London Metal Exchange (LME) and priced daily. Aluminum and alumina represent more than 80% of Alcoa revenues, and the price of aluminum influences the operating results of Alcoa. Nonaluminum products include precision castings and aerospace and industrial fasteners. Alcoa products are used worldwide in aircraft, automobiles, commercial transportation, packaging, building and construction, oil and gas, defense, consumer electronics, and industrial applications. 51 Table of Contents Alcoa is a global company operating in 30 countries. Based upon the country where the point of sale occurred, the U.S. and Europe generated 52% and 25%, respectively, of Alcoa sales in 2012. In addition, Alcoa has investments and operating activities in, among others, Australia, Brazil, China, Guinea, Iceland, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, all of which present opportunities for substantial growth. Governmental policies, laws and regulations, and other economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, affect the results of operations in these countries. Management Review of 2012 and Outlook for the Future At the end of 2011, management had projected growth in global aluminum demand of 7% for 2012. In the first half of the year, demand was on course; however, a slowdown in growth in China in the second half resulted in an actual growth rate of 6%. Additionally, LME pricing levels declined on average 16% year-over-year, mainly due to macroeconomic events, including significant uncertainty of the sovereign debt of many European countries and the U.S. fiscal cliff. The Company also faced significant headwinds for certain costs, including maintenance supplies and services; labor, especially in emerging markets; transportation costs, mostly fuel oil; and higher pension costs. Consequently, the 2012 operating results of the Company upstream businesses declined compared with 2011. Partially offsetting this decrease was the Company midstream and downstream businesses achieving their highest profitability ever driven by net productivity improvements and higher volumes. Management continued its relentless focus on liquidity and cash flows generating incremental improvements in procurement efficiencies, overhead rationalization, working capital, and disciplined capital spending. These actions enabled Alcoa to decrease debt while maintaining a stable level of cash on hand. The following financial information reflects some key measures of Alcoa 2012 results: Sales of $23,700 and Income from continuing operations of $191, or $0.18 per diluted share; Total segment after-tax operating income of $1,369; Cash from operations of $1,497, reduced by pension contributions of $561; Capital expenditures of $1,261, under $1,500 for the third consecutive year; Cash on hand at the end of the year of $1,861, in excess of $1,400 for the fourth consecutive year; Decrease in total debt of $542, and a decline of $1,749 since 2008; and Debt-to-capital ratio of 34.8%, a decrease of 50 basis points from 2011 and within the targeted range of 30% to 35%. In 2013, management is projecting continued growth (increase of 7%) in the global consumption of primary aluminum, consistent with that of 2012. All regions, except North America, are expected to have one-to-three percentage point increases in aluminum demand over 2012 with China (11%) and India (9%) expected to have the highest growth rates in 2013. However, added production, along with few industry-wide capacity curtailments, will result in supply slightly exceeding demand for primary aluminum. For alumina, growth in global consumption is estimated to be 9%, and overall demand is expected to slightly exceed supply. Management also anticipates improved market conditions for aluminum products in all major global end markets, particularly aerospace, despite declines in certain regions. Relative to input costs, labor and maintenance expenses will continue to be a challenge; however, management has established and is committed to achieving the following specific goals in 2013: generating incremental savings over those realized in 2009 through 2012 from procurement, overhead, and working capital programs; generating positive cash flow from operations that will exceed capital spending; and maintaining a debt-to-capital ratio between 30% and 35%. Looking ahead over the next one to three years, management will continue to focus on its aggressive strategic targets established two years ago. These targets include lowering Alcoa refining and smelting operations on the cost curve to the 23rd (from 30th) and 41st (from 51st) percentiles, respectively, by 2015 and driving revenue growth in the 52 Table of Contents midstream (increase of $2,500) and downstream (increase of $1,600) operations by 2013. In conjunction with the revenue targets, management is committed to improving margins that will exceed historical levels in the midstream and downstream operations. Management has made significant progress on these targets as described below. In 2012, actions taken to improve Alcoa position on the cost curve for both refining and smelting operations included production curtailments of 390 kmt of the Atlantic refinery system; the creep of low-cost capacity at the refineries in Australia; full or partial curtailment of 240 kmt of smelting capacity in Europe and the permanent closure of 291 kmt of smelting capacity in the U.S.; the near full-startup of the Estreito hydroelectric power project in Brazil; and new energy contracts for two U.S. smelters. Additionally, the aluminum complex in Saudi Arabia continues to be on target as first production from the smelter occurred in December 2012 and the mine and refinery are expected to commence in 2014. At December 31, 2012, Alcoa refining operations were in the 30th percentile and smelting operations were in the 47th percentile, a four-percentage point improvement, on the respective cost curves. The midstream and downstream operations both achieved margins that exceeded historical levels for the second year in a row and are making progress against the respective revenue growth targets. The midstream operations will continue to build on this success in 2013 through expansion of the rolling facilities in Davenport, IA to meet rising U.S. automotive demand, due to changing emissions regulations, and volume growth in Russia and China, including emerging markets like consumer electronics. The downstream operations will extend their profitable growth in 2013 through continued innovative solutions to meet a wide-range of customer needs, as well as expansion of aluminum lithium capabilities in Lafayette, IN to meet the growing demand in the aerospace market and the opening of a forged wheels facility in Suzhou, China that will serve the commercial transportation market. Results of Operations Earnings Summary Income from continuing operations attributable to Alcoa for 2012 was $191, or $0.18 per diluted share, compared with $614, or $0.55 per share, in 2011. The decline of $423 in continuing operations was primarily due to the following: lower realized prices for aluminum and alumina, higher input costs, and charges for litigation and environmental remediation matters. These items were partially offset by net productivity improvements, a gain on the sale of U.S. hydroelectric power assets, a decline in the results attributable to noncontrolling interests, lower restructuring charges, net favorable foreign currency movements, lower income taxes due to a decline in operating results, a favorable LIFO (last in, first out) impact, and higher volumes in the midstream and downstream segments. Income from continuing operations attributable to Alcoa for 2011 was $614, or $0.55 per share, compared with $262, or $0.25 per share, in 2010. The improvement of $352 in continuing operations was primarily due to the following: higher realized prices for alumina and aluminum, stronger volumes in the midstream and downstream segments, net productivity improvements, and a net favorable change in mark-to-market derivative contracts. These items were partially offset by higher input costs, net unfavorable foreign currency movements, higher income taxes due to better operating results, and additional restructuring charges. Net income attributable to Alcoa for 2012 was $191, or $0.18 per share, compared with $611, or $0.55 per share, in 2011, and $254, or $0.24 per share, in 2010. In 2011, net income of $611 included a loss from discontinued operations of $3, and, in 2010, net income of $254 included a loss from discontinued operations of $8. In 2011, Alcoa restarted the following previously curtailed production capacity in the U.S.: Massena East, NY (125 kmt-per-year); Wenatchee, WA (43 kmt-per-year); and Ferndale, WA (Intalco: 47 kmt-per-year (11 kmt more than previously planned)). These restarts occurred to help meet anticipated growth in aluminum demand and to meet obligations outlined in power agreements with energy providers. As a result of these restarts, aluminum production increased by approximately 150 kmt during 2011 and by 215 kmt in 2012. 53 Table of Contents In late 2011, management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of the smelter located in Tennessee (215 kmt-per-year) and two potlines (capacity of 76 kmt-per-year) at the smelter located in Rockdale, TX (remaining capacity of 191 kmt-per-year composed of four potlines). This decision was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility. Factors leading to this decision were in general focused on achieving sustained competitiveness and included, among others: lack of an economically viable, long-term power solution; changed market fundamentals; cost competitiveness; required future capital investment; and restart costs. Also, at the end of 2011, management approved a partial or full curtailment of three European smelters as follows: Portovesme, Italy (150 kmt-per-year); Avil s, Spain (46 kmt out of 93 kmt-per-year); and La Coru a, Spain (44 kmt out of 87 kmt-per-year). These curtailments were completed by the end of 2012. The curtailment of the Portovesme smelter may lead to the permanent closure of the facility, while the curtailments at the two smelters in Spain are planned to be temporary. These actions were the result of uncompetitive energy positions, combined with rising material costs and falling aluminum prices (mid-2011 to late 2011). In December 2012, the Spanish Government issued a Ministerial Order that modified the interruptibility regime previously in place in the Spanish power market. The interruptibility regime allows certain industrial customers who are willing to be subject to temporary interruptions in the supply of power to sell interruption rights to the high voltage transmission system operator. In January 2013, Alcoa applied for and was granted rights to sell interruption services under the modified regime from its San Ciprian, Avil s, and La Coru a smelters in Spain. The commitment is taken for a one-year period. Alcoa understands that the Spanish Government intends to notify the European Commission of the modification in the interruptibility regime for review under European state aid rules. As a result of the modification to the interruptibility regime, Alcoa has commenced the restart of a portion (25 kmt combined for Avil and La Coru a) of the capacity previously curtailed in the first half of 2012 in order to meet the requirements of the modified interruptibility regime. Sales Sales for 2012 were $23,700 compared with sales of $24,951 in 2011, a decrease of $1,251, or 5%. The decline was mainly the result of a drop in realized prices for aluminum and alumina, driven by lower London Metal Exchange (LME) prices, unfavorable pricing in the midstream segment due to a decrease in metal prices, and unfavorable foreign currency movements, mostly due to a weaker euro, somewhat offset by higher volumes in the midstream and downstream segments and favorable product mix in the midstream segment. Sales for 2011 were $24,951 compared with sales of $21,013 in 2010, an improvement of $3,938, or 19%. The increase was primarily due to a rise in realized prices for alumina and aluminum, better pricing in the midstream segment, and higher volumes in the Primary Metals segment and virtually all businesses in the midstream and downstream segments. Cost of Goods Sold COGS as a percentage of Sales was 86.4% in 2012 compared with 82.1% in 2011. The percentage was negatively impacted by the previously mentioned lower realized prices in the upstream and midstream segments, higher input costs, a net charge for adjustments to certain environmental reserves ($194), and a charge for a civil litigation reserve ($85). These items were somewhat offset by net productivity improvements, net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar, and a change in LIFO adjustments from unfavorable to favorable, primarily due to lower prices for alumina and metal and lower costs for calcined coke. COGS as a percentage of Sales was 82.1% in 2011 compared with 81.7% in 2010. The percentage was negatively impacted by higher energy and raw materials costs and net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker U.S. dollar, mostly offset by the previously mentioned higher realized prices and net productivity improvements. Selling, General Administrative, and Other Expenses SG&A expenses were $997, or 4.2% of Sales, in 2012 compared with $1,027, or 4.1% of Sales, in 2011. The decline of $30 was mostly due to lower stock-based compensation expense, a decrease in bad debt expense (see below), a decline in travel expense, and less spending across various other expenses. These items were partially offset by higher pension costs, due to the recognition of higher net actuarial losses, and increased professional expenses, due to consulting fees associated with productivity initiatives and higher legal expenses. 54 Table of Contents SG&A expenses were $1,027, or 4.1% of Sales, in 2011 compared with $961, or 4.6% of Sales, in 2010. The increase of $66 was principally the result of higher labor costs and an increase in bad debt expense. The increase in labor costs was the result of a higher average employee base and a higher cost of employee benefits. The higher bad debt expense was caused by charges for anticipated customer credit losses, primarily related to those in Europe. Research and Development Expenses R&D expenses were $197 in 2012 compared with $184 in 2011 and $174 in 2010. The increase in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily caused by additional spending related to inert anode technology for the Primary Metals segment. The increase in 2011 as compared to 2010 was mainly driven by incremental increases across various expenses necessary to support R&D activities. Provision for Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization The provision for DD&A was $1,460 in 2012 compared with $1,479 in 2011. The decrease of $19, or 1%, was principally the result of the cessation of DD&A due to the decision at the end of 2011 to permanently shut down and demolish the smelter in Tennessee (see Restructuring and Other Charges below) and the absence of DD&A on various in-use assets that reached the end of their estimated useful life in 2011, partially offset by an increase related to assets placed into service associated with a new hydroelectric power facility in Brazil and higher DD&A due to the capitalization of new haul roads and the write-off of old haul roads no longer in use for mining sites in Australia. The provision for DD&A was $1,479 in 2011 compared with $1,450 in 2010. The increase of $29, or 2%, was mostly due to a portion of the assets placed into service in mid-2011 related to a new hydroelectric power facility in Brazil, along with a number of small increases at various locations. Restructuring and Other Charges Restructuring and other charges for each year in the three-year period ended December 31, 2012 were comprised of the following: 2012 2011 2010 Asset impairments $ 40 $ 150 $ 139 Layoff costs 47 93 43 Other exit costs 21 61 58 Reversals of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs (21 ) (23 ) (33 ) Restructuring and other charges $ 87 $ 281 $ 207 Layoff costs were recorded based on approved detailed action plans submitted by the operating locations that specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans, union contracts or statutory requirements, and the expected timetable for completion of the plans. 2012 Actions In 2012, Alcoa recorded Restructuring and other charges of $87 ($73 after-tax and noncontrolling interests), which were comprised of the following components: $47 ($29 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for the layoff of approximately 800 employees (390 in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, 250 in the Primary Metals segment, 85 in the Alumina segment, and 75 in Corporate), including $10 ($7 after-tax) for the layoff of an additional 170 employees related to the previously reported smelter curtailments in Spain (see 2011 Actions below); $30 ($30 after-tax) in asset impairments and $6 ($6 after-tax) for lease and contract termination costs due to a decision to exit the lithographic sheet business in Bohai, China; $11 ($11 after-tax) in costs to idle the Portovesme smelter (see 2011 Actions below); $10 ($8 after-tax) in other asset impairments; a net charge of $4 ($4 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for other miscellaneous items; and $21 ($15 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for the reversal of a number of layoff reserves related to prior periods, including $10 ($7 after-tax) related to the smelters in Spain. The reversal related to the smelters in Spain is due to lower than expected costs based on agreements with employee representatives and the government, as well as a reduction of 55 in the number of layoffs due to the anticipation of the restart of a portion of the previously curtailed capacity based on an agreement with the Spanish government that will provide interruptibility rights (i.e. compensation for power interruptions when grids are overloaded) to the smelters during 2013. A portion of this reversal relates to layoff costs recorded at the end of 2011 (see 2011 Actions below) and a portion of this reversal relates to layoff costs recorded during 2012 (see above). 55 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2012, approximately 270 of the 800 employees were separated. The remaining separations for the 2012 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2013. In 2012, cash payments of $16 were made against layoff reserves related to the 2012 restructuring programs. 2011 Actions In 2011, Alcoa recorded Restructuring and other charges of $281 ($181 after-tax and noncontrolling interests), which were comprised of the following components: $127 ($82 after-tax) in asset impairments and $36 ($23 after-tax) in other exit costs related to the permanent shutdown and planned demolition of certain idled structures at two U.S. locations (see below); $93 ($68 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for the layoff of approximately 1,600 employees (820 in the Primary Metals segment, 470 in the Global Rolled Products segment, 160 in the Alumina segment, 20 in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, and 130 in Corporate), including the effects of planned smelter curtailments (see below); $23 ($12 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for other asset impairments, including the write-off of the carrying value of an idled structure in Australia that processed spent pot lining and adjustments to the fair value of the one remaining foil location while it was classified as held for sale due to foreign currency movements; $20 ($8 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for a litigation matter related to the former St. Croix location; a net charge of $5 ($4 after-tax) for other small items; and $23 ($16 after-tax) for the reversal of previously recorded layoff reserves due to normal attrition and changes in facts and circumstances, including a change in plans for Alcoa aluminum powder facility in Rockdale, TX. In late 2011, management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of certain facilities at two U.S. locations, each of which was previously temporarily idled for various reasons. The identified facilities are the smelter located in Alcoa, TN (capacity of 215 kmt-per-year) and two potlines (capacity of 76 kmt-per-year) at the smelter located in Rockdale, TX (remaining capacity of 191 kmt-per-year composed of four potlines). Demolition and remediation activities related to these actions began in 2012 and are expected to be completed in 2015 for the Tennessee smelter and in 2013 for the two potlines at the Rockdale smelter. This decision was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility. Factors leading to this decision were in general focused on achieving sustained competitiveness and included, among others: lack of an economically viable, long-term power solution; changed market fundamentals; cost competitiveness; required future capital investment; and restart costs. The asset impairments of $127 represent the write off of the remaining book value of properties, plants, and equipment related to these facilities. Additionally, remaining inventories, mostly operating supplies, were written down to their net realizable value resulting in a charge of $6 ($4 after-tax), which was recorded in Cost of goods sold on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations. The other exit costs of $36 represent $18 ($11 after-tax) in environmental remediation and $17 ($11 after-tax) in asset retirement obligations, both triggered by the decision to permanently shut down and demolish these structures, and $1 ($1 after-tax) in other related costs. Also, at the end of 2011, management approved a partial or full curtailment of three European smelters as follows: Portovesme, Italy (150 kmt-per-year); Avil s, Spain (46 kmt out of 93 kmt-per-year); and La Coru a, Spain (44 kmt out of 87 kmt-per-year). These curtailments were completed by the end of 2012. The curtailment of the Portovesme smelter may lead to the permanent closure of the facility, which would result in future charges, while the curtailments at the two smelters in Spain are planned to be temporary. These actions were the result of uncompetitive energy positions, combined with rising material costs and falling aluminum prices (mid-2011 to late 2011). As a result of these decisions, Alcoa recorded costs of $33 ($31 after-tax) for the layoff of approximately 650 employees. As Alcoa engaged in discussions with the respective employee representatives and governments, additional charges were recognized in 2012 (see 2012 Actions above). As of December 31, 2012, approximately 895 of the 1,475 employees were separated. The total number of employees associated with the 2011 restructuring programs was updated to reflect changes in plans (agreement related to the smelters in Spain see 2012 Actions above), better than expected operating performance at certain locations, and natural attrition. The remaining separations for the 2011 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2013. In 2012 and 2011, cash payments of $23 and $24, respectively, were made against layoff reserves related to the 2011 restructuring programs. 2010 Actions In 2010, Alcoa recorded Restructuring and other charges of $207 ($130 after-tax and noncontrolling interests), which were comprised of the following components: $127 ($80 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) in 56 Table of Contents asset impairments and $46 ($29 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) in other exit costs related to the permanent shutdown and planned demolition of certain idled structures at five U.S. locations (see below); $43 ($29 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for the layoff of approximately 875 employees (625 in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment; 75 in the Primary Metals segment; 60 in the Alumina segment; 25 in the Global Rolled Products segment; and 90 in Corporate); $22 ($14 after-tax) in net charges (including $12 ($8 after-tax) for asset impairments) related to divested and to be divested businesses (Automotive Castings, Global Foil, Transportation Products Europe, and Packaging and Consumer) for, among other items, the settlement of a contract with a former customer, foreign currency movements, working capital adjustments, and a tax indemnification; $2 ($2 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for various other exit costs; and $33 ($24 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for the reversal of prior periods layoff reserves, including a portion of those related to the Portovesme smelter in Italy due to the execution of a new power agreement. In early 2010, management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of the following structures, each of which was previously temporarily idled for different reasons: the Eastalco smelter located in Frederick, MD (capacity of 195 kmt-per-year); the smelter located in Badin, NC (capacity of 60 kmt-per-year); an aluminum fluoride plant in Point Comfort, TX; a paste plant and cast house in Massena, NY; and one potline at the smelter in Warrick, IN (capacity of 40 kmt-per-year). This decision was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility. Factors leading to this decision included current market fundamentals, cost competitiveness, other existing idle capacity, required future capital investment, and restart costs, as well as the elimination of ongoing holding costs. The asset impairments of $127 represent the write off of the remaining book value of properties, plants, and equipment related to these facilities. Additionally, remaining inventories, mostly operating supplies, were written down to their net realizable value resulting in a charge of $8 ($5 after-tax and noncontrolling interests), which was recorded in Cost of goods sold on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations. The other exit costs of $46 represent $30 ($19 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) in asset retirement obligations and $14 ($9 after-tax) in environmental remediation, both triggered by the decision to permanently shut down and demolish these structures, and $2 ($1 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) in other related costs. As of December 31, 2012, the separations associated with 2010 restructuring programs were essentially complete. In 2012 and 2011, cash payments of $3 and $7, respectively, were made against layoff reserves related to 2010 restructuring programs. Alcoa does not include Restructuring and other charges in the results of its reportable segments. The pretax impact of allocating such charges to segment results would have been as follows: 2012 2011 2010 Alumina $ 3 $ 39 $ 12 Primary Metals 20 212 145 Global Rolled Products 43 19 (11 ) Engineered Products and Solutions 13 (3 ) 18 Segment total 79 267 164 Corporate 8 14 43 Total restructuring and other charges $ 87 $ 281 $ 207 Interest Expense Interest expense was $490 in 2012 compared with $524 in 2011. The decline of $34, or 6%, was principally caused by the absence of a $41 net charge related to the early retirement of various outstanding notes (see below), somewhat offset by lower capitalized interest ($8). The decrease in capitalized interest was largely attributable to the Estreito hydroelectric power project in Brazil as construction nears completion, partially offset by an increase related to the aluminum complex in Saudi Arabia. Interest expense was $524 in 2011 compared with $494 in 2010. The increase of $30, or 6%, was primarily due to a $41 net charge related to the early retirement of various outstanding notes ($74 in purchase premiums paid partially offset by a $33 gain for in-the-money interest rate swaps), somewhat offset by the absence of a $14 net charge related to the early retirement of various outstanding notes ($42 in purchase premiums paid partially offset by a $28 gain for in-the-money interest rate swaps). 57 Table of Contents Other (Income) Expenses, net Other income, net was $341 in 2012 compared with $87 in 2011. The increase of $254 was mostly due to a gain on the sale of U.S. hydroelectric power assets ($320: see Primary Metals in Segment Information below) and net favorable foreign currency movements ($21). These two items were somewhat offset by lower equity income ($43), largely attributable to Alcoa share of expenses of the joint venture in Saudi Arabia and the absence of a discrete income tax benefit recognized by the consortium related to an investment in a natural gas pipeline in Australia (see below); the absence of a gain on the sale of land (see below); and a net unfavorable change in mark-to-market derivative contracts ($39), principally driven by the absence of a favorable change in an energy contract that expired in September 2011. Other income, net was $87 in 2011 compared with Other expenses, net of $5 in 2010. The change of $92 was mainly the result of a net favorable change of $89 in mark-to-market derivative contracts, a gain of $43 from the sale of land in Australia, and higher equity income from an investment in a natural gas pipeline in Australia due to the recognition of a discrete income tax benefit by the consortium (Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals share of the benefit was $24), slightly offset by a decrease in the cash surrender value of company-owned life insurance. Income Taxes Alcoa effective tax rate was 50.0% in 2012 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate principally due to the tax impact from the gain recognized on the sale of U.S. hydroelectric power assets (see Primary Metals in Segment Information below) and an $8 discrete income tax charge related to prior year U.S. taxes on certain depletable assets, slightly offset by a $13 discrete income tax benefit related to a change in the legal structure of an investment. Alcoa effective tax rate was 24.0% in 2011 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate mainly due to foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions. Alcoa effective tax rate was 26.9% in 2010 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions, a $57 discrete income tax benefit for the reversal of a valuation allowance as a result of previously restricted net operating losses of a foreign subsidiary now available, a $24 discrete income tax benefit related to a Canadian provincial tax law change permitting a tax return to be filed in U.S. dollars, and a $13 net discrete income tax benefit for various other items, partially offset by a $79 discrete income tax charge as a result of a change in the tax treatment of federal subsidies received related to prescription drug benefits provided under certain retiree health care benefit plans that were determined to be actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D and a $19 discrete income tax charge based on settlement discussions of several matters with international taxing authorities (this amount represents a decrease to Alcoa unrecognized tax benefits). Management anticipates that the effective tax rate in 2013 will be approximately 30%. However, changes in the current economic environment, tax legislation or rate changes, currency fluctuations, ability to realize deferred tax assets, and the results of operations in certain taxing jurisdictions may cause this estimated rate to fluctuate. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law and extended through 2013 various expired or expiring temporary business tax provisions. Two specific temporary business tax provisions that expired in 2011 and impacted Alcoa are the look-through rule for payments between related controlled foreign corporations and the research and experimentation credit. The expiration of these two provisions resulted in Alcoa recognizing a higher income tax provision of $18 in 2012. As tax law changes are accounted for in the period of enactment, Alcoa will recognize an $18 discrete income tax benefit in 2013 related to the 2012 tax year to reflect the extension of these provisions. In December 2011, one of the Company subsidiaries in Brazil applied for a tax holiday related to its expanded mining and refining operations. If approved, the tax rate for this subsidiary will decrease significantly, resulting in future cash tax savings over the 10-year holiday period (would be effective as of January 1, 2013). Additionally, the net deferred tax asset of the subsidiary would be remeasured at the lower rate in the period the holiday is approved. This remeasurement would result in a decrease to the net deferred tax asset and a noncash charge to earnings of approximately $60 to $120. As of December 31, 2012, Alcoa subsidiary application is still pending. 58 Table of Contents Noncontrolling Interests Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $29 in 2012 compared with Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $194 in 2011. The change of $223 was mostly due to lower earnings at Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC), which is owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Alumina Limited. The decline in earnings at AWAC were attributed primarily to lower realized prices, due to a decrease in contractual LME-based pricing, higher input costs, particularly caustic and fuel oil, and a charge for a litigation reserve of $34. These items were somewhat offset by net productivity improvements and net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $194 in 2011 compared with $138 in 2010. The increase of $56 was largely the result of higher earnings at AWAC. The improved earnings at AWAC were mainly driven by higher realized prices, partially offset by higher input costs and net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker U.S. dollar. Loss From Discontinued Operations Loss from discontinued operations in 2011 was $3 comprised of an additional loss of $3 ($5 pretax) related to the wire harness and electrical portion (divested in June 2009) of the Electrical and Electronic Solutions (EES) business as a result of a negotiated preliminary settlement related to claims filed in 2010 against Alcoa by Platinum Equity in an insolvency proceeding in Germany, a net gain of $2 ($3 pretax) related to both the wire harness and electrical portion and the electronics portion (divested in December 2009) of the EES business for a number of small post-closing and other adjustments, and a $2 ($2 pretax) reversal of the gain recognized in 2006 related to the sale of the home exteriors business for an adjustment to an outstanding obligation, which was part of the terms of sale. Loss from discontinued operations in 2010 was $8 comprised of an additional loss of $6 ($9 pretax) related to the wire harness and electrical portion of the EES business as a result of a contract settlement with a former customer of this business and an additional loss of $2 ($4 pretax) related to the electronics portion of the EES business for the settling of working capital, which was not included in the divestiture transaction. Segment Information Alcoa operations consist of four worldwide reportable segments: Alumina, Primary Metals, Global Rolled Products, and Engineered Products and Solutions. Segment performance under Alcoa management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors; however, the primary measure of performance is the after-tax operating income (ATOI) of each segment. Certain items such as the impact of LIFO inventory accounting; interest expense; noncontrolling interests; corporate expense (general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities, along with depreciation and amortization on corporate-owned assets); restructuring and other charges; discontinued operations; and other items, including intersegment profit eliminations and other metal adjustments, differences between tax rates applicable to the segments and the consolidated effective tax rate, the results of the soft alloy extrusions business in Brazil, and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency transaction gains/losses and interest income are excluded from segment ATOI. ATOI for all reportable segments totaled $1,369 in 2012, $1,893 in 2011, and $1,424 in 2010. See Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. The following discussion provides shipments, sales, and ATOI data for each reportable segment and production data for the Alumina and Primary Metals segments for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012. Alumina 2012 2011 2010 Alumina production (kmt) 16,342 16,486 15,922 Third-party alumina shipments (kmt) 9,295 9,218 9,246 Third-party sales $ 3,092 $ 3,462 $ 2,815 Intersegment sales 2,310 2,727 2,212 Total sales $ 5,402 $ 6,189 $ 5,027 ATOI $ 90 $ 607 $ 301 59 Table of Contents This segment represents a portion of Alcoa upstream operations and consists of the Company worldwide refinery system, including the mining of bauxite, which is then refined into alumina. Alumina is mainly sold directly to internal and external smelter customers worldwide or is sold to customers who process it into industrial chemical products. A portion of this segment third-party sales are completed through the use of agents, alumina traders, and distributors. Slightly more than half of Alcoa alumina production is sold under supply contracts to third parties worldwide, while the remainder is used internally by the Primary Metals segment. In 2012, alumina production decreased by 144 kmt compared to 2011. The decline was mainly driven by lower production in the Atlantic refinery system as a result of management plan to reduce annual production capacity by approximately 390 kmt. This decision was made to align production with smelter curtailments initiated at the beginning of 2012 and to reflect prevailing market conditions. The decrease at these three refineries was partially offset by higher production at the Pinjarra and Kwinana refineries in Australia, due to system process improvements. In 2011, alumina production increased by 564 kmt compared to 2010. The improvement was mostly the result of higher production at the S o Lu (Brazil) refinery, as the ramp-up of the 2,100 kmt expanded capacity (the Alumina segment share is approximately 1,100 kmt-per-year) that began in late 2009 continued through 2011. Third-party sales for the Alumina segment dropped 11% in 2012 compared with 2011, primarily related to a 15% decline in realized prices, driven by a decrease in contractual LME-based pricing, slightly offset by realized benefits from moving customer contracts to alumina index pricing and from improved spot pricing. Third-party sales for this segment improved 23% in 2011 compared with 2010, largely attributable to a 21% increase in realized prices, driven by the movement of customer contracts to alumina index pricing, benefits from improved spot prices, and improved pricing from LME-based contracts. Intersegment sales for the Alumina segment decreased 15% in 2012 compared with 2011, principally due to lower realized prices and decreased demand from the Primary Metals segment. Intersegment sales for this segment climbed 23% in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily the result of higher realized prices and an increase in demand from the Primary Metals segment. ATOI for the Alumina segment dropped $517 in 2012 compared with 2011, mostly due to the previously mentioned lower realized prices, higher input costs, particularly caustic and fuel oil, and the absence of a gain on the sale of land in Australia ($30), somewhat offset by net productivity improvements and net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar, especially against the Brazilian real. ATOI for this segment increased $306 in 2011 compared with 2010, mainly caused by the significant improvement in realized prices and a gain on the sale of land in Australia ($30), partially offset by considerably higher input costs, particularly related to caustic and fuel oil, and net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker U.S. dollar, especially against the Australian dollar. In 2013, the continued shift towards alumina index or spot pricing is expected to average 48% of third-party sales, while those still contractually linked to the LME will follow a 30-day lag. Additionally, net productivity improvements are expected to continue. Primary Metals 2012 2011 2010 Aluminum production (kmt) 3,742 3,775 3,586 Third-party aluminum shipments (kmt) 3,056 2,981 2,845 Alcoa average realized price per metric ton of aluminum $ 2,327 $ 2,636 $ 2,356 Third-party sales $ 7,432 $ 8,240 $ 7,070 Intersegment sales 2,877 3,192 2,597 Total sales $ 10,309 $ 11,432 $ 9,667 ATOI $ 309 $ 481 $ 488 60 Table of Contents This segment represents a portion of Alcoa upstream operations and consists of the Company worldwide smelter system. Primary Metals receives alumina, mostly from the Alumina segment, and produces primary aluminum used by Alcoa fabricating businesses, as well as sold to external customers, aluminum traders, and commodity markets. Results from the sale of aluminum powder, scrap, and excess power are also included in this segment, as well as the results of aluminum derivative contracts and buy/resell activity. Primary aluminum produced by Alcoa and used internally is transferred to other segments at prevailing market prices. The sale of primary aluminum represents more than 90% of this segment third-party sales. Buy/resell activity refers to when this segment purchases metal from external or internal sources and resells such metal to external customers or the midstream and downstream segments in order to maximize smelting system efficiency and to meet customer requirements. In November 2012, Alcoa completed the sale of its 351-megawatt Tapoco Hydroelectric Project ( Tapoco ) to Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners for $597 in cash. Alcoa recognized a gain of $320 ($173 after-tax) in Other income, net on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations, of which a gain of $426 ($275 after-tax) was reflected in the Primary Metals segment and a loss of $106 ($102 after-tax) was reflected in Corporate. The amount in Corporate represents the write-off of goodwill and capitalized interest related to Tapoco that were not included in the assets of the Primary Metals segment. Tapoco is a four-station hydroelectric project located on the Little Tennessee and Cheoah Rivers in eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina. The transaction included four generating stations and dams, 86 miles of transmission lines, and approximately 14,500 acres of land associated with and surrounding Tapoco. The power generated by Tapoco was primarily consumed by Alcoa smelter in Tennessee, which was temporarily idled in 2009 and permanently shut down in 2011. Since 2009, the power generated from Tapoco was sold into the open market. At December 31, 2012, Alcoa had 591 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 4,227 kmt. In 2012, idle capacity decreased 53 kmt compared to 2011 due to the permanent shutdown of the smelter in Tennessee (215 kmt-per-year) and two potlines at the smelter located in Rockdale, TX (76 kmt-per-year), mostly offset by the curtailment of the Portovesme smelter in Italy (150 kmt-per-year) and the temporarily curtailment of a portion of the smelters in Spain: Avil (46 kmt out of 93 kmt-per-year) and La Coru a (44 kmt out of 87 kmt-per-year). Additionally, base capacity declined 291 kmt between December 31, 2012 and 2011 due to the previously mentioned permanent shutdowns. In late 2011, management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of the Tennessee smelter and two potlines at the Rockdale smelter (remaining capacity of 191 kmt-per-year composed of four potlines), each of which was previously temporarily idled for various reasons. This decision was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility. Factors leading to this decision were in general focused on achieving sustained competitiveness and included, among others: lack of an economically viable, long-term power solution; changed market fundamentals; cost competitiveness; required future capital investment; and restart costs. Also, at the end of 2011, management approved a full curtailment of the Portovesme smelter and a partial curtailment at the Avil and La Coru a smelters. The curtailment of the Portovesme smelter may lead to the permanent closure of the facility, while the curtailments at the two smelters in Spain are planned to be temporary. These actions were the result of uncompetitive energy positions, combined with rising material costs and falling aluminum prices (mid-2011 to late 2011). At December 31, 2011, Alcoa had 644 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 4,518 kmt. In 2011, idle capacity decreased 234 kmt compared to 2010 due to the full restart of previously curtailed production capacity in the U.S.: Massena East, NY (125 kmt-per-year); Wenatchee, WA (43 kmt-per-year); and Ferndale, WA (Intalco: 47 kmt-per-year (11 kmt more than previously planned)). These restarts occurred to help meet anticipated growth in aluminum demand and to meet obligations outlined in power agreements with energy providers. As a result of these restarts, aluminum production increased by approximately 150 kmt during 2011 and by 215 kmt in 2012. In 2012, aluminum production decreased by 33 kmt, mostly due to the previously mentioned curtailments at the Portovesme, Avil s, and La Coru a smelters, partially offset by the benefit of a full year of production related to the capacity restarted in 2011 at the Massena East, Wenatchee, and Ferndale smelters. In 2011, aluminum production 61 Table of Contents improved by 189 kmt, mainly the result of the previously mentioned restarted capacity at Massena East, Ferndale, and Wenatchee, as well as higher production at the Avil smelter, where production had been previously halted due to torrential flooding in 2010. Third-party sales for the Primary Metals segment dropped 10% in 2012 compared with 2011, mainly due to a 12% decline in average realized prices, driven by 16% lower average LME prices, slightly offset by higher buy/resell activity. The U.S. capacity restarted in 2011 contributed positively to third-party sales in 2012, but was completely offset by the curtailments of European capacity in 2012. Third-party sales for this segment improved 17% in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily due to a 12% rise in average realized prices, driven by 10% higher average LME prices, higher volumes, largely attributable to the previously mentioned restarted U.S. capacity, and increased revenue from the sale of excess power. Intersegment sales for the Primary Metals segment decreased 10% in 2012 compared with 2011, principally due to a decline in realized prices, driven by a lower LME. Intersegment sales for this segment rose 23% in 2011 compared with 2010, mainly the result of an improvement in realized prices, driven by the higher LME, and an increase in buy/resell activity. ATOI for the Primary Metals segment dropped $172 in 2012 compared with 2011, principally related to the previously mentioned decrease in realized prices; higher costs, particularly labor and other raw materials; and an unfavorable impact as a result of business interruption and repair costs related to a fire in March 2012 at the Massena West, NY cast house ($21); partially offset by a gain on the sale of Tapoco (see above); lower costs for alumina and energy; net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar, particularly against the euro and Brazilian real; and net productivity improvements. ATOI for this segment declined $7 in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily caused by significantly higher input costs, including carbon, alumina, and energy, and net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker U.S. dollar, virtually offset by improved realized prices, net productivity improvements, and higher excess power sales. In 2013, pricing is anticipated to follow a 15-day lag on the LME and net productivity improvements are expected to continue. Also, Alcoa share of start-up costs for the smelter in Saudi Arabia will negatively impact results. Additionally, planned maintenance for power plants during the first half of the year and higher energy costs are expected. Furthermore, in January 2013, Alcoa applied for and was granted rights to sell power interruption services from its San Ciprian, Avil s, and La Coru a smelters in Spain for a one-year period. As a result, Alcoa has commenced the restart of a portion (25 kmt combined for Avil and La Coru a) of the capacity previously curtailed in the first half of 2012 in order to meet the requirements of the interruption services (see the Earnings Summary section above for additional information). Global Rolled Products 2012 2011 2010 Third-party aluminum shipments (kmt) 1,867 1,780 1,658 Third-party sales $ 7,378 $ 7,642 $ 6,277 Intersegment sales 163 218 180 Total sales $ 7,541 $ 7,860 $ 6,457 ATOI $ 358 $ 266 $ 220 This segment represents Alcoa midstream operations, whose principal business is the production and sale of aluminum plate and sheet. A small portion of this segment operations relate to foil produced at one plant in Brazil. This segment includes rigid container sheet (RCS), which is sold directly to customers in the packaging and consumer market and is used to produce aluminum beverage cans. Seasonal increases in RCS sales are generally experienced in the second and third quarters of the year. This segment also includes sheet and plate used in the aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation, and building and construction markets (mainly used in the production of machinery and 62 Table of Contents equipment and consumer durables), which is sold directly to customers and through distributors. Approximately one-half of the third-party sales in this segment consist of RCS, while the other one-half of third-party sales are derived from sheet and plate and foil used in industrial markets. While the customer base for flat-rolled products is large, a significant amount of sales of RCS, sheet, and plate is to a relatively small number of customers. Third-party sales for the Global Rolled Products segment decreased 3% in 2012 compared with 2011, principally caused by unfavorable pricing, due to a decrease in metal prices, and unfavorable foreign currency movements, mostly due to a weaker euro, somewhat offset by higher volumes and favorable product mix. The higher volumes were largely attributable to the packaging, automotive, building and construction, and aerospace end markets, slightly offset by the industrial products end market. Third-party sales for this segment climbed 22% in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily driven by better pricing; higher volumes across most businesses, particularly related to the packaging, aerospace, and commercial transportation end markets; favorable foreign currency movements, mainly due to a stronger euro; and favorable product mix. ATOI for the Global Rolled Products segment improved $92 in 2012 compared with 2011, mainly the result of net productivity improvements across all businesses, favorable product mix, and the previously mentioned higher volumes, somewhat offset by higher input costs, particularly labor and transportation. ATOI for this segment rose $46 in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily attributable to the previously mentioned positive pricing, volume, and product mix impacts, partially offset by higher input costs and charges for anticipated customer credit losses. In 2013, demand in the aerospace and automotive markets is expected to remain strong. European and North American industrial markets are uncertain; beverage can packaging markets are expected to remain mixed (by region). Continued net productivity improvements are anticipated. Engineered Products and Solutions 2012 2011 2010 Third-party aluminum shipments (kmt) 222 221 197 Third-party sales $ 5,525 $ 5,345 $ 4,584 ATOI $ 612 $ 539 $ 415 This segment represents Alcoa downstream operations and includes titanium, aluminum, and super alloy investment castings; forgings and fasteners; aluminum wheels; integrated aluminum structural systems; and architectural extrusions used in the aerospace, automotive, building and construction, commercial transportation, and power generation markets. These products are sold directly to customers and through distributors. Additionally, hard alloy extrusions products, which are also sold directly to customers and through distributors, serve the aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation, and industrial products markets. On March 9, 2011, Alcoa completed an acquisition of the aerospace fastener business of TransDigm Group Inc. for $240. This business is a leading global designer, producer, and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components, with three locations (one in the state of California and two in the United Kingdom) that employ a combined 400 people (at time of acquisition). Specifically, this business provides a wide variety of high-strength, high temperature nickel alloy specialty engine fasteners, airframe bolts, and slotted entry bearings. In 2010, this business generated sales of $61. The assets and liabilities of this business were included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment as of March 31, 2011; this business results of operations were included in this segment beginning March 9, 2011. In July 2010, Alcoa completed an acquisition of the commercial building and construction business of a privately-held company, Traco, for $77. This business, located in Cranberry, Pennsylvania, employing 650 people (at time of acquisition), is a premier manufacturer of windows and doors for the commercial building and construction market and generated sales of approximately $100 in 2009. The assets and liabilities of this business were included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment as of the end of July 2010 and this business results of operations were included in this segment since the beginning of August 2010. 63 Table of Contents Third-party sales for the Engineered Products and Solutions segment increased 3% in 2012 compared with 2011, primarily due to higher volumes, slightly offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker euro. The higher volumes were mostly related to the aerospace, industrial gas turbine, and commercial transportation end markets, slightly offset by lower volumes from the building and construction end market. Third-party sales for this segment climbed 17% in 2011 compared with 2010, largely attributable to higher volumes across all businesses, especially related to the aerospace and commercial transportation end markets. Additionally, sales from the acquired fastener business ($58) and from the acquired building and construction business (increase of $40) and favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger euro were positive impacts. Slightly offsetting the positive contributions was the absence of sales related to the April 2010 divestiture of the Transportation Products Europe business ($28). ATOI for the Engineered Products and Solutions segment climbed $73 in 2012 compared with 2011, mainly due to net productivity improvements in four of the five businesses and the previously mentioned higher volumes. ATOI for this segment rose $124 in 2011 compared with 2010, principally the result of the previously mentioned volume impacts and net productivity improvements across most businesses, somewhat offset by unfavorable price/product mix. In 2013, the aerospace end market is expected to remain strong, while the commercial transportation and building and construction end markets are expected to weaken. Also, continued net productivity improvements are anticipated. Reconciliation of ATOI to Consolidated Net Income Attributable to Alcoa Items required to reconcile total segment ATOI to consolidated net income attributable to Alcoa include: the impact of LIFO inventory accounting; interest expense; noncontrolling interests; corporate expense (general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities, along with depreciation and amortization on corporate-owned assets); restructuring and other charges; discontinued operations; and other items, including intersegment profit eliminations and other metal adjustments, differences between tax rates applicable to the segments and the consolidated effective tax rate, the results of the soft alloy extrusions business in Brazil, and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency transaction gains/losses and interest income. The following table reconciles total segment ATOI to consolidated net income attributable to Alcoa: 2012 2011 2010 Total segment ATOI $ 1,369 $ 1,893 $ 1,424 Unallocated amounts (net of tax): Impact of LIFO 20 (38 ) (16 ) Interest expense (319 ) (340 ) (321 ) Noncontrolling interests 29 (194 ) (138 ) Corporate expense (282 ) (290 ) (291 ) Restructuring and other charges (75 ) (196 ) (134 ) Discontinued operations - (3 ) (8 ) Other (551 ) (221 ) (262 ) Consolidated net income attributable to Alcoa $ 191 $ 611 $ 254 The significant changes in the reconciling items between total segment ATOI and consolidated net income attributable to Alcoa for 2012 compared with 2011 consisted of: a change in the Impact of LIFO, due to lower prices for alumina and metal, both of which were driven by a decline in LME prices, and lower costs for calcined coke; a decrease in Interest expense, primarily due to the absence of a $27 net charge related to the early retirement of various outstanding notes (see below), somewhat offset by lower capitalized interest ($6); a change in Noncontrolling interests, mainly the result of lower earnings at AWAC, principally driven by lower realized prices, due to a decrease in contractual LME-based pricing, higher input costs, particularly 64 Table of Contents caustic and fuel oil, and a charge for a litigation reserve ($34), somewhat offset by net productivity improvements and net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar; a decrease in Restructuring and other charges, principally caused by fewer asset impairments and a lower number of employee separations; and a change in Other, largely attributable to a net charge for adjustments to certain environmental reserves ($129), a charge for the write-off of goodwill and capitalized interest related to the sale of Tapoco that were not included in the assets of the Primary Metals segment ($102), a charge for a litigation reserve ($67), and a net unfavorable change in mark-to-market derivative contracts ($24). The significant changes in the reconciling items between total segment ATOI and consolidated net income attributable to Alcoa for 2011 compared with 2010 consisted of: a change in the Impact of LIFO, due to higher prices for alumina and metal, both of which were driven by an increase in LME prices and higher input costs, particularly coke, energy, and caustic soda; an increase in Interest expense, principally caused by a $27 net charge related to the early retirement of various outstanding notes ($48 in purchase premiums paid partially offset by a $21 gain for in-the-money interest rate swaps), somewhat offset by the absence of a $9 net charge related to the early retirement of various outstanding notes ($27 in purchase premiums paid partially offset by an $18 gain for in-the-money interest rate swaps); an increase in Noncontrolling interests, mainly due to higher earnings at AWAC, principally driven by higher realized prices, partially offset by higher input costs and net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker U.S. dollar; an increase in Restructuring and other charges, mostly due to higher layoff costs, largely attributable to Alcoa plans to curtail three smelters in Europe; and a change in Other, primarily due to a net favorable change of $57 in mark-to-market derivative contracts and the difference between the consolidated effective tax rate and the estimated tax rates applicable to the segments, partially offset by a decrease in the cash surrender value of company-owned life insurance. Environmental Matters See the Environmental Matters section of Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Liquidity and Capital Resources Alcoa maintains a disciplined approach to cash management and strengthening of its balance sheet. In 2012, as in the prior three years, management initiated actions to significantly improve Alcoa cost structure and liquidity, providing the Company with the ability to operate effectively as the global economy continues to recover from the economic downturn that began in 2008. Such actions include procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs, working capital initiatives to yield significant cash improvements, and maintaining a sustainable level of capital expenditures. In 2013, this approach will continue with the ultimate goal of generating cash from operations that exceeds capital expenditures. Along with the foregoing actions, cash provided from operations and financing activities is expected to be adequate to cover Alcoa current operational and business needs. For an analysis of long-term liquidity, see Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. At December 31, 2012, cash and cash equivalents of Alcoa was $1,861, of which $659 was held outside the U.S. Alcoa has a number of commitments and obligations related to the Company growth strategy in foreign jurisdictions, resulting in the need for cash outside the U.S. As such, management does not have a current expectation of repatriating cash held in foreign jurisdictions. 65 Table of Contents Cash from Operations Cash from operations in 2012 was $1,497 compared with $2,193 in 2011. The decrease of $696, or 32%, was primarily due to lower operating results, higher pension contributions of $225, and a lower net cash inflow associated with working capital of $36, somewhat offset by a higher cash inflow of $425 in noncurrent liabilities and a positive change of $163 in noncurrent assets. The higher pension contributions were principally driven by the fact that in 2012 all contributions to the U.S. pension plans were made in cash, whereas, in 2011, a $600 noncash contribution to the U.S. pension plans was made in the form of Company common stock. The major components of the lower net cash inflow in working capital were as follows: a favorable change of $219 in receivables, primarily related to fewer uncollected receivables related to sales programs and lower customer sales; a positive change of $435 in inventories, mostly due to lower levels of on-hand alumina and aluminum products and a decrease in the LME price of aluminum; a negative change of $74 in prepaid expenses and other current assets, largely attributable to the absence of a reduction in collateral posted related to mark-to-market derivative contracts and an increase in both excess carbon emission credits and prepayments for natural gas in Australia, somewhat offset by an income tax refund received for the carryback of a loss from a prior year in Canada; an unfavorable change of $406 in accounts payable, trade, principally the result of timing of payments and receipt of vendor invoices; a higher outflow of $45 in accrued expenses, largely attributable to a payment made to the Italian Government (see below), a decrease in deferred revenue, the absence of a charge related to the former St. Croix location, somewhat offset by an increase in the litigation reserve ($42.5 see below); and a negative change of $165 in taxes, including income taxes, mainly due to less income taxes caused by lower operating results. The higher cash inflow in noncurrent liabilities was primarily caused by an increase in certain environmental reserves of $194, higher accrual for pension plans, and an increase in deferred revenue related to a contract to deliver sheet and plate to a customer beginning in 2014. In June 2012, Alcoa received formal notification from the Italian Government requesting a net payment of $310 ( 250) related to a November 2009 European Commission decision on electricity pricing for smelters. Alcoa has been in discussions with the Italian Government regarding the timing of such payment. Alcoa commenced payment of the requested amount in five quarterly installments of $66 ( 50) paying the first installment on October 31, 2012. It is possible that Alcoa may be required to accelerate payment or pay in a lump sum. On July 6, 2012, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21 st Century Act (MAP-21) was signed into law by the United States government. MAP-21, in part, provides temporary relief for employers who sponsor defined benefit pension plans related to funding contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Specifically, MAP-21 allows for the use of a 25-year average interest rate within an upper and lower range for purposes of determining minimum funding obligations instead of an average interest rate for the two most recent years. This relief had an immediate impact on the calculation of the then remaining funding contributions in 2012, resulting in a reduction of $130 in minimum required pension funding. Management expects to reduce its estimated minimum required pension funding by $225 to $250 in 2013. On October 9, 2012, Alcoa World Alumina LLC, a majority-owned subsidiary of Alcoa, paid $42.5 to the plaintiff of a civil litigation matter pursuant to a settlement agreement. Another $42.5 is scheduled to be paid on October 9, 2013. Cash from operations in 2011 was $2,193 compared with $2,261 in 2010. The decline of $68, or 3%, was largely attributable to higher pension contributions of $223, a lower net cash inflow associated with working capital of $206, an additional cash outflow of $71 in noncurrent assets, and a lower cash inflow of $36 in noncurrent liabilities, mostly offset by better operating results. The higher pension contributions were principally driven by cash contributions made to U.S. pension plans towards maintaining an approximately 80% funded status. 66 Table of Contents The major components of the lower net cash inflow in working capital were as follows: an additional outflow of $122 in inventories, mostly due to higher production as a result of increased demand and rising input costs; a higher inflow of $47 in prepaid expenses and other current assets, primarily driven by the absence of collateral posted related to a mark-to-market energy contract that ended in September 2011; an additional inflow of $66 in accounts payable, trade, principally the result of higher purchasing needs and timing of vendor payments; a lower outflow of $201 in accrued expenses, mostly related to fewer cash payments for restructuring programs and the absence of a reduction in collateral held related to mark-to-market energy contracts; and a smaller inflow of $385 in taxes, including income taxes, mainly due to the absence of a $347 federal income tax refund for the carryback of Alcoa 2009 net loss to prior tax years. Financing Activities Cash used for financing activities was $798 in 2012 compared with cash provided from financing activities of $62 in 2011 and cash used for financing activities of $952 in 2010. The use of cash in 2012 was principally the result of $1,489 in payments on debt, mainly related to $600 for the repayment of borrowings under four new short-term facilities (see below), $322 for the repayment of 6% Notes due 2012 as scheduled, $280 for the repayment of the new short-term loans to support the export operations of a subsidiary in Brazil, and $272 for previous borrowings on the loans supporting the S o Lu refinery expansion, Juruti bauxite mine development, and Estreito hydroelectric power project in Brazil; a change of $224 in commercial paper; and $131 in dividends paid to shareholders. These items were partially offset by $972 in additions to debt, due to $600 in borrowings under four new short-term facilities (see below), $280 in new short-term loans to support the export operations of a subsidiary in Brazil, and $92 in borrowings under loans that support the Estreito hydroelectric power project in Brazil; and net cash received from noncontrolling interests of $76, all of which relates to Alumina Limited share of AWAC. The source of cash in 2011 was mostly driven by $1,256 in additions to long-term debt, of which $1,248 was for the issuance of 5.40% Notes due 2021, and a change of $224 in commercial paper. These items were mostly offset by $1,194 in payments on long-term debt, principally related to $881 for the early retirement of all of the 5.375% Notes due 2013 and a portion of the 6.00% Notes due 2013, $217 for previous borrowings on the loans supporting the S o Lu refinery expansion, Juruti bauxite mine development, and Estreito hydroelectric power project in Brazil, and $45 for a loan associated with the Samara, Russia facility; net cash distributed to noncontrolling interests of $88, all of which relates to Alumina Limited share of AWAC; and $131 in dividends paid to shareholders. The use of cash in 2010 was primarily due to $1,757 in payments on long-term debt, mostly related to $511 for the repayment of 7.375% Notes due 2010 as scheduled, $825 for the early retirement of all of the 6.50% Notes due 2011 and a portion of the 6.00% Notes due 2012 and 5.375% Notes due 2013, and $287 related to previous borrowings on the loans supporting the S o Lu refinery expansion and Juruti bauxite mine development in Brazil; $125 in dividends paid to shareholders; net cash paid to noncontrolling interests of $94, all of which relates to Alumina Limited share of AWAC; $66 in acquisitions of noncontrolling interests, mainly the result of the $60 paid to redeem the convertible securities of a subsidiary that were held by Alcoa former partner related to the joint venture in Saudi Arabia; and a change of $44 in short-term borrowings. These items were partially offset by $1,126 in additions to long-term debt, of which $998 was for the issuance of 6.150% Notes due 2020 and $76 was related to borrowings under the loans that support the Estreito hydroelectric power project in Brazil. As a result of an agreement between Alcoa and Alumina Limited in September 2012, Alcoa of Australia (part of the AWAC group of companies) will make minimum dividend payments to Alumina Limited of $100 in 2013. On July 25, 2011, Alcoa entered into a Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ) with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein. The Credit Agreement provides a $3,750 senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ), the proceeds of which are to be used to provide working capital or for other general corporate purposes of Alcoa, including support of Alcoa commercial paper program. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, Alcoa may from time to time request increases in lender commitments under the 67 Table of Contents Credit Facility, not to exceed $500 in aggregate principal amount, and may also request the issuance of letters of credit, subject to a letter of credit sublimit of $1,000 under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility was scheduled to mature on July 25, 2016; however, on December 7, 2012, Alcoa received approval for a one-year extension of the maturity date by the lenders and issuers that support $3,700 of the Credit Facility (approval for the remaining $50 was received on January 8, 2013). As such, the Credit Facility now matures on July 25, 2017, unless extended or earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement. Alcoa may make one additional one-year extension request during the remaining term of the Credit Facility, subject to the lender consent requirements set forth in the Credit Agreement. Under the provisions of the Credit Agreement, Alcoa will pay a fee of 0.25% (based on Alcoa long-term debt ratings as of December 31, 2012) of the total commitment per annum to maintain the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility is unsecured and amounts payable under it will rank pari passu with all other unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness of Alcoa. Borrowings under the Credit Facility may be denominated in U.S. dollars or euros. Loans will bear interest at a base rate or a rate equal to LIBOR, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of Alcoa outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt. The applicable margin on base rate loans and LIBOR loans will be 0.50% and 1.50% per annum, respectively, based on Alcoa long-term debt ratings as of December 31, 2012. Loans may be prepaid without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs. The Credit Facility replaces Alcoa Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of October 2, 2007 (the Former Credit Agreement ), which was scheduled to mature on October 2, 2012. The Former Credit Agreement, which had a total capacity (excluding the commitment of Lehman Commercial Paper Inc.) of $3,275 and was undrawn, was terminated effective July 25, 2011. The Credit Agreement includes covenants substantially similar to those in the Former Credit Agreement, including, among others, (a) a leverage ratio, (b) limitations on Alcoa ability to incur liens securing indebtedness for borrowed money, (c) limitations on Alcoa ability to consummate a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, and (d) limitations on Alcoa ability to change the nature of its business. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, Alcoa was in compliance with all such covenants. The obligation of Alcoa to pay amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an Event of Default as defined in the Credit Agreement. Such Events of Default include, among others, (a) Alcoa failure to pay the principal of, or interest on, borrowings under the Credit Facility, (b) any representation or warranty of Alcoa in the Credit Agreement proving to be materially false or misleading, (c) Alcoa breach of any of its covenants contained in the Credit Agreement, and (d) the bankruptcy or insolvency of Alcoa. There were no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2012 and 2011 and no amounts were borrowed during 2012 or 2011 under the Credit Facility. In January 2012, Alcoa entered into two term loan agreements, totaling $350, with two separate financial institutions. Additionally, throughout 2012, Alcoa entered into six revolving credit agreements, providing a combined $640 in credit facilities, with six different financial institutions. The purpose of any borrowings under all eight arrangements will be to provide working capital and for other general corporate purposes, including contributions to Alcoa pension plans ($561 was contributed in 2012). The two term loans were fully drawn on the same dates as the agreements and were subject to an interest rate equivalent to the 1-month LIBOR (changed from the 3-month LIBOR in April 2012) plus a 1.5% margin. A $150 term loan was repaid between October and November 2012 and a $200 term loan was repaid in December 2012, effectively terminating both agreements. In February 2012, Alcoa fully borrowed $100 under one of the credit facilities, which was repaid in August 2012. This borrowing was subject to an interest rate equivalent to the 6-month LIBOR plus a 1.25% margin. In July 2012, Alcoa fully borrowed $150 under one of the credit facilities, which was repaid in December 2012. This borrowing was subject to an interest rate equivalent to the 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.375% margin. 68 Table of Contents The six revolving credit facilities expire as follows: $150 in March 2013; $100 in September 2013 (originally December 2012, extended in September 2012); $100 in September 2013; $140 in October 2013; $100 in December 2013 (originally December 2012, extended in December 2012); and $50 in December 2015. The covenants contained in all eight arrangements are the same as the Credit Agreement (see above). In February 2011, Alcoa filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an indeterminate amount of securities for future issuance. This shelf registration statement replaced Alcoa existing shelf registration statement (filed in March 2008). As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, $1,250 in senior debt securities were issued under the current shelf registration statement. Alcoa cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short- and long-term debt ratings assigned to Alcoa debt by the major credit rating agencies. On April 12, 2011, Standard and Poor Ratings Services (S&P) affirmed the following ratings for Alcoa: long-term debt at BBB- and short-term debt at A-3. Additionally, S&P changed the current outlook from negative to stable. On March 2, 2011, Moody Investors Service (Moody s) confirmed the following ratings for Alcoa: long-term debt at Baa3 and short-term debt at Prime-3. Additionally, Moody changed the current outlook from negative to stable. On September 7, 2011, Moody affirmed the ratings and outlook published in its March 2, 2011 report. On December 18, 2012, Moody placed Alcoa long-term debt and short-term debt ratings under review. On February 22, 2011, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) affirmed the following ratings for Alcoa: long-term debt at BBB- and short-term debt at F3. Additionally, Fitch changed the current outlook from negative to stable. On August 2, 2012, Fitch reaffirmed its previous ratings and outlook for Alcoa. Investing Activities Cash used for investing activities was $759 in 2012 compared with $1,852 in 2011 and $1,272 in 2010. The use of cash in 2012 was mainly due to $1,261 in capital expenditures (includes costs related to environmental control in new and expanded facilities of $153), 33% of which related to growth projects, including the automotive expansion at the Davenport, IA fabrication plant and the Estreito hydroelectric power project; and $300 in additions to investments, principally for the equity contributions of $253 related to the aluminum complex joint venture in Saudi Arabia. These items were somewhat offset by $615 in proceeds from the sale of assets, mostly the result of $597 received for the sale of U.S. hydroelectric power assets (see Primary Metals in Segment Information above), and a net change in restricted cash of $87, principally related to the release of funds to be used for capital expenditures of the automotive expansion at the Davenport, IA fabrication plant. The use of cash in 2011 was principally due to $1,287 in capital expenditures (includes costs related to environmental control in new and expanded facilities of $148), 28% of which related to growth projects, including the Estreito hydroelectric power project and Juruti bauxite mine development; $374 in additions to investments, mostly for the equity contributions of $249 related to the aluminum complex joint venture in Saudi Arabia and purchase of $41 in available-for-sale securities held by Alcoa captive insurance company; and $239 (net of cash acquired) for the acquisition of an aerospace fastener business. These items were slightly offset by $54 in sales of investments, primarily related to available-for-sale securities held by Alcoa captive insurance company, and $38 in proceeds from the sale of assets, mainly attributable to the sale of land in Australia. The use of cash in 2010 was primarily due to $1,015 in capital expenditures (includes costs related to environmental control in new and expanded facilities of $87), 44% of which related to growth projects, including the Estreito hydroelectric power project, Juruti bauxite mine development, and S o Lu refinery expansion; $352 in additions to investments, mostly for the equity contributions of $160 related to the joint venture in Saudi Arabia and purchase of $126 in available-for-sale securities held by Alcoa captive insurance company; and $72 for acquisitions, principally related to the purchase of a new building and construction systems business. These items were slightly offset by $141 in sales of investments, virtually all of which related to the sale of available-for-sale securities held by Alcoa captive insurance company. 69 Table of Contents Noncash Financing and Investing Activities In August 2012, Alcoa received a loan of $250 for the purpose of financing all or part of the cost of acquiring, constructing, reconstructing, and renovating certain facilities at Alcoa rolling mill plant in Davenport, IA. Because this loan can only be used for this purpose, the net proceeds of $248 were classified as restricted cash. Since restricted cash is not part of cash and cash equivalents, this transaction was not reflected in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows as it represents a noncash activity. As funds are expended for the project, the release of the cash will be reflected as both an inflow on the Net change in restricted cash line and an outflow on the Capital expenditures line in the Investing Activities section of the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. At December 31, 2012, Alcoa had $171 of restricted cash remaining related to this transaction. Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Contractual Obligations. Alcoa is required to make future payments under various contracts, including long-term purchase obligations, debt agreements, and lease agreements. Alcoa also has commitments to fund its pension plans, provide payments for other postretirement benefit plans, and finance capital projects. As of December 31, 2012, a summary of Alcoa outstanding contractual obligations is as follows (these contractual obligations are grouped in the same manner as they are classified in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in order to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information): Total 2013 2014-2015 2016-2017 Thereafter Operating activities: Energy-related purchase obligations $ 29,352 $ 1,770 $ 3,110 $ 3,834 $ 20,638 Raw material purchase obligations 5,773 1,756 1,147 766 2,104 Other purchase obligations 1,283 152 316 152 663 Operating leases 1,256 198 282 179 597 Interest related to total debt 4,699 501 907 860 2,431 Estimated minimum required pension funding 2,480 460 1,110 910 - Other postretirement benefit payments 2,590 285 560 545 1,200 Layoff and other restructuring payments 111 56 41 14 - Deferred revenue arrangements 156 8 31 36 81 Uncertain tax positions 81 - - - 81 Financing activities: Total debt 8,811 518 695 813 6,785 Dividends to shareholders - - - - - Investing activities: Capital projects 1,007 636 304 36 31 Equity contributions 439 350 89 - - Payments related to acquisitions - - - - - Totals $ 58,038 $ 6,690 $ 8,592 $ 8,145 $ 34,611 Obligations for Operating Activities Energy-related purchase obligations consist primarily of electricity and natural gas contracts with expiration dates ranging from 1 year to 35 years. Raw material obligations consist mostly of bauxite (relates to Alcoa bauxite mine interests in Guinea and Brazil), caustic soda, alumina, aluminum fluoride, calcined petroleum coke, cathode blocks, and various metals with expiration dates ranging from less than 1 year to 15 years. Other purchase obligations consist principally of freight for bauxite and alumina with expiration dates ranging from 2 to 19 years. Many of these purchase obligations contain variable pricing components, and, as a result, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table. Operating leases represent multi-year obligations for certain computer equipment, plant equipment, vehicles, and buildings and alumina refinery process control technology. 70 Table of Contents Interest related to total debt is based on interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2012 and is calculated on debt with maturities that extend to 2042. The effect of outstanding interest rate swaps, which are accounted for as fair value hedges, are included in interest related to total debt. As of December 31, 2012, these hedges effectively convert the interest rate from fixed to floating on $200 of debt through 2018. As the contractual interest rates for certain debt and interest rate swaps are variable, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table. Estimated minimum required pension funding and postretirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates, long-term rate of return on plan assets, rate of compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates, among others. The minimum required contributions for pension funding are estimated to be $460 for 2013, $575 for 2014, $535 for 2015, $465 for 2016, and $445 for 2017. These expected pension contributions reflect the impacts of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008, and the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21 st Century Act. Pension contributions are expected to continue to decline if all actuarial assumptions are realized and remain the same in the future. Other postretirement benefit payments are expected to approximate $270 to $285 annually for years 2013 through 2017 and $240 annually for years 2018 through 2022. Such payments will be slightly offset by subsidy receipts related to Medicare Part D, which are estimated to be approximately $30 to $35 annually for years 2013 through 2022. Alcoa has determined that it is not practicable to present pension funding and other postretirement benefit payments beyond 2017 and 2022, respectively. Layoff and other restructuring payments expected to be paid within one year primarily relate to severance costs. Amounts scheduled to be paid beyond one year are related to lease termination costs, special termination benefit payments, and ongoing site remediation work. Deferred revenue arrangements require Alcoa to deliver alumina and sheet and plate to certain customers over the specified contract period (through 2027 for an alumina contract and through 2020 for a sheet and plate contract). While these obligations are not expected to result in cash payments, they represent contractual obligations for which the Company would be obligated if the specified product deliveries could not be made. Uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return may result in additional payments to tax authorities. The amount in the preceding table includes interest and penalties accrued related to such positions as of December 31, 2012. The total amount of uncertain tax positions is included in the Thereafter column as the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments. If a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires, then additional payments will not be necessary. Obligations for Financing Activities Total debt amounts in the preceding table represent the principal amounts of all outstanding debt, including short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Maturities for long-term debt extend to 2042. Alcoa has historically paid quarterly dividends on its preferred and common stock. Including dividends on preferred stock, Alcoa paid $131 in dividends to shareholders during 2012. Because all dividends are subject to approval by Alcoa Board of Directors, amounts are not included in the preceding table unless such authorization has occurred. As of December 31, 2012, there were 1,067,211,953 and 546,024 shares of outstanding common stock and preferred stock, respectively. The annual preferred stock dividend is at the rate of $3.75 per share and the annual common stock dividend is $0.12 per share. Obligations for Investing Activities Capital projects in the preceding table only include amounts approved by management as of December 31, 2012. Funding levels may vary in future years based on anticipated construction schedules of the projects. It is expected that significant expansion projects will be funded through various sources, including cash provided from operations. Total capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately $1,550 in 2013. 71 Table of Contents Equity contributions represent Alcoa committed investment related to a joint venture in Saudi Arabia. In December 2009, Alcoa signed an agreement to enter into a joint venture to develop a new aluminum complex in Saudi Arabia, comprised of a bauxite mine, alumina refinery, aluminum smelter, and rolling mill, which will require the Company to contribute approximately $1,100 over a five-year period (2010 through 2014). As of December 31, 2012, Alcoa has made equity contributions of $661. The timing of the amounts included in the preceding table may vary based on changes in anticipated construction schedules of the project. Payments related to acquisitions are based on provisions in certain acquisition agreements that state additional funds are due to the seller from Alcoa if the businesses acquired achieve stated financial and operational thresholds. Amounts are only presented in the preceding table if it is has been determined that payment is more likely than not to occur. In connection with the 2005 acquisition of two fabricating facilities in Russia, Alcoa could be required to make contingent payments of approximately $50 through 2015, but are not included in the preceding table as they have not met such standard. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. At December 31, 2012, Alcoa has maximum potential future payments for guarantees issued on behalf of certain third parties of $621. These guarantees expire in 2015 through 2019 and relate to project financing for a hydroelectric power project in Brazil and the aluminum complex in Saudi Arabia. Alcoa also has outstanding bank guarantees related to tax matters, outstanding debt, workers compensation, environmental obligations, energy contracts, and customs duties, among others. The total amount committed under these guarantees, which expire at various dates between 2013 and 2017 was $494 at December 31, 2012. Alcoa has outstanding letters of credit primarily related to workers compensation, energy contracts, and leasing obligations. The total amount committed under these letters of credit, which automatically renew or expire at various dates, mostly in 2013, was $299 at December 31, 2012. Alcoa also has outstanding surety bonds primarily related to tax matters, contract performance, workers compensation, environmental-related matters, and customs duties. The total amount committed under these bonds, which automatically renew or expire at various dates, mostly in 2013 and 2014 was $193 at December 31, 2012. Alcoa has three arrangements, each with a different financial institution, to sell certain customer receivables outright without recourse on a continuous basis. As of December 31, 2012, sold receivables, which were derecognized from the Consolidated Balance Sheet, in the amount of $37 under the three arrangements combined were uncollected. Alcoa services the customer receivables for the financial institutions at market rates; therefore, no servicing asset or liability was recorded. On March 30, 2012, Alcoa finalized a one-year arrangement with a financial institution to sell certain customer receivables without recourse on a revolving basis. The sale of such receivables is completed through the use of a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, which is a consolidated subsidiary of Alcoa. This arrangement provides for minimum funding of $50 up to a maximum of $250 for receivables sold. Alcoa initially sold $304 of customer receivables in exchange for $50 in cash and $254 of deferred purchase price under this arrangement. Alcoa received additional cash funding of $155 throughout 2012. As of December 31, 2012, the deferred purchase price receivable was $18, which was included in Other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The deferred purchase price receivable is reduced as collections of the underlying receivables occur; however, as this is a revolving program, the sale of new receivables will result in an increase in the deferred purchase price receivable. The net change in the deferred purchase price receivable was reflected in the Decrease in receivables line item on the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. This activity is reflected as an operating cash flow because the related customer receivables are the result of an operating activity with an insignificant, short-term interest rate risk. In 2012, the gross cash outflows and inflows associated with the deferred purchase price receivable were $3,339 and $3,321, respectively. The gross amount of receivables sold and total cash collections under this program since its inception was $3,339 and $3,116, respectively. Alcoa services the customer receivables for the financial institution at market rates; therefore, no servicing asset or liability was recorded. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosed in the accompanying Notes. Areas that require significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions include accounting for 72 Table of Contents derivatives and hedging activities; environmental and litigation matters; asset retirement obligations; the testing of goodwill, equity investments, and properties, plants, and equipment for impairment; estimating fair value of businesses to be divested; pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations; stock-based compensation; and income taxes. Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments, estimates, and assumptions, and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the Company Consolidated Financial Statements at any given time. Despite these inherent limitations, management believes that Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the Company. A summary of the Company significant accounting policies is included in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the Company to provide the users of the Consolidated Financial Statements with useful and reliable information about the Company operating results and financial condition. Derivatives and Hedging. Derivatives are held for purposes other than trading and are part of a formally documented risk management program. For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, Alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing, at least quarterly, the historical high correlation of changes in the fair value of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, Alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing, at least quarterly, the probable high correlation of the expected future cash flows of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument. The ineffective portions of both types of hedges are recorded in sales or other income or expense in the current period. If the hedging relationship ceases to be highly effective or it becomes probable that an expected transaction will no longer occur, future gains or losses on the derivative instrument are recorded in other income or expense. Alcoa accounts for interest rate swaps related to its existing long-term debt and hedges of firm customer commitments for aluminum as fair value hedges. As a result, the fair values of the derivatives and changes in the fair values of the underlying hedged items are reported in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in the fair values of these derivatives and underlying hedged items generally offset and are recorded each period in sales or interest expense, consistent with the underlying hedged item. Alcoa accounts for hedges of foreign currency exposures and certain forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges. The fair values of the derivatives are recorded in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The effective portions of the changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income and are reclassified to sales, cost of goods sold, or other income or expense in the period in which earnings are impacted by the hedged items or in the period that the transaction no longer qualifies as a cash flow hedge. These contracts cover the same periods as known or expected exposures, generally not exceeding five years. If no hedging relationship is designated, the derivative is marked to market through earnings. Cash flows from derivatives are recognized in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in a manner consistent with the underlying transactions. Environmental Matters. Expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate. Expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations, which will not contribute to future revenues, are expensed. Liabilities are recorded when remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The liability may include costs such as site investigations, consultant fees, feasibility studies, outside contractors, and monitoring expenses. Estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery. Claims for recovery are recognized as agreements are reached with third parties. The estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that Alcoa has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share. The liability is continuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress, prospective estimates of required activity, and other factors that may be relevant, including changes in technology or regulations. 73 Table of Contents Litigation Matters. For asserted claims and assessments, liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. Management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter, available defenses and case strategy, progress of the matter, views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors, applicability and success of appeals processes, and the outcome of similar historical matters, among others. Once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable, management weighs the probability of estimated losses, and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded. If an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible, then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded. With respect to unasserted claims or assessments, management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely, then, a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made. Legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss. Asset Retirement Obligations. Alcoa recognizes asset retirement obligations (AROs) related to legal obligations associated with the normal operation of Alcoa bauxite mining, alumina refining, and aluminum smelting facilities. These AROs consist primarily of costs associated with spent pot lining disposal, closure of bauxite residue areas, mine reclamation, and landfill closure. Alcoa also recognizes AROs for any significant lease restoration obligation, if required by a lease agreement, and for the disposal of regulated waste materials related to the demolition of certain power facilities. The fair values of these AROs are recorded on a discounted basis, at the time the obligation is incurred, and accreted over time for the change in present value. Additionally, Alcoa capitalizes asset retirement costs by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived assets and depreciating these assets over their remaining useful life. Certain conditional asset retirement obligations (CAROs) related to alumina refineries, aluminum smelters, and fabrication facilities have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements due to uncertainties surrounding the ultimate settlement date. A CARO is a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and (or) method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within Alcoa control. Such uncertainties exist as a result of the perpetual nature of the structures, maintenance and upgrade programs, and other factors. At the date a reasonable estimate of the ultimate settlement date can be made, Alcoa would record an ARO for the removal, treatment, transportation, storage and (or) disposal of various regulated assets and hazardous materials such as asbestos, underground and aboveground storage tanks, polychlorinated biphenyls, various process residuals, solid wastes, electronic equipment waste, and various other materials. Such amounts may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the period in which they are recorded. If Alcoa was required to demolish all such structures immediately, the estimated CARO as of December 31, 2012 ranges from less than $1 to $52 per structure (132 structures) in today dollars. Goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is reviewed for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions, negative developments in equity and credit markets, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates, increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. The fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill. Goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Alcoa has nine reporting units, of which five are included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment. The remaining four reporting units are the Alumina segment, the Primary Metals segment, the Global Rolled Products segment, and the soft alloy extrusions business in Brazil, which is included in Corporate. Almost 90% of Alcoa total goodwill is allocated to three reporting units as follows: Alcoa Fastening Systems (AFS) ($1,160) and Alcoa Power and Propulsion (APP) ($1,628) businesses, both of which are included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, and Primary Metals ($1,748). These amounts include an allocation of Corporate goodwill. 74 Table of Contents In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new accounting guidance for testing goodwill for impairment (see the Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance section of Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K). The guidance provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (more than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not, the entity is then required to perform the existing two-step quantitative impairment test (described below), otherwise no further analysis is required. An entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test. The ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test. In the 2011 fourth quarter, in conjunction with management annual review of goodwill, Alcoa early adopted the new guidance. As a result, Alcoa instituted a policy for its annual review of goodwill to perform the qualitative assessment for all reporting units not subjected directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test. Management will proceed directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test for a minimum of three reporting units (based on facts and circumstances) during each annual review of goodwill. This policy will result in each of the nine reporting units being subjected to the two-step quantitative impairment test at least once during every three-year period. Under the qualitative assessment, various events and circumstances (or factors) that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified (similar to impairment indicators above). These factors are then classified by the type of impact they would have on the estimated fair value using positive, neutral, and adverse categories based on current business conditions. Additionally, an assessment of the level of impact that a particular factor would have on the estimated fair value is determined using high, medium, and low weighting. Furthermore, management considers the results of the most recent two-step quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit (this would be 2011 and 2010 in which the estimated fair values of three and nine reporting units, respectively, were substantially in excess of their carrying values) and compares the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) between the current and prior years for each reporting unit. During the 2012 annual review of goodwill, management performed the qualitative assessment for six reporting units. Management concluded that it was not more likely than not that the estimated fair values of the six reporting units were less than their carrying values. As such, no further analysis was required. Under the two-step quantitative impairment test, the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Alcoa uses a DCF model to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment, as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows, including markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce, tax rates, capital spending, discount rate, and working capital changes. Most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units. Cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years. The betas used in calculating the individual reporting units WACC rate are estimated for each business with the assistance of valuation experts. In the event the estimated fair value of a reporting unit per the DCF model is less than the carrying value, additional analysis would be required. The additional analysis would compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill, which may involve the use of valuation experts. The implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to such excess would be recognized, which could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations and shareholders equity. 75 Table of Contents During the 2012 annual review of goodwill, management proceeded directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test for three reporting units as follows: the Primary Metals segment, the Alumina segment, and the Global Rolled Products segment. For Global Rolled Products, the estimated fair value exceeded carrying value by more than 150%, resulting in no impairment. For Primary Metals and Alumina, the estimated fair values exceeded their carrying values by 9.2% and 7.4%, respectively, resulting in no impairment. These two reporting units have goodwill of $1,748 and $171, respectively. In developing the fair value of these reporting units, the Company estimates future cash flows using LME forward curve pricing and operating cost assumptions management believes are reasonable based on expected and historical performance. The following could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of Primary Metals and Alumina: a significant, protracted decrease in LME and alumina prices; decrease in long-term profitability; decrease in the long-term demand for aluminum; substantial reductions in Alcoa end markets and volume assumptions; and an increase in discount rates. As part of the 2012 annual review of goodwill, management considered the market capitalization of Alcoa common stock in relation to the Company total shareholders equity. At December 31, 2012, the market capitalization of Alcoa common stock was $9,263. While this amount is less than the Company total shareholders equity at December 31, 2012, the estimated aggregate fair value of Alcoa reporting units was substantially in excess of the aforementioned market capitalization amount. In management judgment, the main reason for the difference between Alcoa market capitalization and total shareholders equity at December 31, 2012 is significantly lower commodity prices for aluminum. Management believes these commodity prices are being adversely impacted by turmoil in the macroeconomic environment, which do not necessarily reflect aluminum industry fundamentals. For example, there was, and continues to be, significant uncertainty of the sovereign debt of many European countries. This uncertainty has affected the liquidity of many companies that either operate or are located in Europe, although, Alcoa has not been impacted significantly. Additionally, during 2012, there was great concern over what was labeled the fiscal cliff in the U.S. and a slowdown in the growth of China. The combination of this economic uncertainty and the continuing decline in commodity prices caused the price of Alcoa common stock to remain depressed. As a result, management believes the quoted market price of Alcoa common stock does not fully reflect the underlying value of the future aggregate cash flows of the Company reporting units. Accordingly, management does not believe that the comparison of Alcoa market capitalization and total shareholders equity as of December 31, 2012 is an indication that goodwill is impaired. Equity Investments. Alcoa invests in a number of privately-held companies, primarily through joint ventures and consortia, which are accounted for on the equity method. The equity method is applied in situations where Alcoa has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. Management reviews equity investments for impairment whenever certain indicators are present suggesting that the carrying value of an investment is not recoverable. This analysis requires a significant amount of judgment from management to identify events or circumstances indicating that an equity investment is impaired. The following items are examples of impairment indicators: significant, sustained declines in an investee revenue, earnings, and cash flow trends; adverse market conditions of the investee industry or geographic area; the investee ability to continue operations measured by several items, including liquidity; and other factors. Once an impairment indicator is identified, management uses considerable judgment to determine if the impairment is other than temporary, in which case the equity investment is written down to its estimated fair value. An impairment that is other than temporary could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations. Properties, Plants, and Equipment. Properties, plants, and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets (asset group) may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets (asset group) to their carrying amount. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets (asset group) exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets (asset group) over their fair value, with fair value determined using the best information available, which generally is a DCF model. The determination of what constitutes an asset group, the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows, and the estimated useful lives of assets also require significant judgments. 76 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations and Assets Held For Sale. The fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a DCF model, valuations performed by third parties, earnings multiples, or indicative bids, when available. A number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques, including the forecasting of markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs and expenses, and multiple other factors. Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made; however, the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits. Liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions, including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (salary increases, health care cost trend rates, retirement age, and mortality). The interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined using a Company-specific yield curve model (above-median) developed with the assistance of an external actuary. The cash flows of the plans projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds, which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors, including finance and banking, manufacturing, transportation, insurance, and pharmaceutical, among others. The yield curve model parallels the plans projected cash flows, which have an average duration of 10 years, and the underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the Company plans obligations multiple times. In 2012, 2011, and 2010, the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations for U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 4.15%, 4.90%, and 5.75%, respectively. The impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 1/4 of 1% would be approximately $475 and either a charge or credit of $19 to after-tax earnings in the following year. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a five-year market-related value of plan assets (a four-year average or the fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain non-U.S. plans). The process used by management to develop this assumption has expanded from one that relied primarily on historical asset return information to one that also incorporates forward-looking returns by asset class, as described below. Prior to developing the expected long-term rate of return for calendar year 2009, management focused on historical actual returns (annual, 10-year moving, and 20-year moving averages) when developing this assumption. Based on that process, management utilized 9% for the expected long-term rate of return for several years through 2008. For calendar year 2009, the expected long-term rate of return was reduced to 8.75% due to lower future expected market returns as a result of the then global economic downturn. This was supported by the fact that, in 2008, the 10-year moving average of actual performance fell below 9% for the first time in 20 years, although the 20-year moving average continued to exceed 9%. For calendar year 2010, management expanded its process by incorporating expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and management own judgment. Management considered this forward-looking analysis as well as the historical return information, and concluded the expected rate of return for calendar 2010 would remain at 8.75%, which was between the 20-year moving average actual return performance and the estimated future return developed by asset class. For calendar year 2012 and 2011, management again incorporated both actual historical return information and expected future returns into its analysis. Based on strategic asset allocation changes and estimates of future returns by asset class, management used 8.50% as its expected long-term rate of return for both years. This rate again falls within the range of the 20-year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class. For calendar year 2013, management used the same methodology as it did for 2012 and 2011 and determined that 8.50% will be the expected long-term rate of return. A change in the assumption for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 1/4 of 1% would impact after-tax earnings by approximately $16 for 2013. 77 Table of Contents In 2012, a net charge of $769 ($529 after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to a 75 basis point decrease in the discount rate, which was slightly offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs. In 2011, a net charge of $991 ($593 after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to an 85 basis point decrease in the discount rate, which was slightly offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs. In 2010, a net charge of $216 ($138 after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive income, primarily due to a 40 basis point decrease in the discount rate, which was somewhat offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs. Additionally, in 2010, a charge of $2 was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss due to the reclassification of deferred taxes related to the Medicare Part D prescription drug subsidy. Stock-based Compensation. Alcoa recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the non-substantive vesting period approach, in which the expense (net of estimated forfeitures) is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value. The fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-pricing model. Determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment, including estimates for the average risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility, annual forfeiture rate, and exercise behavior. These assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time. Equity grants are issued in January each year. As part of Alcoa stock-based compensation plan design, individuals who are retirement-eligible have a six-month requisite service period in the year of grant. As a result, a larger portion of expense will be recognized in the first half of each year for these retirement-eligible employees. Compensation expense recorded in 2012, 2011, and 2010 was $67 ($46 after-tax), $83 ($56 after-tax), and $84 ($57 after-tax), respectively. Of this amount, $13, $18, and $19 in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively, pertains to the acceleration of expense related to retirement-eligible employees. Most plan participants can choose whether to receive their award in the form of stock options, stock awards, or a combination of both. This choice is made before the grant is issued and is irrevocable. Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable (or received or receivable) for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid, and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of Alcoa assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in carryback periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future profitability within the carryforward period, including from tax planning strategies, and the Company experience with similar operations. Existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence. Negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses, projections of future losses, or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income. Deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances, resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance. Tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold. Otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitation has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open. Interest and penalties related to 78 Table of Contents uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized. Related Party Transactions Alcoa buys products from and sells products to various related companies, consisting of entities in which Alcoa retains a 50% or less equity interest, at negotiated arms-length prices between the two parties. These transactions were not material to the financial position or results of operations of Alcoa for all periods presented.
