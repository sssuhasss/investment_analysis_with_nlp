BUSINESS OVERVIEW Gartner, Inc. is the world leading information technology research and advisory company that helps executives use technology to build, guide and grow their enterprises. We offer independent and objective research and analysis on the information technology, computer hardware, software, communications and related technology industries. We provide comprehensive coverage of the IT industry to approximately 10,000 client organizations, including approximately 400 of the Fortune 500 companies, across 80 countries. Our client base consists primarily of CIOs and other senior IT and executives from a wide variety of business enterprises, government agencies and the investment community. We have three business segments: Research, Consulting and Events. Research provides insight for CIOs, IT professionals, technology companies and the investment community through reports and briefings, access to our analysts, as well as peer networking services and membership programs designed specifically for CIOs and other senior executives. Consulting consists primarily of consulting, measurement engagements and strategic advisory services (paid one-day analyst engagements) ( SAS ), which provide assessments of cost, performance, efficiency and quality focused on the IT industry. Events consists of various symposia, conferences and exhibitions focused on the IT industry. 15 Table of Contents BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS We believe the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments: BUSINESS SEGMENT BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS Research Contract value represents the value attributable to all of our subscription-related research products that recognize revenue on a ratable basis. Contract value is calculated as the annualized value of all subscription research contracts in effect at a specific point in time, without regard to the duration of the contract. Client retention rate represents a measure of client satisfaction and renewed business relationships at a specific point in time. Client retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing our current clients, who were also clients a year ago, by all clients from a year ago. Wallet retention rate represents a measure of the amount of contract value we have retained with clients over a twelve-month period. Wallet retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing the contract value of clients, who were clients one year earlier, by the total contract value from a year earlier. When wallet retention exceeds client retention, it is an indication of retention of higher-spending clients, or increased spending by retained clients, or both. Number of executive program members represents the number of paid participants in executive programs. Consulting Consulting backlog represents future revenue to be derived from in-process consulting, measurement and strategic advisory services engagements. Utilization rates represent a measure of productivity of our consultants. Utilization rates are calculated for billable headcount on a percentage basis by dividing total hours billed by total hours available to bill. Billing Rate represents earned billable revenue divided by total billable hours. Average annualized revenue per billable headcount represents a measure of the revenue generating ability of an average billable consultant and is calculated periodically by multiplying the average billing rate per hour times the utilization percentage times the billable hours available for one year. Events Number of events represents the total number of hosted events completed during the period. Number of attendees represents the number of people who attend events. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION The cornerstones of our strategy are to focus on producing extraordinary research content, deliver innovative and highly differentiated product offerings, enhance our sales capability, provide world class client service, and improve our operational effectiveness. We had total revenues of $1,279.1 million in 2008, up 9% over the prior year. Total revenues increased in all of our geographic regions. We had income from continuing operations of $97.1 million in 2008, or $0.98 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $70.7 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, for 2007. These improved results are due to a number of factors, including higher overall revenues in Research and Consulting, a continued focus on expense management, the impact of a legal settlement and other charges in 2007, the favorable impact of foreign currency, and a lower share base due to share repurchases. These positive trends offset lower revenue and profitability in our Events segment. In our Research business, we had strong, double-digit revenue growth in 2008, with revenues up 15% over the prior year, to $773.2 million. Revenue growth occurred across our entire product portfolio, with all client sizes, industry segments, and products delivering growth. Research contract value was $834.3 million at December 31, 2008, up 11% from December 31, 2007, and a record level for us. Our contract value growth was broad-based across all of our industry sectors. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenues and contract value were up 14% and 8% year-over-year, respectively. 16 Table of Contents Our client retention and wallet retention rates for 2008 remained strong at 82% and 98%, respectively, compared to 82% and 101% in the prior year. Our Executive Program membership was 3,733 at December 31, 2008, compared to 3,753 members at December 31, 2007. Consulting revenue in 2008 was up 7% over 2007, to $347.4 million, reflecting growth in our core consulting and benchmarking businesses and exceptionally strong results in our contract optimization business. Our consultant utilization rate increased 3 points, to 72% from 69% in the prior year, reflecting improved engagement management. Billable headcount was 499 at December 31, 2008, up from 472 at December 31, 2007. The hourly billing rate remained above $350 per hour in 2008, while the average annualized revenue per billable headcount was approximately $458,000 for 2008, about 7% higher than the prior year. Consulting backlog at December 31, 2008 was $97.2 million, down from $121.4 million at December 31, 2007. Events revenues decreased 6%, or $10.0 million, to $150.1 million in 2008 compared to $160.1 million in 2007. We held 70 events in 2008 compared to 62 in 2007. The revenue decrease was due to declines in both the number of attendees and exhibitors, as travel restrictions and other expense controls negatively impacted our fourth quarter Events segment results. For 2009, we are currently planning to hold 54 events. For a more detailed discussion of our segment results, see Segment Results below. We repurchased 9.7 million of our common shares in 2008. We had $184.4 million of operating cash flow in 2008, significantly higher than the prior year, and we ended the year with $140.9 million in cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2008, we also had $178.3 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. We believe we have a strong cash position and adequate borrowing capacity. FLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS Our quarterly and annual revenue, operating income, and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors, including: the timing of our SymposiumITxpo series that normally occurs during the fourth calendar quarter, and other events; the amount of new business generated; the mix of domestic and international business; changes in market demand for our products and services; changes in foreign currency rates; the timing of the development, introduction and marketing of new products and services; competition in the industry; and other factors. The potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause period-to-period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective judgments and the use of estimates. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below. Revenue recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements ( SAB 101 ), and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition ( SAB 104 ). Once all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met, revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows: Research revenues are derived from subscription contracts for research products. Revenues from research products are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term; Consulting revenues are principally generated from fixed fee and time and material engagements. Revenue from fixed fee contracts is recognized on a percentage of completion basis. Revenues from time and materials engagements is recognized as work is delivered and/or services are provided. Revenues related to contract optimization contracts are contingent in nature and are only recognized upon satisfaction of all conditions related to their payment. Events revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the related symposium, conference or exhibition; Other revenues consist primarily of fees from research reprints which are recognized when the reprint is shipped. The majority of research contracts are billable upon signing, absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time. All research contracts are non-cancelable and non-refundable, except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses, which have not produced material cancellations to date. It is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that 17 Table of Contents is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue, since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim. For those government contracts that permit termination, we bill the client the full amount billable under the contract but only record a receivable equal to the earned portion of the contract. In addition, we only record deferred revenue on these government contracts when cash is received. Deferred revenues attributable to government contracts were $61.6 million and $57.6 million at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, we had not recognized uncollected receivables or deferred revenues relating to government contracts that permit termination, of $12.1 million and $10.8 million, respectively. Uncollectible fees receivable The allowance for losses is composed of a bad debt and a sales and allowance reserve. Provisions are charged against earnings, either as a reduction to revenues or an increase to expense. The measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for uncollectible fees receivable is based on historical loss experience, aging of outstanding receivables, an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients. This evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires material estimates. These valuation reserves are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectibility of fees receivable becomes available. Circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients liquidity and credit quality, other factors negatively impacting our clients ability to pay their obligations as they come due, and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. The following table provides our total fees receivable, along with the related allowance for losses (in thousands): December 31, 2008 2007 Total fees receivable $ 326,311 $ 363,376 Allowance for losses (7,800 ) (8,450 ) Fees receivable, net $ 318,511 $ 354,926 Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets The evaluation of goodwill is performed in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ( SFAS No. 142 ). Among other requirements, this standard eliminated goodwill amortization upon adoption and requires ongoing annual assessments of goodwill impairment. The evaluation of other intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis. These assessments require management to estimate the fair values of our reporting units based on estimates of future business operations and market and economic conditions in developing long-term forecasts. If we determine that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we must recognize an impairment charge for the associated goodwill of that reporting unit against earnings in our financial statements. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger a review for impairment include the following: Significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results; Significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; Significant negative industry or economic trends; Significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and Our market capitalization relative to net book value. Due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of the reporting units and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations, both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty, and as additional information becomes known, we may change our estimates. Accounting for income taxes As we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in question. We consider the availability of loss carryforwards, existing deferred tax liabilities, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. In the event we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment is 18 Table of Contents made to reduce the valuation allowance and increase income in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance is charged against income in the period such determination is made. On January 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes ( FIN 48 ) (see Note 11 Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). FIN 48 is an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and it seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, and accounting in interim periods and requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes. Accounting for stock-based compensation On January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123(R), Share-Based Payment ( SFAS No. 123(R) ), as interpreted by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 ( SAB No. 107 ). Effective with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company is recognizing stock-based compensation expense, which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant, over the related service period, net of estimated forfeitures (see Note 9 Stock-Based Compensation in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain highly complex and subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the stock compensation awards and the Company common stock price volatility. In addition, determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the rate of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of achievement of certain performance targets. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent management best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions, or if the quantity and nature of the Company stock-based compensation awards changes, then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period. Contingencies and other loss reserves and accruals We record accruals for severance costs, lease costs associated with excess facilities, contract terminations and asset impairments as a result of actions we undertake to streamline our organization, reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs. Estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions, such as future lease payments, sublease income, the fair value of assets, and severance and related benefits, are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated. To the extent actual costs differ from those estimates, reserve levels may need to be adjusted. In addition, these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved. Additionally, we record accruals for estimated incentive compensation costs during each year. Amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known until after year end. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In February 2008 the Company sold its Vision Events business, which had been part of its Events segment, and has reported the results of operations of this business as a discontinued operation (see Note 2 Discontinued Operations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). As a result, the results discussed below and in the Segment Results section for the years ended prior to December 31, 2008 have been restated to present the results of operations of the Vision Events business as a discontinued operation in order to be consistent with the current year presentation. 2008 VERSUS 2007 TOTAL REVENUES increased by $110.6 million, or 9%, to $1,279.1 million in 2008 from $1,168.5 million during 2007. Excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency translation, total revenues for 2008 would have increased 8% over 2007. Total revenues increased in all of our geographic regions. Revenues from sales to United States and Canadian clients increased 9%, to $723.2 million in 2008 from $661.2 million in 2007. Revenues from sales to clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa ( EMEA ) increased to $430.4 million in 2008 from $403.9 million in 2007, a 7% increase. Revenues from sales to clients in our Other International region increased 21%, to $125.4 million in 2008 from $103.3 million in 2007. An overview of our results by segment follows: Research revenues increased 15% in 2008 to $773.3 million, compared to $673.3 million in 2007, and comprised approximately 60% and 58% of our total revenues in 2008 and 2007, respectively. 19 Table of Contents Consulting revenues increased 7% in 2008 to $347.4 million, compared to $325.0 million in 2007, and comprised approximately 27% and 28% of our total revenues in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Events revenues were $150.1 million in 2008, a decrease of 6% from $160.1 million in 2007, and comprised approximately 12% and 14% of our total revenues in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Other revenues, consisting principally of research reprint revenues, declined to $8.3 million in 2008 from $10.0 million in 2007. Please refer to the section of this MD&A entitled Segment Results for a further discussion of results by segment. COST OF SERVICES AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT increased $24.0 million, or about 5%, when comparing 2008 with 2007, to $554.8 million from $530.8 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, Cost of service and product development would have increased by about 4%. The year-over-year increase of $24.0 million was due to several factors. We had $17.0 million of higher salary, commissions, and other benefit costs, $5.7 million in additional severance and benefits charges related to our fourth quarter reduction in force, and $4.0 million in additional Events fulfillment costs. The impact of foreign currency translation added about $2.1 million of expense. Partially offsetting these higher charges was a decrease of approximately $3.0 million in lower headcount costs, primarily due to our exit from consulting operations in Asia-Pacific in mid-2007, as well as lower stock-compensation charges of about $1.2 million. As a percentage of sales, Cost of services and product development was 43% and 45% in 2008 and 2007 respectively, a decrease of 2 points, which is due to a number of factors. These factors include higher revenues coupled with the inherent operating leverage in our Research business, improved productivity in core Consulting, substantially increased revenues in our higher margin contract optimization business in our Consulting segment, and a continued focus on expense management. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ( SG&A ) expense increased 13%, or $59.6 million, to $532.4 million in 2008 compared to $472.7 million in 2007. The year-over-year impact of foreign currency translation was flat. The $59.6 million increase in SG&A expense resulted primarily from increased investment in our sales organization, severance and benefits charges related to our fourth quarter reduction in force, and increases in other payroll and benefits costs. Growth in our sales organization resulted in approximately $38.0 million of additional payroll and benefits, commissions, and travel expense in 2008 when compared to 2007. We now have 928 quota-bearing sales associates, a 15% increase over December 31, 2007. We had $2.8 million in severance and benefits charges related to our fourth quarter reduction in force, while higher payroll and related benefits costs for our other staff added about $13.0 million in costs. The remaining increase was spread across a number of other cost categories, which was offset to some extent by lower recruiting and stock-compensation charges. DEPRECIATION expense increased 7% in 2008, to $25.9 million compared to $24.3 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a change in the mix of investment in capital expenditures. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES was $1.6 million in 2008 compared to $2.1 million in 2007. The decrease was due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized in 2007. OTHER CHARGES was zero in 2008 and $9.1 million in 2007. The $9.1 million included charges of $8.7 million related to the settlement of litigation and $2.7 million of severance costs related to the Company exit from consulting operations in Asia. Offsetting these charges was a credit of $2.3 million related to an excess facility which the Company returned to service. OPERATING INCOME was $164.4 million and $129.5 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, an increase of $34.9 million, or 27%. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 13% in 2008 and 11% in 2007, which is due to a number of factors, the most significant being the impact from higher revenues in our Research and Consulting businesses. Please refer to the section of this MD&A entitled Segment Results below for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment. The improved operating performance also reflects our continued focus on expense management, charges of $9.1 million in 2007 related to the settlement of litigation and other items, and a positive impact from foreign currency translation. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET was $19.3 million and $22.2 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, a decrease of $2.9 million. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in the weighted-average interest rate on our outstanding debt. The weighted-average interest rate on our debt, including the impact of our interest rate swaps, was 4.8% in 2008 and 6.0% in 2007. The impact of the lower average rate was 20 Table of Contents partially offset by an increase in the weighted-average amount of debt outstanding of approximately $50.0 million during 2008. In 2008 we also had about $0.2 million of additional interest income, as well as a $0.2 million decrease in the amortization of debt issuance costs, both of which are recorded in Interest Expense, net. OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET was $(0.4) million in 2008 and $3.2 million in 2007. The $(0.4) million Other expense in 2008 primarily consisted of a $1.2 million gain related to the settlement of a litigation matter and net foreign currency exchange gains and losses. The $3.2 million of Other income in 2007 primarily consisted of a $1.8 million gain from the settlement of a claim and net foreign currency exchange gains and losses. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES on continuing operations was $47.6 million in 2008 as compared to $39.8 million 2007. The effective tax rate was 32.9% in 2008 and 36.0% in 2007. The lower effective tax rate in 2008 as compared to 2007 was attributable to several items. The most significant of these items included the following: (a) the Company generated a larger percentage of its income in low tax jurisdictions in 2008 as compared to 2007, and (b) differences relating to the tax impact of repatriated funds in 2008 as compared to 2007. INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAXES, which includes the results of the Company Vision Events business, was $6.7 million and $2.9 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company sold the Vision Events business, which had been part of the Company Events segment, in early 2008. The results for 2008 include a net gain on the sale of approximately $7.1 million and a loss from operations of $(0.4) million. NET INCOME was $103.9 million and $73.6 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively, an increase of $30.3 million, or 41%. Basic earnings per share was $1.09 per share in 2008 and $0.71 per share in 2007, while diluted was $1.05 per share in 2008 and $0.68 per share in 2007. Both basic and diluted earnings for 2008 include $0.07 per share from discontinued operations, while basic and diluted earnings for 2007 include $0.03 per share from discontinued operations. 2007 VERSUS 2006 TOTAL REVENUES increased $131.2 million, or 13%, to $1,168.5 million in 2007 from $1,037.3 million during 2006. Excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency translation, total revenues for 2007 would have increased 9% over 2006. Research revenues increased 18% in 2007 to $673.3 million, compared to $571.2 million in 2006, and comprised approximately 58% and 55% of total revenues in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Consulting revenues in 2007 of $325.0 million were up 6% compared to $305.2 million in 2006, and comprised approximately 28% and 29% of total revenues in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Events revenues were $160.1 million in 2007, an increase of 9% from $146.4 million in 2006, and comprised approximately 14% of total revenues in both 2007 and 2006. Other revenues, consisting principally of research reprint revenues, declined to $10.0 million in 2007 from $14.4 million in 2006. Please refer to the section of this MD&A entitled Segment Results for a further discussion of revenues by segment. Revenues increased in all regions. Revenues from sales to United States and Canadian clients increased 9%, to $661.2 million in 2007 from $608.3 million in 2006. Revenues from sales to clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa ( EMEA ) increased to $403.9 million in 2007 from $337.7 million in 2006, a 20% increase. Revenues from sales to clients in the Other International region increased 13%, to $103.3 million in 2007 from $91.3 million in 2006. COST OF SERVICES AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT increased $40.2 million, or 8%, when comparing 2007 with 2006, to $530.1 million from $490.6 million, respectively. Excluding the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation, Cost of services and product development would have increased about 4%. The $40.2 million increase was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency, which added about $17.0 million of additional expense, $18.2 million of merit salary, bonus, and fringe increases, $6.4 million of higher event fulfillment costs driven by higher events revenue, and additional stock-based compensation costs under SFAS No. 123(R) of about $2.5 million. These increases were offset to some extent by lower non-sales headcount and other charges. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, Cost of services and product development as a percentage of revenue was 45% and 47%, respectively. 21 Table of Contents SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ( SG&A ) expense increased $59.7 million, or 14% to $472.7 million from $413.1 million when comparing 2007 to 2006. Excluding the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation, SG&A expense would have increased by 12% year-over-year. The $59.7 million increase in SG&A year-over-year resulted primarily from increased investment in our sales organization, with expenses up approximately $30.0 million, foreign currency translation, which added about $9.1 million of expense, and additional stock-based compensation under SFAS No. 123(R) of $5.4 million. As of December 31, 2007, we had 806 sales associates, a 22% increase over the prior year-end. While SG&A expense increased 14% year-over-year, when sales-related expenses are excluded General and Administrative (G&A) expense was down about one percentage point year-over-year as a percentage of revenue. DEPRECIATION expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $24.3 million compared to $23.4 million in 2006, driven by higher capital expenditures. We had $24.2 million and $21.1 million of capital expenditures in 2007 and 2006, respectively. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES was $2.1 million in 2007 compared to $10.7 million in 2006. The decrease was due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized in 2006. META INTEGRATION CHARGES was zero in 2007 and $1.5 million in 2006. These expenses were primarily for severance, and for consulting, accounting, and tax services. OTHER CHARGES was $9.1 million and zero in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The $9.1 million included charges of $8.7 million related to the settlement of litigation and $2.7 million of severance costs related to the Company exit from consulting operations in Asia. Offsetting these charges was a credit of $2.3 million related to an excess facility which the Company returned to service. OPERATING INCOME was $129.5 million and $98.0 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, an increase of $31.4 million, or 32%. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 11% in 2007 and 9% in 2006. The improved operating income primarily resulted from higher revenues in our Research and Consulting businesses. Please refer to the section of this MD&A entitled Segment Results below for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET was $22.2 million and $16.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in our interest expense was due to a higher weighted-average amount of debt outstanding in 2007. The increased interest expense from additional debt outstanding was partially offset by a slight decline in rates and higher interest income. OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET was $3.2 million and $(0.8) million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 2007 includes a gain from the settlement of a claim for $1.8 million, while the majority of the remaining net balances in both years consists of net foreign currency exchange gains and losses. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES was $39.8 million for 2007 as compared to $26.4 million in 2006. The effective tax rate for 2007 was 36.0% as compared to 32.7% for 2006. The higher effective tax rate in 2007 as compared to 2006 was attributable to several items. The most significant of these items included the following: (a) the Company generated a smaller percentage of its income in low tax jurisdictions in 2007 as compared to 2006, and (b) differences relating to the release of valuation allowances and changes in reserves. INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAXES, which includes the results of the Company Vision Events business, was $2.9 million and $3.9 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. NET INCOME was $73.6 million and $58.2 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, an increase of $15.4 million, or 26%. Basic earnings per share was $0.71 per share in 2007 and $0.51 per share in 2006, while diluted was $0.68 per share in 2007 and $0.50 per share in 2006. The basic and diluted earnings for both 2007 and 2006 includes $0.03 per share from discontinued operations. 2008 SEGMENT RESULTS We evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin. Gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain Cost of services and product development charges, and Selling, general and administrative expenses, Depreciation, META integration charges, Amortization of intangibles and Other charges. Gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues. 22 Table of Contents Research Revenue in our Research business was up 15% in 2008, to $773.3 million, from $673.3 million for 2007. We had growth across our entire product portfolio in 2008. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency, revenue was up approximately 14% over the prior year. Research gross contribution increased to $507.7 million in 2008 from $429.1 million in 2007, an 18% increase, while the contribution margin increased 2 points, to 66% from 64%. The year-over-year contribution margin improved primarily due to our stronger revenue performance coupled with the operating leverage inherent in our Research business, along with tight expense management. Contract value was $834.3 million as of December 31, 2008, up 11% from $752.5 million at December 31, 2007. Adjusted for the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, contract value was up approximately 8%. At December 31, 2008, our research client retention rate remained strong at 82%, the same rate as of December 31, 2007. Wallet retention was 98% at December 31, 2008, down from 101% at December 31, 2007. Our Executive Program membership was 3,733 at December 31, 2008, compared to 3,753 members at December 31, 2007. Consulting Consulting revenues were $347.4 million and $325.0 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively, an increase of $22.4 million, or 7%. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenues for 2008 were up about 6%. The revenue increase was due to strength in both the core Consulting and benchmarking businesses and exceptionally strong results in our contract optimization business. Contributing to the year-over-year revenue increase in our contract optimization business was the completion of one large contract in the fourth quarter of 2008 which resulted in approximately $11.0 million of revenue. Consulting gross contribution of $141.4 million for 2008 increased 10% from the $128.2 million for 2007, while the contribution margin for 2008 increased 2 points, to 41% from 39% in the prior year. The increase in gross contribution and the gross contribution margin was driven by improved utilization on higher headcount and higher billing rates, and higher revenues in our contract optimization business, which has a higher margin than our core Consulting business. Our consultant utilization rates were 72% and 69% for 2008 and 2007, respectively, while the $366 hourly billing rate was up about 3% year-over-year. Our billable headcount was 499 at December 31, 2008 compared to 472 at December 31, 2007. Our average annualized revenue per billable headcount was approximately $458,000 for 2008, about 7% higher than the prior year. These strong metrics reflect improved engagement management and the continuation of our focus on larger and more profitable engagements. Consulting backlog, which represents future revenues to be recognized from in-process consulting, measurement and SAS, was $97.2 million at December 31, 2008, compared to $121.4 million at December 31, 2007, as bookings slowed in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the weaker economic environment. While we ended 2008 with 499 billable consultants, the reduction in force action we took in January 2009 reduced this number by approximately 30 consultants. This action was taken in order to better align our delivery resources with the lower backlog as we move into 2009. Events Events revenues decreased 6% year-over-year, or $10.0 million, to $150.1 million in 2008 compared to $160.1 million in 2007, reflecting lower revenues from both attendees and exhibitors. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, events revenues were down approximately 7% year-over-year. We held 70 events in 2008 compared to 62 events in 2007, with overall attendance down about 6%, to 41,352 in 2008 from 44,216 in 2007. The 70 events held in 2008 included 59 on-going events and 11 new events. During 2008, the number of exhibitors at our on-going events declined by approximately 13%, while attendance was 38,961 as compared to 42,554 attendees in 2007, an 8% decrease. Pricing at these on-going events declined slightly for attendees but increased slightly for exhibitors. Revenues from the 11 new events we held in 2008 was only slightly higher than the events we discontinued. The majority of the year-over-year revenue shortfall occurred in our fourth quarter, as travel restrictions, cuts in marketing budgets, and other expense controls at many companies took effect in response to the credit crisis and weakening global economy. 23 Table of Contents Events gross contribution was $65.0 million in 2008 compared to $81.9 million for 2007, while the year-over-year gross contribution margin declined by 8 points, to 43% from 51%. The decrease in gross contribution margin was primarily due to lower revenues, higher fulfillment costs, the impact of lower margin new events, and severance charges related to our reduction in force. As a result of the travel restrictions and other budget cuts at many companies and the weakening economy, we have reduced the number of events planned in 2009 to 54, which reflects the discontinuance of 18 events, including our two Spring Symposia, as well as the launch of only two smaller, new events. The 18 discontinued events had approximately $21.0 million of revenue in 2008. 2007 SEGMENT RESULTS Research Revenue in our Research business increased $102.1 million or 18% in 2007, to $673.3 million compared to $571.2 million for 2006. We had year-over-year growth across our entire product portfolio and in all of our geographic regions. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency, revenue was up about 15% year-over-year. Research gross contribution increased to $429.1 million in 2007, from $345.5 million in 2006, a 24% increase, while the contribution margin increased 4 points, to 64% from 60%. The contribution margin improved primarily due to our stronger revenue performance. Contract value was $752.5 million at December 31, 2007, up 18% from $640.3 million at December 31, 2006. The year-over-year increase was driven by increases in both core research and Executive Programs, and reflects the success of our new role-based product offerings. We had contract value growth across all of our major geographic regions and client industry segments. Adjusted for the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, contract value was up about 14% year-over-year. At December 31, 2007, our research client retention rate remained strong at 82%, up from 81% at December 31, 2006. Wallet retention was 101% at December 31, 2007, up from 96% at December 31, 2006, reflecting higher spending at retained clients. Our Executive Program membership was 3,753 at December 31, 2007, which is up about 3% over the prior year-end. Consulting Consulting revenues were $325.0 million in 2007, compared to $305.2 million in 2006, an increase of 6%, or $19.8 million, despite a decline in billable headcount. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenues were up 3% year-over-year. The increased revenue was driven by substantial improvement in our contract optimization business as well as higher utilization and billing rates in our core consulting business. Our contract optimization business was weak in the fourth quarter of 2006 due to changes in sales incentives, which we rectified in 2007. Billable headcount was 472 at December 31, 2007 compared to 518 at December 31, 2006, a 9% decrease. The reduced billable headcount primarily reflects our decision to exit our consulting business in Asia. Consulting gross contribution of $128.2 million in 2007 increased 6% from $120.7 million in 2006, while contribution margin decreased 1 point, to 39% in 2007 from 40% in the prior year. The decrease in gross contribution margin year-over-year was driven by lower SAS revenue performance and additional investment in senior level consultants. The consultant utilization rate was 69% and 64% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The billing rate remained above $350 per hour for both 2007 and 2006. Our average annualized revenue per billable headcount was up about 5%, to approximately $430,000 in 2007 from $410,000 in 2006. Consulting backlog, which represents future revenues to be recognized from in-process consulting, measurement and SAS, increased 11%, to $121.4 million at December 31, 2007 from $109.6 million at December 31, 2006. Events Events revenues for 2007 increased 9%, or $13.7 million, to $160.1 million compared to $146.4 million in 2006. Adjusted for the favorable impact of foreign exchange, revenues were up approximately 5%. We held 62 events in 2007 and 58 in 2006. The increased revenue was primarily due to the addition of 10 new events in 2007 and an increase in both attendee volume and ticket prices. Attendance at events was 44,216 in 2007, about an 8% increase over 2006. Gross contribution was $81.9 million in 2007 compared to $75.4 million in 2006, a 9% increase, while gross contribution margin was 51% in both 2007 and 2006. 24 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We finance our operations primarily through cash generated from our on-going operating activities. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we had cash from operating activities of $184.4 million, approximately 24% higher than the $148.3 million realized in 2007. During 2008, we used $200.8 million of our cash to repurchase our common shares. As of December 31, 2008, we had $140.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $178.3 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility (not including a $100.0 million expansion feature). We believe that the cash we expect to earn from our on-going operating activities, our existing cash balances, and the borrowing capacity we have under our five-year revolving credit facility will be sufficient for our expected short-term and foreseeable long-term operating needs. The following sections discuss the Company changes in cash and cash equivalents for the three years ending December 31, 2008: 2008 Cash provided by operating activities totaled $184.4 million for the year December 31, 2008, compared to cash provided of $148.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, a $36.1 million, or 24% increase. The increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to substantially increased cash from our core operations and improvement in our working capital, which together added approximately $45.0 million in higher operating cash flow. Our working capital improved primarily due to improved collection of receivables. Also contributing to the improved cash flow was $12.0 million in lower cash payments related to severance, excess facilities, and settlement of litigation, and about $2.0 million less in interest paid on our debt as interest rates declined. The improved operating cash flow in 2008 was somewhat offset by higher cash payments for taxes and bonuses of approximately $23.0 million. Cash used in investing activities was $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to cash used of $24.1 million in 2007. We had capital expenditures of $24.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2008, which was offset by net cash proceeds from the sale of our Vision Events business of approximately $7.8 million. We had capital expenditures of $24.2 million in 2007. Cash used in financing activities totaled $119.8 million in 2008 compared to cash used of $93.7 million in 2007, an increase in cash used of $26.1 million. The increased use of cash was primarily due to a significantly higher use of cash for stock repurchases in 2008. We used an additional $34.0 million of cash to repurchase our shares in 2008, to $200.8 million in 2008 compared to $166.8 million in 2007. Partially offsetting the additional use of cash used for stock repurchases was an increase of $10.2 million in cash proceeds from stock issued for stock plans, which rose to $44.7 million in 2008 compared to $34.5 million in 2007, driven by higher option exercises. Our cash and cash equivalents was $140.9 million as of December 31, 2008, compared to $109.9 million at December 31, 2007. The effect of exchange rate changes decreased cash and cash equivalents by approximately $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world, with 55% held outside the U.S. as of December 31, 2008. 2007 Cash provided by operating activities totaled $148.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to cash provided of $106.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $42.1 million, or 40%. The increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash from our core operations of approximately $39.0 million, lower cash payments for taxes of about $21.0 million, and to a lesser extent, lower cash payments for severance and other items of $5.0 million. Offsetting these improvements was a payment of $9.5 million related to a legal settlement and higher cash payments for interest on our outstanding debt of about $8.0 million, and a higher reduction from excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $5.6 million. Cash used in investing activities was $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $21.8 million in 2006. The increase was due to a year-over-year increase in capital expenditures, which increased to $24.2 million in 2007 from $21.1 million in 2006. 25 Table of Contents Cash used in financing activities increased slightly, to $93.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $91.5 million in 2006. On a net basis, we borrowed $24.0 million in 2007 compared to $123.0 million in 2006, a decrease of $99.0 million year-over-year. We decreased our use of cash to repurchase shares by $103.9 million, as we repurchased $166.8 million of our common stock in 2007 compared to $270.7 million in 2006. We received proceeds from stock issued under stock plans of $34.5 million in 2007, compared to $46.7 million in 2006, a decrease of $12.2 million. Excess tax benefits from stock compensation increased approximately $5.6 million, to $14.8 million in 2007 compared to $9.2 million in 2006. At December 31, 2007, cash and cash equivalents totaled $109.9 million. The effect of exchange rates increased cash and cash equivalents by about $11.6 million during 2007. OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS At December 31, 2008, we had $416.3 million outstanding under our Credit Agreement, which provides for two amortizing term loans and a $300.0 million revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility may be increased up to an additional $100.0 million at our lenders discretion (the expansion feature ), for a total revolving credit facility of $400.0 million. However, the $100.0 million expansion feature may or may not be available to us depending upon prevailing credit market conditions. The term loans are being repaid in consecutive quarterly installments plus a final payment due on January 31, 2012, and may be prepaid at any time without penalty or premium at our option. The revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until January 31, 2012, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. See Note 6 Debt in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Company Credit Agreement. The following table represents our contractual cash commitments due after December 31, 2008 (in thousands): Less Than 1-3 4-5 More Than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Operating leases (1) $ 136,484 $ 30,980 $ 43,448 $ 18,628 $ 43,428 Debt outstanding (2), (3) 416,250 57,750 207,750 150,750 Deferred compensation arrangement (4) 16,537 1,469 3,164 2,766 9,138 FASB Interpretation No. 48 tax liability (5) 2,306 2,306 Totals $ 571,577 $ 92,505 $ 254,362 $ 172,144 $ 52,566 (1) The Company leases various facilities, furniture, and computer equipment expiring between 2009 and 2025.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations ( SFAS No. 141R ), which replaces FASB Statement No. 141. SFAS No. 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any non controlling interest in the acquiree, and the goodwill acquired in a business combination. The Statement requires that adjustments to tax benefits related to the acquiree that are recorded subsequent to the acquisition date will be recognized in income, rather than as an adjustment of goodwill under the current rules. The Statement also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141R is effective as of the beginning of an entity fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2008, which for Gartner is the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $8.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowances related to our acquisition of META. While the possibility exists that some portion of these items may reverse in future periods, we believe the impact to our provision and results of operations would not be significant. Accordingly, we do not believe the adoption of the standard will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statement amendments of ARB No. 51 ( SFAS No. 160 ). SFAS No. 160 requires the accounting and reporting of minority interests as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. The statement also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS No. 160 applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements, except not-for-profit organizations, but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary. The statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2008, which will be the Company fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009. The Company does not believe the adoption of the standard will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 27 Table of Contents
