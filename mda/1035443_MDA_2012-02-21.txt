ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties regarding events, conditions, and financial trends that may affect our future plans of operation, business strategy, results of operations, and financial position. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those included within or contemplated by such forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, those described under Item 1. Business in this annual report on Form 10-K. We do not undertake any responsibility to update any of these factors or to announce publicly any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained in this or any other document, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Overview We are a Maryland corporation formed in October 1994 that has elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. We are the largest owner and preeminent REIT focused principally on science-driven cluster development through the ownership, operation, management, selective acquisition, development, and redevelopment of properties containing life science laboratory space. We are the leading provider of high-quality, environmentally sustainable real estate, technical infrastructure, and services to the broad and diverse life science industry. Client tenants include institutional (universities and independent non-profit institutions), pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device, product, and service entities and government agencies. Our primary business objective is to maximize stockholder value by providing our stockholders with the greatest possible total return based on a multifaceted platform of internal and external growth. Our operating platform is based on the principle of clustering, with assets and operations located adjacent to life science entities driving growth and technological advances within each cluster. The following table presents certain information regarding our asset base: December 31, Rentable square feet 2011 2010 2009 Operating properties 13,567,997 12,429,758 11,173,738 Development properties 818,020 475,818 980,000 Redevelopment properties 919,857 755,463 575,152 Total rentable square feet 15,305,874 13,661,039 12,728,890 Number of properties 173 167 163 Occupancy of operating properties 94.9% 94.3% 94.1% Occupancy of operating and redevelopment properties 88.5% 88.9% 89.4% Annualized base rent per leased rentable square foot $34.39 $33.95 $30.81 Our average occupancy rate of operating and redevelopment properties as of December 31 of each year from 1998 to 2011, was approximately 89.2%. Our average occupancy rate of operating properties as of December 31 of each year from 1998 to 2011, was approximately 95.2%. Results Balance sheet Over the past several years, we successfully completed important steps in order to enhance our ability to access the debt capital markets on favorable terms, including (1) retiring certain debt, (2) amending our unsecured line of credit and unsecured bank term loans to increase the amount available and extend the maturity dates, (3) deleveraging our balance sheet, (4) generating significant cash flows from the completion and occupancy of key development and redevelopment projects from our non-income producing assets, and (4) reducing outstanding debt with the sale of land parcels in Mission Bay, San Francisco, California, for $278 million. We have also strived to maintain and improve the key strengths of our balance sheet and business, which include, among others, balance sheet liquidity, diverse and creditworthy tenant base, well located properties proximate to leading research institutions, favorable lease terms, stable occupancy and cash flows, and demonstrated life science and real estate expertise. 46 Table of Contents In January 2011, we completed the amendment of our unsecured line of credit, which increased the amount available for borrowing to $1.5 billion from $1.15 billion and extended the maturity date to January 2015, assuming we exercise our sole right to extend the maturity date. In June 2011, we completed a $750 million unsecured bank term loan (the 2016 Unsecured Bank Term Loan ) with a maturity date of June 2016. In December 2011, we completed a $600 million 2017 Unsecured Bank Term Loan with a maturity date of January 2017. The proceeds of the two unsecured bank term loans were initially used to repay outstanding borrowings under our unsecured line of credit and reduce outstanding borrowings on our existing 2012 Unsecured Bank Term Loan from $750 million to $250 million. These financings increased our liquidity significantly to approximately $1.2 billion (availability under our unsecured line of credit and cash on hand as of December 31, 2011). We believe the quality of our asset base, our unique and stable operating model, and our balance sheet are attractive to lenders and debt and equity investors and should allow us access to multiple sources of capital. Receipt of our investment grade ratings was a significant milestone for the Company. We believe our balance sheet with lower leverage and access to the unsecured bond market will provide long-term value to our stockholders. We expect to transition our balance sheet debt from short-term and medium-term bank debt to long-term unsecured fixed rate debt over the next several years. However, some bank debt will remain a component of our long-term capital structure, primarily consisting of an unsecured line of credit for liquidity and flexibility, and when appropriate unsecured bank term loans. The transition from unhedged variable rate bank debt to longer-term fixed rate unsecured bonds is expected to significantly increase our interest costs. The increase in interest costs in the near to medium-term as we transition bank debt to unsecured bonds will be offset by the long-term benefits of longer dated debt maturities, less LIBOR based variable interest rate risk and access to more sources of capital. While this transition from unhedged variable rate bank debt is in process, we expect to utilize interest rate swap agreements to reduce our interest rate risk. In December 2011, we executed interest rate swap agreements that reduced our unhedged variable rate debt exposure from 51% as of September 30, 2011, to 21% as of December 31, 2011. We expect to keep our unhedged variable rate debt at 20% or less of our total outstanding debt. The transition of unhedged variable rate bank debt to longer-term fixed rate unsecured bonds is not expected to impact the highly effective designation of the existing interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2011. Our forecasts assume outstanding unhedged variable rate debt in an amount at least equal to our effective notional amount in effect at any point in time. Additionally, our outstanding unsecured debt can be prepaid at any time without penalty. Secured mortgage notes payable will remain part of our capital structure however we do not anticipate our secured notes payable to become a significant percentage of total debt outstanding. We believe perpetual preferred stock should be a component of our long-term capital structure. However, we also believe that our dividend rate of 8.375% on our Series C Preferred Stock can ultimately be refinanced with lower cost long-term fixed rate debt or another series of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2011, we had three assets held for sale and may also identify additional assets for potential sale in 2012 and thereafter. We expect to initially use the net proceeds from asset sales to reduce outstanding borrowings under our unsecured line of credit and then re-borrow funds for investment primarily into urban or central business district assets. As of December 31, 2011, approximately 24% of our gross real estate represents non-income producing assets (land, preconstruction, development, redevelopment, projects in India and China, and investment in unconsolidated real estate entity). Our active development and redevelopment projects represent 7% of our gross investments in real estate, a significant amount of which is pre-leased and expected to be delivered over the next four to eight quarters. The completion and delivery of these projects will significantly reduce our non-income producing assets as a percentage of gross investments in real estate. Over the next few years, we may also identify certain land parcels for potential sale. Over time, our goal is to reduce non-income producing assets to 15% or less of our gross investments in real estate. Core operations Our primary business objective is to maximize stockholder value by providing our stockholders with the greatest possible total return based on a multifaceted platform of internal and external growth. The key elements to our strategy include our consistent focus on high-quality assets and operations in the top life science cluster locations with our properties located adjacent to life science entities driving growth and technological advances within each cluster. These adjacency locations are characterized by high barriers to entry and exit and limited supply of available space, and represent highly desirable locations for tenancy by life science entities. Our strategy also includes drawing upon our deep and broad life science and real estate relationships in order to attract new and leading life science client tenants and value-added real estate. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we completed the highest amount of rentable square feet leased in one year in the history of our Company. 47 Table of Contents Our leasing activity for the year ended December 31, 2011 consisted of the following: Rental Rate Change (1) Leasing Activity Rentable Square Feet Cash GAAP New or renewal of previously leased space 1,821,866 (1.9%) 4.2% Development/redevelopment space leased 993,655 Previously vacant space leased 591,955 Total leasing activity 3,407,476 (1) Represents the percentage change of the expiring rental rates compared to the new or renewal rental rates of previously leased space for the year ended December 31, 2011 As of December 31, 2011, we had six ground-up development projects in process aggregating approximately 818,020 rentable square feet. We also had eleven projects undergoing conversion into laboratory space through redevelopment aggregating approximately 919,857 rentable square feet. These projects along with recently delivered projects, certain future projects, and contribution from same properties are expected to contribute significant increases in rental income, net operating income and cash flows. Net operating income is projected to increase significantly quarter to quarter from $101.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2011, to $111 million to $113 million for the three months ended December 31, 2012, primarily related to the completion and delivery of current and future development and redevelopment projects, a significant amount of which is pre-leased. Value-added opportunities and external growth During 2011, we initiated four ground-up development project aggregating approximately 594,000 rentable square feet. These projects were 55% leased upon commencement of vertical construction. We expect to commence future ground-up development projects generally only with significant pre-leasing. As of December 31, 2011, our ground-up development projects were 86% leased, excluding approximately 219,007 rentable square feet of an acquired partially completed ground-up development project. The following table presents our key value-added projects started during the year ended December 31, 2011 (dollars in thousands): Total As of December 31, 2011 Estimated Total Stabilized Yield Development/ Start Redevelopment CIP RSF Negotiated/ Cost at Key development starts Date RSF Leased Committed Completion Cash GAAP 4755 Nexus Center Drive 3/2011 45,255 100% % $ 22,341 7.0% 7.7% 409/499 Illinois Street 4/2011 219,007 % % $ 148,100 6.7% 7.4% 225 Binney Street 10/2011 303,143 100% % $ 162,550 7.5% 8.1% Canada 10/2011 26,426 100% % $ 9,121 7.5% 8.1% Key redevelopment starts 1551 Eastlake Avenue (1) 10/2011 117,483 13% 20% $ 64,010 7.0% 7.4% 400 Technology Square 10/2011 212,123 39% % $ 139,550 8.1% 9.1% (1) The total development/redevelopment RSF, estimated total cost at completion, and stabilized yield information relates to the entire project. As of December 31, 2011, the development of approximately 58,304 rentable square feet of the entire 117,483 rentable square feet was complete and the rentable square feet was in service. 48 Table of Contents Key development and redevelopment projects completed in 2011 are as follows: Key development projects Completion RSF Delivered Total Development/ Redevelopment Occupancy as of Investment Stabilized Yield (1) completed in 2011 Date In 2011 RSF (1) 12/31/11 (2) at Completion (1) Cash GAAP 455 Mission Bay Boulevard 12/2011 58,804 210,000 92.4% $ 109,950 8.5% 8.4% 7 Triangle Drive 8/2011 96,626 96,626 100% $ 32,511 8.5% 9.8% 400/450 East Jamie Court 9/2011 62,548 163,307 100% $ 108,490 4.2% 4.3% Key redevelopment projects completed in 2011 10300 Campus Point Drive 11/2011 89,576 279,138 100% $ 131,600 7.6% 7.7% 500 Arsenal Street 9/2011 48,516 48,516 100% $ 24,348 6.9% 7.4% (1) Represents rentable square feet, investment at completion, and Stabilized Yield of the entire development or redevelopment project. Portions of certain projects may still be under construction. (2) Represents occupancy related to operating rentable square feet. At the beginning of 2011, we anticipated only a small number of acquisition opportunities due to our focus on the completion and lease-up of our development and redevelopment projects. However, in April 2011, we completed the acquisition of a partially completed 453,256 rentable square foot waterfront development project located in Mission Bay, San Francisco, California. The completed portion of the property was 97% leased at the time of acquisition and the purchase price was approximately $293 million. This property acquisition provided us 219,007 rentable square feet of immediately available laboratory shell space, allowing us to provide space quickly to prospective tenants upon completion of fit up improvements. Additionally, we continue to have a dominant ownership position in the commercial laboratory space for lease in this top life science cluster market. Due to the current low interest rate environment and the competitive interest in quality real estate, we expect buyer demand for acquisition opportunities to be strong and for this demand to put upward pressure on pricing. Thus, we expect to continue to be selective in acquisition opportunities in 2012. As of December 31, 2011, approximately 95% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes and insurance, common area, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Additionally, approximately 92% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) provided for the recapture of certain capital expenditures, and approximately 94% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed or indexed based on the consumer price index or another index. Critical accounting policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. We base these estimates, judgments, and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by our stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts, and lenders in their evaluation of our performance. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. REIT compliance We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations and financial results, and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. We believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to qualify, and continue to qualify, as a REIT. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a REIT, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify. 49 Table of Contents If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. If we lose our REIT status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to our stockholders will be significantly reduced for each of the years involved and we will no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. Rental properties, net, land held for future development, and construction in progress We recognize assets acquired (including the intangible value of above or below market leases, acquired in-place leases, tenant relationships, and other intangible assets or liabilities), liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in an acquired entity at their fair value as of the acquisition date. The value of tangible assets acquired is based upon our estimation of value on an as if vacant basis. The value of acquired in-place leases includes the estimated carrying costs during the hypothetical lease-up period and other costs that would have been incurred to execute similar leases, considering market conditions at the acquisition date of the acquired in-place lease. We assess the fair value of tangible and intangible assets based on numerous factors, including estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors, including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property. We also recognize the fair values of assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in acquisitions of less than a 100% interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity. In addition, acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs are expensed as incurred. The values allocated to land improvements, buildings, building improvements, tenant improvements, and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis using an estimated life of 20 years for land improvements, the shorter of the term of the respective ground lease or up to 40 years for buildings and building improvements, the respective lease term for tenant improvements, and the estimated useful life for equipment. The values of acquired above and below market leases are amortized over the lives of the related leases and recorded as either an increase (for below market leases) or a decrease (for above market leases) to rental income. The values of acquired above and below market leases are included in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and tenant security deposits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and amortized over the remaining terms of the related leases. Discontinued operations A property is classified as held for sale when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met: (1) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the property; (2) the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary; (3) an active program to locate a buyer, and other actions required to complete the plan to sell, have been initiated; (4) the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be completed within one year; (5) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and (6) actions necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. When all of these criteria have been met, the property is classified as held for sale, its operations, including any interest expense directly attributable to it, are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income, and amounts for all prior periods presented are reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations. Depreciation of assets ceases upon designation of a property as held for sale. Impairment of long-lived assets Long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, land held for future development, construction in progress, and intangibles are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist that may indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset to be held and used is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment indicators for long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, land held for future development, and construction in progress are assessed by project and include, but are not limited to, significant fluctuations in estimated net operating income, occupancy changes, construction costs, estimated completion dates, rental rates, and other market factors. We assess the expected undiscounted cash flows based upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, construction costs, available market information, historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property and our assumptions about the use of the asset, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration. Upon determination that an impairment has occurred, a write-down is recorded to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value. 50 Table of Contents We use a held for sale impairment model for our properties classified as held for sale. The held for sale impairment model is different from the held and used impairment model; under the held for sale impairment model, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the long-lived asset classified as held for sale exceeds its fair value less cost to sell. Because of these two different models, it is possible for a long-lived asset previously classified as held and used to trigger the recognition of an impairment charge upon classification as held for sale. Capitalization of costs We are required to capitalize direct construction and development costs, including predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the acquisition, development, redevelopment, or construction of a project. Capitalization of construction, development, and redevelopment costs is required while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use. Fluctuations in our development, redevelopment, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total expenses and net income. For example, had we experienced a 10% reduction in construction, development and redevelopment, activities, without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, including interest and payroll, total expenses would have increased by approximately $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred. Should development, redevelopment, or construction activity cease, interest, property taxes, insurance, and certain other costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization and would be expensed as incurred. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance and demolition are expensed as incurred. We also capitalize costs directly related and essential to our leasing activities. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Costs related to unsuccessful leasing opportunities are expensed as incurred. Predevelopment and acquisition costs related to abandoned projects are expensed as incurred. These amounts aggregated approximately $1.0 million and $136,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. There were no predevelopment and acquisition costs related to abandoned projects for the year ended December 31, 2009. Accounting for investments We hold equity investments in certain publicly traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science industry. All of our investments in publicly traded companies are considered available for sale and are recorded at fair value. Fair value has been determined based upon the closing price as of each balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and losses shown as a separate component of total equity. The classification of each investment is determined at the time each investment is made, and such determination is reevaluated at each balance sheet date. The cost of each investment sold is determined by the specific identification method, with net realized gains included in other income. Investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under the cost method when our interest in the entity is so minor that we have virtually no influence over the entities operating and financial policies. Certain investments in privately held entities are accounted for under the equity method when our interest in the entity is not deemed so minor that we have virtually no influence over the entities operating and financial policies. Under the equity method of accounting, we record our investment initially at cost and adjust the carrying amount of the investment to recognize our share of the earnings or losses of the investee subsequent to the date of our investment. Additionally, we limit our ownership percentage in the voting stock of each individual entity to less than 10%. Individual investments are evaluated for impairment when changes in conditions exist that may indicate an impairment exists. The factors that we consider in making these assessments include, but are not limited to, market prices, market conditions, available financing, prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives, and new collaborative agreements. If there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that would have an adverse effect on our cost method investments, we do not estimate its fair value. For all of our investments, if a decline in the fair value of an investment below the carrying value is determined to be other-than-temporary, such investment is written down to its estimated fair value with a non-cash charge to current earnings. We use significant other observable inputs and significant unobservable inputs to determine the fair value of privately held entities. 51 Table of Contents Interest rate hedge agreements We are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions. We principally manage our exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of our core business activities. We manage economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our debt funding and the use of interest rate hedge agreements. Specifically, we enter into interest rate hedge agreements to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. Our interest rate hedge agreements are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of our known or expected cash payments principally related to our borrowings based on LIBOR. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently all of our derivatives are designated as hedges. Our objectives in using interest rate hedge agreements are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements in accordance with our interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed rate payments over the life of the interest rate swap agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted, representing an overhaul of the framework for regulation of U.S. financial markets. The Dodd-Frank Act calls for various regulatory agencies, including the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to establish regulations for implementation of many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, and we anticipate that these new regulations will provide additional clarity regarding the extent of the impact of this legislation on us. We expect to be able to continue to use interest rate hedge agreements, including interest rate swap agreements, to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates. However, the costs of doing so may increase as a result of the new legislation. We may also incur additional costs associated with our compliance with the new regulations and anticipated additional reporting and disclosure obligations. Although we are not able to assess the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act until all the implementing regulations have been adopted, based on the information available to us at this time, we do not believe provisions of the regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We record our interest rate hedge agreements on the consolidated balance sheets at their estimated fair values with an offsetting adjustment reflected as unrealized gains/losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. The accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument, based up on the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Our interest rate swap agreements are considered cash flow hedges as they are designated and qualify as hedges of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. All of our interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed highly effective in reducing our exposure to variable interest rates. We formally document all relationships between interest rate hedge agreements and hedged items, including the method for evaluating effectiveness and the risk strategy. We make an assessment at the inception of each interest rate hedge agreement and on an ongoing basis to determine whether these instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows associated with the hedged items. The ineffective portion of each interest rate hedge agreement is immediately recognized in earnings. While we intend to continue to meet the conditions for such hedge accounting, if hedges did not qualify as highly effective, the changes in the fair values of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analyses on the expected cash flows of each derivative. These analyses reflect the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and use observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities (also referred to as significant other observable inputs ). The fair values of our interest rate swap agreements are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The fair value calculation also includes an amount for risk of non-performance using significant unobservable inputs such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default, which we have determined to be insignificant to the overall fair value of our interest rate swap agreements. In adjusting the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements for the effect of non-performance risk, we have considered any applicable credit enhancements such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees. These methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never be realized. 52 Table of Contents Recognition of rental income and tenant recoveries Rental income from leases with scheduled rent increases, free rent, incentives, and other rent adjustments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms. We include amounts currently recognized as income, and expected to be received in later years, in deferred rent receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts received currently, but recognized as income in future years, are included in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and tenant security deposits in our consolidated balance sheets. We commence recognition of rental income at the date the property is ready for its intended use and the tenant takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property. Tenant recoveries related to reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable expenses are incurred. We maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our tenants to make payments required under the terms of the lease and for tenant recoveries due. If a tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of unpaid rent and unrealized deferred rent. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had no allowance for estimated losses. Impact of recently issued accounting standards In July 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) and the International Accounting Standards Board ( IASB ) (collectively the Boards ) reissued a joint proposal for a new standard for lease accounting by both lessors and lessees, which was first issued in August 2010. The lease accounting proposal is anticipated to result in differences from existing GAAP. Leases would no longer be classified as operating or capital leases and all leases would be recorded on balance sheets using a financing model, except for leases with terms of one year or less. Lessees would no longer recognize lease expense on a straight-line basis, and rent expense might be higher in earlier periods of the lease term. Reassessment of key considerations such as lease term or residual value guarantees would be required throughout the life of a lease. The Boards have tentatively decided that lessors should apply a single approach to all leases and recognize a lease receivable and a residual asset for each lease, except for leases of one year or less or leases of investment property carried at fair value. Certain lessors would be excluded from this accounting, including lessors meeting the definition of an investment property entity or investment company and would recognize investment properties at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of income. No date has yet been proposed for the issuance of a final standard, and the effective date has not yet been determined. We anticipate that the adoption of the final standard may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2011, the FASB proposed a new standard for entities that invest primarily in real estate properties and meet other criteria. An entity that qualifies as an IPE would measure real estate investment property at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in net income. The proposed definition of an IPE requires meeting specific criteria, including (1) substantially all of the entity business activities are investing in real estate properties, (2) the express business purpose of the entity is to invest in real estate properties for total return, including capital appreciation, (3) ownership of the entity is represented by units of investment, in the form of equity or partnership interests, to which a portion of net assets are attributed, (4) there must be significant pooling of funds of investors unrelated to the IPE parent, if a parent exists, and (5) the entity must provide financial results about activities to investors. The proposed definition of an IPE will likely evolve during the review of the proposed standard and therefore it is unclear today if the Company will qualify as an IPE. If we do not meet the definition of an IPE, we may be required to evaluate if we will be subject to investment company accounting rules. Investment companies are subject to fair value accounting and are expected to be excluded from the proposed lessor accounting in the paragraph above. The proposal requires IPEs to recognize rental revenue when received or when receivable pursuant to the contractual terms of the lease, thereby eliminating rental revenue recognition on a straight-line basis. IPEs will not follow the proposed lessor accounting in the paragraph above. The proposal requires an IPE to separately present on its financial statements (1) rental revenue from investment properties, (2) rental operating expenses from investment properties, (3) fair value of investment properties, and (4) debt related to investment properties. The FASB proposal, if adopted, would represent a significant change from our current accounting model. No date has yet been proposed for the issuance of a final standard, and the effective date has not yet been determined. We anticipate that the adoption of the final standard may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In May 2011, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) to substantially converge the guidance in GAAP and IFRS on fair value measurements and disclosures. The ASU changes several aspects of the fair value measurement guidance in FASB Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurement, including (1) the application of the concepts of highest and best use and valuation premise, (2) the introduction of an option to measure groups of offsetting assets and liabilities on a net basis, (3) the incorporation of certain premiums and discounts in fair value measurements, and (4) the measurement of the fair value of certain instruments classified in stockholders equity. In addition, the ASU includes several new fair value disclosure requirements, such as information about valuation techniques and unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements and a narrative description of Level 3 measurements sensitivity to changes in unobservable inputs. The ASU is effective for public companies during the interim and annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2011. We will adopt the ASU in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. We anticipate that the adoption of the ASU may affect valuation methodologies, however we do not expect the adoption of the final standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 53 Table of Contents In June 2011, the FASB issued an ASU to make presentation of items within other comprehensive income ( OCI ) more prominent. Entities are required to present items of net income, items of OCI, and total comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements. There no longer exists the option to present OCI in the statement of changes in stockholders equity. In December 2011, the FASB decided to defer the requirement that companies present reclassification adjustments for each component of accumulated other comprehensive income in both net income and OCI on the face of the financial statements. Reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) will be presented either on the face of the financial statement in which OCI is presented or disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. This deferral does not change the requirement to present items of net income, items of OCI, and total comprehensive income in either one continuous statement or two separate consecutive statements. The ASU is effective for public companies during the interim and annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2011. We will adopt the ASU in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. We anticipate the adoption of the ASU will not materially affect the presentation of our consolidated financial statements. 54 Table of Contents Results of operations The following table presents information regarding our asset base and value-added projects as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009: December 31, Rentable square feet 2011 2010 2009 Operating properties 13,567,997 12,429,758 11,173,738 Development properties 818,020 475,818 980,000 Redevelopment properties 919,857 755,463 575,152 Total rentable square feet 15,305,874 13,661,039 12,728,890 Number of properties 173 167 163 Occupancy operating 94.9% 94.3% 94.1% Occupancy operating and redevelopment 88.5% 88.9% 89.4% Annualized base rent per leased rentable square foot $ 34.39 $ 33.95 $ 30.81 As a result of changes within our total property portfolio, the financial data presented in the table on the following page shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period to period. In order to supplement an evaluation of our results of operations over a given period, we analyze the operating performance for all properties that were fully operating for the entire periods presented (herein referred to as Same Properties ) separate from properties acquired subsequent to the first period presented, properties undergoing active development and active redevelopment, and corporate entities (legal entities performing general and administrative functions), which are excluded from same property results (herein referred to as Non-Same Properties ). Additionally, rental revenues from lease termination fees, if any, are excluded from the results of the Same Properties. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, our Same Properties consisted of 127 operating properties aggregating approximately 9.5 million rentable square feet. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, our Same Properties consisted of 129 operating properties aggregating approximately 9.4 million rentable square feet. Net operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to income from continuing operations, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus loss on early extinguishment of debt, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and general and administrative expense. We believe net operating income provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe net operating income is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets. Further, we believe net operating income is a key performance indicator and is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, net operating income reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from income from continuing operations. Net operating income excludes certain components from income from continuing operations in order to provide results that are more closely related to our results of operations from our properties. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level rather than at the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. Net operating income presented by us may not be comparable to net operating income reported by other REITs that define net operating income differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, net operating income should be examined in conjunction with income from continuing operations as presented in our consolidated statements of income. Net operating income should not be considered as an alternative to income from continuing operations as an indication of our performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or our ability to make distributions. 55 Table of Contents Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2011, to the year ended December 31, 2010 The following table presents a comparison of the components of net operating income for our Same Properties and Non-Same Properties for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, and a reconciliation of net operating income to income from continuing operations, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 $ Change % Change Revenues: Rental Same Properties $ 293,831 $ 295,289 $ (1,458 ) % Rental Non-Same Properties 137,528 71,895 65,633 91 Total rental 431,359 367,184 64,175 17 Tenant recoveries Same Properties 101,605 95,362 6,243 7 Tenant recoveries Non-Same Properties 34,717 17,989 16,728 93 Total tenant recoveries 136,322 113,351 22,971 20 Other income Same Properties 43 338 (295 ) (87 ) Other income Non-Same Properties 5,719 4,875 844 17 Total other income 5,762 5,213 549 11 Total revenues Same Properties 395,479 390,989 4,490 1 Total revenues Non-Same Properties 177,964 94,759 83,205 88 Total revenues 573,443 485,748 87,695 18 Expenses: Rental operations Same Properties 113,748 107,481 6,267 6 Rental operations Non-Same Properties 54,879 24,700 30,179 122 Total rental operations 168,627 132,181 36,446 28 Net operating income Net operating income Same Properties 281,731 283,508 (1,777 ) (1 ) Net operating income Non-Same Properties 123,085 70,059 53,026 76 Total net operating income 404,816 353,567 51,249 14 Other expenses: General and administrative 41,163 34,383 6,780 20 Interest 63,407 69,509 (6,102 ) (9 ) Depreciation and amortization 157,526 126,033 31,493 25 Loss on early extinguishment of debt 6,485 45,168 (38,683 ) (86 ) Total other expenses 268,581 275,093 (6,512 ) (2 ) Income from continuing operations $ 136,235 $ 78,474 $ 57,761 74 % Rental revenues Total rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by $64.2 million, or 17%, to $431.4 million, compared to $367.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was due to rental revenues from our Non-Same Properties, including six ground-up development projects that were completed and delivered after January 1, 2010, and nine operating properties that were acquired subsequent to January 1, 2010. Our Same Properties rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011, decreased by $1.5 million, to $293.8 million, compared to $295.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to a slight decrease in occupancy within our Same Properties portfolio, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. 56 Table of Contents Tenant recoveries Total tenant recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by $23.0 million, or 20%, to $136.3 million, compared to $113.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Approximately $16.7 million of the increase was from increases in tenant recoveries from our Non-Same Properties, including six ground-up development projects that were completed and delivered after January 1, 2010, and nine operating properties that were acquired subsequent to January 1, 2010. The remaining $6.2 million increase was from an increase in tenant recoveries from our Same Properties. The increase in tenant recoveries at our Same Properties was primarily attributable to increases in rental operating expenses for our Same Properties of $6.3 million, the majority of which was recoverable from our tenants. As of December 31, 2011, approximately 95% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Other income Other income for the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 of $5.8 million and $5.2 million, respectively, represents construction management fees, interest, investment income, and storage income. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2011 remained consistent with other income for the year ended December 31, 2010 at approximately 1% of total revenues. Rental operating expenses Total rental operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by $36.4 million, or 28%, to $168.6 million, compared to $132.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Approximately $30.2 million of the increase was from an increase in rental operating expenses from our Non-Same Properties, including six ground-up development projects that were completed and delivered after January 1, 2010, and nine operating properties that were acquired subsequent to January 1, 2010. The remaining $6.3 million increase was from increases in rental operating expenses from our Same Properties. The increase in rental operating expenses at our Same Properties was primarily attributable to an increase in property taxes, utilities, and common area repair and maintenance expenses. The majority of the increase in total rental operating expenses was recoverable from tenants through tenant recoveries. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by $6.8 million, or 20%, to $41.2 million, compared to $34.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in payroll and related taxes and insurance related to an increased employee head count for the year ended December 31, 2011. In addition, we recognized approximately $1.0 million in predevelopment and acquisition costs related to abandoned projects for the year ended December 31, 2011. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses remained consistent for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, at approximately 7% of total revenues. 57 Table of Contents Interest expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011, decreased by $6.1 million, or 9%, to $63.4 million compared to $69.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, detailed as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Interest expense 2011 2010 Change Secured notes payable $ 46,260 $ 50,600 $ (4,340 ) Unsecured line of credit 21,583 9,928 11,655 Unsecured bank term loans 16,085 10,370 5,715 Interest rate hedge agreements 21,457 30,505 (9,048 ) Unsecured convertible notes 9,567 32,894 (23,327 ) Amortization of loan fees and other 9,511 8,047 1,464 Gross interest 124,463 142,344 (17,881 ) Capitalized interest (61,056 ) (72,835 ) 11,779 Interest expense $ 63,407 $ 69,509 $ (6,102 ) The decrease in interest expense of approximately $6.1 million was due to a decrease in interest on our secured notes payable, unsecured convertible notes, and interest rate hedge agreements, and was partially offset by increases in interest on our unsecured line of credit and unsecured bank term loans. Interest on our secured notes payable decreased primarily due to the repayments of seven secured notes payable approximating $55.7 million since December 31, 2010. The decrease in interest on our interest rate hedge agreements was primarily due to the net reduction of effective interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts aggregating $100 million from December 31, 2010 to December 30, 2011. Interest on unsecured convertible notes decreased due to the retirement of substantially all $240 million of our 8.00% unsecured senior convertible notes ( 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes ) during the year ended December 31, 2010, and repurchases of our 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes aggregating $217.1 million since December 31, 2010. The increase in interest on our unsecured line of credit and unsecured bank term loans was primarily attributable to an increase in the applicable margin on our unsecured line of credit and unsecured bank term loans, coupled with an increase in outstanding unsecured bank loans from $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2010, to $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2011. We have entered into certain interest rate hedge agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure primarily related to variable interest rates associated with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured bank term loans (see Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Obligations and Commitments Interest Rate Hedge Agreements ). The following table presents a comparison of the outstanding balances and applicable margins of the unsecured line of credit and unsecured bank term loans as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, detailed as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 Balance Outstanding Applicable Margin Balance Outstanding Applicable Margin Unsecured line of credit $ 370,000 2.30% $ 748,000 1.00% 2012 Unsecured Bank Term Loan 250,000 0.70% 750,000 1.00% 2016 Unsecured Bank Term Loan 750,000 1.65% 2017 Unsecured Bank Term Loan 600,000 1.50% $ 1,970,000 $ 1,498,000 Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by $31.5 million, or 25%, to $157.5 million, compared to $126.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase resulted primarily from depreciation associated with six ground-up development projects that were completed and delivered after January 1, 2010, and nine operating properties that were acquired subsequent to January 1, 2010. 58 Table of Contents Loss on early extinguishment of debt During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $6.5 million related to the repurchase, in privately negotiated transactions, of approximately $217.1 million principal amount of our 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes and the partial and early repayment of our 2012 Unsecured Bank Term Loan. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $45.2 million, composed of a loss of approximately $2.4 million recognized in December 2010 related to the repurchase, in privately negotiated transactions, of approximately $82.8 million of our 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes, and losses of approximately $41.5 million and $1.3 million recognized in June 2010 and July 2010, respectively, related to the retirement of substantially all $240 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes. (Loss) income from discontinued operations, net Loss from discontinued operations, net, of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, reflects the results of operations of three properties classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2011, and one property sold in 2011. Loss from discontinued operations, net included an impairment charge of approximately $1.0 million related to a 30,000 square foot property located in the suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. Income from discontinued operations, net, of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, reflects the results of operations of three properties classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2011, and the results of operations and gain related to the sale in 2010 of one operating property located in the Seattle market. In connection with the operating property sold during the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized a gain of approximately $24,000. In August 2011, we completed the sale of a land parcel in San Diego for an aggregate sales price of approximately $17.3 million at a gain of approximately $46,000. The sale of the land parcel did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations since the parcel did not have any significant operations prior to disposition. Pursuant to the presentation and disclosure literature on gains/losses on sales or disposals by REITs required by the SEC, gains or losses on sales or disposals by a REIT that do not qualify as discontinued operations are classified below income from discontinued operations in the income statement. Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2011, we classified the $46,000 gain on sale of land parcel below income from discontinued operations, net, in the consolidated income statements. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we completed sales of land parcels in Mission Bay, San Francisco, for an aggregate sales price of approximately $278 million at a gain of approximately $59.4 million. The land parcels we sold during the year ended December 31, 2010, did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations since the parcels did not have any significant operations prior to disposition. Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2010, we classified the $59.4 million gain on sales of land parcels below income from discontinued operations, net, in the consolidated income statements. 59 Table of Contents Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2010, to the year ended December 31, 2009 The following table presents a comparison of the components of net operating income for our Same Properties and Non-Same Properties for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, and a reconciliation of net operating income to income from continuing operations, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 $ Change % Change Revenues: Rental Same Properties $ 282,951 $ 282,890 $ 61 % Rental Non-Same Properties 84,233 83,841 392 Total rental 367,184 366,731 453 Tenant recoveries Same Properties 90,291 88,344 1,947 2 Tenant recoveries Non-Same Properties 23,060 14,624 8,436 58 Total tenant recoveries 113,351 102,968 10,383 10 Other income Same Properties 334 273 61 22 Other income Non-Same Properties 4,879 11,581 (6,702 ) (58 ) Total other income 5,213 11,854 (6,641 ) (56 ) Total revenues Same Properties 373,576 371,507 2,069 1 Total revenues Non-Same Properties 112,172 110,046 2,126 2 Total revenues 485,748 481,553 4,195 1 Expenses: Rental operations Same Properties 99,035 98,149 886 1 Rental operations Non-Same Properties 33,146 23,989 9,157 38 Total rental operations 132,181 122,138 10,043 8 Net operating income Net operating income Same Properties 274,541 273,358 1,183 Net operating income Non-Same Properties 79,026 86,057 (7,031 ) (8 ) Total net operating income 353,567 359,415 (5,848 ) (2 ) Other expenses: General and administrative 34,383 36,296 (1,913 ) (5 ) Interest 69,509 82,111 (12,602 ) (15 ) Depreciation and amortization 126,033 117,246 8,787 7 Loss (gain) on early extinguishment of debt 45,168 (11,254 ) 56,422 (501 ) Total other expenses 275,093 224,399 50,694 23 Income from continuing operations $ 78,474 $ 135,016 $ (56,542 ) (42 %) Rental revenues Total rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by $0.5 million, to $367.2 million, compared to $366.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Rental revenues from Non-Same Properties for the year ended December 31, 2009 included additional rental income aggregating $18.5 million related to a modification of a lease for a property in South San Francisco, California. Excluding the additional rental income, rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by $19.0 million, or 5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 which was primarily due to rental revenues from our Non-Same Properties, including three ground-up development projects that were completed and delivered after January 1, 2009, and seven operating properties that were acquired subsequent to January 1, 2009. 60 Table of Contents Tenant recoveries Total tenant recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by $10.4 million, or 10%, to $113.4 million, compared to $103.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Approximately $8.4 million of the increase was from increases in tenant recoveries from our Non-Same Properties, including three ground-up development projects that were completed and delivered after January 1, 2009, and seven operating properties that were acquired subsequent to January 1, 2009. The remaining $2.0 million increase was from an increase in tenant recoveries from our Same Properties. The increase in tenant recoveries at our Same Properties was primarily attributable to increases in rental operating expenses for our Same Properties of $0.9 million, the majority of which was recoverable from our tenants. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, approximately 96% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Other income Other income for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, of $5.2 million and $11.9 million, respectively, represents construction management fees, interest, investment income, and storage income. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2009, included a $7.2 million cash receipt related to real estate acquired in November 2007. Excluding the $7.2 million cash receipt, other income for the year ended December 31, 2010, remained consistent with other income for the year ended December 31, 2009, at approximately 1% of total revenues. Rental operating expenses Total rental operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by $10.0 million, or 8%, to $132.2 million, compared to $122.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Approximately $9.1 million of the increase was from an increase in rental operating expenses from our Non-Same Properties, including three ground-up development projects that were completed and delivered after January 1, 2009, and seven operating properties that were acquired subsequent to January 1, 2009. The remaining $0.9 million increase was from increases in rental operating expenses from our Same Properties. The increase in rental operating expenses at our Same Properties was primarily attributable to an increase in payroll, property taxes, and utilities. The majority of the increase in total rental operating expenses was recoverable from tenants through tenant recoveries. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses decreased by $1.9 million, or 5%, to $34.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $36.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in stock compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010, and the year ended December 31, 2009, remained consistent at approximately 7% to 8% of total revenues. 61 Table of Contents Interest expense Interest expense decreased by $12.6 million, or 15%, to $69.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $82.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, detailed as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Interest expense 2010 2009 Change Secured notes payable $ 50,600 $ 51,642 $ (1,042 ) Unsecured line of credit 9,928 10,211 (283 ) Unsecured bank term loans 10,370 11,279 (909 ) Interest rate hedge agreements 30,505 38,804 (8,299 ) Unsecured convertible notes 32,894 38,940 (6,046 ) Amortization of loan fees and other 8,047 8,119 (72 ) Gross interest 142,344 158,995 (16,651 ) Capitalized interest (72,835 ) (76,884 ) 4,049 Interest expense $ 69,509 $ 82,111 $ (12,602 ) The decrease in interest expense of approximately $12.6 million was due to a decrease in total indebtedness and a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our unsecured line of credit and unsecured bank term loan, including the impact of our interest rate hedge agreements, as well as the retirement of substantially all $240 million of our 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes during the year ended December 31, 2010. The weighted average interest rate on our unsecured line of credit and unsecured bank term loan, including the impact of our interest rate hedge agreements, decreased from approximately 4.1% as of December 31, 2009, to approximately 2.8% as of December 31, 2010. We have entered into certain interest rate hedge agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure primarily related to variable interest rates associated with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured bank term loans. Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization increased by $8.8 million, or 7%, to $126.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $117.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase resulted primarily from depreciation associated with the properties acquired, placed in service, or redeveloped during the periods after January 1, 2010, including the delivery and completion of a ground-up development of a 309,141 rentable square foot science park in New York City during the fourth quarter of 2010, the delivery and completion of a ground-up development of a 129,501 rentable square foot building in the San Francisco market in the third quarter of 2010, and the delivery and completion of a ground-up development of a 115,084 rentable square foot building in the Seattle market in the first quarter of 2010. Loss (gain) on early extinguishment of debt During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized losses on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $45.2 million, composed of losses of approximately $2.4 million recognized in December 2010 related to the repurchase, in privately negotiated transactions, of approximately $82.8 million of our 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes for approximately $84.6 million in cash, and losses of approximately $41.5 million and $1.3 million recognized in June 2010 and July 2010, respectively, related to the retirement of substantially all $240 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized a gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $11.3 million related to the repurchase, in privately negotiated transactions, of approximately $75 million of our 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes for approximately $59.2 million in cash. 62 Table of Contents (Loss) income from discontinued operations, net Income from discontinued operations, net of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, reflects the results of operations of three operating properties classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2011, the results of operations of one property sold in 2011, and the results of operations and gain related to the sale of one operating property during the year ended December 31, 2010. We sold one operating property located in the Seattle market that had been classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2009. In connection with the operating property sold during the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized a gain of approximately $24,000. Income from discontinued operations, net of $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, reflects the results of operations of three operating properties that were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2011, the results of operations of one property sold in 2011, results of operations of the property sold during the year ended December 31, 2010, and the results of operations and gains on sales of four operating properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2009. In connection with the operating properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized a gain of approximately $2.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we sold land parcels in Mission Bay, San Francisco. These land parcels did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations since the parcels did not have any significant operations prior to disposition. In connection with the sales of land parcels during the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized a gain of approximately $59.4 million. Liquidity and capital resources Overview We expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements, such as for property acquisitions, development, redevelopment, and other construction projects, non-recurring capital improvements, tenant improvements, leasing costs, normal recurring expenses, and scheduled debt maturities, through net cash provided by operating activities, periodic asset sales, long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness, including borrowings under our unsecured line of credit, unsecured bank term loans, and the issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities. We expect to continue meeting our short-term liquidity and capital requirements, as further detailed in this section, generally through our working capital and net cash provided by operating activities. We believe that the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make the distributions necessary to continue qualifying as a REIT. Over the next several years, our balance sheet, capital structure, and liquidity objectives are as follows: Reduce leverage as a percentage of total gross assets and improve the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization; Maintain diverse sources of capital, including sources from net cash flows, unsecured debt, secured debt, selective asset sales, joint ventures, perpetual preferred stock, and common stock; Manage the amount of debt maturing in a single year; Refinance outstanding medium-term variable rate bank debt with longer-term fixed rate debt; Mitigate unhedged variable rate debt exposure by transitioning our balance sheet debt from short-term and medium-term variable rate bank debt to long-term unsecured fixed rate debt and utilize interest rate hedge agreements; Maintain adequate liquidity from net cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, and available borrowing capacity under our unsecured line of credit; Maintain available borrowing capacity under our unsecured line of credit in excess of 50% of the total commitments of $1.5 billion, except temporarily as necessary; Fund preferred stock and common stock dividends from net cash provided by operating activities; Retain net positive cash flows after payment of dividends for reinvestment in acquisitions and/or development and redevelopment projects; and Reduce our non-income producing assets as a percentage of our gross investment in real estate. 63 Table of Contents Cash flows We report and analyze our cash flows based on operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. The following table summarizes changes in the Company cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Change Net cash provided by operating activities $ 246,960 $ 227,425 $ 19,535 Net cash used in investing activities $ (733,579 ) $ (445,164 ) $ (288,415 ) Net cash provided by financing activities $ 479,156 $ 237,912 $ 241,244 Operating activities Cash flows provided by operating activities consisted of the following amounts (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Change Net cash provided by operating activities $ 246,960 $ 227,425 $ 19,535 Changes in assets and liabilities (39,586 ) (20,318 ) (19,268 ) Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities $ 207,374 $ 207,107 $ 267 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by $19.5 million, or 9%, to $246.9 million, compared to $227.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in net operating income from completed and leased development and redevelopment spaces, and increased revenues from nine operating properties that were acquired subsequent to January 1, 2010. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by $0.3 million, to $207.4 million, as compared to $207.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. We believe our cash flows from operating activities provide a stable source of cash to fund operating expenses. As of December 31, 2011, approximately 95% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Our average occupancy rate of operating and redevelopment properties as of December 31 of each year from 1998 to 2011, was approximately 89.2%. Our average occupancy rate of operating properties as of December 31 of each year from 1998 to 2011 was approximately 95.2%. 64 Table of Contents Investing activities Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011, was $733.6 million, compared to $445.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.

(2) Amount and timing of issuance of unsecured notes will be subject to the debt capital market environment. (3) If we are successful raising capital from the issuance of unsecured senior notes, it will reduce the estimated amount of debt, equity, and joint venture capital. Sources of capital Unsecured line of credit We use our unsecured line of credit to fund working capital, construction activities, and, from time to time, acquisition of properties. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1.1 billion available under our $1.5 billion unsecured line of credit. Cash and cash equivalents As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $78.5 million of cash and cash equivalents.

(2) Estimated spending beyond 2012 related to preconstruction, projects in India and China, generic infrastructure improvements, major capital spending, and future projected construction projects will be determined at a future date and is contingent upon many factors. 70 Table of Contents The table below shows the average per square foot property-related capital expenditures, tenant improvements, and leasing costs, excluding capital expenditures and tenant improvements that are recoverable from tenants, revenue-enhancing, or related to properties that have undergone redevelopment for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (dollars in thousands, except per square foot amounts): Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Capital expenditures (1): Major capital expenditures $ 641 $ 379 Recurring capital expenditures $ 1,890 $ 953 Square feet in asset base 13,384,598 12,202,231 Per square foot: Major capital expenditures $ 0.05 $ 0.03 Recurring capital expenditures $ 0.14 $ 0.08 Tenant improvements and leasing costs: Re-tenanted space (2) Tenant improvements and leasing costs $ 4,571 $ 3,097 Re-tenanted square feet 512,573 778,547 Per square foot $ 8.92 $ 3.98 Renewal space Tenant improvements and leasing costs $ 6,029 $ 3,628 Renewal square feet 1,309,293 999,419 Per square foot $ 4.60 $ 3.63 (1) Major capital expenditures consist of roof replacements and HVAC systems that are typically identified and considered at the time a property is acquired. Recurring capital expenditures exclude major capital expenditures. (2) Excludes space that has undergone redevelopment before re-tenanting. We expect our future capital expenditures, tenant improvements, and leasing costs (excluding capital expenditures and tenant improvements that are recoverable from tenants, revenue-enhancing, or related to properties that have undergone redevelopment) on a per square footage basis to be approximately in the range as shown in the preceding table. Capitalized interest for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, of approximately $61.1 million and $72.8 million, respectively, is included in investments in real estate, net, on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as the table above summarizing total capital expenditures. In addition, we capitalized payroll and other indirect project costs related to construction, development, and redevelopment projects, including projects in India and China, aggregating approximately $15.7 million and $14.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Such costs are also included in the table on the previous page. We capitalize interest cost as a cost of the project only during the period for which activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are ongoing, provided that expenditures for the asset have been made and interest cost is being incurred. Indirect project costs, including personnel, construction administration, legal fees, and office costs that clearly relate to projects under construction, are capitalized during the period in which activities necessary to prepare the asset for its intended use take place. Additionally, should activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use cease, interest, taxes, insurance, and certain other direct project costs related to this asset would be expensed as incurred. When construction activities cease and the asset is ready for its intended use, the asset is transferred out of construction in progress and classified as rental properties, net. Additionally, if vertical aboveground construction is not initiated at completion of preconstruction activities, the land parcel will be classified as land held for future development. Expenditures for repair and maintenance are expensed as incurred. We also capitalize and defer initial direct costs to originate leases with independent third parties related to evaluating a prospective lessee financial condition, negotiating lease terms, preparing the lease agreement, and closing the lease transaction. Costs that we have capitalized and deferred relate to successful leasing transactions, result directly from and are essential to the lease transaction, and would not have been incurred had that leasing transaction not occurred. The initial direct costs capitalized and deferred also include the portion of our employees total compensation and payroll-related fringe benefits directly related to time spent performing activities previously described related to the respective lease that would not have been performed but for that lease. Total initial direct leasing costs capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, were approximately $57.5 million and $31.1 million, respectively, of which approximately $11.2 million and $7.8 million, respectively, represented capitalized and deferred payroll costs directly related and essential to our leasing activities during such periods. 71 Table of Contents Acquisitions Due to the current low interest rate environment and the competitive interest in quality real estate, we expect buyer demand for acquisition opportunities to be strong and for this demand to put upward pressure on pricing. Thus, we expect to continue to be selective in acquisition opportunities in 2012. Dividends We are required to distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income on an annual basis in order to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we intend to make, but are not contractually bound to make, regular quarterly distributions to preferred and common stockholders from cash flow from operating activities. All such distributions are at the discretion of our Board of Directors. We may be required to use borrowings under our unsecured line of credit, if necessary, to meet REIT distribution requirements and maintain our REIT status. We consider market factors and our performance in addition to REIT requirements in determining distribution levels. Our forecast of taxable income and distributions do not require significant increases or decreases in our annual common stock dividends on a per share basis in order to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income for the year ended December 31, 2012. Contractual obligations and commitments Contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011, consisted of the following (in thousands): Payments by Period Total 2012 2013-2014 2015-2016 Thereafter Secured notes payable (1) (2) $ 725,125 $ 10,857 $ 357,853 $ 240,625 $ 115,790 Unsecured line of credit (3) 370,000 370,000 2012 Unsecured Bank Term Loan (4) 250,000 250,000 2016 Unsecured Bank Term Loan (5) 750,000 750,000 2017 Unsecured Bank Term Loan (6) 600,000 600,000 Unsecured convertible notes (1) (7) 85,051 84,801 250 Estimated interest payments on fixed rate and hedged variable rate debt (8) 270,949 85,929 115,012 37,851 32,157 Estimated interest payments on variable rate debt (9) 71,836 4,224 23,263 43,451 898 Ground lease obligations 680,365 11,222 21,100 20,215 627,828 Other obligations (10) 28,989 22,512 1,635 1,798 3,044 Total $ 3,832,315 $ 469,545 $ 519,113 $ 1,463,940 $ 1,379,717 (1) Amounts represent principal amounts due and exclude unamortized discounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheets.

(9) The interest payments on variable rate debt were calculated based on the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2011. (10) Includes our share, approximately $21.1 million, of a secured note payable due in 2013 held by our unconsolidated real estate entity. 72 Table of Contents Secured notes payable Secured notes payable as of December 31, 2011, consisted of 13 notes secured by 38 properties. Our secured notes payable typically require monthly payments of principal and interest and had weighted average interest rates of approximately 5.8% as of December 31, 2011.

As of December 31, 2011, our secured notes payable, including unamortized discounts, were composed of approximately $647.6 million and $76.7 million of fixed and variable rate debt, respectively. Unsecured credit facility We use our Unsecured Credit Facility to fund working capital, acquisition of properties, and construction activities. Our objective is to maintain significant unused borrowing capacity, generally greater than 50% of our $1.5 billion unsecured line of credit. Over the next several years, we anticipate refinancing a portion of our outstanding balance under our unsecured bank term loans with capital from unsecured senior notes, unsecured bank loans, and other capital, including proceeds from selective sales of assets. In January 2011, we entered into a Third Amendment to our Prior Credit Agreement. The Third Amendment amended the Prior Credit Agreement to, among other things, increase permitted borrowings under our unsecured line of credit from $1.15 billion to $1.5 billion, and provided an accordion option to increase commitments under the Unsecured Credit Facility by up to an additional $300 million. Borrowings under the Unsecured Credit Facility bear interest at LIBOR or a base rate specified in the loan agreement, plus in either case a specified margin. The applicable margin for LIBOR borrowings outstanding under our unsecured line of credit was 2.30% as of December 31, 2011. The applicable margin for the LIBOR borrowings under the 2012 Unsecured Bank Term Loan was not amended in the Third Amendment and was 0.70% as of December 31, 2011. Under the Third Amendment, the maturity date for the unsecured line of credit is January 2015, assuming we exercise our sole right under the amendment to extend this maturity date twice by an additional six months after each exercise. The maturity date for the 2012 Unsecured Bank Term Loan is October 2012. As of December 31, 2011, we had outstanding borrowings of $370 million, representing 25% of total borrowing capacity, under our $1.5 billion unsecured line of credit, and $250 million outstanding under our 2012 Unsecured Bank Term Loan. The weighted average interest rate, including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements, for our Unsecured Credit Facility was approximately 3.82% as of December 31, 2011. The requirements and actual results as of December 31, 2011, of the financial covenants under the unsecured line of credit and unsecured bank term loans are as follows: Covenant Requirement Actual as of December 31, 2011 Leverage ratio (1) Less than or equal to 60.0% 36% (2) Unsecured leverage ratio Less than or equal to 60.0% 38% Fixed charge coverage ratio Greater than or equal to 1.50 2.5x Unsecured debt yield Greater than or equal to 12.00% 15% Minimum book value Greater than or equal to the sum of $2.0 billion and 50% of the net proceeds of equity offerings after January 28, 2011 $3.3 billion Secured debt ratio Less than or equal to 40.0% 9% (1) The leverage ratio threshold under our 2017 Unsecured Bank Term Loan may increase from 60% to 65% for the quarter end in which a material acquisition occurs and for each of the three quarters following such an event. (2) Under the terms of the agreement of our 2017 Unsecured Bank Term Loan, the leverage ratio is calculated over a portion of total indebtedness. The leverage ratio for the 2017 Unsecured Bank Term Loan was 35% as of December 31, 2011. 73 Table of Contents In addition, the terms of the agreements restrict, among other things, certain investments, indebtedness, distributions, mergers, developments, land, and borrowings available under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured bank term loans for developments, land, and encumbered and unencumbered assets. The terms of the agreements also limit our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders in excess of the greater of (1) 95% of consolidated Funds from Operations (as defined in the Third Amendment) for the preceding four quarters and (2) the minimum amount sufficient to permit us to maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes or the amount necessary to avoid the payment of federal or state income or excise tax. In addition, we are prohibited from paying cash dividends in excess of the amount necessary for us to qualify for taxation as a REIT if a default or an event of default exists. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Management continuously monitors the Company compliance and projected compliance with the covenants. We expect to continue meeting the requirements of our debt covenants in the short-term and long-term. However, in the event of an economic slowdown, crisis in the credit markets, or rising cost of capital, there is no certainty that we will be able to continue to satisfy all of the covenant requirements. Additionally, we may be required to reduce our outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and unsecured bank term loans in order to maintain compliance with one or more covenants. As of December 31, 2011, we had 57 lenders providing commitments under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured bank term loans. During 2011, all lenders under our unsecured line of credit funded all borrowings requested under the loan agreement. In the future, if one or more such lenders fail to fund a borrowing request, we may not be able to borrow funds necessary for working capital, construction activities, dividend payments, debt repayment, monthly debt service, and other recurring capital requirements. The failure of one or more lenders to fund their share of a borrowing request may have a material impact on our financial statements. 2016 unsecured bank term loan In February 2011, we entered into a $250 million unsecured bank term loan. In June 2011, we amended this $250 million 2016 Unsecured Bank Term Loan to, among other things, increase the borrowings from $250 million to $750 million and to extend the maturity from January 2015 to June 2016, assuming we exercise our sole right to extend the maturity date by one year. Borrowings under the 2016 Unsecured Bank Term Loan bear interest at LIBOR or the specified base rate, plus in either case a margin specified in the amended unsecured bank term loan agreement. The applicable margin for the LIBOR borrowings under the 2016 Unsecured Bank Term Loan as of December 31, 2011, was 1.65%. Under the 2016 Unsecured Bank Term Loan agreement, the financial covenants were not amended and are identical to the financial covenants required under our existing Unsecured Credit Facility. The 2016 Unsecured Bank Term Loan may be repaid at any date prior to maturity without a prepayment penalty. The net proceeds from this amendment were used to reduce outstanding borrowings on the 2012 Unsecured Bank Term Loan from $750 million to $250 million. As a result of this early repayment, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $1.2 million related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees. 2017 unsecured bank term loan In December 2011, we closed a new $600 million 2017 Unsecured Bank Term Loan, which matures in January 2017, assuming we exercise our sole right to extend the maturity date by one year. Borrowings under the 2017 Unsecured Bank Term Loan bear interest at LIBOR or the specified base rate, plus in either case a margin specified in the unsecured bank term loan agreement. The applicable margin for the LIBOR borrowings under the 2017 Unsecured Bank Term Loan as of December 31, 2011, was 1.50%. The 2017 Unsecured Bank Term Loan may be repaid at any date prior to maturity without a prepayment penalty. The net proceeds from this 2017 Unsecured Bank Term Loan were used to reduce outstanding borrowings on our unsecured line of credit. Unsecured convertible notes During January 2012, we repurchased approximately $83.8 million in principal amount of our 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes at par, pursuant to options exercised by holders thereof under the indenture governing the notes. We do not expect to recognize any gain or loss as a result of this repurchase. As of February 21, 2012, $1.0 million of our 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes remained outstanding. 74 Table of Contents Estimated interest payments Estimated interest payments on our fixed rate debt and hedged variable rate debt were calculated based upon contractual interest rates, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements, interest payment dates, and scheduled maturity dates. As of December 31, 2011, approximately 79% of our debt was fixed rate debt or variable rate debt subject to interest rate hedge agreements. See additional information regarding our interest rate hedge agreements under Liquidity and Capital Resources contractual obligations and commitments Interest Rate Hedge Agreements. The remaining 21% of our debt is unhedged variable rate debt based primarily on LIBOR. Interest payments on our unhedged variable rate debt have been calculated based on interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2011. See additional information regarding our debt under Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Ground lease obligations Ground lease obligations as of December 31, 2011, included leases for 21 of our properties and six land development parcels. These lease obligations have remaining lease terms from 22 to 99 years, excluding extension options. Commitments In addition to the above, as of December 31, 2011, remaining aggregate costs under contracts for the construction of properties undergoing development, redevelopment, and generic life science infrastructure improvements under the terms of leases approximated $255.3 million. We expect payments for these obligations to occur over one to three years, subject to capital planning adjustments from time to time. We are also committed to funding approximately $57.3 million for certain investments over the next six years. A wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company previously executed a ground lease, as ground lessee, for the development site in New York City located at and adjacent to 450 E. 29th Street. That ground lease requires the construction of a second building approximating 407,000 rentable square feet to commence no later than October 31, 2013. Commencement of construction of the second building includes, among other things, site preparation in order to accommodate a construction crane, erection of a construction crane, renewal of permits, and updating the construction plans and specifications. The ground lease provides further that substantial completion of the second building occur by October 31, 2015, meaning satisfying conditions which include substantially completed construction in accordance with the plans and the issuance of either temporary or permanent certificates of occupancy for the core and shell. The ground lease also provides that by October 31, 2016, the ground lessee obtain a temporary or permanent certificate of occupancy for the core and shell of both the first building (which has occurred) and the second building. In each case, the target dates above are subject to force majeure, to contractual cure rights, to other legal remedies available to ground lessees generally, and to change for any reason by agreement between both parties under the ground lease. Lastly, if the above dates are not met, the ground lease provides contractual cure rights and the ground lease does not provide for the payment of additional rent, a late fee, or other monetary penalty. Off-balance sheet arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements consist of our investment in a real estate entity that is a variable interest entity for which we are not the primary beneficiary. We account for the real estate entity under the equity method. The debt held by the unconsolidated real estate entity is secured by the land parcel owned by the entity, and is non-recourse to us. See Notes 2 and 3 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Interest rate hedge agreements We utilize interest rate hedge agreements, including interest rate swap agreements, to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured bank term loans. These agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount (the notional amount ). Interest received under all of our interest rate hedge agreements is based on the one-month LIBOR rate. The net difference between the interest paid and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense. The following table summarizes our interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2011 (in thousands): Notional Amount in Transaction Effective Termination Interest Pay Fair Value Effect as of December 31, Date Date Date Rate (1) as of 12/31/11 (2) 2011 2012 2013 December 2006 December 29, 2006 March 31, 2014 4.990% $ (4,968 ) $ 50,000 $ 50,000 $ 50,000 October 2007 October 31, 2007 September 30, 2012 4.546 (1,559 ) 50,000 October 2007 October 31, 2007 September 30, 2013 4.642 (3,625 ) 50,000 50,000 October 2007 July 1, 2008 March 31, 2013 4.622 (1,298 ) 25,000 25,000 October 2007 July 1, 2008 March 31, 2013 4.625 (1,299 ) 25,000 25,000 December 2006 November 30, 2009 March 31, 2014 5.015 (7,494 ) 75,000 75,000 75,000 December 2006 November 30, 2009 March 31, 2014 5.023 (7,507 ) 75,000 75,000 75,000 December 2006 December 31, 2010 October 31, 2012 5.015 (3,879 ) 100,000 December 2011 December 30, 2011 December 31, 2012 0.480 (76 ) 250,000 December 2011 December 30, 2011 December 31, 2012 0.480 (75 ) 250,000 December 2011 December 30, 2011 December 31, 2012 0.480 (38 ) 125,000 December 2011 December 30, 2011 December 31, 2012 0.480 (38 ) 125,000 December 2011 December 30, 2011 December 31, 2012 0.495 (57 ) 125,000 December 2011 December 30, 2011 December 31, 2012 0.508 (73 ) 125,000 December 2011 December 31, 2012 December 31, 2013 0.640 (136 ) 250,000 December 2011 December 31, 2012 December 31, 2013 0.640 (131 ) 250,000 December 2011 December 31, 2012 December 31, 2013 0.644 (72 ) 125,000 December 2011 December 31, 2012 December 31, 2013 0.644 (73 ) 125,000 December 2011 December 31, 2013 December 31, 2014 0.977 (301 ) 250,000 December 2011 December 31, 2013 December 31, 2014 0.976 (281 ) 250,000 Total $ (32,980 ) $ 1,450,000 $ 1,050,000 $ 700,000 (1) Interest pay rate represents the interest rate we will pay for one month LIBOR under the applicable interest rate swap agreement. This rate does not include any spread in addition to one month LIBOR that is due monthly as interest expense. (2) Including accrued interest and credit valuation (Accounting Standards Codification 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ) adjustment. 75 Table of Contents We have entered into master derivative agreements with each counterparty. These master derivative agreements (all of which are adapted from the standard International Swaps & Derivatives Association, Inc. form) define certain terms between the Company and each counterparty to address and minimize certain risks associated with our interest rate hedge agreements. In order to limit our risk of non-performance by an individual counterparty under our interest rate hedge agreements, our interest rate hedge agreements are spread among various counterparties. As of December 31, 2011, the largest aggregate notional amount in effect at any single point in time with an individual counterparty was $375 million. If one or more of our counterparties fail to perform under our interest rate hedge agreements, we may incur higher costs associated with our variable rate LIBOR-based debt than the interest costs we originally anticipated. As of December 31, 2011, our interest rate hedge agreements were classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and tenant security deposits based upon their respective fair values, aggregating a liability balance of approximately $33.0 million with the offsetting adjustment reflected as unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss in total equity. Balances in accumulated other comprehensive loss are recognized in the period that the forecasted hedge transactions affect earnings. We have not posted any collateral related to our interest rate hedge agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, approximately $21.5 million, $30.5 million, and $38.9 million, respectively, was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense as an increase to interest expense. During the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify approximately $19.1 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense as an increase to interest expense. Other resources and liquidity requirements Under our current shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, we may offer common stock, preferred stock, debt, and other securities. These securities may be issued from time to time at our discretion based on our needs and market conditions, including as necessary to balance our use of incremental debt capital. In May 2011, we sold 6,250,651 shares of our common stock in a follow-on offering (including 750,651 shares issued upon partial exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option). The shares were issued at a price of $75.50 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $451.5 million (after deducting underwriters discounts and other offering costs). In September 2010, we sold 5,175,000 shares of our common stock in a follow-on offering (including 675,000 shares issued upon full exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option). The shares were issued at a price of $69.25 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $342.3 million (after deducting underwriters discounts and other offering costs). We hold interests, together with certain third parties, in companies that we consolidate in our financial statements. These third parties may contribute equity into these entities primarily related to their share of funds for construction and financing-related activities. Exposure to environmental liabilities In connection with the acquisition of all of our properties, we have obtained Phase I environmental assessments to ascertain the existence of any environmental liabilities or other issues. The Phase I environmental assessments of our properties have not revealed any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole, nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities that have occurred since the Phase I environmental assessments were completed. In addition, we carry a policy of pollution legal liability insurance covering exposure to certain environmental losses at substantially all of our properties. Inflation As of December 31, 2011, approximately 95% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Approximately 94% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from 3.0% to 3.5%) or indexed based on the consumer price index or another index. Accordingly, we do not believe that our cash flow or earnings from real estate operations are subject to any significant risk from inflation. An increase in inflation, however, could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate borrowings, including borrowings related to our unsecured line of credit and unsecured bank term loans. 76 Table of Contents Non-GAAP measures Funds from operations GAAP basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes real estate values diminish over time. In an effort to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets, the Board of Governors of NAREIT established the measurement tool of Funds from Operations ( FFO ). Since its introduction, FFO has become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure among real estate investment trusts ( REITs ). We believe that FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity REIT. We calculate FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains from sales, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The primary reconciling item between GAAP net income attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders and FFO attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders is depreciation and amortization expense. Our FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs, and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. The following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to FFO attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Net income attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders $ 101,973 $ 105,941 $ 104,974 Add: Depreciation and amortization (1) 158,026 126,640 118,508 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 3,975 3,729 7,047 Net income attributable to unvested restricted stock awards 1,088 995 1,270 Subtract: Gain on sales of property (46 ) (59,466 ) (2,627 ) FFO attributable to noncontrolling interests (3,970 ) (4,226 ) (3,843 ) FFO attributable to unvested restricted stock awards (2,432 ) (1,608 ) (2,694 ) FFO attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders 258,614 172,005 222,635 Effect of assumed conversion and dilutive securities: Assumed conversion of 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes 21 7,781 11,943 Amounts attributable to unvested restricted stock awards (22 ) 118 FFO attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders assuming effect of assumed conversion and dilutive securities $ 258,635 $ 179,764 $ 234,696 (1) Includes depreciation and amortization classified in discontinued operations related to assets held for sale (for the periods prior to when such assets were designated as held for sale ). 77 Table of Contents Adjusted funds from operations Adjusted funds from operations ( AFFO ) is a non- GAAP financial measure we believe is a useful supplemental measure of our performance. We compute AFFO attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders by adding to or deducting from FFO attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders (1) recurring and non-recurring capital expenditures required to maintain and re-tenant our properties; (2) second generation tenant improvements and leasing costs on re-tenanted and renewal space (excludes redevelopment expenditures); (3) capitalized income from development projects; (4) gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt; (5) amortization of loan fees, debt premiums/discounts and acquired above and below market leases; (6) effects of deferred rent/straight-line rent and deferred rent/straight-line rent on ground leases; (7) non-cash compensation expense related to restricted stock awards; and (8) other non-cash income or charges, including impairment charges. AFFO is not intended to represent cash flow for the period, and is only intended to provide an additional measure of performance. We believe that net income attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to AFFO attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating AFFO and, accordingly, our AFFO may not be comparable to AFFO calculated by other REITs. AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. The following table reconciles net income attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to AFFO attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Net income attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders $ 101,973 $ 105,941 $ 104,974 Cumulative adjustments to calculate FFO (1) 156,641 66,064 117,661 FFO attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders 258,614 172,005 222,635 Add/(deduct): Major and recurring capital expenditures (2) (2,531 ) (1,332 ) (1,934 ) Tenant improvements and leasing costs (2) (10,600 ) (6,725 ) (4,738 ) Amortization of loan fees 9,300 7,892 7,958 Amortization of debt premiums/discounts 3,819 9,999 10,788 Amortization of acquired above and below market leases (9,332 ) (7,868 ) (9,448 ) Deferred rent/straight-line rent (26,797 ) (22,832 ) (14,379 ) Stock compensation 11,755 10,816 14,051 Capitalized income from development projects 3,973 5,688 6,498 Deferred rent/straight-line rent on ground leases 4,704 5,337 5,566 Loss on early extinguishment of debt 6,485 45,168 (11,254 ) Impairment of real estate 994 Allocation to unvested restricted stock awards 74 (424 ) (37 ) AFFO attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders $ 250,458 $ 217,724 $ 225,706 (1) See reconciling items for FFO presented under Funds from operations . (2) Excludes expenditures, tenant improvements, and leasing costs that are recoverable from tenants, revenue-enhancing, or related to properties that have undergone redevelopment before re-tenanting. 78 Table of Contents Adjusted EBITDA EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ( EBITDA ), a non-GAAP financial measure, and is used as a supplemental measure of operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA ( Adjusted EBITDA ) is calculated as EBITDA excluding impairments, gains or losses from sales of real estate, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, and net stock compensation expenses. We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors relevant and useful information because it permits investors to view income from our operations on an unleveraged basis before the effects of taxes, non-cash depreciation and amortization, impairments, gains or losses from sales of real estate, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, and net stock compensation expenses. By excluding interest expense, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA allow investors to measure our performance independent of our capital structure and indebtedness and, therefore, allow for a more meaningful comparison of our performance to that of other companies, both in the real estate industry and in other industries. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as a measure of our performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. While EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are relevant and widely used measures of performance, it does not represent net income or cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, and it should not be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating performance or liquidity. Further, our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. The following table presents a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Net income $ 135,393 $ 139,022 $ 141,648 Interest expense continuing operations 63,407 69,509 82,111 Interest expense discontinued operations 36 133 162 Depreciation and amortization continuing operations 157,526 126,033 117,246 Depreciation and amortization discontinued operations 500 607 1,262 EBITDA 356,862 335,304 342,429 Stock compensation expense 11,755 10,816 14,051 Loss (gain) on early extinguishment of debt 6,485 45,168 (11,254 ) Gain on sales of property (46 ) (59,466 ) (2,627 ) Impairment of real estate 994 Adjusted EBITDA $ 376,050 $ 331,822 $ 342,599 79 Table of Contents Fixed charge coverage ratio The fixed charge coverage ratio is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of the Company ability to satisfy fixed financing obligations and dividends on preferred stock. Cash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus capitalized interest, less amortization of loan fees, and amortization of debt premiums/discounts. The fixed charge coverage ratio calculation is not directly comparable to the calculation of the Consolidated Ratio of Earnings to Combined Fixed Charges and Preferred Stock Dividends included in Exhibit 12.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K.
