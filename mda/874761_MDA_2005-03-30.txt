ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The accompanying management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations gives effect to the restatement of the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, as described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Executive Summary and Overview The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and applicable Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, and other information included in this report. WHO ARE WE? AES is a global power company managed to meet the growing demand for electricity in ways that benefit all of our stakeholders. AES is a holding company that through its subsidiaries and affiliates owns and operates a portfolio of electricity generation and distribution businesses in 27 countries. We seek to capture the benefits of our global expertise and economies of scale in our operations. Predictable cash flow, an efficient capital structure and world-class operating performance are the focus of our management efforts. WHAT BUSINESSES ARE WE IN? We operate two principal businesses. The first is the generation of power for sale to utilities and other wholesale customers. The second is the operation of utilities which distribute power to retail, commercial, industrial and governmental customers. Each principal business generates approximately one half of the Company revenues. Our financial results are reported as four business segments on a regulated and non-regulated basis by region, which further refines our core business structure: Generation Contract Generation Competitive Supply The generation business segments earnings and cash flows may be significantly affected by: (1) the reliability of generating capacity at our existing facilities, (2) newly-completed projects or acquisitions of generating facilities, (3) demand for power beyond minimum requirements under the contract generation segment power sales agreements, or the demand for power as affected by weather conditions in our competitive supply segment, (4) prices for power and fuel supply requirements, (5) the credit quality of the counterparties to our power sales agreements, (6) changes in our cost structure, including cost associated with operation, maintenance and repair, transmission access, insurance and environmental compliance, including expenditures relating to environmental emission equipment or environmental remediation, (7) changes in laws or regulations, and (8) changes in the foreign currency exchange rates for certain of our facilities outside the United States. Our contract generation and competitive supply segments consist of approximately 37 gigawatts of generating capacity from 99 power plants in 23 countries. Our contract generation plants have contractually limited their exposure to electricity price volatility by entering into power sales agreements of five years or longer for 75% or more of their output capacity. Exposure to fuel supply risks is also limited through long-term fuel supply contracts or through fuel tolling arrangements. Through these contractual 40 agreements, the businesses generally reduce commodity and electricity price volatility and thereby increase the predictability of their cash flows and earnings. Our competitive supply segment consists primarily of power plants selling electricity to wholesale customers through competitive markets and, as a result, the cash flows and earnings of such businesses are more sensitive to fluctuations in the market price of natural gas, coal and other fuels. However, for our U.S. competitive supply business which includes a fleet of low-cost coal fired plants in New York, we typically hedge the majority of our fuel exposure on a rolling two year basis. Utilities Large Utilities Growth Distribution The utility business segments earnings and cash flows may be significantly affected by: (1) changes in economic conditions and policies, (2) demand for power, including demand variability associated with weather conditions, (3) prices for power and fuel supply requirements, (4) the extent of commercial losses, which include fraudulent activity by our customers, (5) changes in our cost structure, including costs associated with operation, maintenance and repair, insurance and environmental compliance, including expenditures relating to environmental emissions or environmental remediation, (6) changes in laws or regulation, including changes in electricity tariff rates and our ability to obtain tariff adjustments for increased expenses, and (7) changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly in Brazil and Venezuela. These combined businesses consist of 15 distribution companies in eight countries with over 11.2 million end-user customers. The large utilities segment includes three large utilities located in the U.S. (IPL), Brazil (Eletropaulo) and Venezuela (EDC) all of which maintain a monopoly franchise within a defined service area. The challenge within these businesses includes providing dependable and quality service to a large base of customers, and effectively being able to achieve appropriate returns through tariff increases. While we are exposed to currency, political and economic risks within developing countries, we also have excellent growth opportunities given increasing demand in these markets. Our growth distribution segment is comprised of our interests in electricity distribution facilities located in developing countries where the demand for electricity is expected to grow at a higher rate than in more developed parts of the world. However, these businesses often face particular challenges associated with their presence in developing countries such as outdated equipment, significant electricity theft-related losses, cultural problems associated with customer safety and non-payment, emerging economies, and potentially less stable governments or regulatory regimes. WHAT WAS OUR KEY FOCUS FOR 2004? In 2004, we focused on strengthening our balance sheet, improving the operations of our existing portfolio of assets and pursuing disciplined growth. We strengthened our balance sheet by paying down parent level debt, extending the average maturity of our parent debt and restructuring the debt of several key subsidiaries. In our operating businesses, we focused on improving the strategic sourcing of critical supplies and services, obtaining tariff increases and favorable regulatory treatment of new investments, reducing the impact of forced outages on our generation plants and reducing the impact of commercial losses on our utilities and distribution businesses. 2004 was an important transition year for us as we completed several years of restructuring efforts. It was also a year of strong financial performance with solid improvements in revenue, gross margin and earnings per share, all building the foundation for long-term growth. 41 Operating Highlights 2004 2003 2002 (in millions, except per share data) Revenue $9,486 $ 8,415 $ 7,380 Gross Margin $2,772 $ 2,436 $ 1,950 Gross Margin as a % of Revenue 29.2 % 28.9 % 26.4 % Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities $ 1,568 $ 1,576 $ 1,444 Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share from Continuing Operations $ 0.57 $ 0.56 $ (3.06 ) Revenue We achieved revenues in 2004 of $9.5 billion, an increase of 13% from $8.4 billion in the prior year largely reflecting increased pricing due to successful pass through of tariff increases in our large utilities and the impact of several new projects coming on line within our generation business. Gross margin Gross margin increased 14% over 2003 to $2.8 billion with higher contributions from all four of our segments. In addition, gross margin as a percent of sales increased to 29.2% versus 28.9% in the prior year. Earnings per share Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased from $0.56 to $0.57 in 2004. Although our key operating measures improved substantially year over year, the company was negatively impacted by foreign currency transaction losses related to subsidiary debt denominated in U.S. dollars and higher minority interest related to our Brazil restructuring. Operating cash flow We generated $1,568 million of net cash from operating activities which was $8 million lower than 2003. This year over year decline was largely driven by a return to normalcy in our Brazilian utility business which had dramatically extended its vendor payments in 2003 while going through the debt restructuring process. Days payables outstanding in this business were at 72 at the end of 2003 and are now at a more acceptable level of 47 as of the end of 2004. Strategic Highlights Strengthening Our Balance Sheet In 2004, we continued to make progress in strengthening our financial position in a number of ways. AES reduced overall recourse debt at the parent level by approximately $800 million to approximately $5.2 billion at year end. We also continued to extend a portion of our debt repayments associated with our scheduled future debt maturities by refinancing approximately $700 million of intermediate term recourse debt at the parent level with longer term debt. These new debt obligations also bear lower interest costs than the debt refinanced. Recourse debt at the parent level with maturities of one year or less at December 31, 2004 was $142 million. We expect to either repay or refinance this debt at or prior to maturity. This debt is a junior subordinated debenture that bears a coupon rate of 4.5%. We can provide no assurance that we can refinance this debt with terms as favorable as the current debt terms. At the subsidiary level, we refinanced or restructured more than $4.6 billion of non-recourse debt in 2004. Most of these efforts resulted in extended maturity dates and amortization schedules. In addition, we also added approximately $1 billion of non-recourse debt at the subsidiary level. Most new debt was used to fund the construction of new electric generation plants or other capital expenditures in Indiana, Qatar, Cameroon, Hungary and Spain. Additionally, one of our subsidiaries issued approximately $120 million of debt to return a portion of our investment initially contributed to our Ebute project in Nigeria. 42 Liquidity (defined in the Parent Company Liquidity section in Item 7 of this Form 10-K as cash and equivalents plus undrawn available commitments under credit facilities) at the parent level on December 31, 2004 was $643 million. The 2004 liquidity decreased from $1 billion at the end of 2003 primarily as a result of our efforts to reduce aggregate recourse debt levels at the parent. The aggregate amount and specific sources of cash flow relative to debt levels are important factors for the rating agencies in determining whether the Company credit ratings should improve. Currency, political and regulatory risks tend to be the biggest variables to sustaining cash flows at predictable levels. Our large contractual and concession-based cash flow from our contract generation and large utility businesses is a mitigating factor to these variables. In 2004, more than 71% of cash distributions to the parent were from our U.S. large utility and worldwide contract generation businesses. Restructuring Key Subsidiaries During 2002 and 2003 we embarked upon a significant restructuring plan aimed at divesting non-core assets and raising cash to pay down debt, discontinuing underperforming businesses and restructuring significant aspects of several of our South American businesses. The latter efforts were focused on improving the businesses long-term prospects for generating acceptable returns on invested capital or extending short-term debt maturities. During 2004: We completed a number of debt restructuring and refinancing transactions of over $4.6 billion of non-recourse debt largely in Brazil, Chile, Venezuela, Colombia, and the US. Although these transactions have improved the financial condition of these businesses, many of these businesses are highly leveraged. As a result, these businesses may be significantly limited in their ability to meet debt service obligations or operate successfully under adverse economic conditions. However, we will continue our efforts to improve the financial condition of these businesses. A major part of this achievement included the restructuring of our Brazilian utility through successful negotiations with our lenders, the Brazilian National Bank for Economic and Social Development ( BNDES ), whereby they took a 54% economic interest in our Brazil distribution business and two generating facilities in exchange for the cancellation of $869 million of debt and accrued interest. The remaining indebtedness of $510 million was re-profiled at a 9% stated interest rate with extended maturities. We discontinued seven underperforming businesses and successfully concluded our negotiations to transfer or sell these operations with the final dispositions of Ede Este, Wolf Hollow and Granite Ridge in the fourth quarter of 2004. Targeting Business Development In 2004, we brought three power plants on line and in so doing added approximately 500 MW of capacity in three countries Qatar, Panama and Cameroon. We entered the wind generation business through our current investment in US Windforce and recent acquisition of another wind generation business SeaWest. These investments have the potential to make us a top U.S. wind developer and operator with interests in over 2,800 MWs of development projects in thirteen states. We believe that wind generation will be one of the highest growth markets in Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries within the next five years and is a logical extension of our current contract generation business. We also are currently involved in developing a 600 MW lignite project in Bulgaria. Although the project has a power purchase agreement with the state owned transmission company, commencement of construction is pending completion of development, receipt of appropriate regulatory approvals and financing. Commercial operation of the first 300 MW unit is expected in 2008. 43 Finally, we are working to develop a $750 million project to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Ocean Cay, Bahamas, which would include a 95-mile natural gas pipeline from the terminal to an access site in Florida, pending approvals from the Bahamian government. Improving Operating Performance Over the past two years we have developed key programs aimed at helping us continue to organically grow our business, provide better service to our customers, manage our costs and safeguard our people. These include the following efforts: 1. Strategic Sourcing Initiatives In 2003 we launched a strategic sourcing initiative to avoid costs and capture cost reductions through the implementation of improved purchasing practices throughout the Company. During 2004, we evaluated and strategically sourced key spending categories including capital, services, materials and fuel. We are pursuing cost avoidance and cost reduction savings using best practice methodologies to improve our pricing through volume purchasing and product mix changes while pursuing cost reduction opportunities related to inventory management and parts rationalization. A core component of our program also includes developing supplier relationships to leverage our purchasing power and improve overall service and response times. 2. Plant Performance In our generation businesses, we track plant reliability as a key performance indicator. For 2004, our estimated average fleet availability declined 1% from 2003 to 87%. This measure is comprised of two key elements a scheduled outage factor and a forced outage factor. The forced outage factor, which is influenced by improving operating performance through effective maintenance and operating practices, has improved nearly 25% over the last two years. In 2004, our annual forced outage factor improved from 4.6% in 2003 to 3.8% in 2004. The scheduled outage factor was nearly 2% higher in 2004 versus 2003 as the Company made strategic timing decisions concerning planned maintenance that would least impact our contractual commitments. 3. Loss Reduction Our large non-U.S. utility businesses have embarked on comprehensive programs to track and reduce revenue losses, defined as the difference between energy purchased or generated and energy billed to customers. These losses can result from several factors including energy losses during the heat conversion process, i.e. technical losses and non-technical losses as a result of metering issues and customer theft. Progress has been made particularly in Brazil on improved metering practices, field training of inspectors, identification of commercial fraud and the establishment of a rebilling and collection process. This is a long term effort which requires both cultural and systematic process change. WHAT ARE OUR KEY CHALLENGES? There are several challenges we face in achieving our plans for 2005 and beyond. These include the recent emergence of increased and new global competition in our markets. In the United States and Europe there has been an emergence of multiple new financial sponsors aggressively acquiring assets. Internationally, there has been a rapid increase in the number of new, regionally focused and aggressive competitors. These factors have led to more competition and an increase in the prices for assets in both secondary asset sales and privatizations. The global power market is extremely large and offers multiple opportunities. In the European Union ( EU ), the market rules require a liberalized competitive wholesale power market as a condition for EU entry. However, there are a number of considerations that may limit the number of available near term 44 opportunities in other markets. First, in the United States and, to a lesser extent, Western Europe there is limited need for new capacity, reducing the number of available Greenfield opportunities in the most stable markets. Many states in the United States have slowed or reversed their trends towards liberalization, thereby reducing the number of available opportunities. Internationally, planned privatization programs have been deferred for specific local reasons. In the markets outside the United States that are liberalizing the rules, those rules are being designed such that the risks are too great to justify the level or returns currently available. Hence we have decided to either not participate in those markets or to only do so in a limited manner and wait for a more balanced set of rules or regulations to emerge. Political Environment Several of our businesses operate in politically unstable environments. The impact of governmental change and uncertainty impacts foreign currency volatility (discussed below), our ability to maintain or attract needed financing as well and our ability to effectively recover costs through routine tariff or regulatory reset proceedings. Foreign Currency Risk A significant portion of our business portfolio is located outside of the U.S. and therefore usually subject to both currency translation and transaction risk. Our financial position and results of operations have been significantly affected in the past by significant fluctuations in the value of the Argentine peso, Brazilian real and Venezuelan bolivar relative to the U.S. dollar. We hedge certain transaction exposures principally related to debt, and have restructured debt into local currency denomination to minimize risk when possible. Although these actions may have mitigated negative impacts in certain cases, movements within currencies are difficult to predict and continue to have a significant impact on our financial results. Regulatory Risk Due to the regulated nature of the utilities business, we are subject to regulatory risk related to changes in tariff agreements, and existing laws and provisions. Changes in regulation may impact our future operations, cash flows and financial condition. Long-term Contracts Several of our power generation plants operate on a long term contract basis with one or a limited number of contracts related to both the fuel supply and power demand. The remaining periods for these long-term contracts range from 1 to 26 years. The ability of our customers and suppliers to perform under these contracts and our ability to negotiate new contracts upon expiration may have a significant impact on our results of operations in the future. LOOKING AHEAD WHAT IS OUR KEY FOCUS FOR 2005? Given the progress we have made in executing our restructuring programs, we are poised to continue to grow organically and through targeted and disciplined acquisition. We also will continue to pursue our long-term growth strategies on a disciplined basis. We are targeting four different dimensions within our targeted growth initiatives to include (1) expansion of existing business platforms; (2) targeted acquisitions; (3) Greenfield development; and (4) privatizations. 45 All of these areas of opportunity have a common theme which is to leverage our existing strengths and capitalize on favorable market conditions to improve gross margin, earnings per share and cash flows. The catalysts to further growth include both external and internal factors such as: Continued electricity demand growth in key markets; Attraction of private capital for emerging markets; and Government policies that encourage the development of new areas of opportunity including renewable energy. In each case, we will carefully consider whether proposed transactions have the appropriate risk/reward profile. Critical Accounting Estimates The consolidated financial statements of AES are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. AES significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Critical accounting estimates are described in this section. An accounting estimate is considered critical if: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or if changes in the estimate that would have a material impact on the Company financial condition or results of operations are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Income Taxes. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our worldwide income tax provision requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are under examination by relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. The Company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each of the taxing jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes. Tax reserves have been established, which the Company believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. While the Company believes that the amount of the tax estimates is reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may exceed current reserves in amounts that could be material. A range of these amounts cannot be reasonably estimated at December 31, 2004, as they are primarily unasserted claims. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act ( the AJCA ) was signed into law. The AJCA includes a deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined in the AJCA. The Company may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in 2005. The Company has started an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision in accordance with recently issued Treasury Department guidance. The Company expects to complete its evaluation early in 2005. The range of possible amounts that the Company is considering for repatriation under this provision is between zero and $150 million. The amount of income tax cannot be reasonably estimated. Long-Lived Assets. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, we periodically review the carrying value of our long-lived assets held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, and assets to be disposed of when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 46 or the assets meet the held for sale criteria under SFAS No. 144. These events or circumstances may include the relative pricing of wholesale electricity by region and the anticipated demand and cost of fuel. If the carrying amount is not recoverable, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. For regulated assets, an impairment charge could be offset by the establishment of a regulatory asset, if rate recovery was probable. For non-regulated assets, an impairment charge would be recorded as a charge against earnings. The fair value of an asset is the amount at which that asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, that is, other than a forced or liquidation sale. Quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for measurement, if available. In the absence of quoted market prices for identical or similar assets in active markets, fair value is estimated using various internal and external valuation methods including cash flow projections or other indicators of fair value such as bids received, comparable sales or independent appraisals. In connection with the periodic evaluation of long-lived assets in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 144, the fair value of the asset can vary if different estimates and assumptions would have been used in our applied valuation techniques. In cases of impairment described in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we made our best estimate of fair value using valuation methods based on the most current information at that time. We have been in the process of divesting certain assets and their sales values can vary from the recorded fair value as described in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Fluctuations in realized sales proceeds versus the estimated fair value of the asset are generally due to a variety of factors including differences in subsequent market conditions, the level of bidder interest, timing and terms of the transactions, and management analysis of the benefits of the transaction. Goodwill. We review the carrying value of our goodwill annually during the fourth quarter. We also review the carrying value of our goodwill periodically when events and circumstances warrant such a review. This review is performed using estimates of fair value and includes discounted future cash flows. If the carrying value of goodwill is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded. Pension and Postretirement Obligations. Certain of our foreign and domestic subsidiaries maintain defined benefit pension plans which we refer to as the pension plans, or the plans, covering substantially all of their respective employees. Pension benefits are generally based on years of credited service, age of the participant and average earnings. Of the thirteen pension plans existing at December 31, 2004, two exist at domestic subsidiaries and eleven exist at foreign subsidiaries. The measurement of our pension obligations, costs and liabilities is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries. These assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions. The plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets. The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: Discount rates Salary growth Retirement rates Inflation Expected return on plan assets Mortality rates 47 The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods. Sensitivity of our pension funded status and stockholders equity to the indicated increase or decrease in the discount rate assumption is shown below. Although not an estimate, we ve also included sensitivity around the actual return on pension assets. Note that these sensitivities may be asymmetric, and are specific to the base conditions at year-end 2004. They also may not be additive, so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities shown. The December 31, 2004 funded status is affected by December 31, 2004 assumptions. Pension expense for 2004 is affected by December 31, 2003 assumptions . The impact on our funded status, equity and U.S. pension expense from a one percentage point change in these assumptions is shown below (in millions): Increase of 1% in the discount rate $ (10 ) Decrease of 1% in the discount rate $ 16 Increase of 1% in the long-term rate of return on plan assets $ (11 ) Decrease of 1% in the long-term rate of return on plan assets $ 11 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities. The Company accounts for its regulated operations under the provisions of SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. As a result, AES records assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process that would not be recorded under GAAP for non-regulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers for previous collections for costs that are not likely to be incurred. Management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes, recent rate orders applicable to other regulated entities and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the asset write-offs would be required to be recognized in operating income. New Accounting Pronouncements Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Financial Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities An Interpretation of ARB No. 51 ( FIN 46 or Interpretation ). FIN 46 is an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin 51 Consolidated Financial Statements, and addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities ( VIE ). The primary objective of the Interpretation is to provide guidance on the identification of and financial reporting for, entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights; such entities are known as VIEs. The Interpretation requires an enterprise to consolidate a VIE if that enterprise has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entity expected losses if they occur, receive a majority of the entity expected residual returns if they occur or both. An enterprise shall consider the rights and obligations conveyed by its variable interests in making this determination. On December 24, 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (Revised 2003) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ( FIN 46(R) or Revised Interpretation ), which partially deferred the effective date of FIN 46 for certain entities and makes other changes to FIN 46, including a more complete definition of variable interest and an exemption for many entities defined as businesses. The Company applied FIN 46 in its financial statements relating to its interest in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities as of December 31, 2003, and applied FIN 46(R) as of March 31, 2004. The application of FIN 46(R) did not have an impact on the Company condensed consolidated financial statements for any quarter through December 31, 2004. 48 Share-Based Payment. In December 2004, the FASB issued a revised SFAS No.123 ( SFAS No. 123R ), Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS No. 123. SFAS No. 123R eliminates the intrinsic value method under APB 25 as an alternative method of accounting for stock-based awards by requiring that all share-based payments to employees, including grants of stock options for all outstanding years be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. It also revises the fair-value based method of accounting for share-based payment liabilities, forfeitures and modifications of stock-based awards and clarifies SFAS No. 123 guidance related to measurement of fair value, classifying an award as equity or as a liability and attributing compensation to reporting periods. In addition, SFAS No. 123R amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows, to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow. The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 123R for the interim period beginning July 1, 2005 using a modified version of prospective application. The Company may apply a modified retrospective application to periods before the required effective date. The Company plans to adopt SFAS No. 123R no later than July 1, 2005, but has not determined what method it will use. Management is currently evaluating the effect of adoption of SFAS No. 123R, but does not expect the adoption to have a material effect on the Company financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, as the Company had previously adopted income statement treatment for compensation related to share-based payments under SFAS No. 123. 49 Results of Operations For The Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 $ change 2004 vs. 2003 $ change 2003 vs. 2002 (in millions, except per share data) Gross Margin: Large utility $ 883 $ 766 $ 687 $ 117 $ 79 Growth distribution 223 183 15 40 168 Contract generation 1,430 1,267 1,065 163 202 Competitive supply 236 220 183 16 37 Total gross margin 2,772 2,436 1,950 336 486 General and administrative expenses(1) (182 ) (157 ) (112 ) (25 ) (45 ) Interest expense (1,910 ) (1,986 ) (1,744 ) 76 (242 ) Interest income 282 280 259 2 21 Other income, net 11 61 50 (50 ) 11 Loss on sale of investments, asset and goodwill impairment expense (41 ) (212 ) (1,114 ) 171 902 Foreign currency transaction (losses) gains on net monetary position (118 ) 130 (459 ) (248 ) 589 Equity in earnings (loss) of affiliates 70 94 (203 ) (24 ) 297 Income tax expense (249 ) (204 ) (293 ) (45 ) 89 Minority interest (expense) income (269 ) (110 ) 20 (159 ) (130 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations 366 332 (1,646 ) 34 1,978 Income (loss) from operations of discontinued businesses 20 (787 ) (1,567 ) 807 780 Cumulative effect of accounting change 41 (346 ) (41 ) 387 Net income (loss) $ 386 $ (414 ) $(3,559 ) $ 800 $3,145 PER SHARE DATA: Basic income (loss) per share from continuing operations $ 0.57 $ 0.56 $ (3.06 ) $ (0.01 ) $ 3.62 Diluted income (loss) per share from continuing operations $ 0.57 $ 0.56 $ (3.06 ) $ (0.01 ) $ 3.62 (1) General and administrative expenses are corporate and business development expenses. 50 Overview Revenue For the Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Revenue % of Total Revenues Revenue % of Total Revenues Revenue % of Total Revenues ($ in millions) Large Utilities $ 3,600 38 % $ 3,301 40 % $ 3,150 42 % Growth Distribution 1,320 14 % 1,126 13 % 868 12 % Regulated 4,920 52 % 4,427 53 % 4,018 54 % Contract Generation 3,546 37 % 3,108 37 % 2,550 35 % Competitive Supply 1,020 11 % 880 10 % 812 11 % Non-Regulated 4,566 48 % 3,988 47 % 3,362 46 % Total $ 9,486 100 % $ 8,415 100 % $ 7,380 100 % Revenues increased approximately $1.1 billion, or 13%, to $9.5 billion in 2004 from $8.4 billion in 2003. Excluding the estimated impacts of foreign currency translation effect, revenues would have increased approximately 11% from 2003 to 2004. The increase in revenues was due to higher tariff rates, increased contract pricing and new projects coming on line. Excluding businesses that commenced commercial operations in 2004 or 2003, revenues increased 11% to $9.3 billion in 2004. Revenues increased approximately $1.0 billion, or 14%, to $8.4 billion in 2003 from $7.4 billion in 2002. The increase in revenues was due to new operations from Greenfield projects and improvements from existing operations. Excluding businesses that commenced commercial operations in 2003 or 2002, revenues increased 8% to $8.0 billion in 2003.

This increase was primarily due to the impact of higher revenues in 2004 versus 2003, resulting from higher tariff rates, increased generation contract pricing and new projects coming on line. Excluding businesses that commenced commercial operations in 2004 or 2003, gross margin increased 11% to $2.7 billion in 2004. Gross margin as a percentage of revenues improved 30 basis points for the year to 29.2%. 51 Gross margin increased $486 million, or 25%, to $2.4 billion in 2003 from $2.0 billion in 2002. Gross margin as a percentage of revenues increased to 28.9% in 2003 from 26.4% in 2002. The increase was primarily due to new operations from Greenfield projects. Excluding businesses that commenced commercial operations in 2003 or 2002, gross margin increased 16% to $2.2 billion in 2003. Segment Analysis Large Utilities Revenue For the Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Revenue % of Total Revenues Revenue % of Total Revenues Revenue % of Total Revenues ($ in millions) North America $ 885 9 % $ 832 10 % $ 818 11 % South America 2,095 22 % 1,861 22 % 1,698 23 % Caribbean* 620 7 % 608 8 % 634 8 % Total $ 3,600 38 % $ 3,301 40 % $ 3,150 42 % * I ncludes Venezuela The increase in large utility segment revenue in 2004 of $299 million, or 9%, as compared to 2003 was primarily due to the contribution of our Brazilian subsidiary, Eletropaulo, where revenues increased $234 million as a result of increased tariffs and favorable exchange rates that were partially offset by lower sales volume. The average customer tariff at Eletropaulo increased in 2004 due to both a rate increase and an increase in residential consumption, although overall consumption decreased by 1%. This net increase in revenue in the large utility segment was also affected by an increase of 6% ($53 million) in revenues at our U.S. subsidiary, IPALCO, due to improved wholesale prices, recoveries of environmental compliance program investments and associated costs and increases in sales volumes. Revenues at our Venezuelan subsidiary, EDC increased 2% ($12 million) due to higher tariffs that were offset substantially by unfavorable exchange rates and reduced sales volumes. The increase in large utility segment revenue in 2003 of $151 million was primarily due to the consolidation of Eletropaulo for a full fiscal year compared to 11 months in 2002, where revenues increased $163 million compared to 2002. Total sales volume at Eletropaulo increased year over year by approximately 10%, although this was more than offset by a decline in the average customer tariff in 2003 resulting from a decrease in residential consumption. This net increase at Eletropaulo as well as an increase of 2% ($14 million) in revenues at IPALCO were partially offset by a 4% ($26 million) decline in revenues at EDC. 52 Large Utilities Gross Margin For the Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Gross Margin % of Total Gross Margin Gross Margin % of Total Gross Margin Gross Margin % of Total Gross Margin (Restated) ($ in millions) North America $ 303 11 % $ 282 12 % $ 302 16 % South America 364 13 % 255 10 % 165 8 % Caribbean* 216 8 % 229 9 % 220 11 % Total $ 883 32 % $ 766 31 % $ 687 35 % Large Utilities Gross Margin as a% of Large Utilities Revenue 24.5 % 23.2 % 21.8 % * Includes Venezuela Gross margin from our large utilities segment increased $117 million or 15% in 2004 as compared to 2003, primarily from increases at Eletropaulo and IPALCO, offset by decreases at EDC. Eletropaulo gross margin improved as the increased tariffs and the favorable effect of exchange rates on revenues were only partially offset by increased costs related to purchased electricity and bad debt provisions. IPALCO higher margin was due to the favorable effect on revenues of demand and tariffs, coupled with improvements in fuel volumes only partially offset by higher purchased electricity volumes and fixed costs. EDC gross margin decreased due to the unfavorable effect of exchange rates and lower demand on revenues coupled with higher fixed costs in 2004 compared to 2003. The large utilities segment gross margin as a percentage of large utility segment revenue increased to 24.5% for 2004 from 23.2% in 2003. Gross margin from our large utilities segment increased in 2003 due to higher gross margins in South America, which was due to a write-off of approximately $80 million of other receivables at Eletropaulo in 2002. EDC gross margin increased due to higher demand and increased tariffs in 2003 compared to 2002. IPALCO experienced a lower margin and margin percentage due to milder weather and higher operating and maintenance cost in 2003. The large utilities segment gross margin as a percentage of large utility segment revenue increased to 23.2% for 2003 from 21.8% in 2002. Growth Distribution Revenue For the Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Revenue % of Total Revenues Revenue % of Total Revenues Revenue % of Total Revenues ($ in millions) South America $ 494 5 % $ 415 5 % $ 263 4 % Caribbean 352 4 % 343 4 % 311 4 % Europe/Africa 474 5 % 368 4 % 294 4 % Total $ 1,320 14 % $ 1,126 13 % $ 868 12 % Revenue from the growth distribution segment in 2004 increased $194 million, or 17%, as compared to 2003. The principal contributions to the overall revenue growth came from our subsidiary in Cameroon, Sonel, where revenue increased by $81 million or 40% and our Brazilian subsidiaries, principally Sul, where revenues increased $62 million or 21%, due to increased customer tariffs, improved demand and favorable exchange rates. Additional contributions by Ukraine, where revenues increased $26 million or 53 16% as well as El Salvador, where revenue improved by $9 million or 3%, and finally Argentina, whose revenues exceeded 2003 by $18 million or 15%, were due to higher sales volumes and customer tariffs. Revenue from the growth distribution segment in 2003 increased $258 million as compared to 2002. The most significant component of the increase was due to the impact of the $146 million provision recorded at AES Sul related to a Brazilian regulatory decision. Additional significant contributions to the 2003 increase included an increase of $57 million at Sonel in Cameroon resulting from higher customer tariffs in 2003 and increased sales volumes, an increase of $30 million in our El Salvador distribution businesses because of higher sales volumes and increased tariffs and an increase in our Argentine distribution businesses primarily arising from the appreciation of the Argentine peso in 2003.

In Cameroon, the increase in the margin was caused by higher demand and tariffs offset by higher fixed costs, including a one-time $16 million severance charge taken in 2004. In Brazil and Ukraine, the improved margin was the result of higher tariffs and demand that were substantially offset by higher variable costs, primarily from purchased electricity. The decrease in the gross margin in El Salvador was the result of higher fixed costs that were not compensated by the increase in demand. Argentina margin remained stable between 2004 and 2003. The growth distribution gross margin as a percentage of growth distribution segment revenues slightly increased to 16.9% in 2004 from 16.3% in 2003. Gross margin from our growth distribution segment increased in 2003 due to increases at Sonel in Cameroon and Caess in El Salvador. Additionally, there was a non-recurring charge taken in 2002 for the write-off of $141 million related to MAE settlements at AES Sul in Brazil that did not occur in 2003. The growth distribution gross margin as a percentage of growth distribution segment revenues increased to 16.3% in 2003 from 1.7% in 2002. 54 Contract Generation Revenue For the Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Revenue % of Total Revenues Revenue % of Total Revenues Revenue % of Total Revenues ($ in millions) North America $ 884 9 % $ 876 10 % $ 852 12 % South America 1,118 12 % 922 11 % 850 12 % Caribbean 542 5 % 493 6 % 180 2 % Europe/Africa 432 5 % 415 5 % 365 5 % Asia 570 6 % 402 5 % 303 4 % Total $ 3,546 37 % $ 3,108 37 % $ 2,550 35 % Revenue from the contract generation segment for 2004 increased $438 million, or 14%, over 2003 primarily due to increased contract pricing at Tiet in Brazil (consisting of a group of hydro-electric plants providing electricity primarily to Eletropaulo), Gener in Chile, Kilroot in Northern Ireland and Merida III in Mexico. The completion of Ras Laffan power and water desalination plant in Qatar contributed significantly to the increase in revenues as well as the reporting of a full year operating results for businesses that came on line in 2003 (Barka in Oman and Andres in the Dominican Republic). Excluding the estimated impacts of foreign currency translation effect, revenues would have increased approximately 12% from 2003 to 2004. Favorable foreign currency translation effects positively impacted revenues at Kilroot in Northern Ireland, Tiet in Brazil, Tisza in Hungary and Gener in Chile. These revenue increases were partially offset by lower volumes at Tisza in Hungary as a result of outages to perform plant upgrades in 2004. Revenue from the contract generation segment for 2003 increased $558 million over 2002 primarily due to the addition of recently completed businesses including Red Oak in New Jersey (which reported results from operations for a full year), Puerto Rico L.P. in Puerto Rico, Kelanitissa in Sri Lanka, Barka in Oman, Ras Laffan in Qatar and Andres in the Dominican Republic. Together, these businesses contributed $407 million, or 73%, of the increase for 2003. Revenues also improved over the same time period at Los Mina in the Domincan Republic, Merida III in Mexico, Tisza in Hungary, Gener in Chile, and Tiet in Brazil. These improvements were offset by declines at Shady Point in Oklahoma, due to a scheduled decrease in the contracted capacity payment, and at Lal Pir and Pak Gen in Pakistan, because of lower energy dispatch in 2003.

The completion of Ras Laffan power and water desalination plant in Qatar contributed significantly to the increase in gross margin as well as the reporting of a full year operating results for businesses that came on line in 2003 (Barka in Oman and Andres in the Dominican Republic). This gross margin increase was partially offset by higher fuel costs at Gener in Chile, Merida III in Mexico and Kilroot in Northern Ireland, as well as by increased depreciation and other fixed costs. The contract generation gross margin as a percentage of revenues slightly decreased to 40.3% in 2004 from 40.8% in 2003. Gross margin from our contract generation segment increased in 2003 because of improvements at Tiet in Brazil, and Ebute in Nigeria compared to 2002. Additionally, new plants came online and contributed to the increase. These new plants include Red Oak in New Jersey, Puerto Rico L.P. in Puerto Rico, Kelanitissa in Sri Lanka, Barka in Oman, Ras Laffan in Qatar and Andres in the Dominican Republic. These increases were partially offset by declines in gross margin at Beaver Valley and Ironwood in Pennsylvania, Shady Point in Oklahoma, Kilroot in Northern Ireland and the Chigen plants in China. The contract generation gross margin as a percentage of contract generation revenues decreased to 40.8% in 2003 from 41.8% in 2002. Competitive Supply Revenue For the Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Revenue % of Total Revenues Revenue % of Total Revenues Revenue % of Total Revenues ($ in millions) North America $ 446 5 % $ 451 5 % $ 417 6 % South America 178 3 % 110 1 % 74 1 % Caribbean 122 1 % 84 1 % 69 1 % Europe/Africa 137 1 % 132 2 % 162 2 % Asia 137 1 % 103 1 % 90 1 % Total $ 1,020 11 % $ 880 10 % $ 812 11 % Revenue from our competitive supply segment for 2004 increased $140 million, or 16%, over 2003 primarily due to the significantly higher than expected dispatch of AES coal-fired plant in Argentina, CTSN, as a result of increased demand caused by gas shortages in Argentina. The completion of AES Greenfield hydroelectric project in Panama (Esti), combined with the expansion of another hydroelectric project in Panama (Bayano), resulted in increased revenues. Higher competitive market prices for electricity sold at Parana in Argentina, Ekibastuz in Kazakhstan and CTSN in Argentina also contributed to this revenue growth. Excluding the estimated impacts of foreign currency translation effect, revenues would have increased approximately 13% from 2003 to 2004. Favorable foreign currency translation effects positively impacted revenues at Borsod and Altai in Hungary, Ekibastuz in Kazakhstan and Ottana in Italy. Revenue from our competitive supply segment for 2003 increased $68 million over 2002 due primarily to an increase of $54 million in the revenues at our New York plants, where average competitive market prices for electricity sold by those plants increased approximately 29% over 2002. The remaining net increase resulted from improvements at several other plants including Alicura and Parana in Argentina, Panama in the Caribbean and Ekibastuz in Kazakhstan. These increases were partially offset by decreased revenues from Deepwater in Texas due to an extended outage in 2003 and the termination of a small retail electricity business in the U.K. in early 2003. 56 Competitive Supply Gross Margin For the Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Gross Margin % of Total Gross Margin Gross Margin % of Total Gross Margin Gross Margin % of Total Gross Margin ($ in millions) North America $ 92 3 % $ 113 5 % $ 96 5 % South America 63 2 % 43 2 % 19 1 % Caribbean 42 2 % 36 1 % 32 1 % Europe/Africa 4 % 3 % 17 1 % Asia 35 1 % 25 1 % 19 1 % Total $ 236 8 % $ 220 9 % $ 183 9 % Competitive Supply Gross Margin as a % of Competitive Supply Revenue 23.1 % 25.0 % 22.5 % Gross margin from our competitive supply segment increased $16 million, or 7%, in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to the significantly higher dispatch of AES coal-fired plant in Argentina, CTSN, as well as the completion of AES Greenfield and expansion hydroelectric projects in Panama. Higher competitive market prices for electricity sold at Parana in Argentina, Ekibastuz in Kazakhstan and CTSN in Argentina also contributed to this gross margin growth. The competitive supply gross margin as a percentage of competitive supply revenues decreased to 23.1% in 2004 from 25.0% in 2003. This decrease was primarily due to higher fuel costs for our businesses in the U.S. (New York) and in South America (Parana), as well as increased depreciation and other fixed costs for our new Greenfield and expansion hydroelectric projects in Panama. Gross margin from our competitive supply segment increased in 2003 due to improvements at the New York plants, CTSN and Parana in South America and Altai in Asia. These increases were partially offset by lower margins and margin percentages at Deepwater in Texas and Borsod in Hungary. The competitive supply gross margin as a percentage of competitive supply revenues increased to 25.0% in 2003 from 22.5% in 2002. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses increased $25 million, or 16% to $182 million in 2004 from 2003 and also increased $45 million, or 40% to $157 million in 2003 from 2002. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained at 2% in 2004, 2003 and 2002. The increases are a result of additional corporate personnel and expensing of annual awards of stock options and other long-term incentive compensation. Additional personnel have been added at the parent company over the past two years to support our key initiatives related to strategy, safety, compliance, information systems and controls. In addition, a higher level of consulting costs were incurred in 2004 and 2003 respectively related to our internal controls reviews as a result of Sarbanes-Oxley and other consulting costs related to implementation of our new corporate initiatives. Interest expense Interest expense decreased $76 million, or 4%, to $1,910 million in 2004 from $1,986 million in 2003. Interest expense as a percentage of revenues decreased from 24% in 2003 to 20% for 2004. Interest expense decreased primarily due to a reduction of debt associated with the Brazil debt restructuring completed at the end of 2003 and debt refinancings and paydowns offset by interest expense from new 57 projects coming on-line in 2004, new project financings and unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts. Interest expense increased $242 million, or 14%, to $1,986 million in 2003 from $1,744 million in 2002. Interest expense as a percentage of revenues remained at 24% in 2003 and 2002. Increases due to accrual of $194 million of default interest at Eletropaulo, increased interest at Corporate due to higher rates on refinanced debt and interest from Greenfield projects that were brought on-line in late 2002 or 2003 were slightly offset by lower interest at Southland due to lower rates and no interest expense for Cemig due to the deconsolidation of that entity in 2002. Interest income Interest income increased $2 million to $282 million in 2004 from $280 million in 2003. Interest income as a percentage of revenues remained constant at 3% in 2004 and 2003. Interest income increased primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation and higher interest on spot market and customer receivables offset by a reclassification adjustment associated with the Eletropaulo settlement of certain outstanding municipal receivables. Interest income increased $21 million, or 8%, to $280 million in 2003 from $259 million in 2002. Interest income as a percentage of revenues was 3% in 2003 and 4% in 2002. The increase in interest income during 2003 was due primarily to a $58 million increase in interest earnings in Eletropaulo related to its regulatory asset and accounts receivable. The increase in Eletropaulo in 2003 over 2002 was partially offset by a general decline in interest earnings due to lower interest rates. Other income Other income decreased $9 million to $162 million in 2004 from $171 million in 2003. Other income in 2004 primarily consists of a $64 million gain on debt extinguishment related to one of our businesses in Argentina, $21 million for gains on settlement of disputes and $13 million for gains on the sale of assets. Included in 2003 was approximately $141 million related to gains on extinguishment of debt and $30 million of other income. Other income increased $38 million to $171 million in 2003 from $133 million in 2002. Activity in 2003 was driven by $141 million related to gains on extinguishment of debt and $30 million of other income. There were $61 million related to gains on extinguishment of debt in 2002 along with $29 million for mark-to-market on commodity derivatives and $12 million for gains on the sale of assets. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for an analysis of other income. Other expense Other expense increased $41 million to $151 million in 2004 from $110 million in 2003. Other expense primarily consists of losses on the sale of assets, losses associated with the early extinguishment of debt and dispute settlements. Other expense increased $27 million to $110 million in 2003 from $83 million in 2002. Approximately $57 million of other expense recorded in 2003 was attributable to mark-to-market loss on commodity derivatives and debt refinancing costs. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for an analysis of other expense. 58 Loss on sale of investments and asset impairments Loss on sale of investments and asset impairment expense was $41 million in 2004 compared to $201 million in 2003 primarily from fewer impairment charges being taken in 2004. The amount of asset impairment expense for 2004, includes the write-off of $25 million of capitalized costs associated with a fertilizer development project at our Deepwater facility in Texas. This project was terminated in the fourth quarter of 2004. It also includes a $15 million asset impairment charge taken to reflect the net realizable value of an investment in one of our Chinese businesses which we expect to sell. Loss on sale of investments and asset impairment expense decreased to a loss of $201 million in 2003 compared to a loss of $473 million in 2002 primarily from fewer impairment charges being taken in 2003. In 2003, the following actions were taken which led to the recording of impairment charges: In December 2003, we sold an approximate 39% ownership interest in AES Oasis Limited ( AES Oasis ) for cash proceeds of approximately $150 million. The loss realized on the transaction was approximately $36 million before income taxes. AES Oasis is an entity that owns an electric generation project in Oman (AES Barka) and two oil-fired generating facilities in Pakistan (AES Lal Pir and AES Pak Gen). AES Barka, AES Lal Pir, and AES Pak Gen are all contract generation businesses. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we decided to discontinue the development of Zeg, a contract generation plant under construction in Poland. In connection with this decision, we wrote-off our investment in Zeg of approximately $23 million before income taxes. In August 2003, we decided to discontinue the construction and development of AES Nile Power in Uganda ( Bujagali ). In connection with this decision, we wrote-off our investment in Bujagali of approximately $76 million before income taxes in the third quarter of 2003. During the second quarter of 2003, we wrote off capitalized costs of approximately $20 million associated with our development project in Honduras when we elected to offer the project for sale after consideration of existing business conditions and future opportunities. The project consisted of a 580 MW combined-cycle power plant fueled by natural gas, a liquefied natural gas import terminal with storage capacity of one million barrels and transmission lines and line upgrades. The project was sold in January 2004. Additionally, during 2003, we recorded $16 million of other losses which resulted from the sale of assets to third parties, and $29 million of other asset impairment charges taken to reflect the net realizable value of discontinued development projects and other non-recoverable assets. In 2002, the following impairment charges were taken: In the fourth quarter of 2002, we decided not to provide any further funding to Lake Worth, a 205 MW gas plant in Florida, and to sell the project. Subsequently the project entered into bankruptcy. As a result, the carrying amount of AES investment in the Lake Worth project was not expected to be recovered. Therefore, in accordance with SFAS No. 144, a pre-tax impairment charge of $78 million was recorded to write-down the net assets of Lake Worth to their net realizable value. In September 2002, AES Greystone, L.L.C. and its subsidiary Haywood Power I, L.L.C., sold the Greystone gas-fired peaker assets then under construction in Tennessee to Tenaska Power Equipment for $36 million including cash and assumption of certain obligations. With this sale, AES and its subsidiaries have eliminated any future capital expenditures related to the facility, and also settled all major outstanding obligations with parties involved in this project. We recorded a loss of approximately $168 million associated with this sale. Greystone was previously recorded as a competitive supply business. 59 Additionally, during 2002, we recorded $116 million of other losses which resulted from the sale of assets to third parties, and $111 million of other asset impairment charges taken to reflect the net realizable value of discontinued development projects and other non-recoverable assets. Goodwill impairment expense During 2003, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $11 million primarily related to all of the goodwill at Atlantis, an aragonite mining operation in the Caribbean. The write-off was due to a reduction in the fair value of the business below its carrying value due to a slow down of operations from the termination of sales contracts that have not been replaced. During 2002, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $641 million primarily related to all of the goodwill at Eletropaulo in Brazil. The fair value of the business was less than the carrying value due to slower than anticipated recovery to pre-rationing electricity consumption levels and lower electricity prices due to devaluation of foreign exchange rates. Foreign currency transaction (losses) gains on net monetary position The Company recognized foreign currency transaction losses of $118 million in 2004 compared to gains from foreign currency transactions of $130 million in 2003. The $248 million decrease for 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily related to losses in Brazil, Argentina, and the Dominican Republic. Foreign currency transaction losses increased primarily due to lower annual appreciation in 2004 of the Brazilian real of 7.5% compared to 23.7% in 2003 contributing to $179 million of the change year over year. The Argentine peso devalued 1.7% during 2004 thereby contributing $46 million of losses to the overall change. Additionally, the Dominican peso appreciated 31.2% during 2004. This is related to one of our Dominican businesses which has a net monetary liability position denominated in the Dominican peso. This appreciation in the Dominican peso contributed to the change year over year by $21 million in losses. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction gains of $130 million in 2003 compared to a loss of $459 million in 2002. This $589 million increase related to exchange rate changes in Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela. Foreign currency transaction gains increased primarily due to a 23.7% appreciation of the Brazilian real during 2003 compared to devaluation of 33.5% during 2002. This appreciation resulted in gains in 2003 compared to losses in 2002 and an overall change of $444 million. Additionally, the Argentine peso appreciated 13.3% during 2003. This appreciation resulted in gains in 2003 compared to losses in 2002 and an overall change of $245 million. These gains were offset by foreign currency transaction losses recorded at EDC during 2003 due to a 12% devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar and a year over year change of $102 million. Since EDC uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency and a portion of its debt is denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar, EDC will experience losses when the currency devalues. Equity in earnings of affiliates Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased $24 million, or 26%, to $70 million in 2004 from $94 million in 2003. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of our ownership in Medway Power Ltd. in 2003 offset by slight increases from Chigen in our contract generation business. Equity in (losses) earnings of affiliates increased by $297 million to income of $94 million in 2003 compared to a loss of $203 million in 2002. The overall increase was due primarily to the change of control in February 2002 of Eletropaulo, and an impairment charge taken for an other than temporary decline in the value of CEMIG in 2002. 60 Income taxes Income tax expense (including income tax on equity in earnings) on continuing operations increased $45 million to $249 million in 2004 from $204 million in 2003. The Company effective tax rate was 28% for 2004 and 32% for 2003. The effective tax rate decreased in spite of higher U.S. taxes on distributions from and earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. Such higher U.S. taxes were more than offset by reduced income taxes on the Company non-U.S. subsidiaries. Income tax expense (including income taxes on equity in earnings) on continuing operations decreased from $293 million in 2002 to $204 million in 2003. The effective tax rate decreased from (21)% in 2002 (we had a tax expense on a loss from continuing operations) to 32% in 2003. The reduction in the 2003 effective tax rate was due, in part, to a reduction in the taxes on our foreign earnings. In addition, the 2002 effective tax rate was not in line with our historic effective tax rate trend as it was the result of significant book write offs that were not deductible for tax purposes. Minority Interest Minority interest expense increased $159 million to $269 million in 2004 from $110 million in 2003. The increase is primarily due to the sale of stock by our subsidiary in Brazil, the sale of a portion of our interest in Oasis and higher earnings for Ras Laffan being allocated to the minorities since the project came on-line in 2004. Minority interest expense increased $130 million to $110 million in 2003 from minority interest income of $20 million in 2002. The increase is primarily due to the deconsolidation of CEMIG in 2002 and recording more losses related to Parana due to the minority owners investment being reduced to zero in 2003. Discontinued operations Income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax, was $20 million in 2004 related to the sales of Whitefield, AES Communications Bolivia, Colombia I, Ede Este, Wolf Hollow, Carbones Internacionales del Cesar S.A. and Granite Ridge. All of these entities had originally been recorded in discontinued operation in either 2003 or 2002. Additionally, in 2004, as a result of filing our 2003 tax returns, previously recorded estimates of the tax effect of the discontinued businesses were adjusted to reflect the final tax returns. As a result, favorable tax adjustments are reflected in the net income of discontinued operations. As of December 31, 2004, no further businesses were classified as discontinued operations. Loss from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax, was $787 million in 2003. During 2003, we discontinued certain of our operations including Haripur, Meghnaghat, Barry, Telasi, Mtkvari, Khrami, Drax, Whitefield, AES Communications Bolivia, Granite Ridge, Ede Este, Wolf Hollow and Colombia I. We closed the sale of Barry in September 2003, Telasi, Mtkvari and Khrami in August 2003 and Haripur and Meghnaghat in December 2003. Loss from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax, was $1,567 million in 2002. During 2002, we discontinued certain of our operations including Fifoots, CILCORP, NewEnergy, Eletronet, Mt. Stuart, Ecogen, two Altai businesses, Mountainview and Kelvin. We closed the sale of both CILCORP and Mt. Stuart in January 2003 and the sale of Ecogen in February 2003. Change in accounting principle On January 1, 2003, we adopted SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations which requires companies to record the fair value of a legal liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. The items that are part of the scope of SFAS No. 143 for our business 61 primarily include active ash landfills, water treatment basins and the removal or dismantlement of certain plant and equipment. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 resulted in a cumulative reduction to income of $2 million, net of income tax effects. On October 1, 2003, we adopted Derivative Implementation Group ( DIG ) Issue C-20 which superseded and clarified DIG Issue C-11 regarding the treatment of power sales contracts. As a result of this adoption, we had a Power Purchase Agreement ( PPA ) that was previously treated as a normal sales and purchase contract that was treated as a derivative instrument under SFAS No. 133 and marked-to-market upon adoption of DIG Issue C-20. The prospective method of accounting for this PPA requires no further mark-to-market treatment, and the initial mark-to-market adjustment will be subsequently amortized over the life of the contract. The adoption of DIG Issue C-20, effective October 1, 2003 results in a cumulative increase to income of $43 million, net of income tax effects. On April 1, 2002, we adopted Derivative Implementation Group ( DIG ) Issue C-15 which established specific guidelines for certain contracts to be considered normal purchases and normal sales contracts under SFAS No. 133. As a result of this adoption, we had two contracts which no longer qualified as normal purchases and normal sales contracts and were required to be treated as derivative instruments under SFAS No. 133. The adoption of DIG Issue C-15, effective April 1, 2002, resulted in a cumulative increase to income of $127 million, net of income tax effects. Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets which established accounting and reporting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets. The adoption of SFAS No. 142 resulted in a cumulative reduction to income of $473 million, net of income tax effects. SFAS No. 142 adopts a fair value model for evaluating impairment of goodwill in place of the recoverability model used previously. We wrote-off the goodwill associated with certain acquisitions where the current fair market value of such businesses was less than the current carrying value of the business, primarily as a result of reductions in fair value associated with lower than expected growth in electricity consumption compared to the original estimates made at the date of acquisition. Capital Resources and Liquidity Overview We are a holding company that conducts all of our operations through subsidiaries. We have, to the extent achievable, utilized non-recourse debt to fund a significant portion of the capital expenditures and investments required to construct and acquire our electric power plants, distribution companies and related assets. This type of financing is non-recourse to other subsidiaries and affiliates and to us (as parent company), and is generally secured by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts and cash flow of the related subsidiary or affiliate. At December 31, 2004, we had $5.2 billion of recourse debt and $13.4 billion of non-recourse debt outstanding. For more information on our long-term debt see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. In addition to the non-recourse debt, if available, we, as the parent company, provide a portion, or in certain instances all, of the remaining long-term financing or credit required to fund development, construction or acquisition. These investments have generally taken the form of equity investments or loans, which are subordinated to the project non-recourse loans. We generally obtain the funds for these investments from our cash flows from operations and/or the proceeds from our issuances of debt, common stock and other securities. Similarly, in certain of our businesses, we may provide financial guarantees or other credit support for the benefit of counterparties who have entered into contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity with our subsidiaries. In such circumstances, if a subsidiary defaults on its payment or supply obligation, we will be responsible for the subsidiary obligations up to the amount provided for in the relevant guarantee or other credit support. 62 We intend to continue to seek where possible non-recourse debt financing in connection with the assets or businesses that our affiliates or we may develop, construct or acquire. However, depending on market conditions and the unique characteristics of individual businesses, non-recourse debt may not be available or available on economically attractive terms. If we decide not to provide any additional funding or credit support to a subsidiary that is under construction or has near-term debt payment obligations and that subsidiary is unable to obtain additional non-recourse debt, such subsidiary may become insolvent and we may lose our investment in such subsidiary. Additionally, if any of our subsidiaries lose a significant customer, the subsidiary may need to restructure the non-recourse debt financing. If such subsidiary is unable to successfully complete a restructuring of the non-recourse debt, we may lose our investment in such subsidiary. As a result of AES parent below-investment-grade rating, counter-parties may be unwilling to accept our general unsecured commitments to provide credit support. Accordingly, with respect to both new and existing commitments, we may be required to provide some other form of assurance, such as a letter of credit, to backstop or replace our credit support. We may not be able to provide adequate assurances to such counter-parties. In addition, to the extent we are required and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such counterparties, this will reduce the amount of credit available to us to meet our other liquidity needs. At December 31, 2004, we had provided outstanding financial and performance related guarantees or other credit support commitments to or for the benefit of our subsidiaries, which were limited by the terms of the agreements, in an aggregate of approximately $562 million (including those collateralized by letters of credit and other obligations discussed below). At December 31, 2004, we had $98 million in letters of credit outstanding, which operate to guarantee performance relating to certain project development activities and subsidiary operations. All of these letters of credit were provided under our revolver. We pay letter of credit fees ranging from 0.5% to 3.5% per annum on the outstanding amounts. In addition, we had $4 million in surety bonds outstanding at December 31, 2004. Many of our subsidiaries including those in Central and South America depend on timely and continued access to capital markets to manage their liquidity needs. The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, to refinance existing indebtedness or to fund operations and other commitments during times of political or economic uncertainty may adversely affect those subsidiaries financial condition and results of operations. In addition, changes in the timing of tariff increases or delays in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions could affect the cash flows and results of operations of our businesses in Brazil and Venezuela. Management believes that cash on hand, along with cash generated through operations, and our financing availability will be sufficient to fund normal operations, capital expenditures, and debt service requirements. Capital Expenditures We spent $892 million and $1,228 million on capital expenditures in 2004 and 2003, respectively. We anticipate capital expenditures during 2005 to approximate the amount in 2004. Planned capital expenditures include new project construction costs, environmental pollution control construction and expenditures for existing assets to increase their useful lives. Capital expenditures for 2005 are expected to be financed using internally generated cash provided by operations and project level financing. Cash Flows At December 31, 2004, we had $1,408 million of cash and cash equivalents representing a decrease of $329 million from December 31, 2003. The Company paid down in excess of $700 million of debt and funded approximately $900 million of property additions from operating cash flow generated this year and the use of some of our existing cash balances. 63 Operating Activities 2004 2003 Change (in millions) Increase in accounts receivable $ (128 ) $ (101 ) $ (27 ) Increase in inventory (33 ) (2 ) (31 ) Decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets 3 112 (109 ) Increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 236 695 (459 ) Total working capital $ 78 $ 704 $ (626 ) The cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $1,568 million during 2004, which was $8 million lower than 2003. The primary reason for the slight decrease in cash flows from operations was an increase in net earnings (adjusted for non-cash items) of $604 million which was more than offset by $626 million of changes in working capital. The working capital change was mainly driven by changes in prepaid expenses and other current assets and accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The change in prepaid expenses and other current assets is being driven by our large utilities segment. The change is related to a settlement of a receivable from the Brazilian Wholesale Electricity Market ( MAE ) regulatory body in 2003 for energy capacity that was sold in the market in the prior year when demand for energy was low. In 2004, the settlement from MAE was much less as the demand for electricity stabilized. The change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities also was driven by our large utilities and contract generation segments. In the large utilities segment, the majority of the change is due to the payment of outstanding payables in 2004 related to the period prior to the debt restructuring in Brazil. Our business in Venezuela experienced a slow down in accounts payable payments at the end of 2003 due to the political situation in that country. Those payments were caught up on in the beginning of 2004. In the contract generation segment we had a build up in 2003 of construction liabilities at one of our plants in the Middle East due to the plant approaching its commercial operations date. When the plant began operations in 2004 the construction related liabilities were paid. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $986 million during 2004. The cash used in investing activities includes $892 million for property additions, an increase in debt service reserve and other assets of $151 million, and other cash inflows of $57 million. The increase in cash flows used in investing activities is due to an increase in debt service reserves and other assets of $125 million from the prior year and a reduction in the proceeds from the sale of assets of $1,023 million. This is offset by a reduction from 2003 in property additions and restricted cash of $336 million and $182 million respectively. Debt service reserves and other assets increased mainly as a result of the construction activity at our Cartagena plant due to increased equity contributions which were placed into an escrow deposit. In 2003, we received approximately $898 million of proceeds from the sale of our subsidiaries. The decrease in property additions in 2004 is attributable to the completion of construction projects in the Caribbean and Middle East of $193 million and $68 million respectively. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $936 million during 2004, which primarily consists of refinancing and principal payments cash outflow of $734 million, net of issuances, and payments for deferred financing costs of $109 million. The increase in cash used in financing activities in 2004 primarily reflects the reduction in our borrowings of $1,674 million compared to 2003 and the decline in proceeds from the issuance of stock. We reduced our borrowings by approximately $2 billion on our parent recourse debt in comparison to borrowings in 2003. In 2004 we received $16 million in proceeds from stock option 64 exercises compared to proceeds of $334 million in 2003 from our stock offering and proceeds of $3 million from stock option exercises. Contractual Obligations A summary of the Company contractual obligations, commitments and other liabilities as of December 31, 2004 is presented in the table below. Contractual Obligations Total Less then 1 year 2-3 years 3-5 years After 5 years Footnote Reference Debt Obligations(1) $ 18,583 1,760 2,677 2,961 11,185 8 Capital Lease Obligations(2) 83 5 9 9 60 10 Other Long-term Liabilities Reflected on AES Consolidated Balance Sheet under GAAP(3) 70 14 34 5 17 n/a Operating Lease Obligations(4) 149 10 19 18 102 10 Sale Leaseback Obligations(5) 1,436 59 124 126 1,127 10 Purchase Take-or-Pay Obligations(6) 18,367 982 1,966 2,209 13,210 10 Fuel Contract Obligations(7) 10,386 916 1,504 1,210 6,756 Other(8) 292 114 59 64 55 Total $ 49,366 $ 3,860 $ 6,392 $ 6,602 $ 32,512 (1) Debt Obligations Debt obligations includes non-recourse debt and recourse debt presented on our consolidated financial statements. Non-recourse debt borrowings are not a direct obligation of The AES Corporation, the parent company, and are primarily collateralized by the capital stock of the relevant subsidiary and in certain cases the physical assets of, and all significant agreements associated with, such subsidiaries. These non-recourse financings include structured project financings, acquisition financings, working capital facilities and all other consolidated debt of the subsidiaries. Recourse debt borrowings are the borrowings of The AES Corporation, the parent company. Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K provides disclosure of these obligations. (2) Capital Lease Obligations One of AES subsidiaries, AES Indian Queens Power Limited, conducts a major part of its operations from leased facilities. The plant lease is for 25 years expiring in 2022. In addition, several AES subsidiaries lease operating and office equipment, and vehicles. The total capital lease obligation of $83 million represents the future minimum lease commitments. The present value of the capital lease obligations included in the consolidated balance sheet totals $48 million. Imputed interest for these obligations total $35 million. (3) Other long-term liabilities reflected on AES consolidated balance sheet under GAAP include only those amounts in long-term liabilities reflected on the Company consolidated balance sheet that are contractual obligations. These amounts do not include (1) current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, (2) any taxes or regulatory liabilities, (3) contingencies, (4) pension and other than pension employee benefit liabilities (see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K). (4) As of December 31, 2004, the Company was obligated under long-term non-cancelable operating leases, primarily for office rental and site leases. These amounts exclude amounts related to the sale/leaseback discussed below in item (5). (5) In May 1999, a subsidiary of the Company acquired six electric generating stations from New York State Electric and Gas ( NYSEG ). Concurrently, the subsidiary sold two of the plants to an unrelated third party for $666 million and simultaneously entered into a leasing arrangement with the 65 unrelated party. This transaction has been accounted for as a sale/leaseback with operating lease treatment. (6) Some of our operating subsidiaries have entered into take-or-pay contracts for the purchase of electricity from third parties. (7) Some of our operating subsidiaries have entered into various long-term contracts for the purchase of fuel subject to termination only in certain limited circumstances. (8) Amounts relate to other contractual obligations where the Company has an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the Company that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Included in the total amount is (1) $149 million of other take-or-pay contracts denoted in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, (2) $44 million of capital costs of AEE, a U.S. subsidiary of the Company, to install the MCP Project at Greenidge Unit 4 denoted in Item 3 of this Form 10-K, and (3) $99 million related to other service and fuel contracts. These amounts also exclude planned capital expenditures that are not contractually obligated. Parent Company Liquidity Because of the non-recourse nature of most of our indebtedness, we believe that unconsolidated parent company liquidity is an important measure of liquidity. Our principal sources of liquidity at the parent company level are: dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries, including refinancing proceeds; proceeds from debt and equity financings at the parent company level, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility; and proceeds from asset sales. Our cash requirements at the parent company level through the end of 2004 are primarily to fund: interest and preferred dividends; principal repayments of debt; construction commitments; other equity commitments; taxes; and parent company overhead and development costs. 66 During the past three years, we undertook numerous actions designed to increase parent liquidity, lengthen parent debt maturities, and reduce parent debt and other contractual obligations, both contingent and non-contingent. These actions are consistent with our strategic goals of improving the credit profile of both the parent and the consolidated company in order to reduce our financial risk and improve our credit rating by the major rating agencies. Parent liquidity was as follows at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002: 2004 2003 2002 (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,408 $ 1,737 $ 792 Less: cash and cash equivalents at subsidiaries 1,121 872 604 Parent cash and cash equivalents 287 865 188 Borrowing available under revolving credit facility 352 180 18 Cash at qualified holding companies 4 25 10 Total parent liquidity $ 643 $ 1,070 $ 216 Our parent recourse debt at year-end was approximately $5.2 billion, $5.9 billion, and $6.8 billion in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our contingent contractual obligations were $562 million, $608 million, and $871 million at the end of 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The primary actions we undertook in 2004 at the parent level to achieve these goals included: (i) exchanging common stock for recourse debt, (ii) refinancing recourse debt to mature at later dates, (iii) reducing interest costs associated with our senior secured credit facilities, and (iv) redeeming recourse debt. In February 2004, we called for redemption of $155 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 8% senior notes due 2008, which represents the entire outstanding principal amount of the 8% senior notes due 2008, and $34 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 10% secured senior notes due 2005. In February 2004, we issued $500 million of unsecured senior notes bearing a coupon rate of 7.75%. The unsecured senior notes mature in 2014 and are callable at our option at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the unsecured senior notes plus a make-whole premium. The unsecured senior notes were issued at a price of 98.288% and pay interest semi-annually. In March 2004, we increased the size of our secured revolving credit facility from $250 million to $450 million through an expanded group of global financial institutions. We also negotiated amendments to our secured bank agreement, which includes the revolving credit facility and a $200 million secured term loan. In August 2004, we amended our $650 million credit facilities to reduce borrowing costs under the facilities. The interest rate on the $450 million revolving facility was reduced to LIBOR plus 2.5% and the interest rate on the $200 million term loan was reduced to LIBOR plus 2.25%. Previously, borrowings under both facilities were LIBOR plus 4%. In addition, the term loan maturity was extended from 2007 to 2011. The revolving credit facility maturity date of 2007 remained unchanged. These amendments modified various prepayment provisions. In December 2004, we redeemed all of the remaining $153 million of our 10% senior secured notes due 2005, all of the remaining $113 million of our 8.375% senior subordinated notes due 2007, and a portion of our 8.5% senior subordinated notes due 2007 amounting to $66 million. At various times during the first three quarters of 2004, we issued an aggregate of 19.6 million common shares of AES in exchange for $165 million of aggregate principal amount of various series of recourse debt at the parent level. 67 In addition, the Company redeemed an additional aggregate amount of approximately $45 million of the 10% senior secured notes due 2005. These redemptions were in accordance with various mandatory prepayments contained in the indentures of those securities. At various times during the first three quarters the company retired an additional aggregate amount of $69 million of various series of recourse debt at the parent level through open market repurchases. As a result of the actions described above, we reduced recourse debt by approximately $800 million and increased our average term of our recourse debt maturities from 8.9 years at December 31, 2003 to 9.2 years at December 31, 2004. The following table sets forth our parent company contingent contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004: Contingent contractual obligations Amount Number of Agreements Exposure Range for Each Agreement ($ in millions) Guarantees $ 460 46 <$1 - $100 Letters of credit under the Revolver 98 20 <$1 - $42 Surety bonds 4 5 <$1 - $3 Total $ 562 71 We have a varied portfolio of performance related contingent contractual obligations. Amounts related to the balance sheet items represent credit enhancements made by us at the parent company level and by other third parties for the benefit of the lenders associated with the non-recourse debt recorded as liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These obligations are designed to cover potential risks and only require payment if certain targets are not met or certain contingencies occur. The risks associated with these obligations include change of control, construction cost overruns, political risk, tax indemnities, spot market power prices, supplier support and liquidated damages under power sales agreements for projects in development, under construction and operating. While we do not expect that we will be required to fund any material amounts under these contingent contractual obligations during 2004 or beyond that are not recorded on the balance sheet, many of the events which would give rise to such an obligation are beyond our control. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to fund our obligations under these contingent contractual obligations if we are required to make substantial payments thereunder. While we believe that our sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our needs through the end of 2005, this belief is based on a number of material assumptions, including, without limitation, assumptions about exchange rates, power market pool prices and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. In addition, our project subsidiaries ability to declare and pay cash dividends to us (at the parent company level) is subject to certain limitations contained in project loans, governmental provisions and other agreements. We can provide no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated. We have met our interim needs for shorter-term and working capital financing at the parent company level with a secured revolving credit facility of $450 million. We did not have any outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2004, we had $98 million of letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility. 68 Various debt instruments at the parent company level, including our senior secured credit facilities, senior secured notes and senior subordinated notes contain certain restrictive covenants. The covenants provide for, among other items: limitations on other indebtedness, liens, investments and guarantees; restrictions on dividends and redemptions and payments of unsecured and subordinated debt and the use of proceeds; restrictions on mergers and acquisitions, sales of assets, leases, transactions with affiliates and off balance sheet and derivative arrangements; and maintenance of certain financial ratios. Non-Recourse Debt Financing While the lenders under our non-recourse debt financings generally do not have direct recourse to the parent company, defaults thereunder can still have important consequences for our results of operations and liquidity, including, without limitation: reducing our cash flows as the subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to the parent level during the time period of any default; triggering our obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support we have provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary; causing us to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets; and triggering defaults in our outstanding debt at the parent level. For example, our revolving credit agreement and outstanding senior notes, senior subordinated notes and junior subordinated notes at the parent level include events of default for certain bankruptcy related events involving material subsidiaries. In addition, our revolving credit agreement at the parent level includes events of default related to payment defaults and accelerations of outstanding debt of material subsidiaries. Some of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. The total debt classified as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets related to such defaults was $291 million at December 31, 2004. None of the subsidiaries that are currently in default are owned by subsidiaries that currently meet the applicable definition of materiality in AES corporate debt agreements in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or permit an acceleration under such indebtedness. However, as a result of additional dispositions of assets, other significant reductions in asset carrying values or other matters in the future that may impact our financial position and results of operations, it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries could fall within the definition of a material subsidiary and thereby upon an acceleration trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under the AES parent company senior notes, senior subordinated notes and junior subordinated notes. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In May 1999, one of our subsidiaries acquired six electric generating plants from New York State Electric and Gas. Concurrently, the subsidiary sold two of the plants to an unrelated third party for $666 million and simultaneously entered into a leasing arrangement with the unrelated party. We have accounted for this transaction as a sale/leaseback transaction with operating lease treatment. Accordingly, we have not recorded these assets on our books and we expense periodic lease payments, which amounted to $54 million in 2004, as incurred. The lease obligations bear an imputed interest rate of approximately 9% which approximates fair market value. We are not subject to any additional liabilities or contingencies 69 if the arrangement terminates, and we believe that the dissolution of the off-balance sheet arrangement would have minimal effects on our operating cash flows. The terms of the lease include restrictive covenants such as the maintenance of certain coverage ratios. As of December 31, 2004, we fulfilled a lease requirement on the subsidiary behalf by funding an additional liquidity account, as defined in the lease agreement, in the form of a $36 million letter of credit. However, the subsidiary is required to replenish or replace this letter of credit in the event it is drawn upon or requires replacement. Historically, the plants have satisfied the restrictive covenants of the lease, and there are no known trends or uncertainties that would indicate that the lease will be terminated early. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of this transaction. Our subsidiary IPL formed IPL Funding Corporation ( IPL Funding ) in 1996 to purchase, on a revolving basis, up to $50 million of the retail accounts receivable and related collections of IPL in exchange for a note payable. IPL Funding is not consolidated by IPL or IPALCO since it meets requirements set forth in SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities to be considered a qualified special-purpose entity. IPL Funding has entered into a purchase facility with unrelated parties (the Purchasers ) pursuant to which the Purchasers agree to purchase from IPL Funding, on a revolving basis, up to $50 million of the receivables purchased from IPL. During 2004, this agreement was extended through October 26, 2005. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the aggregate amount of receivables IPL has sold to IPL Funding and IPL Funding has sold to the Purchasers pursuant to this purchase facility was $50 million. Accounts receivable on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets are stated net of the $50 million sold. The net cash flows between IPL and IPL Funding are limited to cash payments made by IPL to IPL Funding for interest charges and processing fees. These payments totaled $1 million for each of the three years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. IPL retains servicing responsibilities through its role as a collection agent for the amounts due on the purchased receivables. IPL and IPL Funding provide certain indemnities to the Purchasers, including indemnification in the event that there is a breach of representations and warranties made with respect to the purchased receivables. IPL Funding and IPL each have agreed to indemnify the Purchasers on an after-tax basis for any and all damages, losses, claims, liabilities, penalties, taxes, costs and expenses at any time imposed on or incurred by the indemnified parties arising out of or otherwise relating to the purchase facility, subject to certain limitations as defined in the purchase facility. The transfers of receivables to IPL Funding are recorded as sales however no gain or loss is recorded on the sale. Under the receivables purchase facility, if IPL fails to maintain certain financial covenants regarding interest coverage and debt-to-capital ratios, it would constitute a termination event. IPL is in compliance with such covenants. As a result of IPL current credit rating, the facility agent has the ability to (i) replace IPL as the collection agent; and (ii) declare a lock-box event. Under a lock-box event or a termination event, the facility agent has the ability to require all proceeds of purchased receivables of IPL to be directed to lock-box accounts within 45 days of notifying IPL. A termination event would also (i) give the facility agent the option to take control of the lock-box account, and (ii) give the Purchasers the option to discontinue the purchase of new receivables and cause all proceeds of the purchased receivables to be used to reduce the Purchaser investment and to pay other amounts owed to the Purchasers and the facility agent. This would have the effect of reducing the operating capital available to IPL by the aggregate amount of such purchased receivables (currently $50 million).
