ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All statements in the following discussion which are not reports of historical information or descriptions of current accounting policies are forward-looking statements. Please consider our forward-looking statements in light of the risks referred to in this report introductory cautionary note. There can be no assurance that actual developments will be those anticipated by us. Actual results could differ materially from those projected as a result of a number of factors, some of which we cannot predict or control. For a discussion of our risk factors, see Risk Factors, beginning on page 41. General Alaska and Horizon operate as airlines. However, their business plans, competition, and economic risks differ substantially. Alaska is a major airline serving primarily Alaska; the U.S. West Coast; five cities on the U.S. East Coast, Denver, Chicago; Vancouver and Calgary, Canada; and Mexico. It operates an all jet fleet and its average passenger trip is 996 miles. Horizon operates both as a regional airline serving primarily the Pacific Northwest, California, and Western Canada, and as a contract service provider to Frontier Airlines, operating as Frontier JetExpress out of Denver. Horizon operates both jet and turboprop aircraft, and its average passenger trip is 363 miles. As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning in 2004, Horizon began operating regional jet service branded as Frontier JetExpress under an agreement with Frontier Airlines, which is described in more detail below. Year in Review and Current Events Overall, economic conditions in 2004 improved over 2003. The industry generally enjoyed increases in both passenger traffic and load factors, and Alaska and Horizon were no different posting record monthly load factors for much of the year. However, ticket yields continued to remain under pressure in the wake of growth of low cost carriers such as Southwest and jetBlue and excess capacity in many markets. Fuel prices reached record highs during much of the year, although moderated somewhat in the fourth quarter, but are still materially above historical averages. These factors, coupled with the high cost structures of many major carriers, resulted in another year of significant losses for the industry. During 2004, the management team at Alaska was actively focused on cost reductions. Our stated goal for 2004 was to achieve a unit cost (excluding fuel and significant items) of 8.0 cents per available seat mile (ASM) and we achieved a full year unit cost excluding fuel and significant items of 7.92 cents per ASM. Restructuring Charges During the third quarter of 2004, Alaska announced a management reorganization and the closure of its Oakland heavy maintenance base, contracting out of related heavy maintenance, contracting out of the Company Fleet Service, Ground Support Equipment and facility maintenance functions, maintenance shops and other initiatives. In total, we believe these restructuring activities will result in a reduction of approximately 900 employees when fully implemented in the first half of 2005. Severance and related costs associated with this restructuring are estimated at $53.4 million, of which $27.5 million was recorded during the third quarter of 2004 and $25.9 million was recorded in the fourth quarter. We expect savings from these job-related initiatives to be approximately $35 million per year when fully implemented. As part of our ongoing cost saving initiatives, we continue to look at all aspects of our business. In 2005, we may outsource other activities or initiate other restructuring activities which would result in further restructuring charges. Labor Costs and Negotiations Alaska Airlines continues to pursue the restructuring of its labor agreements so that they are in line with what we believe to be the market. Our objectives as we restructure these agreements are to achieve market 23 Table of Contents labor costs, productivity and employee benefit costs. Based on these three objectives, in 2003 Alaska targeted $112 million per year of labor savings. As a result of increases in our wage rates since that time, combined with labor cost decreases achieved by our competitors, we believe that our wages and benefits are now above market by approximately $125 million. Alaska believes that its pilot labor costs represent the majority of this amount. Despite ongoing negotiations in late 2003 and much of 2004, we were unable to reach a new agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) and have therefore submitted to binding arbitration, the decision of which will be effective in May 2005. The arbitration will cover wages plus five issues submitted by each of the Company and ALPA. The pilot labor contract contains market related standards for wages and benefits. Nevertheless, we cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding, particularly whether the arbitrator award will reflect cost savings in wage rates, productivity and benefits equal to what we consider to be the current excess over market. Reducing labor costs and finalizing the agreements with our labor groups is an important objective for 2005. Mark-to-Market Fuel Hedging Gains Beginning in the second quarter of 2004, we lost the ability to defer, as a component of comprehensive income, recognition of any unrealized gain or loss on our fuel hedge contracts until the hedged fuel is consumed. We lost this ability because the price correlation between crude oil, the commodity we use to hedge, and West Coast jet fuel fell below required thresholds. For more discussion, see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. The implications of this change are twofold: First, our earnings are more volatile as we mark our entire hedge portfolio to market each quarter-end and report the gain or loss in other non-operating income or expense, even though the actual consumption will take place in a future period. Second, to a large extent, the impact of our fuel hedge program will not be reflected in fuel expense. For example, we recorded gains from settled fuel hedges totaling $45.2 million during 2004, but only $16.6 million of that gain is reflected as an offset to fuel expense with the balance reported in other non-operating income. We have provided information on mark-to-market gains or losses, as well as calculations of our economic fuel cost per gallon on pages 20 through 22. We continue to believe that our fuel hedge program is an important part of our strategy to reduce our exposure to volatile fuel prices. Impairment of 737-200C Aircraft In June 2004, the Company Board approved a plan to accelerate the retirement of its Boeing 737-200C fleet and remove those aircraft from service earlier than initially planned. In July 2004, the Company announced its plan to replace these aircraft by modifying five existing 737-400 aircraft and using other existing 737-400 aircraft for the remaining passenger capacity. At December 31, 2004 the planned modifications have been delayed. However, management currently believes that all 737-200s will still be retired by the end of 2007 as planned. The Company expects to replace the 737-400s with Boeing 737-800 aircraft in 2005 and 2006. As a result of this decision, the Company evaluated impairment as required by SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets and concluded that the carrying value of the 737-200C fleet was no longer recoverable when compared to the estimated remaining future cash flows. Accordingly, during the second quarter of 2004, the Company recorded an impairment charge totaling $36.8 million (pre-tax) to write down the fleet to its estimated fair market value. In addition, we revised our estimates of the useful lives and residual values of the fleet and related spare equipment and will depreciate the remaining carrying values through 2007, when the last aircraft will be retired. 24 Table of Contents Navigation Fee Refund During the third quarter of 2004, we received a refund totaling $11 million (pre-tax) from the Mexican government related to navigation fees paid in 2002 and 2003. Approximately $7.7 million of the refund was recorded as a reduction to operating expenses and $3.3 million was recorded as non-operating income. Frontier JetExpress On January 1, 2004, Horizon began operating regional jet service branded as Frontier JetExpress under a 12-year agreement with Frontier Airlines. Service under this agreement became fully operational during the second quarter of 2004 and Horizon is currently operating nine regional jet aircraft under the Frontier JetExpress brand. Flying under this agreement represented 21.4% of Horizon 2004 capacity and 9.1% of passenger revenues. For the fourth quarter (which is more representative of ongoing operations), flying under this agreement represented 23.1% of Horizon fourth quarter capacity and 9.9% of passenger revenue. The arrangement with Frontier provides for reimbursement of costs plus a base mark-up and certain incentives. However, since Horizon is not responsible for many of the typical costs of operations such as fuel, landing fees, marketing costs and station labor and rents and combined with longer trip lengths, revenue per ASM, cost per ASM and cost per ASM excluding fuel for this flying is significantly lower than Horizon native network flying. Other Events During the fourth quarter of 2004, Alaska entered into a 10 year power-by-the-hour engine maintenance agreement with a third party. Under terms of this arrangement, the third party will provide routine and major overhaul maintenance services on certain engines in our 737-400 fleet at an agreed upon rate per hour flown. During the fourth quarter, Alaska added a row of seats to its 737-400 fleet. This change will result in an increase of approximately 2.3% in available seat miles on an annualized basis. We expect this change will represent a significant portion of our capacity growth in 2005. In late 2004, we also announced that we would be installing winglets on our B737-700 aircraft. Outlook For 2005, Alaska and Horizon expect capacity increases of approximately 3% and 12%, respectively. The expected capacity increase at Alaska is due largely to the annualization of the additional seats added to the B737-400 fleet and the addition of three B737-800s offset by the retirement of two B737-200s. Horizon expected capacity increase is due largely to the annualization of aircraft additions in the first half of 2004, the addition of one new CRJ-700, higher utilization resulting from the annualization of the contract flying for Frontier. In addition, Horizon will be adding a row of seats to the Q400 fleet increasing capacity from 70 to 74 seats. When complete, this will result in an increase of approximately 1.5% in available seat miles on an annualized basis. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2004 Compared with 2003 Our consolidated net loss for 2004 was $15.3 million, or $0.57 per share, versus net income of $13.5 million, or $0.51 per share, in 2003. The 2004 results include four significant items which impact the comparability to 2003. These items are discussed in the Year in Review and Current Events section beginning on page 29. Our 2003 results also include $71.4 million ($52.8 million for Alaska and $18.6 million for Horizon, or a combined $44.3 million net of tax or $1.66 per share) received related to assistance from the government under the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act. Our consolidated operating loss for 2004 was $79.8 million compared to a loss of $17.5 million for 2003. Our consolidated pre-tax loss for 2004 was $20.6 million compared to pre-tax income of $29.0 million for 25 Table of Contents 2003. Financial and statistical data comparisons for Alaska and Horizon are shown on pages 18 and 19, respectively. On pages 20 through 22, we have included a reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Alaska Airlines Revenues Operating revenues increased $205.6 million, or 10.1%, during 2004 as compared to the same period in 2003. The increase in revenues resulted from an 11.5% increase in passenger traffic, offset by a 1.4% decline in ticket yields. For the year ended December 31, 2004, capacity increased 7.1% as compared to 2003. The capacity increases are primarily due to the annualization and expansion of our transcontinental flying, including service from Seattle to Chicago and Los Angeles to Reagan National in Washington D.C.. The traffic increase of 11.5% outpaced the capacity increase of 7.1%, resulting in an increase in load factor from 70.0% to 72.9%. The decline in yield per passenger mile was a result of continued industry-wide pricing pressure, particularly in the fourth quarter where yield declines were more substantial, dropping 5.8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2003. We expect that load factors will continue to be strong but that yields and passenger unit revenues will continue to decline on a year-over-year basis into the first half of 2005. Freight and mail revenues increased $9.1 million, or 11.8%, because of a new mail contract we have in the State of Alaska offset by lower freight revenues. Other-net revenues increased $13.3 million, or 12.1%, due largely to revenues received from an agreement with Pen Air to provide flight services to Dutch Harbor that began in January of 2004 and higher Mileage Plan revenues. Alaska Airlines Expenses For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, total operating expenses increased $271.6 million, or 13.3%, as compared to the same period in 2003. Operating expenses per ASM increased 5.8% from 9.84 cents in 2003 to 10.41 cents in 2004. The increase in operating expenses per ASM is due largely to significant increase in fuel costs, our restructuring charges, the impairment charge related to our Boeing 737-200 fleet, higher wages and benefits, contracted services costs and landing fees and other rental costs offset by declines in other selling expenses and commissions and the navigation fee recovery. Operating expense per ASM excluding fuel, the navigation fee recovery, restructuring and impairment charges decreased 5% to 7.92 cents per ASM compared to 8.34 cents per ASM in 2003. Explanations of significant period-over-period changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows: Wages and benefits increased $19.9 million, or 3%, during 2004. Approximately two thirds of the increase reflects higher pilot wages, substantially all of which is due to the 4% wage rate increase in May 2004 under the terms of our existing union contract . Wages were favorably impacted by the restructuring initiatives announced in August and September. During 2004, there were 9,968 FTEs, which is down by approximately 70 FTEs from 2003 on a 7.1% increase in capacity. Our current plan is for approximately 9,500 FTEs in 2005. Benefits costs were favorably impacted by a $7.3 million reduction in workers compensation expense resulting from positive workers compensation claims experience at Alaska and a related reduction to ultimate loss estimates recorded in December totaling $6.6 million. In total, benefits costs were flat year over year. Beginning in 2005, wages and benefits will include stock-based compensation associated with options granted to certain employees. Based on recent history, stock-based compensation expense associated with option grants is expected to be approximately $8 to $10 million per year (pre-tax). Since FAS 123R is effective for interim periods beginning after June 15, 2005 (our third quarter), we expect that only half that amount will be recorded in 2005. Contracted services increased $14.9 million, or 18%, due largely to expenses associated with an agreement with PenAir to provide flight services to Dutch Harbor that began in January of 2004, costs associated with a temporary charter contract we have for our new mail contract in Alaska and higher 26 Table of Contents security costs, partially offset by $8.6 million from the recovery in 2004 of disputed Mexico navigation fees paid in 2002 and 2003. Aircraft fuel increased $159.9 million, or 51%, due to a 43.9% increase in the GAAP fuel cost per gallon and a 5.2% increase in fuel gallons consumed. The increase in aircraft fuel expense is inclusive of $14.6 million of gains from settled hedges. During 2004, Alaska also realized $25.2 million of hedge gains which are recorded in other non-operating income. After including all hedge gains recorded during the year, our economic fuel expense increased $140.1 million, or 45.7%, over 2003. Our economic fuel cost per gallon increased 38.6% from 90.9 cents to 126.0 cents. Aircraft maintenance decreased $7.6 million, or 5%, due largely to fewer engine overhauls during 2004 and a change in the mix of heavy maintenance versus routine maintenance. We plan to change the accounting for engine and airframe overhauls at Alaska and Horizon, effective January 2005. Under the new method, we will charge the costs of these overhauls directly to expense, as opposed to our current practice of capitalizing and amortizing them. To effect this change, we will write off the unamortized portion of previously capitalized overhauls in January 2005 as a cumulative effect of an accounting change. We expect the one-time charge to be approximately $91 million, after tax. Aircraft rent decreased $10.4 million, or 8%, due to lower rates on extended leases and fewer leased aircraft in 2004 compared to 2003. Other selling expenses and commissions decreased $15.8 million, or 11%, due to a decline in the incentive payments made to Horizon offset by increases in booking fees, credit card fees, and commissions. Incentive payments to Horizon are eliminated in consolidation. In 2004, 38.0% of Air Group ticket sales were made through traditional travel agents, compared to 43.0% in 2003. In 2004, 30.4% of the ticket sales were made through Alaska Internet web site compared to 27.4% in 2003. Depreciation and amortization increased $8.6 million, or 7%, reflecting accelerated depreciation on the planned retirement of the Boeing 737-200C fleet, an increase in depreciation resulting from one aircraft purchased in the last twelve months, and the full year depreciation on aircraft acquired in 2003, and additional provisions for inventory obsolescence. Landing fees and other rentals increased $14.2 million, or 11%. The higher rates primarily reflect higher joint-use and exclusive rental fees at Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles and Oakland, combined with modest volume growth. We expect landing fees and other rentals to continue to increase as a result of airport facility expansions and increased costs for security due to unfunded government mandates. Other expense increased $9.7 million, or 7%, primarily reflecting a $6.3 million increase in professional services costs, higher moving expenses associated with our restructuring initiatives, higher passenger remuneration costs, and supplies costs. Restructuring charges totaled $53.4 million during 2004. This charge includes wages and other benefits that will be paid as a result of our restructuring initiatives announced in August and September of 2004. The following table reconciles the total charge to the remaining accrual on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2004 (in millions): Severance and Related Costs Balance at December 31, 2003 $ Restructuring charges 53.4 Cash payments* (14.7 ) Balance at December 31, 2004 $ 38.7 * The Company expects the majority of cash payments will be made during the first and second quarters of 2005. 27 Table of Contents Horizon Air Revenues For the year ended December 31, 2004, operating revenues increased $39.4 million, or 8.5% as compared to 2003. This increase is due largely to the increased traffic in our native network and our new contract flying for Frontier Airlines, which began January 1, 2004, partially offset by a decline in the incentive payments made by Alaska to Horizon. Incentive payments are eliminated in consolidation. The arrangement with Frontier provides for reimbursement of expected costs plus a base mark up and certain incentives. However, since Horizon is not responsible for many of the typical costs of operations such as fuel, landing fees, marketing costs and station labor and rents, revenue per ASM, cost per ASM and cost per ASM excluding fuel for this flying is significantly lower than Horizon native network flying. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, capacity increased 20.9% and traffic was up 31.4%, compared to the same period in 2003. Contract flying with Frontier represented approximately 9.1% of passenger revenues and 21.4% of capacity, during 2004. Passenger load factor increased 5.4 percentage points to 69.3%. Passenger yield decreased 16.5% to 22.50 cents, reflecting the inclusion of the Frontier contract flying, the yield for which is significantly lower than native network flying, and a decline in incentive payments from Alaska for feed traffic. Contract revenue and higher yields in Horizon native network combined with the increases in traffic, resulted in an increase in passenger revenue of $42.5 million, or 9.6%. Horizon Air Expenses Operating expenses increased $36.8 million, or 8.1%, as compared to the same period in 2003. Operating expenses per ASM including fuel and the impairment charge decreased 10.5% as compared to 2003. Operating expenses per ASM excluding fuel and the impairment charge decreased 14.1% as compared to the same period in 2003. Operating expenses in 2004 include $3.4 million related to an impairment charge on our held-for-sale F-28 aircraft and spare engines to lower the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value. Explanations of other significant period-over-period changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows: Wages and benefits increased $3.8 million, or 2%, reflecting an increase in the average number of employees, wages and payroll taxes, partially offset by favorable reductions of medical and workers compensation accruals. Aircraft fuel increased $17.5 million, or 34%, due to a 45.0% increase in the GAAP fuel cost per gallon, partially offset by a 7.4% decrease in gallons consumed. The increase in aircraft fuel expense is inclusive of $2.0 million of gains from settled hedges. During the year, Horizon also realized $3.4 million of hedge gains which are recorded in other non-operating income. After including all hedge gains recorded during the year, our economic fuel expense increased $15.1 million, or 30.1%, over 2003. Our economic fuel cost per gallon increased 40.5% from 93.5 cents to 131.4 cents. Aircraft maintenance expense increased $7.9 million, or 26%, primarily due to an increase in block hours, a higher number of routine maintenance activities and engine overhauls for the Q200 fleet and fewer aircraft covered by warranty. We expect aircraft maintenance expense to decline somewhat in 2005 based on the timing of expected maintenance activities. Aircraft rent increased $2.9 million, or 4%, reflecting the annualization of aircraft added during 2003 and the addition of spare engines during 2004. Landing fees and other rentals increased $2.9 million, or 8%. Higher landing fees are a result of higher rates associated with modest volume growth, an increase in airport fees and increased costs for security. We expect landing fees and other rentals to continue to increase as a result of airport facility expansions and increased costs for security. Consolidated Nonoperating Income (Expense) Net nonoperating income was $59.2 million in 2004 compared to $46.5 million in 2003. Interest income increased $11.7 million due to a larger marketable securities portfolio in 2004 combined with a correction of 28 Table of Contents premium and discount amortization on our marketable securities portfolio in 2003. 2004 interest income also includes $3.3 million from the recovery in 2004 of disputed Mexico navigation fees paid in 2002 and 2003. Interest expense (net of capitalized interest) increased $4.7 million due to increases in debt balances as compared to 2003. Other-net includes $28.6 million and $6.4 million in gains from settled fuel hedging contracts in 2004 and 2003, respectively. In addition, other-net includes mark-to-market gains on unsettled hedge contracts of $56.9 million in 2004. The 2003 results include $71.4 million ($52.8 million for Alaska and $18.6 million for Horizon) received in connection with the government reimbursement of security fees remitted and carrier fees paid under the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act. Consolidated Income Tax Benefit Our consolidated effective income tax benefit for 2004 was 25.7% compared to an effective income tax expense rate of 53.4% in 2003. Due to the magnitude of nondeductible expenses, such as employee per diem costs, relative to pre-tax profit or loss, a relatively small change in pre-tax results can cause a significant change in the effective tax rate. 2003 Compared with 2002 Our consolidated net income for 2003 was $13.5 million, or $0.51 per share, compared with a net loss of $118.6 million, or $4.47 per share, in 2002. Our 2003 results include $71.4 million ($52.8 million for Alaska and $18.6 million for Horizon) received related to assistance from the government under the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act. Our 2002 net loss includes $0.5 million received from the government and $51.4 million related to the write-off of goodwill in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142 (see discussion in Note 17 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Excluding the government compensation received in 2003 and 2002 and the goodwill write-off in 2002, our net loss for 2003 was $30.8 million ($1.15 per share) compared to $67.5 million ($2.54 per share) for 2002. Our consolidated operating loss for 2003 was $17.5 million compared to $93.2 million for 2002. Our consolidated pre-tax income for 2003 was $29.0 million compared with a consolidated pre-tax loss before accounting change of $101.8 million for 2002. Financial and statistical data comparisons for Alaska and Horizon are shown on pages 18 and 19, respectively. On pages 20 through 22, we have included a reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Alaska Airlines Revenues Operating revenues increased $194.3 million, or 10.6%, during 2003 as compared to the same period in 2002, reflecting stronger summer demand and higher than expected fourth quarter traffic as compared to 2002. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, capacity increased 7.5% and traffic increased 10.4% as compared to the same period in 2002. The capacity increases are primarily due to the addition of service to new cities (Boston, Denver, Newark, Washington D.C., Orlando and Miami) and an increase in service in the Pacific Northwest, Mexico, and Canada markets, partially offset by lower capacity in the Bay Area, Arizona and Northern Alaska. During 2003, roughly 75% of our ASM growth came from expansion in the Transcontinental and Denver markets. Traffic increases primarily reflect service to new cities and traffic increases in the Pacific Northwest, Mexico and Nevada, partially offset by decreases in traffic in the Bay Area, Northern Alaska and Arizona. Higher traffic resulted in a $172.7 million, or 10.4%, increase in passenger revenues. Our passenger load factor increased 1.9 percentage points to 70.0% during 2003 as compared to 2002. Our yield per passenger mile remained constant compared to 2002 due to a combination of longer average stage lengths, fewer business travelers, and continued pricing pressure by low cost carriers, partially offset by an increase in revenue from expired Mileage Plan accounts. 29 Table of Contents Freight and mail revenues increased $5.2 million, or 7.2%, due principally to higher freight and mail volumes attributable to a reduction of security restrictions. Other-net revenues increased $16.4 million, or 17.6%, due largely to cash received from the sale of miles in our frequent flyer program (impacting other revenue currently as a portion is recognized immediately) and redemption of miles on partner airlines. Alaska Airlines Expenses For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, total operating expenses increased $136.1 million, or 7.1%, as compared to the same period in 2002. This increase is due largely to a 7.5% increase in ASMs combined with higher fuel, maintenance, wages and benefits costs and landing fees and other rentals. Operating expense per ASM decreased 0.3% as compared to the same period in 2002 from 9.87 cents to 9.84 cents. Operating expense per ASM excluding fuel decreased 2.1% as compared to the same period in 2002 from 8.52 cents to 8.34 cents. Explanations of significant period-over-period changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows: Wages and benefits increased $75.2 million, or 11%, during 2003 as compared to 2002. Approximately $52.8 million of this increase reflects higher benefit costs, mainly increases in pension costs of approximately $34.1 million and higher health insurance and workers compensation costs. The remaining $22.4 million increase reflects scale and step increases, partially offset by a 1.0% decrease in the number of full time equivalent employees. Alaska recorded employee profit sharing of $2.9 million in 2003, which was paid in 2004. No profit sharing occurred in 2002. Aircraft fuel increased $51.4 million, or 20%, due to a 14.8% increase in the fuel cost per gallon and a 4.3% increase in fuel gallons consumed. Air Group fuel hedging program resulted in Alaska recognizing a $19.6 million reduction in aircraft fuel expense for hedging gains realized on hedge positions settled during 2003. At December 31, 2003, we had fuel hedge contracts in place to hedge 33%, 28% and 2% of our expected fuel usage in 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Aircraft maintenance increased $8.2 million, or 6%, due to increases in the number of outside airframe and engine checks and other outside repairs and additional depreciation that was recorded following our decision in the fourth quarter to retire three Boeing 737-200Cs in 2004. Aircraft rent decreased $4.3 million, or 3%, due to new lease extensions at lower rates, partially offset by five new 737-700 leases. Other selling expenses and commissions decreased $6.6 million, or 4%. This decrease was due principally to lower computer reservation system costs, the elimination of travel agency base commissions and lower Mileage Plan costs, partially offset by an increase in credit card commissions, advertising costs, and incentive payments made to Horizon. Incentive payments to Horizon are eliminated in consolidation at the Air Group level. In 2003, 43.0% of Air Group ticket sales were made through traditional travel agents, compared to 48.2% in 2002. In 2003, 27.4% of the ticket sales were made through Alaska Internet web site compared to 21.0% in 2002. Depreciation and amortization increased $5.5 million, or 5% reflecting a year over year increase in the depreciable asset base and $0.7 million in accelerated depreciation on three 737-200s. Landing fees and other rentals increased $17.3 million, or 16%. The higher rates reflect modest volume growth and an increase in airports cost of operations, including facility expansion initiatives, and increased security costs due to unfunded government mandates. Other expense decreased $11.9 million, or 8%, primarily reflecting lower expenditures for insurance, supplies, communication services and property taxes, partially offset by increases in expenditures for professional services and per diems. Insurance expense decreases are a reflection of several factors including a $3.7 million insurance reimbursement received during the latter part of 2003 resulting from a clarification of liability related to Flight 261, lower cost coverage from a government aviation war risk 30 Table of Contents insurance program and competitive pressures in the aviation war risk insurance market. However, aviation insurance remains substantially higher than before September 11, 2001. Horizon Air Revenues Operating revenues increased $44.2 million, or 10.5%, during 2003 as compared to 2002 due, in part, to an increase in incentive payments from Alaska for feed traffic, which eliminates in consolidation. For the twelve months ending December 31, 2003, capacity increased 5.8% and traffic was up 8.3%, compared to the same period in 2002. Passenger load factor increased 1.5 percentage points to 63.9% during 2003 as compared to 2002. Passenger yield increased 3.6%, and combined with the increase in traffic, resulted in an increase in passenger revenue of $48.4 million, or 12.3%. The increase in revenue and passenger yield resulted from improved economic conditions, stronger summer demand and higher than expected fourth quarter revenue passenger miles. Other-net revenues decreased $4.2 million, or 20.3%, primarily due to manufacturer payments received in 2002 as compensation for delays in the delivery of CRJ 700 aircraft, which did not recur in 2003. Horizon Air Expenses For the twelve months ending December 31, 2003, operating expenses increased $23.2 million, or 5.3%, as compared to the same period in 2002. This increase is due largely to a 5.8% increase in ASMs combined with higher wages and benefits, aircraft maintenance, landing fees and other rental costs. Operating expenses per ASM decreased 0.5% as compared to the same period in 2002 from 17.87 cents to 17.79 cents in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Operating expenses per ASM excluding fuel decreased 1.2% as compared to the same period in 2002 from 15.99 cents to 15.80 cents in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Explanations of significant period-over-period changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows: Wages and benefits increased $6.7 million, or 4%, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 as compared to 2002. Approximately $6.2 million of this increase reflects higher benefits, resulting primarily from increases in health insurance, workers compensation and profit sharing. The remaining increase reflects an increase in wages, partially offset by a 3.3% reduction in the number of employees. Horizon recorded employee profit sharing of $0.8 million in 2003, which was paid in 2004. No profit sharing occurred in 2002. Aircraft fuel increased $5.6 million, or 12%, due to a 13.9% increase in the cost per gallon of fuel, partially offset by a 1.5% decrease in gallons consumed. Air Group fuel hedging program resulted in Horizon recognizing a $3.4 million reduction in aircraft fuel expense for hedging gains realized on hedge positions settled during 2003. Aircraft maintenance expense increased $5.3 million, or 21%, primarily due to maintenance on Q400 and CRJ-700 aircraft and a series of engine repairs on both aircraft types. Aircraft rent increased $8.8 million, or 14%, due to the addition of two CRJ-700s and a short-term lease agreement for two Q400s as compared to 2002. Other selling expenses and commissions decreased $4.5 million, or 15%, due primarily to the elimination of travel agent base commissions starting in June 2002, and the continuing shift to direct sales channels. Landing fees and other rentals increased $7.3 million, or 23%. Higher landing fees are a result of higher rates associated with modest volume growth, an increase in airports cost of operations and increased costs for security. Horizon is also paying a larger portion of Air Group expenses at stations where Alaska and Horizon operate due to a 2003 revision of an intercompany expense sharing agreement with Alaska. These costs are eliminated in consolidation. Other expense decreased $6.1 million, or 12%, primarily reflecting a decrease in insurance costs. Insurance expense decreases are a reflection of several factors including a $1.3 million insurance 31 Table of Contents reimbursement received during the latter part of 2003 resulting from clarification of an Air Group insurance liability, lower cost coverage from government aviation war risk insurance programs and competitive pressures in the aviation war risk insurance market. Consolidated Nonoperating Income (Expense) Net nonoperating items were $8.6 million expense in 2002 compared to $46.5 million income in 2003. The 2003 results include $71.4 million ($52.8 million for Alaska and $18.6 million for Horizon) received in connection with the government reimbursement of security fees remitted and carrier fees paid under the Act. Interest income decreased $8.4 million due principally to lower interest rates and an adjustment of premium and discount amortization on our marketable securities portfolio. Interest expense (net of capitalized interest) increased $1.9 million, due primarily to increases in debt resulting from the completion of a private placement of $150.0 million of floating rate senior convertible notes in the first quarter of 2003. See discussion at Note 4, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other-net includes $8.1 million and $10.7 million in gains resulting from hedge ineffectiveness on fuel hedging contracts in 2003 and 2002, respectively. In 2003, we received an insurance recovery of $3.1 million in connection with legal fees associated with a U.S. Attorney investigation in Oakland. In 2002, we received a $1.4 million insurance recovery and a $0.9 million gain on conversion of Equant N.V. shares (a telecommunications network company owned by many airlines). Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under this statement, goodwill is no longer amortized, but instead is tested for impairment on a minimum of an annual basis. During the second quarter of 2002, we completed the first step of our impairment test related to our $51.4 million of goodwill. The test was performed using Alaska and Horizon as separate reporting units. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we completed the second step of our impairment test and determined that all of our goodwill was impaired. As a result, we recorded a one-time, non-cash charge, effective January 1, 2002, of $51.4 million ($12.5 million Alaska and $38.9 million Horizon) to write-off all of our goodwill. This charge is reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for 2002. Critical Accounting Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations. See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our significant accounting policies. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We have identified the following critical accounting estimates. We have discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee. Mileage Plan Our Mileage Plan loyalty program awards miles to member passengers who fly on Alaska or Horizon and our travel partners. Additionally, we sell miles to third parties, such as our credit card partner, for cash. In either case, the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on Alaska, Horizon, or any of our alliance partners. As long as the Mileage Plan is in existence, we have an obligation to provide this future travel; therefore, for awards earned by passengers who fly on Alaska, Horizon or our travel partners, we recognize a liability and the corresponding selling expense for this future obligation. For miles sold to third parties, a majority of the sales proceeds are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when the award transportation 32 Table of Contents is provided. The deferred proceeds are recognized as passenger revenue when awards are issued and flown on Alaska or Horizon, and as other-net revenue for awards issued and flown on other airlines. At December 31, 2004, we had approximately 86 billion miles outstanding, resulting in an aggregate liability of $409.3 million. The liability is computed based on several assumptions that require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate. There are uncertainties inherent in estimates; therefore, an incorrect assumption impacts the amount and/or timing of revenue recognition or Mileage Plan expenses. The most significant assumptions in accounting for the Mileage Plan are described below. 1. The number of miles that will not be redeemed for travel: Members may not reach the mileage threshold necessary for a free ticket and outstanding miles may not always be redeemed for travel. Therefore, based on the number of Mileage Plan accounts and the miles in the accounts, we estimate how many miles will never be used ( breakage ), and do not record a liability for those miles. Our estimates of breakage consider activity in our members accounts, account balances, and other factors. We believe our breakage assumptions are reasonable. A hypothetical 1.0% change in our estimate of breakage (currently 12% in the aggregate) has approximately a $4.5 million affect on the liability. However, actual breakage could differ significantly from our estimates given the dynamic nature of the program and our inability to predict our member future behavior. 2. The number of miles used per award (i.e., free ticket): We estimate how many miles will be used per award. If actual miles used are more or less than estimated, we may need to adjust the liability and corresponding expense. Our estimates are based on the current requirements in our Mileage Plan program and historical redemptions on Alaska, Horizon or other airlines. 3. The costs which will be incurred to carry the passenger: When the frequent flyer travels on his or her award ticket, incremental costs such as food, fuel and insurance are incurred to carry that passenger. We estimate what these costs (excluding any contribution to overhead and profit) will be and accrue a liability. If the passenger travels on another airline on an award ticket, we often must pay the other airline for carrying the passenger. The other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often substantially higher than the costs we would incur to carry that passenger. We estimate how much we will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and accrue a liability accordingly. The costs actually incurred by us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued, and therefore we may need to adjust our liability and recognize a corresponding expense. 4. Redemption on Alaska or Horizon versus other airlines: The cost for Alaska or Horizon to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost we will pay to other airlines. We estimate the number of awards which will be redeemed on Alaska or Horizon versus other airlines and accrue the costs on this based on our estimate of historical redemption patterns. If the number of awards redeemed on other airlines is higher or lower than estimated, we may need to adjust our liability and corresponding expense. 5. The rate at which we defer sales proceeds from sold miles: We defer an amount that represents our estimate of the value of a free travel award. As fare levels change, our deferral rate changes, which may result in more or less recognition of cash proceeds in any given quarter. We review all Mileage Plan estimates each quarter, and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary. Any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations. 33 Table of Contents Pension Plans We account for the defined benefit pension plans using SFAS No. 87, Employer Accounting for Pensions. Under SFAS No. 87, pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods. Pension expense calculated under SFAS No. 87 is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements. We recognized expense for our defined benefit pension plans of $78.3 million, $73.5 million and $40.0 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of important assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions. At December 31, 2004, the fair value of our pension plan assets totaled $607.0 million. We anticipate making a cash contribution of approximately $58 million during 2005. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases. At December 31, 2004, we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate a long-term rate of return of 8.0%. This rate is equal to the assumed rate of 8.0% used at December 31, 2003, and was developed by evaluating input from consultants and economists as well as long-term inflation assumptions. We regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as considered appropriate. This expected long-term rate of return on plan assets at December 31, 2004 is based on an allocation of U.S. equities and U.S. fixed income securities. Decreasing the expected long-term rate of return by 0.5% (from 8.0% to 7.5%) would increase our estimated 2005 pension expense by approximately $3.1 million. Pension liability and future pension expense increase as the discount rate is reduced. We discounted future pension obligations using a rate of 5.75% and 6.00% at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The discount rate is determined based on the current rates earned on high quality long-term bonds. Decreasing the discount rate by 0.5% (from 5.75% to 5.25%) would increase our accumulated benefit obligation at December 31, 2004 by approximately $52.0 million and increase estimated 2005 pension expense by approximately $8.7 million. The defined benefit plan for management personnel was closed to new entrants in 2003. We are working to restructure the defined benefits plans for other labor groups. Any such change could impact future pension expense and pension liabilities. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict what these factors will be in the future. Long-lived Assets As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $1.9 billion of property and equipment and related assets. In accounting for these long-lived assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate. Factors indicating potential impairment include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long-lived assets, a significant change in the long-lived assets condition, and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long-lived asset. In 2002, 2003 and 2004, due to volatile economic conditions and indications of declining aircraft market values, we evaluated whether the book value of our aircraft was impaired in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. No impairment was necessary based on the results of the evaluations except as related to the B737-200C fleet and Horizon idle Fokker F-28 aircraft and spare engines as described above. See page 24. There is inherent risk in estimating the future cash flows used in the impairment test. If cash flows do not materialize as estimated, there is a risk the impairment charges recognized to date may be inaccurate, or further impairment charges may be necessary in the future. 34 Table of Contents Workers Compensation and Employee Health Care Accruals The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for workers compensation claims and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Restructuring accruals During the third quarter of 2004, Alaska announced a management reorganization and the closure of its Oakland maintenance base, contracting out of the related heavy maintenance, contracting out of the Company Fleet Service Ground, Support Equipment and facility maintenance functions and other initiatives. Total severance and related costs associated with this restructuring are estimated at $53.4 million. Our severance package offered to impacted employees included cash payments based on years of service and one year of medical coverage after severance date. Since Alaska self-insures for employee medical coverage, we estimated the projected claims cost for affected employees and recorded a corresponding accrual. Actual experience will likely differ from the estimate if employees accept positions with other employers and no longer need the coverage provided by Alaska or simply submit claims during the one year period that are higher or lower than our estimate. We expect to adjust this accrual quarterly throughout 2005. Realizability of Deferred Tax Assets The Company has a net deferred tax liability of $98.9 million at December 31, 2004, which includes gross deferred tax assets of $396.1 million offset by a gross deferred tax liability of $495.0 million. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. , we have evaluated whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. Based on the available evidence, we have concluded that it is more likely than not that those assets would be realizable and thus no valuation allowance has been recorded as of December 31, 2004. Our conclusion is based on the expected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and does not rely on future taxable income. Should we incur additional losses in the future, our ability to realize the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to greater uncertainty. We will continue to reassess the need for a valuation allowance during each future reporting period. Liquidity and Capital Resources The table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity. December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 Change (In millions, except per share and debt-to- capital amounts) Cash and marketable securities $ 873.9 $ 812.3 $ 61.6 Working capital 285.0 130.9 154.1 Long-term debt and capital lease obligations 989.6 906.9 82.7 Shareholders equity 664.8 674.2 (9.4 ) Book value per common share $ 24.51 $ 25.19 $ (0.68 ) Long-term debt-to-capital 60%:40 % 57%:43 % NA Long-term debt-to-capital assuming aircraft operating leases are capitalized at seven times annualized rent 78%:22 % 77%:23 % NA During the year ended December 31, 2004, our cash and marketable securities increased $61.6 million to $873.9 million. This increase reflects cash provided by operating activities of $334.0 million, offset by cash used in financing activities of $106.9 million, cash used for property and equipment additions of $167.5 million and net purchases of marketable securities of $204.5 million. 35 Table of Contents Cash Provided by Operating Activities During 2004, net cash provided by operating activities was $334.0 million, compared to $355.2 million during 2003. Operating cash inflows in 2003 included $71.4 million of government compensation, whereas cash inflows in 2004 included $42.7 million of cash received from a tax refund. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $365.7 million during 2004, compared to $638.1 million in 2003. We had net purchases of $204.5 million of marketable securities and $167.5 million for property and equipment. During 2004, our aircraft related capital expenditures decreased $188.6 million as compared to 2003, reflecting a reduction in spending for new aircraft and capitalized overhauls. Beginning January 1, 2005, we will have no capital expenditures related to overhauls as those maintenance activities will be expensed as incurred under our maintenance accounting policy that will be adopted on that date. Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $106.9 million during 2004 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $206.8 million during 2003. Debt issuances during 2004 of $94.6 million were secured by flight equipment. These debt issuances have interest rates that vary with the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and payment terms ranging from 12 to 16 years. Debt issuances during the period were offset by normal long-term debt payments of $59.9 million and full repayment of our credit facility of $150 million. In 2003, we completed the private placement of $150 million of floating rate senior convertible notes. We plan to meet our capital and operating commitments through cash flow from operations and cash and marketable securities on hand at December 31, 2004 totaling $873.9 million. We also have restricted cash of $12.6 million, which is intended to collateralize interest payments due in the next two years on our $150 million floating rate senior convertible notes due 2023 issued in 2003. Bank Line of Credit Facility During 2004, Alaska paid off its $150 million credit facility and, on December 23, 2004, that facility expired. Management is currently negotiating a replacement facility and expects to close the new facility during the first quarter of 2005, although there can be no assurance that this can be accomplished on terms acceptable to us. The $150 million credit facility that expired in December 2004 contained contractual restrictions, required maintenance of specific levels of net worth, maintenance of certain debt and leases to net worth, leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios, and limits on investments, lease obligations, sales of assets, and additional indebtedness. Such provisions also limited the amount of funds Alaska Airlines can distribute via dividend to Alaska Air Group. The notes did not restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to enter into additional agreements limiting or prohibiting the distribution of earnings, loans or other payments to Alaska Air Group. As noted above, we are currently negotiating with a replacement facility and hope to have that agreement completed by the end of the first quarter. We expect that the new line of credit facility will be at least as restrictive as the prior credit facility. Convertible Notes In 2003, Alaska Air Group completed the private placement of $150.0 million of floating rate senior convertible notes due in 2023 pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Net proceeds from the offering were $144.9 million, of which $22.3 million was used to acquire U.S. government securities to fund the first three years of interest payments. In 2003, we made a capital contribution to Alaska Airlines of the remaining net proceeds from the sale of the notes. Alaska Airlines has used the remaining proceeds from the notes for working capital requirements and expects in the future to continue to use these remaining proceeds for working capital requirements as well as other general corporate purposes. Although we have not yet determined how each payment of principal or interest due will be funded in the future, we anticipate that 36 Table of Contents these payments will be funded either by dividends, distributions, loans, advances or other payments from our subsidiaries or through new borrowings or financings by Alaska Air Group. Any such payments by our subsidiaries to Air Group could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions. The holders of the $150.0 million of floating rate senior convertible notes due in 2023 may elect to have the Company redeem all or a portion of the notes on the 5th, 10th and 15th anniversaries of the date of issuance. On September 30, 2004, we entered into the First Supplemental Indenture with respect to the Notes to rescind the Company right to pay for such a repurchase of the Notes at the option of the holders, in whole or in part, in shares of our common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the notes, as amended, any such repurchases shall be paid for in cash. Supplemental Disclosure of Noncash Investing and Financing Activities During 2004, Horizon financed three Bombardier Q400s under long-term debt arrangements totaling $44.7 million. These debt arrangements have a 15-year term and interest rates that vary with LIBOR. Two of the aircraft were originally leased in January 2004 and were treated as capital leases at that time. The resulting re-financing transactions did not result in any gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Aircraft Purchase Commitments At December 31, 2004, we had firm orders for 12 aircraft requiring aggregate payments of approximately $291.1 million, as set forth below. In addition, Alaska had options to acquire 26 additional B737 s, and Horizon had options to acquire 15 Q400 and 25 CRJ 700 s. Alaska and Horizon expect to finance the firm orders and to the extent exercised, the option aircraft with leases, long-term debt or internally generated cash. One B737-800 was delivered in February 2005, and two others are expected in March and July of 2005. We have secured lease financing for the March delivery. We purchased the B737-800 aircraft delivered in February 2005 with cash on hand at the time, and expect to do the same for the July delivery. We expect to finance the CRJ700 delivered in 2005 with debt financing. The following table summarizes aircraft purchase commitments and payments by year, as of December 31, 2004: Delivery Period Firm Orders Beyond Aircraft 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2009 Total Boeing 737-800 3 3 Bombardier CRJ700 1 2 2 2 2 9 Total 4 2 2 2 2 12 Payments (Millions) $ 94.8 $ 50.9 $ 51.6 $ 53.0 $ 40.8 $ $ 291.1 In February 2005, we converted options to acquire three B737-800 aircraft into firm orders to be delivered in 2006. This results in additional purchase commitments which have been excluded from the table above. 37 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table provides a summary of our principal payments under current and long-term debt obligations, operating lease commitments, aircraft purchase commitments and other obligations as of December 31, 2004. This table excludes contributions to our various pension plans, which we expect to be approximately $60 million to $75 million per year through 2008. Beyond 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2009* Total (In millions) Current and long-term debt and capital lease obligations $ 53.4 $ 57.1 $ 60.1 $ 63.2 $ 67.0 $ 742.2 $ 1,043.0 Operating lease commitments 286.5 222.0 196.2 190.6 175.2 940.0 2,010.5 Aircraft purchase commitments(3) 94.8 50.9 51.6 53.0 40.8 291.1 Interest obligations(1) 54.4 52.4 49.3 47.4 42.3 211.8 457.6 Other purchase obligations(2) 28.8 29.1 29.4 29.7 30.0 154.5 301.5 Total $ 517.9 $ 411.5 $ 386.6 $ 383.9 $ 355.3 $ 2,048.5 $ 4,103.7 * Includes $150 million related to the Company senior convertible notes due in 2023. Holders of these Notes may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their Notes, for a purchase price equal to principal plus accrued interest, on the 5 th , 10 th , and 15 th anniversaries of the issuance of the Notes, or upon the occurrence of a change in control or tax event, as defined in the agreement. See Note 4 in the consolidated financial statements. (1) For variable rate debt, future obligations are shown above using interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2004. (2) Includes obligations under our long-term power-by-the-hour maintenance agreement. (3) Excludes three B737-800 aircraft to be delivered in 2006. In February 2005, options for three were converted to firm orders, resulting in additional purchase obligations. New Accounting Standards In March 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (EITF 03-1). The guidance prescribes a three-step model for determining whether an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, while the disclosure requirements are effective for annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2004. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF 03-1-1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10-20 of EITF Issue No. 03-1 The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (FSP EITF 03-01-1). FSP EITF 03-1-1 delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10-20 of EITF Issue 03-01. During the period of the delay, FSP EITF 03-1-1 states that companies should continue to apply relevant other-than-temporary guidance. The Company will assess the impact of paragraphs 10-20 of EITF 03-1 once the guidance has been finalized. At December 31, 2004, available-for-sale investments in the Company marketable securities portfolio had unrealized losses totaling $4.0 million which are recorded in Other Accumulated Comprehensive Income. Management does not believe that the securities with unrealized losses as of December 31, 2004 meet the criteria for recognizing the loss under existing other-than-temporary guidance. During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 123R, Share Based Payments: An Amendment of FASB No. 123 and 95 . The new standard requires companies to recognize in the income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based 38 Table of Contents compensation issued to employees. This new standard will apply to both stock options that we grant to employees and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which features a look-back provision and allows employees to purchase stock at a discount in excess of 5%. Our options are typically granted with graded vesting provisions, and we intend to amortize compensation cost over the service period using the straight line method. This new statement is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005 (our third quarter of 2005). We intend to use the modified prospective method upon adoption whereby previously awarded but unvested equity awards are accounted for in accordance with SFAS 123R but prospective amounts are recognized in the income statement instead of simply being disclosed. Our stock based compensation expense, as measured under SFAS 123, approximates $8 to $10 million per year on a pre-tax basis. During the third quarter of 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) affirmed its tentative conclusion reached in July of 2004 on EITF Issue No. 04-08, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted EPS (EITF 04-08). EITF 04-08 requires companies to include certain contingently convertible securities in the calculation of diluted EPS to the extent the inclusion of the shares would not be anti-dilutive beginning in the fourth quarter of 2004. Because the Company convertible notes fall under the scope of EITF 04-08 , the Company expects to report a lower diluted EPS to the extent the convertible notes are not anti-dilutive. Retroactive application of EITF 04-08 is required and our quarterly data in Item 8 has been revised accordingly. The notes were anti-dilutive for the fourth quarter and full year of 2004. The following example illustrates the application of this consensus on the third quarter of 2004: As Originally Change under Presented EITF 04-08 Net income $ 74.0 $ 74.0 Interest on convertible bonds, net of tax 1.0 Adjusted net income $ 74.0 $ 75.0 Weighted average shares outstanding 26.862 26.862 Assumed exercise of stock options .070 .070 Assumed conversion of convertible bonds 5.769 Diluted EPS shares 26.932 32.631 Earnings per share $ 2.75 $ 2.29 In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46, as amended by FIN 46 (Revised) in December 2003, requires consolidation of certain types of entities in which the Company absorbs a majority of the entity expected losses, receives a majority of the entity expected returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the entity. These entities are called variable interest entities. The principal characteristics of variable interest entities are (1) an insufficient amount of equity to absorb the entity expected losses, (2) equity owners as a group are not able to make decisions about the entity activities, and (3) equity that does not absorb the entity losses or receive the entity residual returns. Variable interests are contractual, ownership or other monetary interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in the entity net asset value. As a result, variable interest entities can arise from items such as lease agreements, loan arrangements, guarantees or service contracts. If an entity is determined to be a variable interest entity, the entity must be consolidated by the primary beneficiary . The primary beneficiary is the holder of the variable interests that absorbs a majority of the variable interest entity expected losses or receives a majority of the entity residual returns in the event no holder has a majority of the expected losses. There is no primary beneficiary in cases where no single holder absorbs the majority of the expected losses or receives a majority of the residual returns. The determination of the primary beneficiary is based on qualitative aspects of the arrangements involved or projected cash flows at the inception of the transaction with the variable interests entity. 39 Table of Contents FIN 46 was applicable to financial statements of companies that have interests in special purpose entities , as defined, during the year ended 2003. We are the lessee in a series of operating leases covering our leased aircraft. In many instances, the lessors are trusts established by a third party specifically to purchase, finance and lease aircraft to us. These leasing entities meet the criteria for variable interest entities. However, they do not meet the consolidation requirements of FIN 46 because we are not the primary beneficiary of the entity expected gains or losses. Our conclusions are based on the fact that the leasing arrangements involved contain terms which are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include residual value guarantees made by us, fixed-price purchase obligations or similar features that obligate us to absorb the majority of expected losses of the variable interest entities. Our maximum exposure under these types of lease arrangements is the remaining lease payments, which are reflected in future lease commitments in Note 5 (plus the cost, if any, of bringing the equipment into compliance with the physical condition required for return). Effect of Inflation Inflation and price changes other than for aircraft fuel do not have a significant effect on our operating revenues, operating expenses and operating income. 40 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to various uncertainties, such as global and industry instability, intense competition, volatile fuel prices, a largely unionized labor force, the need to finance large capital expenditures, government regulation, potential aircraft incidents and general economic conditions. If any of the following occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could also decline. The airline industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid change. We may be unable to compete effectively against other airlines with greater financial resources or lower operating costs, or to adjust rapidly enough in the event the basis of competition in our markets changes. The airline industry is highly competitive as to fares, flight frequency, frequent flyer benefits, routes and service. The industry is particularly susceptible to price discounting because airlines incur only nominal costs to provide service to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats. We currently compete with one or more other airlines on substantially all of our routes. Many of these airlines are larger and have significantly greater financial resources and name recognition or lower operating costs than our company. Others are operating under bankruptcy court protection and run lower costs more quickly than we can. Some of these competitors have chosen from time to time to add service, reduce their fares, or both, in our markets. We may be unable to compete effectively against other airlines that introduce service or discounted fares in the markets that we serve. Our strategy is to focus on serving a few key markets, including Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles and Anchorage. Significant portions of our flights occur to and from our Seattle hub. In 2004, this traffic to and from Seattle accounted for 63% of total traffic. We believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel, aircraft and ground operations, as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in these regions. As a result, we remain highly dependent upon our key markets. Our business would be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in our key markets, such as adverse changes in local economic conditions, negative public perception of a key market and significant price increases linked to increases in airport access costs and fees imposed on passengers. An increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that harm our operating results. Many airlines, including ours, have code share and frequent flyer marketing alliances with other airlines. Internet distribution arrangements either in conjunction with other airlines or with independent travel websites have become an important means for selling airline travel. Any consolidation or significant alliance activity within the airline industry, or our loss of key alliance or distribution relationships, could result in our competitors having access to increased route networks and resources, which, in turn, would increase the risks of competition described above. The airline industry, particularly the regional airlines, also faces competition from ground transportation alternatives, such as the bus, train or automobile. Video teleconferencing and other methods of electronic communication may add a new dimension of competition to the industry as business travelers seek lower-cost substitutes for air travel. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations are substantially exposed to the current high prices and variability of jet fuel. Further increases in jet fuel costs would harm our business. Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses, comprising 19% of total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004. Significant increases in fuel costs during 2004 have negatively impacted our results of operations. Further increases would harm our financial condition and results of operations. We estimate that during the year ended December 31, 2004 and during the year ended December 31, 2003 a one-cent increase in the price per gallon of fuel would have increased our fuel expenses by $4.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively. Average economic fuel prices (which include the benefits of our hedging program) during 2004 were 35.3 cents higher than in 2003. Total fuel costs, net of the benefit received from fuel hedges settled during the period were $177.4 million higher in 2004 compared to 2003. 41 Table of Contents Historically, fuel costs have been unpredictable and subject to wide price fluctuations based on geopolitical issues and supply and demand. Fuel availability is also subject to periods of market surplus and shortage and is affected by demand for both home heating oil and gasoline. Because of the effect of these events on the price and availability of fuel, the cost and future availability of fuel cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. In the event of a fuel supply shortage, higher fuel prices or the curtailment of scheduled service could result. Some of our competitors may have more leverage in obtaining fuel. We may be unable to offset increases in the price of fuel through higher fares. We utilize our fuel hedges as a form of insurance against significant increases in fuel prices. To hedge our exposure to fuel price fluctuations, we began purchasing hedging instruments, primarily instruments that cap the price paid. At December 31, 2004, we had fuel hedge contracts in place to hedge 50% of our anticipated fuel consumption in 2005 and 35% and 9% of our anticipated fuel consumption in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Even with hedges, we are substantially exposed to increases in jet fuel costs. If we are unable to meet our cost reduction goals, our results of operations and financial condition may suffer. We, along with other airlines, have announced aggressive cost reduction goals that are an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to passengers through competitive fares while at the same time achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital. We believe having a lower cost structure better positions us to be able to grow our business and take advantage of market opportunities. We have implemented initiatives that we believe will reduce our annual operating costs by approximately $185 million and seek additional savings of approximately $155 million, the majority of which is being sought from our labor groups and, to a lesser extent, additional cost reductions in ticket distribution, maintenance, and other costs. We hope to achieve labor savings through a combination of market-based wage adjustments, a common health and retirement benefits package for every work group, and work rule changes focusing on greater efficiency in operations. We cannot be certain that we will be able to implement changes in our operations sufficient to generate this level of additional targeted savings, or that if such changes are implemented, that forecasted savings will be achieved. In the event that we are unable to achieve our cost reduction goals, or our efforts prove less successful than those of our competitors, our results of operations will likely be below our own expectations and may be below those of outside financial analysts, and our financial condition may be harmed. Many of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. A failure to negotiate new agreements, or to do so on terms competitive with the labor costs and practices of our competitors, could disrupt our business and increase our costs. As of December 31, 2004, labor unions represented 83% of Alaska and 45% of Horizon employees. Labor costs generally are a significant component of our total expenses, comprising approximately 35% of our total operating expenses in 2004. Each of our different employee groups has separate collective bargaining agreements, and may make demands that would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our profitability. At December 31, 2004 we were in contract talks with most labor groups and had submitted to binding arbitration with the Airline Pilots Association (ALPA). The degree to which we meet our overall labor savings goals will be determined to a large extent by the results of the pilot arbitration. The pilot contract provides that, if an agreement on the entire contract was not reached by December 15, 2004, ten contract issues plus wage rates would be submitted to an interest arbitrator. Issues submitted generally relate to pension plans, medical insurance, profit sharing, code sharing and work rules. The parties did not reach an agreement, and the issues have been submitted to binding arbitration in March 2005 with a decision to be effective in May 2005. The pilot labor contract contains market related standards for wages and non-wage issues. If we were unable to reach agreement on the terms of any collective bargaining agreement with any group of our employees or were to experience widespread employee dissatisfaction, we could be subject to work 42 Table of Contents slowdowns or stoppages. We could also become subject to protests or picketing by organized labor groups representing our employees. Any of these events would be disruptive to our operations and could harm our business. In the event any agreement we reach with an organized labor group requires us to pay wages or to incur costs that are materially higher than those we currently pay or we are unable to fully offset such increased costs through fare increases, our expenses would increase and our operating margin would be harmed. Weakness in the general economy, and in the airline industry in particular, could have an adverse effect on our business. We believe that airline traffic, including business traffic, is particularly sensitive to changes in economic growth and expectations. Weak economic growth in 2001 through the first half of 2003, low ticket yields, and escalating fuel prices contributed to much of the airline industry suffering significant losses from 2001 through 2004. Currently, US Airways, United Airlines and ATA Airlines, as well as other carriers, operate under bankruptcy protection. Because airlines operating under bankruptcy protection receive increased flexibility to reduce their costs by voiding contracts and renegotiating existing business obligations, current and future airline bankruptcies could have a substantial impact on industry competition. In the event airlines who have received bankruptcy protection choose to apply some or all of the cost savings they obtain toward reduced fares, bankruptcy by airlines who compete with us may cause us to reduce our fares and result in a substantial reduction in revenue and operating margin. Continued weakness in the airline industry may also result in additional industry consolidation, greater reliance on industry alliances, such as code sharing and frequent flyer reciprocity arrangements, and increased price competition among existing carriers, each of which could dramatically alter the competitive environment in the markets we serve and harm our operating results. Continued weak economic performance in the airline industry may also result in a further reduction in our credit rating and make it more difficult for us to raise capital on economical terms. Any general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of a soft economy would harm our business. We rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business and any failure of these systems could harm our business. We depend on automated systems to operate our business, including our computerized airline reservation system, our telecommunication systems and our website. We also issue a substantial number of our tickets to passengers as electronic tickets. We depend on our computerized reservation system to be able to issue, track and accept these electronic tickets. In order for our operations to work efficiently, our website and reservation system must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver important flight information. Substantial or repeated website, reservations system or telecommunication systems failures could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our customers to purchase tickets from another airline. Any disruption in these systems could result in the loss of important data, increase our expenses and generally harm our business. Increases in government taxes and fees could reduce demand for air travel and harm our business Airlines pay or are responsible for collecting a number of different taxes and fees including, but not limited to, fuel taxes, airport facility charges, immigration fees, security fees, excise taxes on ticket sales, and fuel taxes. Recently, the United States Department of Homeland Security proposed raising the aviation security fee from $2.50 per one-way segment to $5.50 per one-way segment. We believe the demand for air travel is highly sensitive to fare levels. Although law makers may impose additional fees and view them as pass through costs , we believe that a higher total ticket price in the eyes of the consumer will influence their purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic, which would harm our business. Moreover, we believe that the impact of higher fees is proportionally greater for low fare carriers, carriers with a high percentage of leisure travelers, and carriers that fly relatively short segments. Because Alaska 43 Table of Contents carriers many leisure travels and Horizon flies many short haul segments, we believe higher security fees and (other fee increases generally) could negatively impact Air Group more than some of our competitors. The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks negatively impacted our industry and our business and further threatened or actual terrorist attacks, or other hostilities involving the U.S., may significantly harm our industry and our business in the future. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and their aftermath have negatively impacted the airline industry, including our company. Because a substantial portion of our costs are fixed in the short-term, we were unable to offset the reduction in customer demand through cost savings, and operating results were harmed to a proportionately greater degree. Additional terrorist attacks, the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the U.S. could have a further significant negative impact on the airline industry, including us, and could: result in a grounding of commercial air traffic by the FAA, significantly reduce passenger traffic and yields due to a potentially dramatic drop in demand for air travel, increase security and insurance costs, increase fuel costs and the volatility of fuel prices, make it more difficult for us to obtain war risk or other insurance, and increase costs from airport shutdowns, flight cancellations and delays resulting from security breaches and perceived safety threats. Our insurance costs have increased as a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and further increases in insurance costs would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, aviation insurers dramatically increased airline insurance premiums and significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance available to airlines for third-party claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events to $50 million per event and in the aggregate. In light of this development, under the Air Transportation Safety and Stabilization Act, the Homeland Security Act of 2002, as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005, the government is currently offering domestic airlines either (i) third-party liability war risk coverage above $50 million, or (ii) in lieu of commercial war risk insurance, full hull, comprehensive and third-party liability war risk coverage. This coverage provides for the same limits of hull and comprehensive insurance and twice the limits of third-party liability insurance carried by the airline on September 11, 2001. Aviation insurers could increase their premiums even further in the event of additional terrorist attacks, hijackings, airline accidents or other events adversely affecting the airline industry. Furthermore, the full hull, comprehensive and third-party war risk insurance provided by the government is mandated through August 31, 2005. While the government may extend the deadline for when it will stop providing such coverage, we cannot be certain that any extension will occur, or if it does, how long the extension will last. It is expected that, should the government stop providing such coverage to the airline industry, the premiums charged by aviation insurers for this coverage will be substantially higher than the premiums currently charged by the government. Significant increases in insurance premiums would adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions. Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements, both domestically and internationally, that involve significant compliance costs. In the last several years, Congress has passed laws, and the DOT and the FAA have issued regulations, relating to the operation of airlines that have required significant expenditures. Additional laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time 44 Table of Contents to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel. If adopted, these measures could have the effect of raising ticket prices, reducing revenue and/or increasing costs. Our reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident. An accident or incident involving one of our aircraft could involve a significant loss of life and result in a loss of faith in our airlines by the flying public. In addition, we could experience significant potential claims from injured passengers and surviving relatives, as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential temporary or permanent loss from service. Although we believe that we currently maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice, the amount of such coverage may not be adequate and we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident. Substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results. Moreover, any aircraft accident or incident, even if fully insured and even if it does not involve one of our airlines, could cause a public perception that our airlines or the equipment they fly is less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives, which would harm our business. Our operations are often affected by factors beyond our control, including traffic congestion at airports, weather conditions and increased security measures, any of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations. Like other airlines, our operations are subject to delays caused by factors beyond our control, including air traffic congestion at airports, adverse weather conditions and increased security measures. Delays frustrate passengers, reduce aircraft utilization and increase costs, all of which in turn affect our profitability. During periods of fog, snow, rain, freezing rain, storms or other adverse weather conditions, flights may be canceled or significantly delayed. Due to our geographic area of operations, we believe a significant portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than many of our competitors. Cancellations or delays due to weather conditions, traffic control problems and breaches in security could harm our financial condition and results of operations. If Alaska fails to comply with financial covenants, some of its financing agreements may be terminated. Alaska is required to comply with specific financial covenants in certain agreements. Although our $150 million revolving credit facility expired in December 2004, we are currently negotiating a replacement facility. We expect this facility to have covenants that are as restrictive, if not more, than those in our recently expired agreement. We cannot ensure that Alaska will be able to comply with these covenants or provisions or that these requirements will not limit our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs. Alaska inability to comply with the required financial maintenance covenants or provisions could result in default under these financing agreements and could result in a cross default under Alaska other financing agreements. In the event of any such default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under the agreements could be declared to be immediately due and payable. If Alaska did not have sufficient available cash to pay all amounts that became due and payable, Air Group or Alaska would have to seek additional debt or equity financing, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If such financing were not available, Alaska would have to sell assets in order to obtain the funds required to make accelerated payments or risk its aircraft becoming subject to repossession, which could harm our business. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel at reasonable costs. Our business is labor intensive, with labor costs representing approximately 35% of our operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004. We expect salaries, wages and benefits to increase on a gross basis and that these costs could increase as a percentage of our overall costs, which could harm our business. We compete against the major U.S. airlines for labor in many highly skilled positions. If we are unable to hire, train and retain qualified employees at a reasonable cost, or if we lose the services of key personnel we may be 45 Table of Contents unable to grow or sustain our business and our operating results and business prospects could be harmed. We may also have difficulty replacing management or other key personnel who leave and, therefore, the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business. We rely on third-party vendors for certain critical activities We have historically relied on outside vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business, including airframe and engine maintenance, ground handling, fueling, catering, computer reservation system hosting and software maintenance. As part of its cost control efforts, the reliance on outside vendors will increase. In September 2004, Alaska Airlines announced that it was sub-contracting the remaining heavy aircraft maintenance that it was then performing to outside vendors. In addition, Alaska retained outside suppliers for fleet service and facilities maintenance. In January 2005, Alaska signed an agreement with a vendor for ground handling services at Seattle in the event that it does not reach an agreement with the IAM representing its ramp employees. Our increased use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks. In the event that one or more vendors goes into bankruptcy, ceases operation or fails to perform as promised, replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates, or at all. Vendor bankruptcies, unionization, regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force Alaska to renegotiate existing agreements on less favorable terms. These events could result in disruptions in Alaska operations or increases in its cost structure. We have incurred operating losses in each year since 2000 and may incur substantial operating losses in the future. In addition, our quarterly results can fluctuate substantially. For the year ended December 31, 2004, Air Group incurred an operating loss of $79.8 million. Prior to that, we incurred operating losses of $17.5 million and $93.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The inability to achieve or sustain profitability may hinder our ability to honor our existing obligations as they become due, to obtain future equity or debt financing or to do so on economical terms, and to sustain and expand our business. In addition, our quarterly results can fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors including seasonal variations in traffic, the timing of various expenditures, and weather. Because expenses of an aircraft flight do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried, a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline operating and financial results. Accordingly, a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our operating results. Due to these factors, as well as other risk factors described in this Form 10-K, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results may not be good indicators of our future performance. In addition, it is possible that in any future quarter our operating results could be below expectations of investors and any published reports or analyses regarding our company. In that event, the price of Air Group common stock could decline, perhaps substantially. Our indebtedness could increase the volatility of earnings and otherwise restrict our activities. We have and will continue to have for the foreseeable future a significant amount of indebtedness. Due to our high fixed costs, including aircraft lease commitments and debt service, a decrease in revenues results in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings. As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $1,043.0 million of indebtedness outstanding, approximately $892.5 million of which was secured by flight equipment and real property. Our outstanding indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could: limit our ability to obtain additional financing for funding our growth strategy, capital expenditures, acquisitions, working capital or other purposes, require us to dedicate a material portion of our operating cash flow to fund interest payments on indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for other purposes, and 46 Table of Contents limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions, including reacting to any economic slowdown in the airline industry. In addition, we have an ongoing need to finance new aircraft deliveries, and there is no assurance that such financing will be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms. Horizon results are partly dependent on Frontier JetExpress, which is dependent on Frontier Airlines. Horizon operates regional jet service branded as Frontier JetExpress under a 12-year agreement with Frontier Airlines that began in January 2004. Currently, that flying represents approximately 23% of Horizon total capacity and 9.9% of Horizon passenger revenue. Under the arrangement, Frontier Airlines pays Horizon the expected costs of providing the service plus a base markup. If Frontier were to have financial difficulties and find it necessary to terminate the agreement, we would have significant excess capacity that we would have to deploy elsewhere. There can be no assurance that this excess capacity could be deployed in profitable markets and our unit operating costs would likely increase. A downgrade in our corporate credit rating may indicate a decline in our business and in our ability to make interest or principal payments on our outstanding debt. In 2003, Air Group credit ratings were downgraded by both S&P and Moody s. On March 14, 2003, the senior implied rating for Alaska Air Group was downgraded from Ba3 to B1 by Moody with a commensurate reduction in other ratings. On September 4, 2003, Standard & Poor announced that it lowered the corporate credit rating from BB to BB- with a commensurate reduction in other ratings. We cannot be assured that our corporate credit ratings will not decline in the future. If any of our ratings decline, this may indicate a decline in our business and may affect the trading prices, if any, of our common stock or convertible notes and may make additional borrowing more expensive and difficult to obtain.
