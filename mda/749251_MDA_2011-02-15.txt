ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The purpose of the following Management Discussion and Analysis ( MD&A ) is to help facilitate the understanding of significant factors influencing the operating results, financial condition and cash flows of Gartner, Inc. Additionally, the MD&A also conveys our expectations of the potential impact of known trends, events or uncertainties that may impact future results. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. Historical results and percentage relationships are not necessarily indicative of operating results for future periods. References to the Company, we, our, and us are to Gartner, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. The following items impact the presentation and discussion of results in this MD&A section: On December 18, 2009 we acquired AMR Research, Inc. ( AMR Research ) and on December 30, 2009 we acquired Burton Group, Inc. ( Burton Group ) (see Note 2 Acquisitions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The operating results of these businesses have been included in our consolidated results beginning on their respective dates of acquisition. The results of these businesses were not material to our consolidated or segment results for 2009. In 2008 we sold our Vision Events business, which had been part of our Events segment. As a result, the results of operations for this business for 2008 and earlier periods have been reported as a discontinued operation (see Note 3 Discontinued Operations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

BUSINESS OVERVIEW Gartner, Inc. is the world leading information technology research and advisory company that helps executives use technology to build, guide and grow their enterprises. We offer independent and objective research and analysis on the information technology, computer hardware, software, communications and related technology industries. We provide comprehensive coverage of the IT industry to 11,601 client organizations, including approximately 400 of the Fortune 500 companies, in 85 countries. Our client base consists primarily of CIOs and other senior IT and executives from a wide variety of business enterprises, government agencies and the investment community. We have three business segments: Research, Consulting and Events. Research provides insight for CIOs, other IT executives and professionals, business leaders, technology companies and the investment community through research reports and briefings, access to our analysts, as well as peer networking services and membership programs. Consulting consists primarily of consulting engagements that utilize our research insight, benchmarking data, problem-solving methodologies and hands on experience to improve the return on an organization IT investment through assessments of cost, performance, efficiency and quality. Events consists of various symposia, summits and conferences focused on the IT industry as a whole, as well as IT applicable to particular industries and particular roles within an organization. 16 Table of Contents BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS We believe the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments: BUSINESS SEGMENT BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS Research Contract value represents the value attributable to all of our subscription-related research products that recognize revenue on a ratable basis. Contract value is calculated as the annualized value of all subscription research contracts in effect at a specific point in time, without regard to the duration of the contract. Client retention rate represents a measure of client satisfaction and renewed business relationships at a specific point in time. Client retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing our current clients, who were also clients a year ago, by all clients from a year ago. Wallet retention rate represents a measure of the amount of contract value we have retained with clients over a twelve-month period. Wallet retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing the contract value of clients, who were clients one year earlier, by the total contract value from a year earlier, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. When wallet retention exceeds client retention, it is an indication of retention of higher-spending clients, or increased spending by retained clients, or both. Number of executive program members represents the number of paid participants in executive programs. Consulting Consulting backlog represents future revenue to be derived from in-process consulting, measurement and strategic advisory services engagements. Utilization rates represent a measure of productivity of our consultants. Utilization rates are calculated for billable headcount on a percentage basis by dividing total hours billed by total hours available to bill. Billing Rate represents earned billable revenue divided by total billable hours. Average annualized revenue per billable headcount represents a measure of the revenue generating ability of an average billable consultant and is calculated periodically by multiplying the average billing rate per hour times the utilization percentage times the billable hours available for one year. Events Number of events represents the total number of hosted events completed during the period. Number of attendees represents the number of people who attend events. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION The cornerstones of our growth strategy are to focus on producing extraordinary research content, deliver innovative and highly differentiated product offerings, enhance our sales capability, provide world class client service, and improve our operational effectiveness. We had total revenues of $1,288.5 million in 2010, an increase of 13% over the prior year while diluted earnings per share increased by $.11 per share, to $0.96. Revenues increased across all of our geographic regions and in all three of our business segments. Total revenues were also up 13% excluding the impact of foreign currency. Research revenues rose 15% year-over-year, to $865.00 million in 2010, while the contribution margin was flat at 65%. At December 31, 2010, Research contract value was almost $978.0 million, the highest in the Company history, and an increase of 25% over December 31, 2009. Client retention was 83% and wallet retention was 98% at December 31, 2010. Consulting revenues increased 5% over 2009, while the gross contribution margin improved by 1 point. Consultant utilization was 68% for 2010, the same as 2009. We had 473 billable consultants at December 31, 2010. Events revenues increased 21% compared to 2009. We held 56 events in 2010, two more than the prior year, and attendance at our events increased 22%, to 37,219. The segment contribution margin was 46% for 2010, an increase of 5 points over 2009. For a more detailed discussion of our segment results, see Segment Results below. We refinanced our debt in late 2010 to take advantage of favorable financing conditions and to obtain greater financial flexibility and liquidity through a larger revolving credit facility. The new credit arrangement provides for a five-year, $200.0 million term loan and a $400.0 million revolving credit facility. 17 Table of Contents Gartner generated over $205.0 million of cash from operating activities in 2010. We had $120.2 million of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2010, and we had $376.0 million of available borrowing capacity under our new revolving credit facility. We believe we have a strong cash position and liquidity. FLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTERLY RESULTS Our quarterly and annual revenue, operating income, and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors, including: the timing of our SymposiumITxpo series, that normally are held during the fourth calendar quarter, and other events; the amount of new business generated; the mix of domestic and international business; changes in market demand for our products and services; changes in foreign currency rates; the timing of the development, introduction and marketing of new products and services; competition in the industry; and other factors. The potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause period-to-period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are also described below. The preparation of our financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events. We develop our estimates using both current and historical experience, as well as other factors, including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future. We adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate. However, our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision. In addition, these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ from actual results. On-going changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the Company financial statements in future periods. Our critical accounting policies are as follows: Revenue recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements ( SAB 101 ), and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition ( SAB 104 ). Once all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met, revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows: Research revenues are derived from subscription contracts for research products and are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term. Fees from research reprints are recognized when the reprint is shipped. Consulting revenues are principally generated from fixed fee and time and material engagements. Revenues from fixed fee contracts are recognized on a proportional performance basis. Revenues from time and materials engagements are recognized as work is delivered and/or services are provided. Revenues related to contract optimization contracts are contingent in nature and are only recognized upon satisfaction of all conditions related to their payment. Events revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the related symposium, conference or exhibition. The majority of research contracts are billable upon signing, absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time. All research contracts are non-cancelable and non-refundable, except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses. It is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue, since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim. For those government contracts that permit cancellation, historically we only recorded fees receivables to the extent amounts were earned and deferred revenue to the extent cash was received. As of September 30, 2010, based on an analysis of historic contract cancellations, we determined that the likelihood of such cancellations was remote. Accordingly, as of that date we record the entire billable contract amount as fees receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount to deferred revenue, consistent with other contracts. This change in estimate had an immaterial impact. Uncollectible fees receivable The allowance for losses is composed of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve. Provisions are charged against earnings, either as a reduction in revenues or an increase to expense. The measurement of likely and probable losses 18 Table of Contents and the allowance for losses is based on historical loss experience, aging of outstanding receivables, an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients. This evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires material estimates. These valuation reserves are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectibility of fees receivable becomes available. Circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients liquidity and credit quality, other factors negatively impacting our clients ability to pay their obligations as they come due, and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. The following table provides our total fees receivable and the related allowance for losses (in thousands): December 31, 2010 2009 Total fees receivable $ 372,018 $ 325,698 Allowance for losses (7,200 ) (8,100 ) Fees receivable, net $ 364,818 $ 317,598 Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets The evaluation of goodwill is performed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 350, which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In addition, an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis. Our annual goodwill assessment requires us to estimate the fair values of our reporting units based on estimates of future business operations and market and economic conditions in developing long-term forecasts. If we determine that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we must recognize an impairment charge for a portion of the associated goodwill of that reporting unit against earnings in our financial statements. Factors we consider important that could trigger a review for impairment include the following: Significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results; Significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; Significant negative industry or economic trends; Significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and Our market capitalization relative to net book value. Due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of the reporting units and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations, both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty, and as additional information becomes known, we may change our estimates. We completed the required annual goodwill impairment testing in the quarter ended September 30, 2010 and concluded that the fair values of each of the Company reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values. In addition, management concluded that none of the goodwill impairment triggers discussed above occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010. See Note 1 Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional goodwill disclosures. Accounting for income taxes As we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in question. We consider the availability of loss carryforwards, existing deferred tax liabilities, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. In the event we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment is made to reduce the valuation allowance and increase income in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we determine that 19 Table of Contents we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance is charged against income in the period such determination is made. Accounting for stock-based compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topics 505 and 718, as interpreted by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins No. 107 ( SAB No. 107 ) and No. 110 ( SAB No. 110 ). The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense, which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant, over the related service period, net of estimated forfeitures (see Note 9 Stock-Based Compensation in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain highly complex and subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the stock compensation awards and the Company Common Stock price volatility. In addition, determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the rate of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of achievement of certain performance targets. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent management best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions, or if the quantity and nature of the Company stock-based compensation awards changes, then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period. Restructuring and other accruals We may record accruals for severance costs, costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased, contract terminations, asset impairments, and other costs as a result of on-going actions we undertake to streamline our organization, reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs. Estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions, such as future lease payments, sublease income, the fair value of assets, and severance and related benefits, are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated. These accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates. In addition, these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved. We also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs. Amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known with certainty until after year end. 20 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overall Results The following tables summarize the changes in selected line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operation for the three years ended December 31, 2010 (dollars in thousands): For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Twelve Months Twelve Months Income Income Ended Ended Increase Increase December 31, December 31, (Decrease) (Decrease) 2010 2009 (1) $ % Total revenues $ 1,288,454 $ 1,139,800 $ 148,654 13 % Costs and expenses: Cost of services & product development 552,238 498,363 (53,875 ) (11 )% Selling, general and administrative 543,174 477,003 (66,171 ) (14 )% Depreciation 25,349 25,387 38 % Amortization of intangibles 10,525 1,636 (8,889 ) >(100 )% Acquisition & integration charges 7,903 2,934 (4,969 ) >(100 )% Operating income 149,265 134,477 14,788 11 % Interest expense, net (15,616 ) (16,032 ) 416 3 % Other income (expense), net 436 (2,919 ) 3,355 >100 % Provision for income taxes 37,800 32,562 (5,238 ) (16 )% Net income $ 96,285 $ 82,964 $ 13,321 16 % For the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Twelve Months Twelve Months Income Income Ended Ended Increase Increase December 31, December 31, (Decrease) (Decrease) 2009 (1) 2008 $ % Total revenues $ 1,139,800 $ 1,279,065 $ (139,265 ) (11 )% Costs and expenses: Cost of services & product development 498,363 572,208 73,845 13 % Selling, general and administrative 477,003 514,994 37,991 7 % Depreciation 25,387 25,880 493 2 % Amortization of intangibles 1,636 1,615 (21 ) (1 )% Acquisition & integration charges 2,934 (2,934 ) (100 )% Operating income 134,477 164,368 (29,891 ) (18 )% Interest expense, net (16,032 ) (19,269 ) 3,237 17 % Other expense, net (2,919 ) (358 ) (2,561 ) >(100 )% Provision for income taxes 32,562 47,593 15,031 32 % Income from continuing operations 82,964 97,148 (14,184 ) (15 )% Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes (2) 6,723 (6,723 ) (100 )% Net income $ 82,964 $ 103,871 $ (20,907 ) (20 )% (1) In December 2009 we acquired AMR Research and Burton Group. The operating results of these businesses have been included in our consolidated results of operations beginning on their respective dates of acquisition. The results of these businesses were not material to the Company 2009 consolidated operating results. (2) Includes the gain on sale and operating results of the Company Vision Events business, which was sold in 2008. 21 Table of Contents 2010 VERSUS 2009 TOTAL REVENUES for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 increased $148.7 million, or 13%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. Revenues increased across all of our geographic regions and in all three of our business segments. Total revenues were also up 13% excluding the impact of foreign currency, which had an immaterial impact year-over-year. An overview of our results by geographic region follows: Revenues from sales to United States and Canadian clients increased 15%, to $765.8 million in 2010 from $663.8 million in 2009, with a substantial portion of the increase due to the AMR Research and Burton Group businesses. Revenues from sales to clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa ( EMEA ) increased to $380.8 million in 2010 from $360.8 million in 2009, a 6% increase. Revenues from sales to clients in our Other International region increased 23%, to $141.9 million in 2010 from $115.2 million in 2009. An overview of our results by segment follows: Research revenues increased 15% in 2010, to $865.0 million compared to $752.5 million in 2009, and comprised 67% and 66% of our total revenues in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Consulting revenues increased 5% in 2010 to $302.1 million, compared to $286.8 million in 2009, and comprised approximately 23% and 25% of our total revenues in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Events revenues were $121.3 million in 2010, an increase of 21% from $100.4 million in 2009, and comprised approximately 10% and 9% of our total revenues in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Please refer to the section of this MD&A below entitled Segment Results for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment. COST OF SERVICES AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ( COS ) increased 11% in 2010, or $53.9 million, to $552.2 million compared to $498.4 million in 2009. The impact of foreign currency on the year-over-year increase was not significant. We recognized $36.8 million in higher payroll, commissions, and related personnel costs in 2010, primarily due to the impact of the increased headcount from the AMR Research and Burton Group businesses. We had $12.0 million in higher conference and travel costs in 2010, due to the additional events we held and increased attendees, as well as a general increase in travel activity from the depressed 2009 levels, when the Company had strict travel restrictions in place due to the economic downturn. We also had $2.2 million in higher equity compensation expense due to a higher level of achievement on performance-based stock units. Cost of services and product development as a percentage of sales was 43% in 2010 and 44% in 2009, a 1 point improvement, primarily driven by the substantial increase in our fourth quarter 2010 revenues, which increased 16% over the fourth quarter of 2009, and was substantially greater than the increase in the quarterly cost of services. The improvement reflects the operating leverage of our business model. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ( SG&A ) expense increased by $66.2 million in 2010, or 14%, to $543.2 million from $477.0 million in 2009. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, SG&A expense increased 13% year-over-year. We had $47.0 million of higher sales commissions, payroll and benefits, and other personnel charges in 2010, which included the additional headcount costs attributable to the AMR Research and Burton Group businesses. We also had $4.3 million of additional stock-based compensation expense due to the higher level of achievement on performance-based stock units and higher travel charges of $7.1 million, primarily due to additional sales headcount and the loosening of travel restrictions. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency added $3.1 million of additional expense. DEPRECIATION expense decreased slightly year-over-year. Capital spending increased to $21.7 million in 2010 from $15.1 million in 2009, a 43% increase. The Company had reduced its capital expenditures in 2009 due to the economic downturn. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES was $10.5 million in 2010 compared to $1.6 million in 2009. The increase is due to the amortization of the intangibles acquired from AMR Research and Burton Group. 22 Table of Contents ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION CHARGES was $7.9 million in 2010 and $2.9 million in 2009. Included is these charges are legal fees and consultant fees in connection with the acquisitions and integration of AMR Research and Burton Group, as well as severance costs related to redundant headcount. OPERATING INCOME increased 11% year-over-year, to $149.3 million in 2010 from $134.5 million in 2009. The increase was due to the significantly higher gross contribution from our three business segments in 2010, which increased 15% year-over-year, to $742.3 million in 2010 from $642.9 million in 2009. The increased gross contribution was partially offset by higher charges in 2010 for SG&A as well as higher intangible amortization and acquisition and integration charges related to our acquisitions. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 12% for both 2010 and 2009. Please refer to the section of this MD&A entitled Segment Results below for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET was $15.6 million in 2010 and $16.0 million in 2009, a 3% decline. The 2010 period includes $3.7 million of incremental expense related to the refinancing of our debt in December 2010 (See Note 6 Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Excluding the $3.7 million incremental charge, Interest expense, net would have declined approximately 26% year-over-year, due to lower average debt outstanding and a lower weighted-average rate. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET was $0.4 million in 2010 and consisted of a $2.4 million gain for an insurance recovery related to a prior period loss offset by net foreign currency exchange losses. The $(2.9) expense in 2009 primarily consisted of net foreign currency exchange losses. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES was $37.8 million in 2010 compared to $32.6 million in 2009 and the effective tax rate was 28.2% for both periods. Year-over-year increases in the rate attributable to higher financial statement cost of repatriation and higher net reserve increases were substantially offset by reductions in the rate year over year attributable to larger releases of valuation allowances. The Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) has completed its examination of the federal income tax return of the Company for the tax year ended December 31, 2007. In December 2010, the Company received a report of the audit findings. The Company disagrees with certain of the proposed adjustments and intends to vigorously dispute this matter through applicable IRS and judicial procedures, as appropriate. The Company believes that it has recorded reserves sufficient to cover exposures related to these issues. However, the resolution of such matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the ultimate resolution will not exceed the amounts recorded. Although the final resolution of the proposed adjustments is uncertain, we believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. NET INCOME was $96.3 million in 2010 and $83.0 million in 2009, an increase of $13.3 million, or 16%, primarily due to a $14.8 million year-over-year increase in operating income. We also had a $0.4 million gain from other income (expense) activity in 2010 compared to a loss of $(2.9) million in 2009, as well as slightly lower interest expense in 2010. These increases were partially offset by higher income tax charges in 2010. Basic earnings per share increased 15% year-over-year while diluted earnings per share increased 13% year-over-year. The increased earnings per share were due to the higher net income in 2010, which was slightly reduced by higher weighted-average shares outstanding in 2010. 2009 VERSUS 2008 TOTAL REVENUES for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 decreased $139.3 million, or 11%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2008. Revenues declined across all of our geographic regions and in all three of our business segments. The impact of foreign currency had a negative impact on our revenues in 2009, and excluding this impact, total revenues in 2009 were down 8% compared to 2008. Our revenues and operating results were negatively impacted by global economic conditions in 2009. An overview of our results by geographic region follows: Revenues from sales to United States and Canadian clients decreased 8%, to $663.8 million in 2009 from $723.2 million in 2008. Revenues from sales to clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa ( EMEA ) decreased to $360.8 million in 2009 from $430.4 million in 2008, a 16% decrease. 23 Table of Contents Revenues from sales to clients in our Other International region decreased 8%, to $115.2 million in 2009 from $125.4 million in 2008. An overview of our results by segment follows: Research revenues decreased 4% in 2009 to $752.5 million compared to $781.6 million in 2008, and comprised approximately 66% and 61% of our total revenues in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Consulting revenues decreased 17% in 2009 to $286.8 million, compared to $347.4 million in 2008, and comprised approximately 25% and 27% of our total revenues in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Events revenues were $100.4 million in 2009, a decrease of 33% from $150.1 million in 2008, and comprised approximately 9% and 12% of our total revenues in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Please refer to the section of this MD&A below entitled Segment Results for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment. COST OF SERVICES AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT decreased $73.8 million year-over-year, or 13%. The favorable impact of foreign currency translation reduced expense by about $19.0 million. We had lower conference expenses of $18.5 million primarily due to discontinued events. We also had reduced travel and internal meeting charges of $16.7 million and lower personnel costs of about $12.5 million, primarily due to our tight cost controls. The remaining $7.1 million net decrease was spread across a number of other expense categories. Cost of services and product development as a percentage of sales declined by 1 point, to 44% in 2009 from 45% in 2008, primarily due to tight expense controls across our businesses. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ( SG&A ) expense decreased by about $38.0 million in 2009, or 7%, compared to 2008, despite increasing our sales force. The impact of foreign currency translation reduced expense by about $18.0 million. We also had lower travel, internal meeting, and recruiting costs of about $19.0 million, again due to our tight cost controls. The remaining net reduction was spread across a number of other expense categories. Excluding the 60 sales associates that joined us from AMR Research and Burton Group, we had 942 quota-bearing sales associates at December 31, 2009, a 2% increase from the prior year end. This additional investment in sales associates resulted in $9.0 million of higher payroll and benefits costs, which was offset by lower G&A charges. DEPRECIATION expense decreased 2% year-over-year which reflects reduced capital spending during 2009. Capital spending decreased to $15.1 million in 2009 from $24.3 million in 2008, a 38% decline, which reflects the Company reduced 2009 capital expenditures. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES was $1.6 million for both 2009 and 2008. ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION CHARGES was $2.9 million in 2009 and zero in 2008. Included is these charges are legal fees and consultant fees in connection with the acquisitions and integration of AMR Research and Burton Group, as well as severance costs related to redundant headcount. OPERATING INCOME decreased 18% year-over-year, to $134.5 million in 2009 from $164.4 million in 2008. Operating income as a percentage of revenues declined 1 point year-over-year, primarily due to lower profitability in our Consulting and Events segments and the $2.9 million acquisition and integration charge related to AMR Research and Burton Group. Please refer to the section of this MD&A entitled Segment Results below for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET was $16.0 million in 2009 and $19.3 million in 2008, a 17% decline. The 2009 period includes $1.1 million of expense related to the discontinuance of hedge accounting on an interest rate swap contract (See Note 6 Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Excluding the $1.1 million charge, Interest expense, net would have declined approximately 22% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline is primarily attributable to a reduction in the weighted-average amount of debt outstanding. 24 Table of Contents OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET of $(2.9) million in 2009 consisted of net foreign currency exchange losses. The $(0.4) million Other expense in 2008 primarily consisted of a $1.2 million gain related to the settlement of a litigation matter offset by net foreign currency exchange losses. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES on continuing operations was $32.6 million in 2009 as compared to $47.6 million in 2008. The effective tax rate was 28.2% in 2009 and 32.9% in 2008. The lower effective tax rate in 2009 as compared to 2008 is attributable to several items. The most significant of these items include the following: (a) the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions relating to the expiration of statutes of limitation was larger in 2009 than in 2008 while pretax income was lower, and (b) differences relating to the taxability of life insurance contracts year-over-year. INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAXES, includes the results of the Company Vision Events business, which we sold in early 2008. The $6.7 million of income for 2008 includes a net gain on sale of approximately $7.1 million and a $(0.4) million operating loss. NET INCOME was $83.0 million in 2009 and $103.9 million in 2008, a decline of $20.9 million or 20%. The decline was primarily driven by the reduced contributions by our three business segments in the 2009 period and to a lesser extent, the $2.9 million acquisition and integration charge we recorded related to AMR Research and Burton Group. These decreases were partially offset by lower SG&A charges, a lower effective income tax rate, and reduced interest expense. Also contributing to the year-over-year decline in net income was the $6.7 million net gain from the sale of the Company former Vision Events business recorded in the 2008 period. Basic earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 14% year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 13% year-over-year. SEGMENT RESULTS We evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin. Gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain Cost of services and product development charges, and SG&A, Depreciation, Acquisition and integration charges, Amortization of intangibles, and Other charges. Gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues.

Approximately 39% of the $112.5 million revenue increase was attributable to the AMR Research and Burton Group businesses. The segment gross contribution margin was flat at 65%, despite additional headcount expenses from the AMR Research and Burton Group businesses. Research contract value was $977.7 million at December 31, 2010, an increase of 25% compared to December 31, 2009 and the highest reported contract value in the Company history. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, research contract value increased 20% over 2009. We attribute the increase to our continuing focus on sales effectiveness and the improving economic environment. The increase is also due to the AMR Research and Burton Group businesses, which contributed approximately 30% of the $193.3 million increase in contract value. Client retention and wallet retention improved 5 points and 11 points, respectively. 2009 VERSUS 2008 Research revenues declined 4% year-over-year, but excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation, Research revenues were down about 1%. In spite of lower revenues, the Research contribution margin increased 2 points year-over-year. The improved margin was primarily driven by tight cost controls, which resulted in lower costs concentrated in personnel, travel, and internal meetings, and our ability to implement price increases for our products. Contract value decreased 6% when comparing December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2008, but excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, contract value was down 1% year-over-year. While down year-over-year, contract value increased $42.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, or 6%, with growth across all industries, geographies, and client sizes. We believe the increase reflects both improved sales effectiveness as well as an improving economic environment.

(3) The 2009 and 2008 metrics exclude AMR Research and Burton Group. 26 Table of Contents 2010 VERSUS 2009 Consulting revenues increased 5% in 2010, but excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenues increased 6%. The AMR Research and Burton Group businesses added approximately 35% of the $15.3 million revenue increase. The gross contribution margin improved by 1 point, primarily due to additional revenues in our contract optimization and SAS businesses, both of which have higher margins than core consulting. Consulting billable headcount was 473 at December 31, 2010, an increase of 7% year-over-year. Backlog was $100.8 million at December 31, 2010, and increase of $9.9 million or 11% over the prior year. Backlog increased across all of our geographic regions. The AMR Research and Burton Group businesses added approximately $0.3 million of the increase. 2009 VERSUS 2008 Consulting revenues declined 17% when comparing 2009 with 2008, with the majority of the decline in core consulting, and to a lesser extent, in our SAS and contract optimization businesses. The decline in core consulting was driven by lower headcount, utilization, and billing rates. The decline in revenue in our contract optimization business reflects a large contract received at the end of 2008 which was not repeated in 2009. SAS revenues declined due to approximately 17% fewer fulfilled SAS days. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, overall Consulting revenues were down about 15%. The 2 point decline in the Consulting contribution margin reflects lower revenue in our SAS and contract optimization businesses, which have higher margins than core consulting. To a lesser extent, the decline also reflects lower utilization and billing rates in core consulting. We ended 2009 with 442 billable consultants, a decline of 11% from the prior year end as we tightly managed resources to match demand. The decline reflects normal attrition as well as the termination of approximately 30 consultants in January 2009 to better align our delivery resources with lower backlog. Consulting backlog declined 6% year-over-year but increased 7% sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $90.9 million, as demand for our consulting services was solid in the U.S. while demand in Europe lagged.

We held 2 additional events in 2010, for a total of 56 events, which consisted of 48 ongoing events and 8 new event launches. We 27 Table of Contents discontinued 6 events that had been held in prior years. We had a 22% increase in attendees and a 24% increase in exhibitors, while average revenue increased 12% for attendees but was down slightly for exhibitors. Revenues increased $21.1 million and $5.2 million from our ongoing and new events, respectively, which was partially offset by a $5.4 million revenue loss from discontinued events. The gross contribution margin increased 5 points, primarily due to higher contribution from our ongoing events, reflecting the strength in attendee volume and average revenue per attendee as well as higher exhibitor volume. 2009 VERSUS 2008 Events revenue was down $49.6 million, or 33% in 2009 due to the impact of discontinued events and a decline in revenue from our on-going events. We held 54 events in 2009, a decline of 16 events compared to the prior year. The 54 events held in 2009 consisted of 51 on-going events and 3 new events. The number of attendees at our 51 on-going events was down 12% while the number of exhibitors was down 31%. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, Events revenues were down 32% year-over-year. Approximately $24.0 million of the revenue decrease was due to 19 discontinued events, including our Spring Symposium, which was a significant event in prior years. We discontinued these events in 2009 in response to the difficult operating environment, with tight travel restrictions and budget cuts at many companies due to the weak economy. We also had a $30.0 million decline in revenue from our 51 on-going events. These declines were slightly offset by approximately $4.0 million in higher revenue from new event launches and other miscellaneous events revenues. The Events contribution margin was down 2 points year-over-year primarily due to lower average attendee and exhibitor revenue at our 51 on-going events. While the number of attendees was down significantly year-over-year, this trend began to show improvement in the fourth quarter of 2009 with attendance at our on-going events up 2%. We also began to see improvement in exhibitor participation. We believe these trends reflect a loosening of corporate travel budgets, resumed growth in marketing spend by technology companies, and our continuing efforts to increase client retention by enhancing the value and experience that our clients derive from our events. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES On December 22, 2010, the Company entered into a new credit facility with a syndication of banks led by JPMorgan Chase to take advantage of favorable financing conditions and to obtain greater financial flexibility and liquidity through a larger revolving credit facility. The new credit arrangement provides for a five-year, $200.0 million term loan and a $400.0 million revolving credit facility. The new credit facility contains an expansion feature by which the term loan and revolving credit facility may be increased, at the Company option and under certain conditions, by up to an additional $150.0 million in the aggregate. We finance our operations primarily through cash generated from our on-going operating activities, and our 2010 operating cash flow increased 27% over the prior year. As of December 31, 2010, we had $120.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and $376.0 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world, with approximately 75% held outside the United States as of December 31, 2010. We believe that we have adequate liquidity and that the cash we expect to earn from our on-going operating activities, our existing cash balances, and the expanded borrowing capacity we have under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient for our expected short-term and foreseeable long-term operating needs. The following table summarizes the Company changes in cash and cash equivalents for the three years ending December 31, 2010: 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Twelve Months Twelve Months Twelve Months Twelve Months Ended Ended Dollar Ended Ended Dollar December 31, December 31, Increase December 31, December 31, Increase 2010 2009 (Decrease) 2009 2008 (Decrease) Cash provided by operating activities $ 205,499 $ 161,937 $ 43,562 $ 161,937 $ 184,350 $ (22,413 ) Cash used by investing activities (33,845 ) (119,665 ) 85,820 (119,665 ) (16,455 ) (103,210 ) Cash used in financing activities (171,556 ) (73,780 ) (97,776 ) (73,780 ) (119,835 ) 46,055 Net increase (decrease) 98 (31,508 ) 31,606 (31,508 ) 48,060 (79,568 ) Effects of exchange rates 3,509 7,153 (3,644 ) 7,153 (17,076 ) 24,229 Beginning cash and cash equivalents 116,574 140,929 (24,355 ) 140,929 109,945 30,984 Ending cash and cash equivalents $ 120,181 $ 116,574 $ 3,607 $ 116,574 $ 140,929 $ (24,355 ) 28 Table of Contents 2010 VERSUS 2009 Operating Our 2010 operating cash flow increased by $43.6 million, or 27%, primarily due to the $13.3 million increase in net income, a $9.0 million decrease in cash payments for income taxes, and a $12.1 million decrease in payments for severance, interest payments on our debt, and excess facilities. We also received $2.4 million in cash in 2010 from an insurance recovery, and approximately $19.8 million of improvements in our working capital accounts, which includes increased cash collections on our receivables. Partially offsetting these increases were $8.0 million in acquisition and integration payments made in 2010 related to the acquisitions of AMR Research and Burton Group and $5.0 million more in 2010 bonus payments. Investing Cash used in our investing activities declined by $85.8 million in 2010 due to the acquisitions of AMR Research and Burton Group in 2009. We paid $104.5 million in cash for these acquisitions in December 2009 and an additional $12.2 million in January 2010. We used $21.7 million of cash in 2010 for capital expenditures compared to $15.1 million in the 2009 period, an increase of $6.6 million, or 43%. Financing Cash used in our financing activities was $97.8 million higher in 2010 compared to 2009, with a total of $171.6 million used in 2010 compared to $73.8 million used in 2009. The additional cash used was due to higher debt repayments and additional share repurchases in 2010. On a net basis, we repaid $108.8 million of debt in 2010 compared to $87.3 million in the prior year, an increase in cash used of $21.6 million. We used $99.8 million of cash for share repurchases in 2010 compared to $3.7 million in 2009, an increase in cash used of $96.1 million. We also paid $4.8 million in cash in 2010 for fees related to our debt refinancing. Partially offsetting these higher uses of cash was an additional $24.7 million in cash realized from option exercises and excess tax benefits as a higher average stock price in 2010 resulted in a significantly increased number of option exercises. 2009 VERSUS 2008 Operating Our operating cash flow decreased by 12% in 2009, or $22.4 million. We had a decline of approximately $23.0 million in cash from our core operations, along with $14.5 million more in cash taxes paid and $8.0 million in higher severance payments due to the workforce reduction completed in early January 2009. Partially offsetting the declines were $14.8 million in lower interest payments on our debt, bonus payments, and payments on our excess facilities, and an $8.3 million improvement in working capital. The improved working capital primarily reflects improved cash collection on receivables. Investing We used an additional $103.2 million of cash in our investing activities in 2009 due to the $104.5 million of cash used for the acquisitions of AMR Research and Burton Group. We had $15.1 million of capital expenditures in 2009, a decline of 38% compared to the $24.3 million of capital expenditures in 2008. The decline reflects the Company tight focus on reducing costs. We also realized $7.8 million of cash proceeds in 2008 from the sale of our Vision Events business. Financing Cash used in financing activities declined by $46.1 million, primarily due to a significant decline in the use of cash for stock repurchases. Cash used for stock repurchases declined by about $197.1 million. Offsetting the decline in cash used for share repurchases was an increase in the use of cash to repay debt of about $108.7 million and a decline in cash proceeds from option exercises and excess tax benefits from equity compensation of approximately $42.3 million. 29 Table of Contents OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS At December 31, 2010, we had $220.0 million outstanding under our 2010 Credit Agreement which provides for a five-year, $200.0 million term loan and a $400.0 million revolving credit facility. The 2010 Credit Agreement contains an expansion feature by which the term loan and revolving credit facility may be increased, at the Company option and under certain conditions, by up to an additional $150.0 million in the aggregate. The term loan will be repaid in 19 consecutive quarterly installments commencing March 31, 2011, plus a final payment due on December 22, 2015, and may be prepaid at any time without penalty or premium at the Company option. The revolving credit facility may be used for loans, and up to $40.0 million may be used for letters of credit. The revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed until December 22, 2015, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. See Note 6 Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the 2010 Credit Agreement. Commitments The following table presents our contractual cash commitments due after December 31, 2010 (in thousands): Less Than 2-3 4-5 More Than Commitment Type: 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Total Operating leases (1) $ 30,775 $ 43,300 $ 27,875 $ 66,640 $ 168,590 Debt outstanding (2) 20,000 70,000 130,156 220,156 Deferred compensation arrangement (3) 1,930 4,230 2,865 17,265 26,290 Tax liabilities (4) 1,275 1,275 Totals $ 53,980 $ 117,530 $ 160,896 $ 83,905 $ 416,311 (1) The Company leases various facilities, furniture, and computer equipment expiring between 2011 and 2025. (2) Represents amounts due under the 2010 Credit Agreement. Amounts drawn under the revolver credit arrangement have been classified in the 4-5 Years category since the amounts are not contractually due until December 2015. Interest payments on our outstanding debt are excluded from the amounts payable due to the variable nature of the interest rates and resulting payment amounts. Information regarding current interest rates on the Company debt is contained in Note 6 Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we paid cash interest on our debt of $11.5 million, $13.9 million, and $22.4 million, respectively. (3) Represents the Company liability to participants in the supplemental deferred compensation arrangement. Amounts payable to active employees whose payment date is unknown have been included in the More Than 5 Years category since the Company cannot determine when the amounts will be paid. (4) Includes interest and penalties. In addition to the $1.3 million liability, approximately $15.8 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities, and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. Related to the unrecognized tax benefits not included in the table, the Company has also recorded a liability for potential interest and penalties of $2.5 million.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Accounting guidance issued by the various standard setting and governmental authorities that have not yet become effective with respect to our Consolidated Financial Statements are described below, together with our assessment of the potential impact they may have on our Consolidated Financial Statements: In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. ASU 2010-06 requires fair value hierarchy disclosures to be further disaggregated by class of assets and liabilities. A class is often a subset of assets or liabilities within a line item in the balance sheet. In addition, significant transfers between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy are required to be disclosed. These additional disclosure requirements became effective January 1, 2010. In general, we do not anticipate transfers between the different levels of the fair value hierarchy, and for the year ended December 31, 2010, there were none. Our required fair value disclosures are presented in Note 12 Fair Value Disclosures , herein in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Beginning January 1, 2011, the FASB will also require additional disclosures regarding changes in Level 3 instruments. The Company currently does not have any Level 3 instruments. In September 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-13, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. ASU 2009-13 requires companies to allocate revenue in arrangements involving multiple deliverables based on the estimated selling price of each deliverable, even though such deliverables are not sold separately either by the company itself or other vendors. ASU 2009-13 eliminates the requirement that all undelivered elements must have objective and reliable evidence of fair value before a company can recognize the portion of the overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that already have been delivered. As a result, the new guidance is expected to allow some companies to recognize revenue on transactions that involve multiple deliverables earlier than under current requirements. ASU 2009-13 will be effective for Gartner beginning January 1, 2011. The Company multiple revenue arrangements are limited and as a result we do not expect any impact on our Consolidated Statement of Operations related to the adoption of this guidance.
