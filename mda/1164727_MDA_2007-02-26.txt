ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) The following discussion provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Newmont Mining Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, Newmont or the Company ). References to A$ refer to Australian currency, CDN$ to Canadian currency, CHF to Swiss currency, NZD$ to New Zealand currency, IDR to Indonesian currency and $ to United States currency. This discussion addresses matters we consider important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the three years ended December 31, 2006, as well as our future results. It consists of the following subsections: Overview, which provides a brief summary of our consolidated results and financial position and the primary factors affecting those results, as well as a summary of our expectations for 2007; Accounting Developments, which provides a discussion of recent changes to our accounting policies that have affected our consolidated results and financial position; Critical Accounting Policies, which provides an analysis of the accounting policies we consider critical because of their effect on the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and/or expenses in our consolidated financial statements and/or because they require difficult, subjective or complex judgments by our management; Consolidated Financial Results, which includes a discussion of our consolidated financial results for the last three years; Results of Consolidated Operations, which sets forth an analysis of the operating results for the last three years, the Merchant Banking Segment and the Exploration Segment; Recent Accounting Pronouncements, which summarizes recently published authoritative accounting guidance, how it might apply to us and how it might affect our future results; and Liquidity and Capital Resources, which contains a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, investing activities and financing activities, contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements. This item should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report. Overview Newmont is one of the world largest gold producers and is the only gold company included in the S&P 500 Index. We are also engaged in the exploration for and acquisition of gold properties. We have operations in the United States, Australia, Peru, Indonesia, Canada, Bolivia, New Zealand, Ghana and Mexico. We face key risks associated with our business. One of the most significant risks is fluctuation in the prices of gold and copper, which are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. Other challenges we face include capital and production cost increases and social and environmental issues. Operating costs at our operations are subject to variation due to a number of factors, such as changing ore grades, metallurgy, revisions to mine plans and changes in accounting principles. At foreign locations, such costs are also influenced by currency fluctuations that may affect our U.S. dollar operating costs. In addition, we must continually replace reserves depleted through production by expanding known ore bodies, by acquisition or by locating new deposits in order to maintain production levels over the long term. 36 Table of Contents Summary of Consolidated Financial and Operating Performance The table below highlights key financial and operating results: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Revenues $ 4,987 $ 4,352 $ 4,326 Income from continuing operations $ 840 $ 360 $ 411 Net income $ 791 $ 322 $ 443 Net income per common share, basic Income from continuing operations $ 1.87 $ 0.81 $ 0.93 Net income $ 1.76 $ 0.72 $ 1.00 Consolidated gold ounces sold (thousands) (1) 7,361 8,429 8,619 Consolidated copper pounds sold (millions) 435 573 683 Average price received (2) Gold (per ounce) $ 599 $ 441 $ 412 Copper (per pound) $ 1.99 $ 1.45 $ 1.33 Costs applicable to sales (3) Gold (per ounce) $ 304 $ 237 $ 218 Copper (per pound) $ 0.71 $ 0.53 $ 0.45 (1) Includes incremental start-up ounces of 100,300 and 22,100 in 2006 and 2005, respectively. (2) Before treatment and refining charges. (3) Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization. Consolidated Financial Performance Gold revenues increased in 2006 from 2005 primarily due to higher gold prices, partially offset by lower gold sales volume. Gold sold decreased to 7.4 million ounces in 2006 from 8.4 million ounces in 2005, primarily due to decreased throughput and lower grade ores processed at Yanacocha, Nevada and Batu Hijau, decreased throughput at Australia/New Zealand partially offset by the commencement of operations at Ahafo in the third quarter of 2006. Copper revenues decreased in 2006 from 2005 due to a decrease in copper pounds sold at Batu Hijau, partially offset by an increase in the average realized price (see Results of Consolidated Operations below). The gold price increases over the last few years were partially offset by higher production costs and fewer gold ounces sold. During the same period, Newmont has seen significant increases in the costs of labor, fuel, power and other bulk consumables. In addition, our financial and operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 were impacted by the following (pre-tax): Gain on the sale of the Alberta Oil Sands project ($266 in 2006); Increased income tax expense ($114 greater than 2005); Loss on the expropriation of the Zarafshan-Newmont Joint Venture ( ZNJV ) ($101 in 2006); Increased reclamation and remediation costs ($47 in 2006); Loss on the early extinguishment of prepaid forward sales obligation ($40 in 2006); Increased exploration expenditures ($23 greater than 2005); and Increased advanced projects research and development expenditures ($21 greater than 2005). 37 Table of Contents Liquidity The Company financial position was as follows: At December 31, 2006 2005 Total debt $ 1,911 $ 1,918 Total stockholders equity $ 9,337 $ 8,376 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,166 $ 1,082 During 2006 our debt and liquidity positions were affected by the following: Net proceeds from the issuance of debt of $198; Net cash provided from continuing operations of $1,237; Proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations of $40 and other assets of $334; Scheduled debt repayments of $111 cash and $48 non-cash; Early extinguishment of prepaid forward sales obligation of $48; Capital expenditures at continuing operations of $1,551; Dividends paid to common shareholders of $180; and Dividends paid to minority interests of $264. Looking Forward Certain key factors will affect our future financial and operating results. These include, but are not limited to, the following: Fluctuations in gold prices and, to a lesser extent, copper prices; Newmont expects 2007 consolidated gold sales of approximately 6.1 to 6.6 million ounces (approximately 5.2 to 5.6 million equity ounces), primarily as a result of lower production from Yanacocha and Australia, as well as the closure of Lone Tree in Nevada and Golden Giant in Canada in 2006. Costs applicable to sales per ounce for 2007 are expected to be approximately 25% higher than 2006, primarily from lower production at Yanacocha and Australia, as well as higher labor, consumables and energy prices in all operating regions. Additionally, future potential power interruptions in Ghana could further impact the Company Costs applicable to sales in 2007. The Company anticipates capital expenditures of approximately $1.8 to $2.0 billion in 2007, with approximately one third invested in Nevada, one third in Australia/New Zealand and the remaining one third invested at the other locations. Approximately $0.8 to $0.9 billion of the 2007 capital budget is allocated to sustaining investments, with the remaining $1.0 to $1.1 billion allocated to new project development and improvement initiatives, including the Boddington project, continued development of the power plant in Nevada and completion of the Yanacocha gold mill. We expect 2007 exploration expenditures of approximately $170 to $175 and 2007 advanced projects, research and development expenditures of approximately $85 to $100; and The construction of the Boddington project, the 200 megawatt coal-fired power plant in Nevada and the gold mill at Yanacocha, as well as potential future investments in the Akyem project in Ghana and the Conga project in Peru will require significant funds for capital expenditures. At current gold and copper prices, new sources of capital will be needed to meet the funding requirements of these investments, fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends. Our ability to raise and service significant new 38 Table of Contents sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices and our operational performance, among other factors. In the event of lower gold and copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or new funding limitations, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends could be significantly constrained. Accounting Developments Pensions As of December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Statement No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) ( FAS 158 ). FAS 158 required employers that sponsor one or more defined benefit plans to (i) recognize the funded status of a benefit plan in its statement of financial position, (ii) recognize the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, (iii) measure the defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer fiscal year-end statement of financial position, and (iv) disclose in the notes to the financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition asset or obligation. The impact of adopting FAS 158 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was as follows: Before Application of FAS 158 Adjustment After Application of FAS 158 Other long-term assets $ 193 $ (15 ) $ 178 Total assets $ 15,616 $ (15 ) $ 15,601 Employee pension and other benefits $ 229 $ 27 $ 256 Deferred income taxes $ 717 $ (14 ) $ 703 Accumulated other comprehensive income $ 700 $ (27 ) $ 673 Total stockholders equity $ 9,364 $ (27 ) $ 9,337 Stock Based Compensation On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123(R), Share-Based Paymen t ( FAS 123(R) ). The Company adopted FAS 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method. Under this method, compensation cost recognized in 2006 includes: a) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of FAS 123, and b) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of FAS 123(R). As a result of adopting FAS 123(R), the Company Income from continuing operations and Net income for 2006 is $19 ($0.04 per share) lower, than if we had continued to account for share-based compensation under APB 25 as we did in the comparable prior year periods. Prior to the adoption of FAS 123(R), cash retained as a result of tax deductions relating to stock-based compensation was included in operating cash flows, along with other tax cash flows. FAS 123(R) requires tax benefits relating to the deductibility of increases in the equity instruments issued under share-based compensation arrangements that are not included in Costs applicable to sales ( excess tax benefits ) to be presented in the Statement of Cash Flows as financing cash inflows. The benefit realized for tax deductions from option exercises totaled $3 in 2006. Deferred Stripping Costs On January 1, 2006 the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-06 ( EITF 04-06 ), Accounting for Stripping Costs Incurred during Production in the Mining Industry. EITF 04-06 addresses the 39 Table of Contents accounting for stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine and refers to these costs as variable production costs that should be included as a component of inventory to be recognized in Costs applicable to sales in the same period as the revenue from the sale of inventory. As a result, capitalization of post-production stripping costs is appropriate only to the extent product inventory exists at the end of a reporting period. The guidance required the recognition of a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption, with no charge to earnings in the period of adoption for prior periods. The cumulative effect adjustment reduced retained earnings by $81 (net of tax and minority interests) and eliminated the $71 net deferred stripping asset from the balance sheet. Adoption of EITF 04-06 had no impact on the Company cash position or net cash from operations. Consolidation of Batu Hijau In December 2003, FASB issued Interpretation No. 46R ( FIN 46R ), which provides guidance on the identification and reporting for entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights. FIN 46R defines such entities as variable interest entities ( VIEs ). Newmont identified the Nusa Tenggara Partnership ( NTP ) and P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara ( PTNNT ) (collectively, Batu Hijau ) as VIEs. Therefore, as of January 1, 2004, the Company has fully consolidated Batu Hijau in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Under the Batu Hijau Contract of Work, a portion of the project must be offered for sale to the Indonesian government or to Indonesian nationals. Therefore, it is possible that future changes in the Company economic ownership interest in Batu Hijau would result in the Company accounting for its investment in Batu Hijau using the equity method of accounting, significantly impacting the Company Consolidated Financial Statements. In this case, Batu Hijau revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, minority interests and cash flows would no longer be individually reported in the Company Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company share of Batu Hijau net income would be reported as Equity income of affiliates in the Statements of Consolidated Income, the net investment in Batu Hijau would be included in Investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and dividends received from Batu Hijau would be reported in Operating activities in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. Upon consolidation of Batu Hijau, effective January 1, 2004, certain adjustments were recorded to the opening balance sheet of PTNNT to conform to Newmont accounting policies. These adjustments were recorded to change from units-of-production depreciation of processing plant and mining facilities to straight-line depreciation of such facilities and to change from allocating costs to stockpile inventories based on mining costs per ton to allocating costs based on recoverable pounds of copper equivalent contained in the various categories of stockpiles. The impact of these adjustments was a charge of $47, net of income tax expense and minority interest which has been recorded in Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax in the 2004 Statement of Consolidated Income. Critical Accounting Policies Listed below are the accounting policies that the Company believes are critical to its financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported . Carrying Value of Goodwill As of December 31, 2006, the carrying value of goodwill was approximately $3,004. Goodwill was assigned to the Company Merchant Banking ($1,661) and Exploration ($1,129) Segments and to various mine site reporting units in the Australia/New Zealand Segment ($214). Substantially all of this goodwill arose in connection with our February 2002 acquisitions of Normandy and Franco-Nevada, and represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Our approach to allocating goodwill was to identify those reporting units that we believed had contributed to such excess purchase price. We then performed valuations to 40 Table of Contents measure the incremental increases in the fair values of such reporting units that were attributable to the acquisitions, and that were not already captured in the fair values assigned to such units identifiable net assets. In the case of the Merchant Banking and Exploration Segments, these valuations were based on each reporting unit potential for future growth, and in the case of the mine site reporting units, the valuation was based on the merger-related synergies that were expected to be realized by each mine site reporting unit. We evaluate, on at least an annual basis, the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether current events and circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may no longer be recoverable. To accomplish this, we compare the estimated fair values of the reporting units to their carrying amounts. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value at the time of the evaluation, we would compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount and any shortfall would be charged to earnings. Assumptions underlying fair value estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties. Newmont performed its annual impairment tests of goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2006 and determined that goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2006. A similar assessment by the Company during the fourth quarter of 2005 determined that the Nevada reporting unit was impaired as of December 31, 2005. To the extent the assumptions used in the Company valuation models, described below, for such impairment tests are not achieved in the future, it is reasonably possible that the Company will record charges for impairment of goodwill in future periods. The specific application of the Company goodwill impairment policy with respect to the Merchant Banking Segment, Exploration Segment and mine site reporting units is separately discussed below. Merchant Banking Segment Goodwill Newmont Merchant Banking Segment is comprised of an equity portfolio, focused on managing the Company portfolio of equity securities, a royalty portfolio, portfolio management activities, providing in-house investment banking and advisory services to the Company, and downstream business activities. As of December 31, 2006, the $1,661 carrying value of the Merchant Banking Segment goodwill represented approximately 54% of the carrying value of the total assets of the Merchant Banking Segment. Based on a December 31, 2006 valuation of the Merchant Banking Segment, the Company concluded that the fair value of the Merchant Banking Segment was significantly in excess of its carrying value as of December 31, 2006. The December 31, 2006 discounted cash flow analysis for the Equity Portfolio of the Merchant Banking Segment assumed: (i) a discount rate of 9%; (ii) a time horizon of ten years; (iii) pre-tax returns on investment ranging from 35% in 2007 and gradually declining to 15% in 2014 through 2016; (iv) an initial equity portfolio investment of approximately $1,400; (v) capital infusions of $50 annually for the next three years; and (vi) a terminal value of approximately $5,400. The December 31, 2006 discounted cash flow analysis for the Royalty Portfolio of the Merchant Banking Segment assumed: (i) a discount rate of 9%; (ii) a time horizon of ten years; (iii) an annual growth rate of 5% in the Royalty Portfolio; and (iv) a pre-tax rate of return on investment of 13%. The December 31, 2006 discounted cash flow analysis for the Portfolio Management of the Merchant Banking Segment assumed: (i) a discount rate of 9%; (ii) a time horizon of ten years; and (iii) a pre-tax advisory fee of 5% on approximately $500 of transactions and value-added activities in 2007, with the dollar amount of such transactions and activities increasing by 5% annually thereafter. The December 31, 2006 discounted cash flow analysis for the downstream business of the Merchant Banking Segment assumed: (i) a discount rate of 9%; (ii) a time horizon of ten years; and (iii) a pre-tax annual return on investment of 15%. The December 31, 2006 discounted cash flow analysis assumed a combined terminal value for the royalty portfolio, portfolio management and downstream business of approximately $700. For purposes of valuing the Merchant Banking Segment in the future, the Company expects that the valuation model will continue to be reevaluated and enhanced to recognize the activities and objectives of the 41 Table of Contents Merchant Banking Segment. The key drivers of such future valuations are expected to include (i) expected long-term investment returns, adjusted for Company specific and market driven factors; (ii) expected economic value to be added by the Merchant Banking Segment in addition to such investment returns; (iii) the level of capital accessible by the Merchant Banking Segment; and (iv) other relevant facts and circumstances. To determine the appropriate returns, investment levels and other assumptions for purposes of this analysis, the Company will (i) review the expected and actual returns from transactions that were initiated and/or completed since the last impairment test; (ii) assess the actual economic value added by other Merchant Banking Segment activities since the last impairment test; and (iii) assess the ongoing appropriateness of all assumptions impacting the valuation based on then current conditions and expectations. The Company believes that any model used to value the Merchant Banking Segment will need to take into account the relatively long time horizon required to evaluate the investment returns and other economic value added activities of the Merchant Banking Segment. A high degree of judgment is involved in determining the assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of the Merchant Banking Segment. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from the corresponding assumptions and estimates. If a triggering event were to occur that could reasonably be expected to result in an impairment of the carrying value of the Merchant Banking Segment, the Company would be required to test the goodwill assigned to the Merchant Banking Segment as of the end of the reporting period in which any such event occurred. The Company believes that triggering events with respect to the Merchant Banking Segment could include, but are not limited to: (i) the Company partial or complete withdrawal of financial support for the Merchant Banking Segment; (ii) a significant reduction in management long-term expectation of the price of gold or oil, given the adverse effect such a development could have on the fair values of the Merchant Banking Segment investment and royalty interest portfolios and the Merchant Banking Segment prospects for future growth; (iii) the divestiture of a significant portion of the Merchant Banking Segment investment portfolio together with management determination not to fund the replenishment of such portfolio for the foreseeable future; and (iv) any other event that might adversely affect the ability of the Merchant Banking Segment to consummate transactions that create value for the Company. The Company currently has no plans to withdraw financial support for the Merchant Banking Segment. For a discussion of the results of operations of the Merchant Banking Segment, see Results of Consolidated Operations, Merchant Banking Segment, below. Exploration Segment Goodwill The Exploration Segment is responsible for all activities, whether near-mine or greenfield, associated with the Company efforts to discover new mineralized material that could ultimately advance into proven and probable reserves. As discussed in greater detail below, when performing its Exploration Segment goodwill impairment testing, the Company uses historic additions to proven and probable reserves as an indication of the expected future performance of the Exploration Segment. The Exploration Segment valuation model attributes all cash flows expected to be derived from future exploration discoveries, whether near-mine or greenfield, to the Exploration Segment. Therefore, the valuation model includes all expected value from future discoveries, including existing and future mine site reporting units. Existing proven and probable reserves and value beyond proven and probable reserves, including mineralization other than proven and probable reserves and other material that is not part of the measured, indicated or inferred resource base, are included when determining the fair value of mine site reporting units at acquisition and, subsequently, in determining whether the assets are impaired. The value beyond proven and probable reserves relating to mine site reporting units (which uses the same valuation concepts as required by EITF 04-03, Mining Assets: Impairment and Business Combinations ) is excluded when determining the fair value of the Exploration Segment, if any, at acquisition and, subsequently, in determining whether the assets are impaired. The valuation model includes management best estimates of future reserve additions from exploration activities and all revenues and costs associated with their discovery, development and production. Historical proven and probable reserve additions, excluding acquisitions, are used as an indicator of the Exploration Segment ability to discover additional reserves in the future. Actual reserve additions may vary significantly 42 Table of Contents from year to year due to the time required to advance a deposit from initial discovery to proven and probable reserves and based on the timing of when proven and probable reserves can be reported under the Securities and Exchange Commission Industry Guide 7. The valuation model assumes that the Company will be able to perpetually develop and produce the assumed additions to proven and probable reserves from future discoveries at existing or new mine site reporting units. These estimates assume that the Company will continue to find reserves of sufficient size and quality to meet the Company operational and return thresholds in increasing quantities in perpetuity. Future discoveries could become increasingly difficult to locate, and even if the Company finds reserves in a sufficient quality and size, they may consist of a larger number of smaller deposits that could be more costly to develop and or operate than historically experienced. The development and production of reserves will eventually lead to the depletion of existing mine site reporting units and require the perpetual development of new mines in increasing quantities through successful greenfield exploration. A reduction in reserves or a lower than expected increase in reserve additions, or a greater than expected increase in operating, capital or finding costs, may negatively impact the value of the Exploration Segment and may result in the impairment of the Exploration Segment goodwill. Subsequent to the business combinations for which value beyond proven and probable reserves were recorded, EITF 04-03, Mining Assets: Impairment and Business Combinations, was issued and requires that value beyond proven and probable reserves be allocated to mining assets consistent with the Company existing policy. The Company has defined value beyond proven and probable reserves as the value of known mineralization other than proven and probable reserves and other material that is not part of the measured, indicated or inferred resource base that is measured based on extrapolation of known exploration information, to the extent that it believes a market participant would include such value in determining the fair value of the assets. The Company interpretation of value beyond proven and probable reserves may differ from that of other mining industry companies and may result in a different allocation of values at the time of acquisition and subsequent impairment analysis. If value beyond proven and probable reserves was interpreted to include value in excess of the Company determination, such values would be considered tangible mineral interests and therefore reduce the implied fair value of goodwill. Under such an interpretation, if Step 2 of a goodwill impairment analysis (which requires the Company to compare the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount and write write-off any excess carrying amount over the implied fair value) was required for the existing Exploration Segment, goodwill could be significantly impaired resulting in an impairment loss in the financial statements. The Company has not been required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test for the Exploration Segment. Please see the Company Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional details. The Company approach to managing the exploration aspect of its business separate from the day to day operations of its mine site reporting units may differ from the approach taken by other companies in the mining industry. Other mining companies may integrate the exploration function with their mine site reporting units, allocating residual goodwill to these units. Absent our Exploration Segment success and reporting structure, we may have reached a similar conclusion regarding the goodwill allocation. As a result of these potential differences, the Company financial position and results of operations may not be comparable to those of other entities in the mining industry. Internally generated proven and probable reserve additions are attributed to the Exploration Segment for purposes of determining the Company assumptions with respect to the expected future performance of the Exploration Segment only to the extent that such additions are derived from (i) a discovery made by the Company; or (ii) a discovery made on previously acquired properties as a result of exploration efforts conducted subsequent to the acquisition date. A portion of the additions to proven and probable reserves during 2004 through 2006 was derived from the conversion of mineralized material that had been assigned value as part of the purchase price allocation process. In addition, the Company expects that a portion of internally generated reserve additions during 2007 and the next several years will also be derived from the conversion of mineralized material which had been assigned value as part of purchase price accounting. To avoid duplication, the reserves which are expected to be derived from this mineralized material in the future are excluded from the reserve additions used in the valuation of the Exploration Segment performed in connection with the Company goodwill impairment tests. 43 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2006, the $1,129 carrying value of the Exploration Segment goodwill represented approximately 87% of the carrying value of the total assets of the Exploration Segment. Based on valuations of the Exploration Segment as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company concluded that substantially all of the fair value of the Exploration Segment, which was significantly in excess of the carrying value, was derived from the terminal value. Based on the period required to advance projects from initial discovery to production, the valuation model has negative net cash flows for approximately the first 10 years and more than 100% of the fair value of the Exploration Segment is attributable to its terminal value. The valuation models included the following assumptions: At December 31, 2006 2005 Initial year additions to reserves (gold ounces in millions): Total additions 8.6 9.5 Less: Additions previously valued in purchase accounting (0.6 ) (0.9 ) Additions attributable to the Exploration Segment 8.0 8.6 Annual reserve addition and terminal growth rate 4 % 5 % Time horizon (years) 16 16 Time lag between reserve additions and production (years) 7.5 7.1 Production period (years) 5 5 Discount rate 8 % 8 % Price/cost assumptions (per ounce of gold): Gold price $ 550 $ 450 Operating costs $ 331 $ 264 Capital costs $ 73 $ 56 Finding costs $ 15 $ 13 The cash flow assumptions used in the valuation models are burdened only to the extent of management estimate of the Company internal costs to explore, develop and produce the expected discoveries based on the Company historical experience and long-term plans. The cost assumptions may not be representative of what a third party would be required to pay for access to the Company properties. The annual reserve addition and terminal growth rate assumptions have a significant impact on the fair value of the Exploration Segment. Due to the shortfall in reserve additions during the last two years, the Company has revised its assumptions for initial year additions to gold reserves and the annual reserve addition and terminal growth rate. If these rate assumptions were reduced further from 4% to 3%, the fair value of the Exploration Segment would have been approximately $1,000 lower as of December 31, 2006. Price and cost assumptions were updated to reflect the Company long-term planning assumptions. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the terminal value of the Exploration Segment was approximately $5.2 billion and $7.5 billion, respectively. 44 Table of Contents The December 31, 2006 Exploration Segment goodwill valuation model assumes proven and probable reserve additions attributable to the Exploration Segment of 8.0 million equity ounces in 2007. Actual proven and probable additions attributable to the Exploration segment for 2006, 2005 and 2004 compared to assumptions used as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, were as follows: (millions of equity ounces) Actual Assumption (1) Excess (shortfall) 2006 Total additions 5.9 9.5 (3.6 ) Additions previously valued in purchase accounting (0.9 ) (0.9 ) Additions attributable to the Exploration Segment 5.0 8.6 (3.6 ) 2005 Total additions 9.4 11.0 (1.6 ) Additions previously valued in purchase accounting (1.2 ) (1.0 ) (0.2 ) Additions attributable to the Exploration Segment 8.2 10.0 (1.8 ) 2004 Total additions 12.4 7.9 4.5 Additions previously valued in purchase accounting (1.9 ) (5.0 ) 3.1 Reclassification of Cerro Quilish reserves (2.0 ) (2.0 ) Additions attributable to the Exploration Segment 8.5 2.9 5.6 (1) Additions assumed in the Exploration Segment valuation models for 2006 as of December 31, 2005, for 2005 as of December 31, 2004 and for 2004 as of December 31, 2003. Triggering events that impact certain assumptions used in the Exploration Segment valuation model and require an asset impairment evaluation with respect to the Exploration Segment would include, but are not limited to: (i) the Company partial or complete withdrawal of financial support for the Exploration Segment; (ii) a significantly lower assumed annual reserve addition growth rate; (iii) a significant decrease in the Company long-term expectation of the price of gold; (iv) a significant change in the financial markets resulting in a significant increase in the discount rate; (v) a significant increase in long-term operating, capital and finding cost estimates; and (vi) a significant impairment at an existing mine location (an impairment could call into question the projections of future exploration success which are based on historical results both positive and negative). The Company currently has no plans to withdraw financial support for the Exploration Segment. For a discussion of the results of operations of the Exploration Segment, see Results of Consolidated Operations, Exploration Segment, below. Mine Site Goodwill The assignment of goodwill to mine site reporting units was based on synergies that have been incorporated into the Company operations and business plans over time and from the purchase of an additional 22.22% of the Boddington project in Australia during 2006. The amount of goodwill assigned to each segment or reporting unit was based on discounted cash flow analyses that assumed risk-adjusted discount rates over the remaining lives of the applicable mining operations. The Company believes that triggering events with respect to the goodwill assigned to mine site reporting units could include, but are not limited to: (i) a significant decrease in the Company long-term gold and copper price assumptions; (ii) a decrease in reserves; (iii) a significant reduction in the estimated fair value of mine site exploration potential; and (iv) any event that might otherwise adversely affect mine site production levels or costs. The Company performed its annual impairment test of mine site goodwill as of December 31, 2006 and determined that the fair value of each mine site reporting unit was in excess of the relevant carrying value as of December 31, 2006. For more information on the discounted cash flows used to value mine site reporting units, see Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets, below. 45 Table of Contents Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and depreciated using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to depreciate such costs over the estimated future lives of such facilities or equipment. These lives do not exceed the estimated mine life based on proven and probable reserves as the useful lives of these assets are considered to be limited to the life of the relevant mine. Costs incurred to develop new properties are capitalized as incurred, where it has been determined that the property can be economically developed based on the existence of proven and probable reserves. At the Company surface mines, these costs include costs to further delineate the ore body and remove overburden to initially expose the ore body. At the Company underground mines, these costs include the cost of building access ways, shaft sinking and access, lateral development, drift development, ramps and infrastructure development. All such costs are amortized using the units-of-production ( UOP ) method over the estimated life of the ore body based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves. Major development costs incurred after the commencement of production are amortized using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves. Depending upon whether the development is expected to benefit the entire remaining ore body, or specific ore blocks or areas only, the UOP basis is either the life of the entire ore body or the life of the specific ore block or area. The calculation of the UOP rate of amortization, and therefore the annual amortization charge to operations, could be materially impacted to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on proven and probable reserves. This would generally occur to the extent that there were significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in determining reserves. These factors could include: (i) an expansion of proven and probable reserves through exploration activities; (ii) differences between estimated and actual costs of production, due to differences in grade, metal recovery rates and foreign currency exchange rates; and (iii) differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of reserves. Such changes in reserves could similarly impact the useful lives of assets depreciated on a straight-line basis, where those lives are limited to the life of the mine, which in turn is limited to the life of the proven and probable reserves. The expected useful lives used in depreciation, depletion and amortization calculations are determined based on applicable facts and circumstances, as described above. Significant judgment is involved in the determination of useful lives, and no assurance can be given that actual useful lives will not differ significantly from the useful lives assumed for purpose of depreciation, depletion and amortization calculations. Carrying Value of Stockpiles Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing. Stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile, the number of contained ounces based on assay data, and the estimated recovery percentage based on the expected processing method. Stockpile tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. Stockpiles are valued based on mining costs incurred up to the point of stockpiling the ore, including applicable depreciation, depletion and amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are added to a stockpile based on current mining costs and removed at the average cost per recoverable ounce of gold in the stockpile. Stockpiles are reduced as material is removed and processed further. The adoption of EITF 04-06 resulted in the allocation of deferred and advanced stripping costs to stockpiles and the value of the Company stockpiles decreased from $532 as of December 31, 2005 to $515 as of January 1, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the Company stockpiles had a total carrying value of $743. Costs that are incurred in or benefit from the productive process are accumulated as stockpiles. The Company records stockpiles at the lower of average cost or net realizable value ( NRV ), and carrying values are evaluated at least quarterly. NRV represents the estimated future sales price of the product based on prevailing 46 Table of Contents and long-term metals prices, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. The primary factors that influence the need to record write-downs of stockpiles include short-term and long-term metals prices and costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy, materials and supplies, as well as realized ore grades and actual production levels. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, write-downs of stockpiles to NRV totaled $2, $10 and $10, respectively. Cost allocation to stockpiles and the NRV measurement involves the use of estimates and assumptions unique to each mining operation regarding current and future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors. A high degree of judgment is involved in determining such assumptions and estimates and no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An asset impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset, including goodwill, if any. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows. Future cash flows are estimated based on estimated quantities of recoverable minerals, expected gold and other commodity prices (considering current and historical prices, price trends and related factors), production levels and costs of production, capital and reclamation costs, all based on life-of-mine plans. The significant assumptions in determining the future discounted cash flows for each mine site reporting unit as of December 31, 2006, apart from production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, included a long-term gold price of $550 per ounce and Australian and Canadian dollar exchange rates of A$1.33 and CDN$1.11, respectively per $1.00. Existing proven and probable reserves and value beyond proven and probable reserves, including mineralization other than proven and probable reserves and other material that is not part of the measured, indicated or inferred resource base, are included when determining the fair value of mine site reporting units at acquisition and, subsequently, in determining whether the assets are impaired. The term recoverable minerals refers to the estimated amount of gold or other commodities that will be obtained after taking into account losses during ore processing and treatment. Estimates of recoverable minerals from such exploration stage mineral interests are risk adjusted based on management relative confidence in such materials. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups. As discussed above under Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization, various factors could impact the Company ability to achieve its forecasted production schedules from proven and probable reserves. Additionally, production, capital and reclamation costs could differ from the assumptions used in the cash flow models used to assess impairment. The ability to achieve the estimated quantities of recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests involves further risks in addition to those factors applicable to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have been identified, due to the lower level of confidence that the identified mineralized material could ultimately be mined economically. Assets classified as other mine-related exploration potential and greenfields exploration potential have the highest level of risk that the carrying value of the asset can be ultimately realized, due to the still lower level of geological confidence and economic modeling. Stripping Costs Stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are variable production costs that are included as a component of inventory to be recognized in Costs applicable to sales in the same period as the revenue from the sale of inventory. Capitalization of post-production stripping costs is appropriate only to the extent product inventory exists at the end of a reporting period. 47 Table of Contents Prior to 2006 (see Note 3 to Consolidated Financial Statements) at some of the Company mining operations, deferred stripping costs were charged to Costs applicable to sales as gold or copper was sold using the units of production method based on estimated recoverable quantities of proven and probable gold or copper reserves, using a stripping ratio calculated as the ratio of total tons to be moved to total proven and probable ore reserves, which resulted in the recognition of the costs of waste removal activities over the life of the mine as gold or copper was sold. The application of the deferred stripping accounting method generally resulted in an asset (deferred stripping costs), although a liability (advanced stripping costs) arose when the actual stripping ratio incurred to date was less than the expected stripping ratio over the life of the mine. The Advanced stripping costs primarily pertained to the Batu Hijau operation. Financial Instruments All financial instruments that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value, with the exception of contracts that qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exemption. Changes in the fair market value of derivatives recorded on the balance sheet are recorded in the statements of consolidated operations, except for the effective portion of the change in fair market value of derivatives that are designated as a cash flow hedge and qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. The Company portfolio of derivatives includes various complex instruments that are linked to gold prices and other factors. Management applies significant judgment in estimating the fair value of instruments that are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding gold and other commodity prices, gold lease rates, market volatilities, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Variations in these factors could materially affect amounts credited or charged to earnings to reflect the changes in fair market value of derivatives. In addition, certain derivative contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, whereby the effective portion of changes in fair market value of these instruments are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income and will be recognized in the statements of consolidated operations when the underlying production designated as the hedged item is sold. All derivative contracts qualifying for hedge accounting are designated against the applicable portion of future production from proven and probable reserves, where management believes the forecasted transaction is probable of occurring. To the extent that management determines that such future production is no longer probable of occurring due to changes in the factors impacting the determination of reserves, as discussed above under Depreciation, depletion and amortization , gains and losses deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income would be reclassified to the statements of consolidated operations immediately. Reclamation and Remediation Obligations (Asset Retirement Obligations) Reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation and remediation costs. The asset retirement obligation is based on when the spending for an existing environmental disturbance will occur. The Company reviews, on at least an annual basis, the asset retirement obligation at each mine site in accordance with FASB FAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Future remediation costs for inactive mines are accrued based on management best estimate at the end of each period of the costs expected to be incurred. Such cost estimates include, where applicable, ongoing care, water treatment, maintenance and monitoring costs. Changes in estimates at inactive mines are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs the Company will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required. Any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to earnings for reclamation and remediation. 48 Table of Contents Deferred Tax Assets The Company recognizes the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. Refer above under Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets for a discussion of the factors that could cause future cash flows to differ from estimates. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Company to realize deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates could limit the Company ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by its deferred tax assets recorded at the reporting date. Consolidated Financial Results Sales gold, net increased in 2006 compared to 2005 due to a $158 per ounce increase in the average realized price, partially offset by a decrease in ounces sold. In 2005, gold sales increased over 2004 primarily due to a $29 per ounce increase in the average realized price, partially offset by a decrease in ounces sold. For a complete discussion regarding variations in gold volumes, see Results of Consolidated Operations below. The following analysis reflects the increase in consolidated gold sales: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Consolidated gold sales: Gross $ 4,346 $ 3,706 $ 3,551 Less: Treatment and refining charges (30 ) (26 ) (11 ) Net $ 4,316 $ 3,680 $ 3,540 Consolidated gold ounces sold (thousands) Gross 7,361 8,429 8,619 Less: Incremental start-up sales (100 ) (22 ) Net 7,261 8,407 8,619 Average realized gold price per ounce: Before treatment and refining charges $ 599 $ 441 $ 412 After treatment and refining charges $ 594 $ 437 $ 411 The change in consolidated gold sales is due to: 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Reduction in consolidated ounces sold $ (505 ) $ (87 ) Increase in average realized gold price 1,145 242 Increase in treatment and refining charges (4 ) (15 ) $ 636 $ 140 Sales copper, net were unchanged in 2006 compared to 2005 as lower sales volumes were offset by higher realized prices. In addition, in 2006 a loss of $56 was included in Other income, net for the ineffective portion of copper hedges. In 2005, copper sales decreased compared to 2004 due to a 16% decrease in copper pounds sold, partially offset by a 9% increase in the average realized copper price. For a complete discussion regarding variations in copper volumes, see Results of Consolidated Operations below. 49 Table of Contents The following analysis reflects the changes in consolidated copper sales: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Consolidated copper sales: Gross before hedging $ 1,333 $ 953 $ 880 Hedging losses (633 ) (258 ) (39 ) Provisional pricing mark-to-market 165 138 66 Gross after hedging 865 833 907 Less: Treatment and refining charges (194 ) (161 ) (121 ) Net $ 671 $ 672 $ 786 Consolidated copper pounds sold (millions) 435 573 683 Average realized price per pound: Gross before hedging $ 3.07 $ 1.66 $ 1.29 Hedging losses (1.46 ) (0.45 ) (0.06 ) Provisional pricing mark-to-market 0.38 0.24 0.10 Gross after hedging 1.99 1.45 1.33 Less: Treatment and refining charges (0.45 ) (0.28 ) (0.18 ) Net $ 1.54 $ 1.17 $ 1.15 The change in consolidated copper sales is due to: 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Decrease in consolidated pounds sold $ (201 ) $ (146 ) Increase in average realized copper price 233 72 Increase in treatment and refining charges (33 ) (40 ) $ (1 ) $ (114 ) 50 Table of Contents The following is a summary of net gold and copper sales: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Gold Nevada, USA $ 1,441 $ 1,053 $ 1,037 Yanacocha, Peru 1,543 1,490 1,250 Australia/New Zealand: Tanami, Australia 250 221 273 Kalgoorlie, Australia 198 183 192 Jundee, Australia 190 154 156 Pajingo, Australia 105 87 104 Martha, New Zealand 71 73 54 814 718 779 Batu Hijau, Indonesia 264 318 288 Ahafo, Ghana 124 Other Operations: Golden Giant, Canada 35 73 66 Kori Kollo, Bolivia 77 44 10 La Herradura, Mexico 48 36 27 Ovacik, Turkey 44 Minahasa, Indonesia 32 160 153 179 Corporate (30 ) (52 ) 7 $ 4,316 $ 3,680 $ 3,540 Copper Batu Hijau, Indonesia $ 671 $ 672 $ 786 Costs applicable to sales gold increased in 2006 compared to 2005 due to higher labor and input commodity prices and lower grades at Nevada, Batu Hijau and Yanacocha, higher waste removal at Yanacocha and Batu Hijau, as well as increased operating costs from the start-up of Phoenix and Leeville in Nevada and Ahafo in Ghana. The increase in 2005 from 2004 resulted primarily from increased operating costs in Nevada and at Yanacocha. Costs applicable to sales copper were $308 and $303 in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Newmont has seen significant increases in the costs of labor, fuel, power and other consumables during these periods. For a complete discussion regarding variations in operations, see Results of Consolidated Operations below. 51 Table of Contents The following is a summary of Costs applicable to sales by operation: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Gold Nevada, USA $ 980 $ 807 $ 716 Yanacocha, Peru 498 487 432 Australia/New Zealand: Tanami, Australia 155 162 194 Kalgoorlie, Australia 163 144 141 Jundee, Australia 113 115 106 Pajingo, Australia 61 58 59 Martha, New Zealand 27 29 28 519 508 528 Batu Hijau, Indonesia 91 109 91 Ahafo, Ghana 60 Other Operations: Golden Giant, Canada 13 48 48 Kori Kollo, Bolivia 27 16 10 La Herradura, Mexico 19 15 10 Ovacik, Turkey 23 Minahasa, Indonesia 20 59 79 111 $ 2,207 $ 1,990 $ 1,878 Copper Batu Hijau, Indonesia $ 308 $ 303 $ 305 Deferred stripping.

The decrease in 2005 from 2004 primarily resulted from the disposition of the Ovacik mine in Turkey and lower consolidated ounces sold. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense fluctuates as capital expenditures increase or decrease and as production levels increase or decrease. For a complete discussion, see Results of Consolidated Operations , below. Newmont expects Depreciation, depletion and amortization to increase to approximately $800 to $865 in 2007. The following is a summary of Depreciation, depletion and amortization by operation: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Nevada, USA $ 180 $ 124 $ 127 Yanacocha, Peru 172 205 198 Australia/New Zealand: Tanami, Australia 30 33 38 Kalgoorlie, Australia 25 17 16 Jundee, Australia 26 27 27 Pajingo, Australia 28 25 31 Martha, New Zealand 10 16 14 Gold 119 118 126 Other 3 3 4 122 121 130 Batu Hijau, Indonesia Gold 20 34 28 Copper 66 87 90 86 121 118 Ahafo, Ghana 19 1 1 Other Operations: Golden Giant, Canada 1 11 11 Kori Kollo, Bolivia 9 4 2 La Herradura, Mexico 8 5 5 Ovacik, Turkey 16 Minahasa, Indonesia 3 Gold 18 20 37 Other 1 2 3 19 22 40 Other: Merchant Banking 19 21 24 Exploration 3 4 3 Corporate and Other 16 16 11 38 41 38 $ 636 $ 635 $ 652 Exploration period-to-period increases reflect increased exploration and related activity in response to higher gold prices and increased labor and consumable costs. Advanced projects, research and development costs represent spending on advanced projects, feasibility studies and drilling at Phoenix, Martabe, Akyem, Ahafo and Conga. Newmont expects Exploration to be approximately $170 to $175 and Advanced projects, research and development to be approximately $85 to $100 in 2007. 53 Table of Contents General and administrative expense increased in 2006 from 2005 primarily due to $12 of stock option expense. General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.0% in 2006, compared to 3.1% in 2005 and 2.7% in 2004. Newmont expects General and administrative expenses to be approximately $155 to $165 in 2007, including $10 in stock option expense. Write-down of goodwill was $nil, $41 and $52 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2005 expense was related to the Nevada segment resulting from anticipated increased future operating and capital costs. The 2004 expense was related to the Pajingo reporting unit in Australia resulting from anticipated increased future operating costs and lower grade ore. Write-down of long-lived assets totaled $3, $43 and $39 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2006 write-down primarily related to equipment. The 2005 write-down primarily related to the Martabe exploration project in Indonesia and exploration tenements in Australia. The 2004 write-down included $16 related to the Ovacik mine in Turkey. The remainder of the write-down for 2004 was related to exploration tenements in Australia, mineral interests at Pajingo, and processing facilities at Yanacocha. For a discussion of the Company policy for assessing the carrying value of its goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment, see Critical Accounting Policies, above. Other expense, net includes the following: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Reclamation and remediation $ 47 $ 38 $ (11 ) Peruvian royalty 22 Buyat Bay settlement and other (Note 29) 22 56 7 Peruvian worker participation reserves 15 Yanacocha leach pad repair 10 Other 33 18 38 $ 149 $ 112 $ 34 The 2006 expense primarily includes changes in environmental obligation estimates at non-operating sites, legal and other costs incurred in regards to pollution allegations at Minahasa and at Yanacocha, a new Peruvian royalty, costs associated with leach pad repairs and Peruvian worker participation reserves. The 2005 expense included legal and other costs incurred in regards to pollution allegations at Minahasa, changes in environmental obligation estimates at other non-operating properties, costs incurred to stabilize material and repair damage to roads and utility lines for a waste dump slide in Nevada and a pension settlement loss. The 2004 expense related to the closure of Minahasa, care and maintenance charges at Ovacik in Turkey, engineering and permitting expenses for the power plant in Nevada and other miscellaneous expenses. 54 Table of Contents Other income, net is summarized as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Gain on sale of Alberta Oil Sands project $ 266 $ $ Royalty and dividend income, net 120 79 64 Interest income 67 59 23 Gain on sale of Martabe project 30 Income from development projects, net 19 Gain (loss) on investments, net 13 54 (39 ) Gain on sale of property, plant and equipment 12 11 20 Foreign currency exchange gains 5 8 7 Gain on sale of other assets, net 6 37 8 Gain on QMC debt guarantee 9 11 Loss on early extinguishment of debt (40 ) (Loss) gain on ineffective portion of derivative investments, net (60 ) 2 2 Other 13 10 6 $ 451 $ 269 $ 102 During the third quarter of 2006, Merchant Banking completed the sale of the Alberta Oil Sands project to the Korean National Oil Corporation and the Martabe project in Indonesia to Agincourt Resources Limited ( Agincourt ). Newmont received net cash proceeds of $271 for the Alberta Oil Sands project. Newmont received net cash proceeds of $42 and approximately 43 million Agincourt shares valued at $37 for the Martabe project. Royalty and dividend income increased each year due to higher gold, oil and gas prices and higher distributions received from Canadian Oil Sands Trust, which was acquired during the second and third quarters of 2004. Interest income increased each year due to increased funds invested and higher investment yields. Income from development projects includes the gold and copper sales net of incremental operating costs incurred prior to commercial production at the Leeville and Phoenix operations in Nevada. The 2006 gain on investments is primarily related to the sale of Regis Resources NL and Pan Australian Resources Ltd. which resulted in gains of $7 and $4, respectively. The gain on investments during 2005 was primarily attributable to the sale of investments in Kinross Gold Corporation and Oxiana Limited which resulted in gains of $20 and $25, respectively. The loss on investments during 2004 was attributable to a $39 impairment of Kinross based on an extended decline in value of Kinross equity securities. The 2006 gain on sale of other assets primarily related to additional proceeds from the sale of Ovacik. The gain on sale of other assets during 2005 was primarily attributable to the sale of the Mezcala gold deposit. The 2004 gain on sale of other assets primarily resulted from the sales of Perama, Midwest Uranium and Bronzewing. Newmont was the guarantor of an A$71 (approximately $53) amortizing loan facility of QMC Finance Pty Ltd. ( QMC ) which was collateralized by the assets of the Queensland Magnesium Project. Newmont reduced the amount accrued for this contingent obligation by the estimated fair value of the Australian Magnesium Corporation assets that would be subrogated to Newmont in the event the guarantee was called, which resulted in a $30 loss during 2003. During 2004, Newmont entered into a transaction resulting in a loan from Newmont to a subsidiary of QMC for A$30 (approximately $23), the release of Newmont from its guarantee obligation and recognition of an $11 gain resulting from the release of all previously accrued contingent liabilities. An 55 Table of Contents allowance was provided for 100% of the loan receivable from the QMC entity. In 2005, a gain was recognized for A$12 (approximately $9), resulting from a reduction in the allowance provided on the loan receivable. On September 27, 2006, Newmont settled its remaining obligations under the prepaid forward gold sales contract and forward gold purchase contract for which it was required to deliver 17,951 ounces of gold in December 2006 and 179,062 ounces of gold in June 2007. This settlement resulted in cash payments of $96, and included a $48 reduction to the current portion of long-term debt and a $40 pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt. The loss on ineffective portion of derivative instruments includes a loss of $56 in 2006 for the ineffective portion of the copper collar instruments designated as cash flow hedges. Other losses relate to the ineffective portion of legacy gold puts in Australia. Interest expense, net of capitalized interest was $97, $97 and $97 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Capitalized interest totaled $57, $39 and $13 in each year, respectively. Interest costs increased each year due to the issuance of the $600 5 7 / 8 % notes in 2005 and the $200 bond issuance at Yanacocha in July 2006. These increases were offset each year by higher capitalized interest due to construction of Leeville, Phoenix and the power plant in Nevada, the Ahafo project in Ghana and the Boddington project in Australia. Newmont expects Interest expense, net of capitalized interest to be approximately $95 to $105 in 2007. Income tax expense was $424 in 2006, compared to $310 and $324 in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The effective tax rates were 26.1%, 29.6%, and 30.3% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The factors that most significantly impact the Company effective tax rate are percentage depletion and resource allowances, the rate differential related to foreign earnings indefinitely invested, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets, foreign earnings net of foreign tax credits, earnings attributable to minority interests in subsidiaries and affiliated companies, foreign currency translation gains and losses, impacts of the analysis of income taxes payable and U.S. book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the impact of certain specific transactions. Most of these factors are sensitive to the average realized price of gold and other metals. Percentage depletion allowances (tax deductions for depletion that may exceed the Company tax basis in its mineral reserves) are available to the Company under the income tax laws of the United States for operations conducted in the United States or through branches and partnerships owned by U.S. subsidiaries included in the Company consolidated United States income tax return. The deductions are highly sensitive to the price of gold and other minerals produced by the Company. For 2006 and prior years, similar types of deductions are available for mining operations in Canada. The tax benefits from percentage depletion and resource allowances were $83, $47 and $47 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily is due to an increase in the Company average realized gold price. The Company operates in various countries around the world that have tax laws, tax incentives and tax rates that are significantly different than those of the United States. Many of these differences combine to move the Company overall effective tax rate higher or lower than the United States statutory rate depending on the mix of income relative to income earned in the United States. The effect of these differences is shown in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements as either a foreign rate differential or the effect of foreign earnings, net of credits. Differences in tax rates and other foreign income tax law variations make the Company ability to fully utilize all of its available foreign income tax credits on a year-by-year basis highly dependent on the price of the gold and copper produced by the Company and the costs of production, since lower prices or higher costs can result in the Company having insufficient sources of taxable income in the United States to utilize all available foreign tax credits. Such credits have limited carry back and carry forward periods and can only be used to reduce the United States income tax imposed on the Company foreign earnings included in its annual United States consolidated income tax return. The effects of foreign earnings, net of allowable credits, were an increase of income tax expense of $9, $12 and $25, in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The effect of different income tax rates in countries where earnings are indefinitely reinvested contributed to an increase in the Company income tax expense of $79, $8 and $61 in 2006, 2005 and 2004 respectively. 56 Table of Contents The tax effect of changes in local country tax laws, as shown in the Company effective tax reconciliation in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, resulted in a net tax benefit of $22, $24 and $51 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The net tax benefit in 2006 is primarily related to a decrease in the Canadian federal and provincial statutory tax rates. The net tax benefit in 2005 and 2004 is primarily related to a change in Australian tax law regarding the ability of the company to file consolidated income tax returns. The Company adopted the U.S. dollar as its functional currency for Australian tax reporting purposes. This change will eliminate fluctuations in the effective tax rate that resulted from foreign currency exchange rate movements between the U.S. dollar and Australian dollar. The change resulted in a tax benefit of $48 in 2006. The need to record valuation allowances related to the Company deferred tax assets (primarily attributable to net operating losses and tax credits) is principally dependent on the following factors: (i) the extent to which the net operating losses and tax credits can be carried back and yield a tax benefit; (ii) the Company long-term estimate of future average realized minerals prices; and (iii) the degree to which many of the tax laws and income tax agreements imposed upon the Company and its subsidiaries around the world tend to create significant tax deductions early in the mining process. These up-front deductions can give rise to net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards in circumstances where future sources of taxable income may not coincide with available carry forward periods even after taking into account all available tax planning strategies. Furthermore, certain liabilities, accrued for financial reporting purposes, may not be deductible for tax purposes until such liabilities are actually funded which could happen after mining operations have ceased, when sufficient sources of taxable income may not be available. Changes to valuation allowances decreased income tax expense by $27 in 2006, increased income tax expense by $22 in 2005, and decreased income tax expense by $58 in 2004. This utilization primarily is due to generation of low taxed, foreign sourced income, in addition to higher sources of taxable income in the United States resulting from the increase in the Company average realized gold price in 2006. The release of valuation allowance on capital loss carry forwards was due to the realization of capital gains outside the United States. The Company, consolidates certain subsidiaries of which it does not own 100% of the outstanding equity. However, for tax purposes, the Company is only responsible for the income taxes on the portion of the taxable earnings attributable to its ownership interest of each consolidated entity. Such minority interests contributed $15, $15 and $7 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, as reductions in the Company income tax expense. The Company tax expense decreased by $2, $14 and $13 in 2006, 2005 and 2004 respectively due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In 2005 and 2004, these amounts primarily relate to the Australian tax effect of realized and unrealized translation gains attributable to United States dollar-denominated assets and liabilities and the gold derivatives positions at Newmont Australia Limited whose functional currency is the United States dollar. Because Newmont intends to indefinitely reinvest earnings from Newmont Australia Limited, no offsetting United States deferred income tax effect can be recorded. During 2006 the Company completed a reconciliation of its U.S. book and tax basis assets and liabilities as well as a detailed analysis of its income taxes payable. This exercise identified differences of $27. The entire adjustment was recognized as a tax benefit in 2006. The Company also recognized a net tax benefit of $16 due to an adjustment on the interest accrued on tax contingencies. Based on the uncertainty and inherent unpredictability of the factors influencing the Company effective tax rate and the sensitivity of such factors to gold and other metals prices as discussed above, the effective tax rate is expected to be volatile in future periods. The effective tax rate is expected to be between 29% and 34% in 2007. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, ( FIN 48 ) an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax 57 Table of Contents position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 requires that the Company recognize in its financial statements, the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective beginning January 1, 2007 with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings, goodwill, deferred income taxes and income taxes payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48 on the Company consolidated financial position, results of operations and disclosures. Minority interest in income of subsidiaries decreased in 2006 from 2005 as a result of lower production and earnings at Batu Hijau (see Results of Consolidated Operations, Batu Hijau Operations). The 2005 increase from 2004 resulted from increased earnings at Yanacocha due to increased gold price and ounces sold, partially offset by an increase in costs (see Results of Consolidated Operations, Yanacocha Operations). Equity income (loss) of affiliates was as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 European Gold Refineries $ 3 $ 6 $ 1 AGR Matthey Joint Venture 1 (2 ) 1 Regis Resources NL (2 ) $ 2 $ 4 $ 2 The Loss from discontinued operations of $49 in 2006 resulted from the Holloway and Zarafshan gold operations being discontinued from sale and expropriation, respectively. The Company reclassified the income statement results from the historical presentation to discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented. The Company recorded a pre-tax impairment loss of $101 as a result of the Uzbekistan government expropriation of the Zarafshan operation. A $13 pre-tax gain was recorded for the sale of the Holloway operation. The 2005 loss of $38 was primarily due to a $42 pre-tax write-down of long-lived assets as a result of the classification of the Golden Grove copper-zinc operation in Australia as a discontinued operation. A $6 pre-tax gain was recorded later in 2005 for the sale of Golden Grove. The gain of $79 in 2004 was primarily due to a tax credit related to Golden Grove from an election to prepare a consolidated tax return in Australia (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax was $47 effective January 1, 2004 resulting from the consolidation of Batu Hijau to conform Batu Hijau accounting policies to Newmont accounting policies. See Accounting Developments, above, for more information. Other comprehensive income, net of tax in 2006 included a $272 gain in value of marketable securities, $47 for unrealized gains on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and $17 related to a minimum pension liability adjustment, offset by a loss of $14 on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies. Other comprehensive income, net of tax in 2005 included a $282 gain in value of marketable equity securities and a $26 gain on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, offset by losses of $18 related to a minimum pension liability adjustment and $59 for unrealized losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. Other comprehensive income, net of tax in 2004 included a $123 gain in value of marketable equity securities and a $31 gain on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, offset by losses of $11 related to a minimum pension liability adjustment and $19 for unrealized losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. 58 Table of Contents Results of Consolidated Operations Gold Ounces or Copper Pounds Sold (1) Costs Applicable to Sales (2) Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 (ounces in thousands) ($ per ounce) ($ per ounce) Gold Nevada 2,534.1 2,444.1 2,538.0 $ 403 $ 333 $ 282 $ 74 $ 51 $ 50 Yanacocha (3) (51.35% owned) 2,572.3 3,327.5 3,039.9 193 147 142 67 62 65 Australia/New Zealand 1,350.1 1,600.5 1,887.6 384 317 280 89 74 67 Batu Hijau (3)(4) 435.3 720.5 715.2 209 152 128 46 47 39 Ahafo 202.1 297 94 Other (3) 267.3 336.7 438.1 222 233 252 69 58 84 Total/Weighted-Average 7,361.2 8,429.3 8,618.8 $ 304 $ 237 $ 218 $ 73 $ 60 $ 60 (pounds in millions) ($ per pound) ($ per pound) Copper Batu Hijau (2)(3) 434.7 572.7 683.3 $ 0.71 $ 0.53 $ 0.45 $ 0.15 $ 0.15 $ 0.13 (1) Includes incremental start-up ounces of 100,300 and 22,100 in 2006 and 2005, respectively. (2) Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization. (3) Consolidated gold ounces or copper pounds sold includes minority interests share. (4) Economic interest decreased to 52.875% from 56.25% on October 1, 2004. Consolidated gold ounces sold decreased in 2006 from 2005 due to: decreased sales at Yanacocha and Batu Hijau due to lower grade ores and lower throughput at Batu Hijau; the completion of operations at Lone Tree (Nevada) and Golden Giant (Other); partially offset by the start-up of operations at Ahafo (Ghana) and Leeville and Phoenix (Nevada). Consolidated gold ounces sold decreased in 2005 from 2004 due to: lower grade ores processed in Nevada and Australia/New Zealand; the dispositions of Ovacik (Other) and Bronzewing (Australia/New Zealand); and the completion of operations at Minahasa (Other); partially offset by increased sales at Yanacocha. Consolidated copper pounds sold decreased in 2006 and 2005 due to the processing of lower grade ore (0.55% vs. 0.69%) and lower mill throughput due to mine plan changes and harder material. Consolidated copper pounds sold also decreased in 2005 from 2004 due to the processing of lower grade ore (0.69% vs. 0.75%) after access to ore in the lower portion of the pit was restricted as a result of several small pit wall slides during the first quarter of 2005. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated gold ounce sold increased in 2006 from 2005 and in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to the decrease in production at Yanacocha, Batu Hijau, and Australia/New Zealand and increased operating costs in Nevada, Yanacocha, Batu Hijau and Australia/New Zealand. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated copper pound increased from year-to-year due to the decrease in copper production and increased operating costs. The Company expects consolidated gold sales of approximately 6.1 to 6.6 million ounces in 2007, primarily as a result of lower production from Yanacocha and Australia, as well as the closure of Lone Tree in Nevada and 59 Table of Contents Golden Giant in Canada in 2006. Costs applicable to sales per ounce for 2007 are expected to be approximately 25% higher than 2006, primarily from lower production at Yanacocha and Australia, as well as expected higher labor, consumables and energy prices in all operating regions. Additionally, future potential power interruptions in Ghana could further impact the Company Costs applicable to sales in 2007. The Company expects consolidated copper sales of approximately 400 to 435 million pounds of copper in 2007 at Costs applicable to sales of approximately $1.10 to $1.20 per pound. Nevada Operations Nevada gold ounces sold increased by 90,000 ounces in 2006 from 2005, due to the commencement of commercial operations at Phoenix and Leeville in the fourth quarter of 2006 and increased access to open pit ore at the Twin Creeks layback, partially offset by lower production from Lone Tree. The Phoenix project commenced commercial operations on October 1, 2006, followed by the Leeville project on October 14, 2006. Leeville and Phoenix produced 243,700 ounces in 2006, including 100,300 incremental start-up ounces included in Other income, net . Gold production at Lone Tree declined as mining was completed in 2006. Overall, mill ore grade decreased 17% and mill throughput increased 16% as a result of the start-up of the lower grade Phoenix operation. Heap leach production was slightly higher than 2005 due to a 9% increase in average grade of ore placed on the leach pads. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 22%, primarily due to increased labor, diesel, power, cyanide and other commodity prices, higher underground contract service costs. Costs applicable to sales were also impacted by the change in accounting for open pit waste removal costs. In 2005, $47 of mining costs was deferred which reduced Costs applicable to sales by $20 per ounce. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased as a result of placing new equipment and facilities in operation. Gold ounces sold decreased in 2005 from 2004, as a 12% decrease in mill ore grade and sales from inventories in 2004 were partially offset by an 18% increase in mill throughput and a 12% increase in heap leach ore placed. Adverse mill grades were caused by unfavorable ground conditions at underground operations and a labor shortage impacting underground development. Ore placed on the leach pads increased by 12% in 2005 from 2004 due to increased open pit production from Carlin and Twin Creeks. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 18%, primarily due to increased labor, diesel and other commodity prices, a decrease in ounces produced and higher underground contract service costs. During the fourth quarter of 2005, Nevada recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $41 as a result of anticipated increased future operating and capital costs. Consolidated gold sales are expected to remain stable in 2007 at approximately 2.35 to 2.55 million ounces. Higher production from Phoenix, Leeville and Twin Creeks is expected to be partially offset by the shut-down of Lone Tree at the end of 2006. Higher mill throughput and mill recoveries are expected to be offset by lower planned mill grades and leach recoveries in 2007. Costs applicable to sales are also expected to remain stable in 2007 at approximately $375 to $400 per ounce. Ongoing labor and energy cost pressures are expected to be offset by reduced contracted services and other expenses, as well as lower anticipated maintenance costs associated with a newer mining fleet. Construction of a 200-megawatt coal-fired power plant is approximately 37% complete as of December 31, 2006. Capital costs for the power plant are expected to be between $620 and $640 and completion is targeted for mid-2008. Non-governmental organizations have brought a series of actions relating to the Nevada operations, as described in more detail in Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. While Newmont believes that the legal actions are without merit, unfavorable outcomes could result in additional conditions being imposed on the Company operations, and such conditions could have a material adverse effect on Nevada results of operations or financial position. 60 Table of Contents Yanacocha Operations Gold ounces sold decreased in 2006 from 2005, primarily due to a decrease in ore tons mined and placed on the leach pads, as anticipated in the mine plan. The proportion of waste tons mined increased from 0.50 waste tons per ton of ore in 2005 to 0.88 waste tons per ton of ore in 2006. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to the decrease in production, increased consumption and prices of diesel, cyanide, lime and other commodities and higher worker participation bonuses and royalties due to increased gold prices, partially offset by increased silver by-product credits. Gold ounces sold increased in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to a 12% increase in the grade of ore placed and a 10% increase in the total ore placed, partially offset by timing of flows from the leach pads and increased inventory. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to increased workers participation payments, increased consumption of reagents and higher royalties due to increased gold prices. Increased labor and commodity costs were partially offset by increased production, related allocation of costs to inventory and increased silver by-product credits. Consolidated gold sales are expected to decrease in 2007 to approximately 1.5 to 1.6 million ounces, primarily as a result of lower throughput and ore grades. Consolidated gold sales for 2008 through 2010 are expected to be approximately 1.6 to 1.8 million ounces per year. Costs applicable to sales at Yanacocha are expected to increase in 2007 to approximately $340 to $360 per ounce, primarily as a result of lower production. During 2004, Peru enacted legislation to establish a sliding scale mining royalty of up to 3% based on the volume of mine production. The royalty is calculated on revenue from sales of product less certain refining and transportation expenses. While the Peruvian royalty became effective during the second quarter of 2004, it did not apply to those projects that had tax stabilization agreements prior to the adoption of the royalty law. Virtually all of Yanacocha current production is derived from projects that were stabilized prior to the enactment of the royalty legislation; however, future projects not covered by the tax stabilization agreements will be burdened by this royalty. In addition, the recent presidential, congressional and regional elections may result in changes to the government's positions on regulations and policies that could impact Yanacocha's operations. Although the new administration has affirmed its intention to uphold these tax stabilization agreements, it is possible that the Congress will attempt to set aside these agreements and impose the mining royalty on projects covered by such agreements or that additional payments may be required to address the perception that proceeds from mining activities should be more equitably shared. In 2006, Yanacocha recorded a $22 charge to Other expense, net related to an agreement with the Peruvian government to provide for a royalty payment for community improvements during current high metal prices. The negotiated royalty is based on 3.75% of Yanacocha net income beginning January 1, 2006 for a period of up to five years. There is a collective bargaining agreement in place at Yanacocha through February 2007. The agreement is currently being re-negotiated. A minority of the union membership staged a three-day strike in April 2006. The strike had no material impact on operations. There can be no assurance that future disputes will be resolved without disruption to operations. In August 2006, Yanacocha resumed all mining and construction activities after a blockade that temporarily restricted access to the Yanacocha mine. The Company signed agreements with the Peruvian government and duly appointed representatives of the protesting community members on August 30, 2006 to peacefully end the blockade. Yanacocha will participate in a high-level government commission to continue to address the concerns of those community members. Cerro Quilish is a deposit within the Yanacocha complex. In July 2004, Yanacocha received a drilling permit for the Cerro Quilish deposit and commenced drilling activities to further define the deposit. During September 2004, individuals from the Cajamarca region, where Cerro Quilish is located, conducted a sustained blockade of the road between the City of Cajamarca and the mine site, in protest of these exploration activities. 61 Table of Contents Yanacocha suspended all drilling activities at Cerro Quilish and the blockade was resolved. At the request of Yanacocha, the Cerro Quilish drilling permit was revoked in November 2004. Yanacocha has reassessed the challenges involved in obtaining required permits for Cerro Quilish primarily related to increased community concerns. Based upon this reassessment, Yanacocha reclassified 3.9 million ounces (2.0 million equity ounces) of gold from proven and probable reserves to mineralized material not in reserve as of December 31, 2004.

(2) During 2004, Jundee included Bronzewing which ceased mining in the first quarter of 2004 and was sold during the third quarter of 2004. Australia/New Zealand operations sold fewer ounces of gold in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to lower production resulting from decreased ore tons mined and lower mill throughput. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased in 2006 from 2005 primarily due to the decreases in ounces sold, increased commodity costs partially offset by depreciation of the Australian and New Zealand dollars compared to the U.S. dollar. The favorable foreign exchange movements decreased Australia/New Zealand Costs applicable to sales in 2006 from 2005 by $5 per ounce. Costs applicable to sales were also impacted by the change in accounting for open pit waste removal costs. In 2005, $7 of mining costs was deferred which reduced Costs applicable to sales by $5 per ounce. In 2005, gold ounces sold decreased compared to 2004, primarily due to lower grades at Tanami and Kalgoorlie combined with lower throughput at Tanami and Pajingo. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to the decreases in ounces sold, increased commodity costs and appreciation of the Australian and New Zealand dollars compared to the U.S. dollar. The unfavorable foreign exchange movements increased Australia/New Zealand Costs applicable to sales in 2005 from 2004 by $15 per ounce. Consolidated gold sales are expected to decline in 2007 to approximately 1.275 to 1.325 million ounces, primarily as a result of lower planned throughput and ore grades. At Martha, lower mill throughput is anticipated as a result of planned mine sequencing adjustments. Lower anticipated ore grades at Tanami and planned ramp-down sequencing at Pajingo are also expected to contribute to declining gold sales in the region until Boddington begins production. Costs applicable to sales are expected to increase to approximately $445 to $470 per ounce in 2007, primarily as a result of lower planned production and higher anticipated labor, electricity and fuel expenses. Tanami, Australia . Gold ounces sold decreased in 2006 from 2005, primarily due to a 23% decline in mill throughput resulting from the completion of processing Groundrush stockpiles, partially offset by higher ore grade from the Granites. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to lower gold production and increased royalties due to the higher gold price. 62 Table of Contents Gold ounces sold decreased in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to a 16% decline in ore grade from mining lower grade zones of the Callie underground deposit and processing lower grade stockpiles at Groundrush. Mining was completed at Groundrush in 2004 and the lower grade stockpiles were exhausted in the third quarter of 2005. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to lower gold production, higher maintenance, diesel, power, ground support and surface works costs and appreciation of the Australian dollar. Kalgoorlie, Australia . Gold ounces sold decreased in 2006 from 2005, due to lower mill throughput (harder ore), a decrease in mill ore grade and a decrease in roaster throughput resulting from a higher sulfer to gold ratio and adverse weather conditions. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to lower production and increased labor, diesel and contract services. Milling costs also increased due to mill maintenance costs and higher grinding costs due to the harder ore. Costs applicable to sales were also impacted by the change in accounting for open pit waste removal costs. In 2005, $9 of mining costs was deferred which reduced Costs applicable to sales by $23 per ounce. Gold ounces sold decreased in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to a 7% decrease in ore grade milled and sales from inventories in 2004, partially offset by a 2% increase in tons milled. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to increased mill throughput, increased diesel, reagent and power costs and appreciation of the Australian dollar. Jundee, Australia . Gold ounces sold decreased in 2006 from 2005, due to a 4% decrease in tons milled and a 6% decrease in mill ore grade. The decrease in tons milled was attributable to severe weather conditions, flooding and an extended mill shutdown in the first half of the year. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to lower gold production and higher maintenance costs, partially offset by reduced mining activity. Gold ounces sold decreased 10% in 2005 from 2004, due to the cessation of production at Bronzewing, partially offset by higher mill ore grade from Jundee. Processing at Bronzewing ceased during the second quarter of 2004 and Bronzewing was sold the third quarter of 2004 (see Other Investing Activities, below). Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to higher underground contract services, steel, diesel and administration costs and appreciation of the Australian dollar. Pajingo, Australia . Gold ounces sold decreased in 2006 from 2005, primarily due to a 14% decrease in tons milled. The decrease in tons milled was attributable to ground control issues at Vera South Deeps and slower than planned access at Jandam. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to lower production, increased contract services and equipment maintenance costs. Pajingo is approaching the end of its mine life, based on current mine plans, and operations are expected to be completed in 2008. Gold ounces sold decreased in 2005 from 2004, due to a 19% decrease in ore milled as low grade stockpiles which supplemented production in 2004 were exhausted. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to lower production and appreciation of the Australian dollar. Martha, New Zealand . Gold ounces sold decreased in 2006 from 2005, primarily due to a 4% decrease in mill ore grade and a 20% decrease in mill throughput due to reduced open pit mining activity and the commencement of Favona ore treatment which requires finer grinding. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to the decrease in gold production. Gold ounces sold increased in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to a 37% increase in ore grade due to mine sequencing, partially offset by a 9% decrease in ore milled. Costs applicable to sales per ounce decreased due to increased production, partially offset by higher processing costs from harder ore and appreciation of the New Zealand dollar. 63 Table of Contents Batu Hijau Operations Gold Ounces or Copper Pounds Sold Costs Applicable to Sales (1) Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 (ounces in thousands) ($ per ounce) ($ per ounce) Gold Batu Hijau (2)(3) 435.3 720.5 715.2 $ 209 $ 152 $ 128 $ 46 $ 47 $ 39 (pounds in millions) ($ per pound) ($ per pound) Copper Batu Hijau (2)(3) 434.7 572.7 683.3 $ 0.71 $ 0.53 $ 0.45 $ 0.15 $ 0.15 $ 0.13 (1) Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization. (2) Consolidated gold ounces or copper pounds sold includes minority interests share. (3) Economic interest decreased to 52.875% from 56.25% on October 1, 2004. Batu Hijau revised its mine plan in 2006 to address geotechnical instability of the operation east pit wall and harder than modeled ore. Production was impacted by lower grades due to the mining sequence, as well as lower mill throughput due to processing harder ore. Copper and gold sales decreased in 2006 from 2005 as a result of lower copper (20%) and gold (34%) ore grades, and lower mill throughput (6%). Total tons mined were 30% higher in 2006 from 2005 primarily due to the addition of new mining equipment, shorter hauling distance and increased shovel productivity. Costs applicable to sales per pound of copper and per ounce of gold increased due to lower production, the expansion of the mining fleet and increased diesel, tire, labor and process maintenance costs, partially offset by an increased allocation of costs to stockpile inventories. Short-term stockpiles were built for processing in 2007. Copper sales decreased and gold sales increased slightly in 2005 from 2004. Access to ore in the lower portion of the pit was restricted as a result of several small pit wall slides during the first quarter of 2005. As a result, the mine plan was revised, resulting in the processing of lower grade stockpiles. Costs applicable to sales per pound of copper and per ounce of gold increased as a result of the decrease in production, increased fuel, maintenance, consumables, and labor costs. Consolidated sales are expected to remain stable in 2007 at approximately 435,000 to 475,000 ounces of gold and approximately 395 to 435 million pounds of copper. Consolidated gold and copper sales are expected to be positively impacted by higher grades and throughput, offset by lower copper recoveries. Costs applicable to sales are expected to increase in 2007 to approximately $225 to $240 per ounce of gold and approximately $1.10 to $1.20 per pound of copper. Increasing operating costs are expected to result primarily from higher stripping expenses, as well as rising fuel, energy and consumables prices. As of October 1, 2004, cumulative losses had been recovered and Batu Hijau began to report positive retained earnings, allowing for the payment of dividends, 6% of which are paid to the minority partner. Accordingly, Newmont began recognizing the minority interests in Batu Hijau at 47.125% (effective 52.875% Newmont share) of Batu Hijau earnings and will continue to do so until a loan to the minority interest partner is fully repaid (including accrued interest). See Consolidated Financial Results above for more information. Under the Contract of Work, beginning in 2005 and continuing through 2010, a portion of the project must be offered for sale to the Indonesian government or to Indonesian nationals, equal to the difference between the following percentages and the percentage of shares already owned by the Indonesian government or Indonesian nationals (if such number is positive): 15%, by the end of 2005; 23%, by the end of 2006; 30%, by the end of 2007; 37%, by the end of 2008; 44%, by the end of 2009; and 51%, by the end of 2010. The price at which such interest must be offered for sale to the Indonesian parties is the highest of the then-current replacement cost, the price at which shares of the project company would be accepted for listing on the Jakarta Stock Exchange, or the fair market value of such interest in the project company as a going concern. Pursuant to this provision, it is possible that the ownership interest of the Newmont/Sumitomo partnership in Batu Hijau could be reduced to 49% by the end of 2010. 64 Table of Contents A company owned by an Indonesian national currently owns a 20% interest in Batu Hijau, and therefore the Newmont/Sumitomo partnership was required to offer a 3% interest for sale in 2006. An offer to sell a 3% interest was made to the government of Indonesia. While the central government declined to participate, local governments in the area in which the mine is located have expressed interest in acquiring shares, as have various Indonesian nationals. The Newmont/Sumitomo partnership continues discussions with various interested parties to meet its divestiture obligations. Under the terms of the Contract of Work, an additional 7% interest in Batu Hijau must be offered for sale in 2007. Ahafo Operation Ahafo commenced commercial production in August 2006 and had gold sales of 202,100 ounces in 2006. Gold production was negatively impacted by nation-wide power rationing due to low water levels at Lake Volta serving Ghana Akosombo hydroelectric facilities, which limited mill availability and throughput. Costs applicable to sales in 2006 benefited from the capitalization of pre-production costs and are expected to be higher in 2007 as a result. The Company is installing additional temporary diesel generating capacity at Ahafo and, along with other Ghanaian mining industry members, is exploring longer-term, lower-cost solutions to the current power shortages. Consolidated gold sales for 2007 are expected to increase to approximately 410,000 to 450,000 ounces, as the mine enters its first full year of production. Gold production in 2007 is expected to be lower than previously planned as a result of reduced processing grades and recoveries. Additionally, higher costs and potential production interruptions could result from possible future power shortages in 2007. Costs applicable to sales are expected to increase substantially in 2007 to approximately $460 to $500 per ounce, primarily as a result of lower than previously planned production and higher power costs. Operating costs are also expected to increase in 2007 as a result of higher anticipated labor and contracted services expenditures, as well as rising fuel and consumables prices.

(2) Consolidated gold ounces sold includes minority interests share. (3) Ovacik sold in March 2005. Kori Kollo, Bolivia . Gold ounces sold increased in 2006 from 2005, due to a 59% increase in the ore grade of the material placed on the leach pads, partially offset by 25% fewer tons placed. Total tons mined increased 69%, however, the proportion of waste tons mined increased from 0.11 waste tons per ton of ore in 2005 to 1.50 waste tons per ton of ore in 2006. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased in 2006 from 2005, primarily as a result of the higher waste removal costs. Gold ounces sold increased in 2005 from 2004, due to the placement of additional material from the Kori Kollo pit on the existing leach pad and ore from the Kori Chaca pit on a new leach pad beginning in the third 65 Table of Contents quarter of 2005. The mill was shut down in October 2003, however production continued from residual leaching. Costs applicable to sales per ounce decreased from 2004 to 2005 as a result of the increased production. La Herradura, Mexico . Gold ounces sold decreased in 2006 from 2005 due to the timing of flows from the leach pads. Tons placed on the leach pads increased 21% and was offset by an 18% decrease in ore grade. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to expensing all open pit waste removal costs, an increase in waste tons mined and increased labor, diesel and other commodity prices. In 2005, $3 of mining costs was deferred which reduced Costs applicable to sales by $31 per ounce. Gold ounces sold increased in 2005 from 2004 due to a 12% increase in ore grade and the timing of flows from the leach pads. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to increased labor, diesel and other commodity prices. Golden Giant, Canada . Mining operations at Golden Giant were completed in December 2005. Remnant mining and milling production in 2006 was higher than expected due to additional in-circuit inventory recovery and mill clean-up activities. Remnant production from these activities is expected to be completed in the first half of 2007. Ovacik, Turkey . On March 1, 2005, the Ovacik mine was sold to a subsidiary of Koza Davetiye, a Turkish conglomerate. Operations were suspended in August 2004 as a result of a court decision ordering suspension of operating permits pending completion of certain additional permitting requirements and the submission of an updated environmental impact assessment. Minahasa, Indonesia . Mining activities at Minahasa ceased in 2001. Milling of the remaining stockpiles was completed in August 2004. See Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding legal actions related to Minahasa. Consolidated gold sales for other operations in 2007 are expected to decrease to approximately 160,000 to 200,000 ounces at Costs applicable to sales of approximately $305 to $325 per ounce as a result of higher stripping expenses and higher anticipated labor and fuel expenses. Merchant Banking Merchant Banking is a reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. Merchant Banking, also referred to as Newmont Capital, manages a royalty portfolio, an equity portfolio, a downstream gold refining business, and engages in value realization activities (managing interests in oil and gas, iron ore, and coal properties as well as providing in-house investment banking and advisory services). Merchant Banking manages a royalty portfolio which includes interests that were acquired as a result of the Franco-Nevada acquisition, as well as royalties created by virtue of its land bank activities (through sale or farm-out). Royalty interests are generally in the form of a net smelter return ( NSR ) royalty that provides for the payment of a specified percentage of production, less certain specified transportation and refining costs. In some cases, royalties are a net profit interest ( NPI ) entitling Newmont to a specified percentage of the net profits, as defined in each case. The majority of NSR royalty revenue and NPI revenue can be received in cash or in-kind at the option of Newmont. Merchant Banking royalty interests and equity investments generated $120, $79 and $64 of Royalty and dividend income, net in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase from period-to-period was primarily attributable to steady performance from the gold and platinum group metals royalties coupled with higher gold and oil and gas prices as well as an increase in distributions received from Canadian Oil Sands Trust. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense related to Royalty and dividend income, net was $19, $21 and $24 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 66 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2006, Merchant Banking equity portfolio had a market value of approximately $1,354 compared to the 2005 value of approximately $940. The increase is attributable to unrealized gains of approximately $321 during 2006, Merchant Banking purchasing marketable equity securities of Gabriel Resources, reinvesting dividends from Canadian Oil Sands Trust and closing on a private placement and ore purchase agreement with Queenstake Resources Ltd. for approximately $17, $25 and $10, respectively. During 2005, in addition to unrealized gains of approximately $343, Merchant Banking purchased marketable equity securities of Shore Gold, Gabriel Resources and Miramar Mining for approximately $87, $31 and $27, respectively and sold Kinross equity securities for approximately $111. Merchant Banking also sold Oxiana Limited equity securities for $78, of which, the majority were obtained from the sale of Golden Grove. During 2004, in addition to an unrealized gain of approximately $155, Merchant Banking purchased marketable equity securities of Canadian Oil Sands Trust and Gabriel for approximately $200 and $19, respectively. Also in 2004, Newmont recognized a $39 impairment of its investment in Kinross. Merchant Banking provides advisory services to Newmont to assist it in managing its portfolio of operating and property interests. During 2006, Merchant Banking completed the acquisition of an additional 22.22% interest in the Boddington project and the remaining 15% interest in Akyem, bringing the Company ownership to 66.67% and 100%, respectively, and the acquisition of a 40% interest in Shore Gold Inc. Fort a la Corne diamond Joint Venture in Saskatchewan, Canada. Merchant Banking completed the sale of the Alberta Oil Sands project, the Martabe project in Indonesia, and the discontinued Holloway operation as discussed above under Other income, net and Loss from discontinued operations . Newmont received net cash proceeds of $271 for the Alberta Oil Sands project resulting in a $266 pre-tax gain. Newmont received net cash proceeds of $42 and approximately 43 million Agincourt shares valued at $37 for the Martabe project, resulting in a $30 pre-tax gain. Newmont received net cash proceeds of $40 plus a royalty for the Holloway operation resulting in a $13 pre-tax gain. In 2005, Merchant Banking provided assistance in the sale of non-core properties including Golden Grove in Australia, Ovacik in Turkey and Mezcala in Mexico. In 2004, Merchant Banking assistance was provided in the sale of non-core properties including Bronzewing in Australia, Perama in Greece and Midwest Uranium in Canada. In addition, Merchant Banking participated in the restructuring of Australian Magnesium Corporation eliminating all remaining Newmont obligations (see Other Investing Activities below). Merchant Banking also manages the Company interests in downstream gold refining and distribution businesses (40% interest in AGR Matthey Joint Venture and 50% interest in European Gold Refineries). Merchant Banking earned $4, $4, and $2 in Equity income of affiliates through its investments in AGR and EGR in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Other income, net attributable to the Merchant Banking Segment was as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Gain on sale of Alberta Oil Sands project $ 266 $ $ Royalty and dividend income, net 120 79 64 Gain on sale of Martabe project 30 Gain (loss) on investments, net 13 54 (39 ) Gain on sale of the Mezcala gold deposit 31 Gain on QMC debt guarantee 9 11 Other 4 1 5 $ 433 $ 174 $ 41 Exploration Exploration expense was $170, $147 and $107 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Exploration expense in 2006 reflects higher funding of exploration and related activities in response to higher gold prices and increased labor and consumable costs. Newmont anticipates it will expense between $170 and $175 on exploration activities in 2007. 67 Table of Contents During 2006, Newmont replaced approximately 8.9 million equity gold ounces of depletion and divestitures with 3.7 million equity gold ounces in acquisitions and 5.9 million equity gold ounces of additions and revisions to proven and probable reserves. Exploration activities during 2006 succeeded in converting significant new reserves at Carlin open pits (2.3 million equity gold ounces), Boddington (1.4 million equity gold ounces), Twin Creeks (1.1 million equity gold ounces), Ahafo (0.7 million equity gold ounces), La Herradura (0.7 million equity gold ounces), and Kalgoorlie (0.6 million equity gold ounces). Exploration activities during 2005 primarily focused on the conversion of significant new reserves at the Carlin open pits (1.9 million equity gold ounces), the Conga district in Peru (1.6 million equity gold ounces), and the two Ghana projects (Ahafo 1.6 million equity gold ounces, Akyem 1.1 million equity gold ounces). Newmont added a total of 9.4 million equity gold ounces to proven and probable reserves in 2005. Exploration activities during 2004 primarily focused on the Conga district in Peru and the Phoenix deposit in Nevada. Newmont added 4.5 million equity gold ounces at Conga and 2.3 million equity gold ounces at Phoenix in 2004. Exploration also focused its activities on the Ghana projects where reserves increased by 3.0 million equity gold ounces at Ahafo and 1.1 million equity gold ounces at Akyem in 2004. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates In addition to its domestic operations in the United States, Newmont has operations in Australia, New Zealand, Peru, Indonesia, Canada, Bolivia and other foreign locations. The Company operations sell their production based on U.S. dollar metal prices. Fluctuations in local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar can increase or decrease profit margins and Costs applicable to sales to the extent costs are paid in local currency at foreign operations. Such fluctuations have not had a material impact on the Company revenue since gold and copper are sold throughout the world principally in U.S. dollars. Approximately 33%, 37% and 40% of Newmont Costs applicable to sales were paid in local currencies in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company Costs applicable to sales are most significantly impacted by variations in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate. However, variations in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate historically have been strongly correlated to variations in the U.S. dollar gold price over the long-term. Increases or decreases in costs at Australian locations due to exchange rate changes have therefore tended to be mitigated by changes in sales reported in U.S. dollars at Australian locations. No assurance, however, can be given that the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate will continue to be strongly correlated to the U.S. dollar gold price in the future. Variations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar at Newmont foreign mining operations decreased Costs applicable to sales $7 in Australia and increased Costs applicable to sales $9 in Indonesia in 2006 from 2005 and increased Costs applicable to sales $15 in 2005 from 2004, primarily in Australia. Foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar have not had a material impact on the Company determination of proven and probable reserves in the past. However, if a sustained weakening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Australian dollar, and/or to other foreign currencies that impact the Company cost structure, were not mitigated by offsetting increases in the U.S. dollar gold price or by other factors, the amount of proven and probable reserves in the applicable foreign country could be reduced as certain proven and probable reserves may no longer be economic. The extent of any such reduction would be dependent on a variety of factors including the length of time of any such weakening of the U.S. dollar, and management long-term view of the applicable exchange rate. Future reductions of proven and probable reserves would primarily result in reduced gold or copper sales and increased depreciation, depletion and amortization calculated using the units-of-production method and, depending on the level of reduction, could also result in impairments of property, plant and mine development, mineral interests and/or goodwill. 68 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, ( FIN 48 ) an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 requires that the Company recognize in its financial statements, the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective beginning January 1, 2007 with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings, goodwill, deferred income taxes and income taxes payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48 on the Company consolidated financial position, results of operations and disclosures. In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ( FAS 157 ). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions for FAS 157 are effective for the Company fiscal year beginning January 1, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this statement will have on the Company consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Provided from Operating Activities Net cash provided from continuing operations was $1,237, $1,243 and $1,503 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and was significantly impacted by the following key factors: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Consolidated gold ounces sold (in thousands) (1) 7,361 8,429 8,619 Average price received per ounce of gold (2) $ 599 $ 441 $ 421 Costs applicable to sales per ounce of gold sold (3) $ 304 $ 237 $ 218 Consolidated copper pounds sold (in millions) 435 573 683 Average price received per pound of copper (2) $ 1.99 $ 1.45 $ 1.33 Costs applicable to sales per pound of copper sold (3) $ 0.71 $ 0.53 $ 0.45 (1) Includes incremental start-up ounces of 100,300 and 22,100 in 2006 and 2005, respectively. (2) Before treatment and refining charges. (3) Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization. Net cash provided from continuing operations remained constant in 2006 compared to 2005. Cash flow from continuing operations during 2006 was positively impacted by higher realized gold and copper prices, partially offset by fewer gold ounces and copper pounds sold. Also impacting cash flows from operations during 2006 were higher operating costs as noted in Results of Consolidated Operations , a $110 increase in accounts receivable primarily due to trade receivables at Nevada and a $388 increase in inventories, stockpiles and ore on leach pads. Inventories, stockpiles and ore on leach pads increased due to new operations at Ahafo, Phoenix, and Leeville, increased mining costs, mining rates exceeding processing rates and increased open pit waste removal. Net cash provided from continuing operations was also impacted by the physical delivery of 161,111 ounces of gold under the prepaid forward sales obligation which resulted in the recognition of $48 of non-cash revenue in June 2006. Additionally, net cash provided by continuing operations was impacted by the early settlement of the remaining prepaid forward sales obligation, which resulted in a $40 premium on early extinguishment. Other. Cash provided from operating activities is expected to be negatively impacted in 2007 by the $287 increase in current income and mining taxes payable. Newmont is currently planning to contribute $65 to its 69 Table of Contents retirement benefit programs in 2007 from Net cash provided by operating activities . For additional discussion see Item 7A, Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk, Pension and Other Benefit Plans, below, and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations was $838, $1,093 and $1,388 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, primarily due to Additions to property, plant and mine development, of $1,551, $1,220 and $674 for continuing operations in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and net proceeds from (investments in) marketable debt and equity securities of $721, $57 and $(821) in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Additionally, approximately $6, $31 and $44 was spent on capital expenditures for the discontinued operations of Golden Grove, Holloway and Zarafshan in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Australia/New Zealand capital expenditures primarily included $54 for mine development and reserve definition, $19 for mining equipment previously leased under an operating lease at Kalgoorlie, $10 for facilities and $7 for mobile equipment. Batu Hijau capital expenditures were primarily for mine and plant equipment. Capital expenditures at Ahafo were primarily for the engineering, procurement and construction of the mine and processing facilities. Akyem capital expenditures were for development activities. Corporate expenditures included $33 primarily for improvements in information technology systems. Newmont expects to spend approximately $1,800 to $2,000 on capital expenditures during 2007, with approximately one third in Nevada, one third in Australia/New Zealand and the remaining one third at the other locations. Approximately one half of the capital budget is allocated to sustaining investments and the remaining portion is allocated to new project development and business improvement initiatives. Investments in marketable debt and equity securities, net. The Company had net investing activity of $721, $57 and $(821) related to proceeds from (investments in) the sale of marketable debt and equity investments in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

These shares were sold in the fourth quarter of 2005 for net proceeds of $78. In the first quarter of 2005, Newmont sold approximately 10 million shares of Oxiana for net proceeds of $8. 71 Table of Contents Acquisitions. In September 2006, Newmont acquired a 40% interest in Shore Gold Inc. Fort a la Corne diamond Joint Venture in Saskatchewan, Canada for $152. The Company believes that this investment represents an opportunity to participate directly in a significant, district-scale diamond development project. In March 2006, Newmont acquired Newcrest Mining Limited 22.22% interest in the Boddington project, bringing its interest in the project to 66.67%, for total consideration of $173. Development of the Boddington project in Western Australia with AngloGold Ashanti Limited was also announced in the first quarter 2006. Construction of the Boddington project is expected to cost Newmont approximately $0.9 to $1.0 billion, with initial production expected in late 2008 or early 2009. The project has a current estimated mine life of more than 15 years, with Newmont share of annual production expected to be approximately 700,000 ounces for the first five years and average approximately 600,000 ounces over the life of the project. In January 2006, Newmont acquired the remaining 15% interest in the Akyem project in Ghana, bringing its interest to 100%. In September 2006, the Company deferred further development of the Akyem project pending completion of permitting, resolution of country-wide power shortages and further engineering optimization.

In exchange for the assets, the buyer made installment payments in 2005 totaling $3 and assumed all of the reclamation and closure liabilities. Under the agreement, Newmont is entitled to a 1% net smelter return royalty on all future metal production from the property. During 2004, Newmont entered into an agreement relating to a loan and loan guarantee involving AMC and certain of its subsidiaries. The agreement resulted in the release of Newmont from its guarantee obligation and the release of all previously accrued and contingent liabilities. This transaction resulted in an $11 gain after providing a A$30 ($23) subordinated loan to a subsidiary of QMC. An allowance was provided for 100% of the loan receivable. During 2005, the Company reduced the valuation allowance resulting in a gain of $9. Also impacting cash flows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was the consolidation of Batu Hijau, effective January 1, 2004, which resulted in the recording of approximately $82 of Batu Hijau cash balances. Financing Activities Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities of continuing operations was $(333) in 2006, compared to $39 and $(473) in 2005 and 2004, respectively. 72 Table of Contents Proceeds from debt, net. In July 2006, Yanacocha issued $100 of bonds in the Peruvian capital markets under a $200 bond program approved by the Peruvian securities regulatory authority.

Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.875%. The loan is non-recourse to Newmont. Proceeds received during 2005 were primarily from the issuance of 30-year 5 7 / 8 % Notes for net proceeds of $582 during March 2005. The proceeds were used to fund capital investments, including a 200 megawatt power plant in Nevada, and for general corporate purposes. During 2004, the Company received proceeds from the issuance of debt of $56. Repayment of debt . During 2006, the Company made scheduled cash debt repayments of $111 and a scheduled non-cash debt repayment of $48 in connection with the Prepaid forward sales obligation .

Discontinued Operations Net cash (used in) provided from discontinued operations was $(12) in 2006, compared to $nil and $54 in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash flow used in operations during 2006 was primarily from the loss at Holloway, offset by cash provided by Zarafshan, primarily from the gain on operations before classification to discontinued operations in July 2006. Cash flow from discontinued operations in 2005 was a result of cash provided by Golden Grove and Zarafshan, offset by cash used in discontinued operations of Holloway. 73 Table of Contents Cash flow from discontinued operations in 2004 was a result of the cash provided by Golden Grove, Zarafshan and Holloway. Net cash (used in) provided from investing activities of discontinued operations was $34, $116 and $(44) in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Net cash used in financing activities of discontinued operations was $7, $1 and $2 all from the repayment of debt at Zarafshan. Project Financing On June 30, 2006, Newmont Ghana Gold Limited ( NGGL ), a wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a $125 project financing with the International Finance Corporation ( IFC ). The financing is comprised of a $75 A-loan funded by the IFC; and a $50 B-loan funded by a syndicate of commercial lenders. The financing contains certain Conditions of Disbursement that must be completed prior to funds being made available. NGGL anticipates meeting the Conditions of Disbursement during the first half of 2007. Amounts borrowed under the financing will be collateralized by the assets of the Ahafo project and will be guaranteed by Newmont pending the successful completion of requirements associated with the Project Financial Completion Certificate ( Project Financial Completion ). The loans will require semi-annual payments beginning in April 2007. The A-loan has a final maturity of October 2018 and borrowings will be subject to an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.125% pre-completion, and LIBOR plus 2.00% following Project Financial Completion.

The interest rate on the B-loan then increases to LIBOR plus 1.70% (years 5-7); LIBOR plus 1.90% (years 8-9) and LIBOR plus 2.00% (thereafter). Corporate Revolving Credit Facilities The Company has an uncollateralized $1,250 revolving credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks, which matures in July 2010. The facility contains a letter of credit sub-facility. Interest rates and facility fees vary based on the credit ratings of the Company senior, uncollateralized, long-term debt. Borrowings under the facilities bear interest at an annual interest rate of the greater of LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.22% to 1.00%, the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or the lead bank prime interest rate. Facility fees accrue at an annual rate ranging from 0.080% to 0.250% of the aggregate commitments. The Company also pays a utilization fee of 0.10% on the amount of revolving credit loans and letters of credit outstanding under the facility for each day on which the sum of such loans and letters of credit exceed 50% of the commitments under the facility. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the facility fees were 0.09% of the commitment. There was $321 and $275 outstanding under the letter of credit sub-facility as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Contractual Obligations Newmont contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006 are summarized as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Debt (1) $ 2,934 $ 247 $ 697 $ 254 $ 1,736 Capital lease obligations (1) 328 41 107 99 81 Remediation and reclamation obligations (2 ) 1,137 78 180 78 801 Employee-related benefits (3) 220 98 76 30 16 Operating leases 16 6 8 2 Minimum royalty payments 141 8 17 36 80 Purchase obligations (4) 393 131 158 41 63 Other (5) 553 184 251 113 5 $ 5,722 $ 793 $ 1,494 $ 653 $ 2,782 (1) Amounts represent principal ($1,908) and estimated interest payments ($1,354) assuming no early extinguishment. (2) Mining operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Pursuant to environmental regulations, the Company is required to close its operations and reclaim and remediate the lands that operations have disturbed. The estimated undiscounted cash outflows of these remediation and reclamation obligations are reflected here. For more information regarding remediation and reclamation liabilities, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Contractual obligations for Employee-related benefits include severance, workers participation, pension funding and other benefit plans. Pension plan funding beyond 2011 cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions and actuarial assumptions and are not included. (4) Purchase obligations are not recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations represent contractual obligations for purchase of power, materials and supplies, consumables, inventories and capital projects. (5) Other contractual obligations that are not reflected in the Company Consolidated Financial Statements include labor and service contracts. Payments related to derivative contracts cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 75 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has the following off-balance sheet arrangements: operating leases as disclosed in the above table and $445 of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees (see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). There is also an undrawn contingent sponsor support line of credit to Batu Hijau of $65, of which Newmont pro rata share is $37. Batu Hijau has sales agreements to sell copper concentrates as follows (in millions of pounds) 1,540 in 2007; 1,115 in 2008; 1,411 in 2009; 2,180 in 2010, 1,378 in 2011 and 3,191 thereafter. For information regarding these copper sales agreements, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk-Hedging, Provisional Copper and Gold Sales, below. Future Cash Flows We anticipate that significant capital expenditures in 2007 through 2009 (see Investing Activities, above), funding of the Exploration and Merchant Banking Segments (see Results of Consolidated Operations, above), debt repayments and dividends to both common shareholders and minority interests could lead to Net cash used in investing activities exceeding Net cash provided by operating activities . We expect that any such deficit will be funded through various sources, including Net cash provided by operating activities . Newmont believes that financing required to execute all of these investments will be available over the time period required from Net cash provided by operating activities, cash, marketable equity securities or other sources of funds, including the Company revolving credit facility, project financing and financing alternatives available in the broader capital markets. For information on the Company long-term debt, capital lease obligations and operating leases, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Subject to any significant adverse changes in the Company long-term view of gold and copper prices, the Company has both the ability and intention to fund from Net cash provided by operating activities, the exploration expenditures and investments that were assumed in the goodwill valuations to support the Exploration and Merchant Banking Segments. Net cash provided from operating activities in 2007 are expected to be impacted by the $287 increase in current income and mining taxes payable. Cash flows are expected to be impacted by variations in the realized spot price of gold and copper. The Company has a series of price-capped gold sales contracts under which it will realize the lower of the spot price on the delivery date or the capped price. The Company also has copper collar contracts for 102 million pounds under which it will realize a minimum and maximum price of $1.10 and $1.40 per pound, respectively, in 2007. For information on the sensitivity of Newmont Net cash provided by operating activities to metal prices, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Cash flows are also expected to be impacted by variations in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar, particularly with respect to the Australian dollar. For information concerning the sensitivity of the Company Costs applicable to sales to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, see Results of Consolidated Operations, Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, above. For information on the sensitivity of Newmont Net cash provided to operating activities to foreign currency exchange rates, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Based on Newmont production profile for the next three years and proven and probable reserves as of December 31, 2006, without considering future additions to such reserves, Newmont expects that consolidated gold ounces sold will be between 6.1 and 6.6 million ounces in 2007. The Company does not anticipate that reasonably expected variations in gold or copper sales alone will influence its ability to pay its debt and other obligations over that period. 76 Table of Contents Environmental The Company mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. The Company conducts its operations so as to protect the public health and environment and believes its operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. The Company has made, and expects to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. Estimated future reclamation costs are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, $520 and $428, respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to currently producing mineral properties, of which $67 is classified as current liabilities expected to be spent in 2007. In addition, the Company is involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various sites involved. The Company believes that the related environmental obligations associated with these sites are similar in nature with respect to the development of remediation plans, their risk profile and the compliance required to meet general environmental standards. Based upon the Company best estimate of its liability for these matters, $85 and $77 were accrued for such obligations as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Depending upon the ultimate resolution of these matters, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the liability for these matters could be as much as 89% greater or 27% lower than the amount accrued as of December 31, 2006. The amounts accrued for these matters are reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances available at the time. Changes in estimates are charged to Other expense, net in the period estimates are revised. Newmont spent $12, $14 and $20 in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, for environmental obligations related to former, primarily historic, mining activities, and has classified $10 as a current liability expected to be spent in 2007. Expenditures for 2006, 2005 and 2004 related primarily to legacy Normandy properties in Australia, the McCoy/Cove property in Nevada and the Dawn mill site near Ford, Washington. Included in capital expenditures were $124, $35 and $43 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, to comply with environmental regulations. Ongoing costs to comply with environmental regulations have not been a significant component of Costs applicable to sales . For more information on the Company reclamation and remediation liabilities, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
