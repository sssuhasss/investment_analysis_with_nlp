Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This report contains forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements regarding trends and growth in the markets we sell into, our strategic direction, our future effective tax rate and tax valuation allowance, earnings from our foreign subsidiaries, remediation activities, new product and service introductions, changes to our manufacturing processes, the use of contract manufacturers, the impact of local government regulations on our ability to pay vendors or conduct operations, our liquidity position, our ability to generate cash from continuing operations, growth in our businesses, our investments, the potential impact of adopting new accounting pronouncements, our financial results, our purchase commitments, our contributions to our pension plans, the selection of discount rates and recognition of any gains or losses for our benefit plans, our cost-control activities, savings and headcount reduction recognized from our restructuring programs and the divestiture of our semiconductor products business, the intended spin-off of our SOC and memory test businesses, our stock repurchase program, our transition to lower-cost regions, the existence or length of an economic recovery that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to various factors, including those discussed in "Factors That May Affect Future Results" and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Overview Agilent Technologies, Inc. ("we", "Agilent" or the "company"), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is the world's premier measurement company, providing core bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis industries. Prior to our initial public offering of 16 percent of our stock in November 1999, we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hewlett-Packard Company ("HP"). HP distributed the remaining 84 percent of our stock to its stockholders on June 2, 2000 in the form of a stock dividend. Our fiscal year end is October 31. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year. Restatement of 2004 Financial Statements We have restated our historical consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2004, quarterly financial data for the fourth quarter ended October 31, 2004, and selected financial data for fiscal 2004 (the "Restatement"). The determination to restate these consolidated financial statements and selected financial data was made by our management in consultation with the Audit & Finance Committee on January 13, 2006, as a result of our identification of an error related to the accounting for income taxes. During the October 31, 2004 year-end close process, the Company miscalculated and understated its estimate of U.S. jurisdictional loss. By correcting the error and revising the estimate of U.S. loss, this resulted in the recognition of additional tax benefit associated with the loss and a corresponding additional income tax expense associated with Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS No. 109"). This error was identified through the operation of our internal control over financial reporting in 2005. The Restatement decreases our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2004 by $20 million and increases net income by $20 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. All amounts relating to 2004 income taxes, discontinued operations and net income results on a consolidated basis discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have been presented on a restated basis. See Note 1A, "Restatement of 2004 Consolidated Financial Statements", to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the effect of the 37 restatement on 2004 amounts. The restatement had no effect on our segments' results of operations discussed herein. Reclassifications Amounts in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended October 31, 2004 and October 31, 2003 have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used in 2005. See Note 4, "Discontinued Operations", to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the reclassification of financial information for discontinued operations. See also Note 5, "Tax Valuation Allowance and Provision (Benefit) for Taxes", to our consolidated financial statements for revised classification for income taxes and Note 22, "Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliate (including Gain) Lumileds" to our consolidated financial statements for reclassification of equity in net income. Executive Summary Agilent is the world's premier measurement company providing core bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis industries. Agilent currently has three primary businesses: bio-analytical measurement, electronic measurement and semiconductor test solutions. In August 2005, the Board of Directors of Agilent approved the divestiture of our semiconductor products business. We subsequently signed an Asset Purchase Agreement with Avago Technologies Ltd. (f/k/a Argos Acquisition Pte. Ltd.) ("Avago") providing for the sale of our semiconductor products business for approximately $2.66 billion. We have reflected the semiconductor products business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In December 2005, we completed the sale of our semiconductor products business to Avago. In addition, we plan to spin off our semiconductor test solutions business in 2006. Agilent's total net revenue for the fiscal year ended 2005 was $5.1 billion, flat in comparison to last year. In our bio-analytical business, fiscal year 2005 net revenue increased 7 percent compared to fiscal year 2004. We have experienced some growth from mid-size pharmaceutical companies and some growth from generic pharmaceutical companies on a worldwide basis. In our electronic measurement business, overall demand increased in communications test solutions, with both wireless test and wireline communication test slightly above last year. In 2005, net revenue for our semiconductor test solutions business declined 25 percent year-over-year. Agilent's total net revenue in the fiscal year ended 2004 increased 15 percent in comparison to 2003. Income from operations for the fiscal year ended 2005 was $181 million, an increase of 25 percent from $145 million in the fiscal year ended 2004 and an increase of $901 million in comparison to the fiscal year ended 2003. Net income for the fiscal year ended 2005 was $327 million, a decrease of 11 percent compared to $369 million for the fiscal year ended 2004. The decrease in net income was driven by a $48 million tax charge for the fiscal year ended 2005, associated with repatriating $970 million of offshore earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act ("AJCA"). In the fiscal year ended 2003, we reported a net loss of $2.1 billion, mainly attributable to a valuation allowance charge for taxes of $1.1 billion. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005, we generated operating cash flow of $643 million, and had a cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment balance as of October 31, 2005 of $2.3 billion. In September 2005, we completed a full redemption of $1.15 billion of our outstanding convertible debentures with a redemption price of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount of the debentures, plus accrued interest. 38 In August 2005 and November 2005, we announced a series of actions intended to enhance our focus as the world's premier measurement company and enhance value for our shareholders. See Note 24, "Subsequent Events", to our consolidated financial statements for further information. The following significant events were initiated or occurred prior to the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K: In November 2005, we finalized the sale of our investment in Lumileds to Philips for $949 million plus the repayment of $51 million of the outstanding principal debt plus accrued interest due to us from Lumileds. In December 2005, we sold our semiconductor products business to Avago. We received $2.6 billion in proceeds, subject to further purchase price adjustments. During the fourth quarter 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $4.466 billion of our common stock. To date, we have repurchased approximately 92 million shares for $3.3 billion leaving approximately $1.2 billion remaining authorized under the stock repurchase program, which involved the repurchase of 83 million shares of our common stock pursuant to an issuer self-tender announced in November 2005. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we initiated plans to reduce our infrastructure costs by more than $450 million and infrastructure-related employment by about 1,300 jobs. Looking forward, we expect our growth to increase at the same pace as the electronic measurement and bio-analytical measurement markets. We intend to further reduce our costs and expenses to meet our operating cost structure goals. In addition, we plan to spin off our semiconductor test solutions business as soon as practical in 2006. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, restructuring and asset impairment charges, inventory valuation, investment impairments, stock-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, valuation of long-lived assets and accounting for income taxes. Revenue recognition. We enter into agreements to sell products (hardware or software), services, and other arrangements (multiple element arrangements) that include combinations of products and services. Revenue from product sales, net of trade discounts and allowances, is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. Revenue is reduced for estimated product returns, when appropriate. For sales that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete. Otherwise, neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete. Revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period 39 or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. When arrangements include multiple elements, we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element. The amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value exists for those elements. Changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish vendor-specific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition. Most of these conditions are subjective and actual results could vary from the estimated outcome, requiring future adjustments to revenue. Restructuring and asset impairment charges. The three main components of our restructuring plans are related to workforce reductions, the consolidation of excess facilities and asset impairments. Workforce reduction charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability has been incurred, which is generally after individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments. Plans to consolidate excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees and future commitments to pay lease charges, net of estimated future sublease income. We recognize charges for consolidation of excess facilities when we have vacated the premises. Asset impairments primarily consist of property, plant and equipment and are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and equipment. These estimates were derived using the guidance of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS No. 144"), Staff Accounting Bulletin 100, "Restructuring and Impairment Charges" ("SAB 100"), Emerging Issues Task Force 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)" ("EITF 94-3") and lastly, SFAS No. 146 "Accounting for Exit or Disposal Activities" ("SFAS No. 146") which was effective for exit and disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. If the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated, the actual amount of restructuring and asset impairment charges could be materially different, either higher or lower, than those we have recorded. Inventory valuation. We assess the valuation of our inventory on a quarterly basis and periodically write down the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage. Such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our marketing department plays a key role in our excess inventory review process by providing updated sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period. Investment impairments. We recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair value of our publicly traded equity securities and our cost-method investments below their cost basis are judged to be other-than-temporary. Significant judgment is used to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future use of the investment. We consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, including the severity and duration of the impairment, forecasted recovery, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. Stock-based compensation. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004) "Share-Based 40 Payment" ("SFAS No. 123(R)"). SFAS No. 123(R) addresses all forms of share-based payment ("SBP") awards, including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes our current accounting for SBP awards under APB No. 25 and requires us to recognize compensation expense for all SBP awards based on fair value. In March 2005, the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, "Share-Based Payment" ("SAB No. 107") relating to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). Beginning in the first quarter of 2006, we will adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) under the modified prospective transition method using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Under the new standard, our estimate of compensation expense will require a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility, employee exercise patterns (expected life of the options), future forfeitures and related tax effects. We will recognize SBP compensation expense for awards issued after November 1, 2005 on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award. For awards issued prior to November 1, 2005, we will recognize SBP compensation expense based on FASB Interpretation 28 "Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans an interpretation of APB Opinions No. 15 and 25", which provides for accelerated expensing. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of SFAS No. 123(R) on our results of operations and financial condition. Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions. Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. They represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service to Agilent based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by us. To estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Other important assumptions include the health care cost trend rate, expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover and retiree mortality rates. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. The discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date October 31 for U.S. plans and September 30 for non-U.S plans. The discount rate for U.S. plans was determined based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds. The discount rate for non-U.S. plans was generally determined in a similar manner. Differences between the expected future cash flows of our plans and the maturities of the high quality corporate bonds are not expected to have a material impact on the selection of discount rates. In recent years, decreasing interest rates, particularly outside the U.S., have increased our benefit obligations and our net plan costs. These increases have been in large part offset by a declining number of plan participants as a result of our various restructuring programs. The entire impact of declining discount rates is not recognized immediately under current accounting standards. As of October 31, 2005, delayed recognition of the impact of declining discount rates was the primary factor in approximately $390 million in unrecognized actuarial losses for non-U.S. plans. These losses are being recognized over the expected average future service lives of plan participants ranging from 12 to 18 years depending on the plan. The expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns. Our estimate of expected long-term rates of return has declined in recent years. Declining rate of return assumptions generally result in increased pension expense. This trend has been offset by the impact of company contributions to the plans and growth in plan assets resulting in increased expected returns on plan assets in 2003 through 2005. As of October 31, 2005, delayed recognition of better than expected investment experience was a significant factor in $30 million of unrecognized actuarial gains for U.S. plans. These gains will be 41 recognized over approximately 12 years or the expected average future service life for U.S. plan participants. A one percent change in the estimated long-term return on plan assets for 2006 would result in a $6 million impact on U.S. pension expense and a $13 million impact on non-U.S. pension expense. We expect reduced pension and post-retirement expense in 2006 due to the sale of our semiconductor products business and further restructuring. These events individually or in the aggregate may trigger plan curtailments or settlements under SFAS No. 88, Employers' Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits . We can not currently estimate this impact. Valuation of long-lived assets. We performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2005. Based on our estimates of forecasted discounted cash flows and our market capitalization at that time, we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired. We have also assessed the recoverability of our long-lived assets, by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows. We incurred $26 million of investment and restructuring asset impairment charges in 2005. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangibles is highly subjective and requires significant judgment. We estimate expected future cash flows of our various businesses, which operate in a number of markets and geographical regions. We then determine the carrying value of these businesses. We exercise judgment in assigning and allocating certain assets and liabilities to these businesses. We then compare the carrying value including goodwill and other intangibles to the discounted future cash flows. If the total of future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Estimates of the future cash flows associated with the assets are critical to these assessments. Changes in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods. We performed the required transitional impairment test upon our adoption of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", in the first quarter of 2003 and recorded a $268 million charge related to goodwill. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of long-lived assets such as our property, plant and equipment is also highly subjective and requires significant judgment. In order to estimate the fair value of long-lived assets, we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to, consider market factors specific to that business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as the real estate market, industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. Accounting for income taxes. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. When it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized. Realization is based on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income. During the third quarter of 2003, we recorded a non-cash charge to establish a valuation allowance of $1.4 billion, which included approximately $0.4 billion of tax benefits recorded during the first six months of 2003. This left an 42 approximately $1.0 billion net tax provision recorded within provision for taxes for 2003. The valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109 which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. Cumulative losses incurred in the U.S. and selected entities in other foreign jurisdictions in recent years represented sufficient negative evidence, which made it difficult for positive evidence to overcome under SFAS No. 109. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance was recorded in certain entities of those selected jurisdictions. We intend to maintain a full valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance. Profits or losses incurred in the U.S. and selected entities in other jurisdictions affect the ongoing amount of the valuation allowance. We expect that pre-tax income in fiscal 2006 will be recognized at a lower rate because future income taxes in the U.S. and entities in other jurisdictions will be offset against adjustments to the valuation allowance to effectively eliminate any tax expense or benefit in those jurisdictions. Income taxes will continue to be recorded for various jurisdictions subject to the need for valuation allowances in those jurisdictions. We have not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the cumulative amount of which is approximately $355 million as of October 31, 2005, because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely. Should we decide to remit this income to the U.S. in a future period, our provision for income taxes may increase materially in that period. We are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Restructuring and Asset Impairment Restructuring plans initiated in 2001, 2002 and 2003 ("Prior Plans") are substantially complete. In 2005, we initiated a new restructuring plan ("FY05 Plan"). With the FY05 Plan, we intend to reduce infrastructure-related employment by about 1,300 jobs and reduce our annual infrastructure costs by more than $450 million, with approximately $250 million savings from job elimination and transfer to lower cost regions, approximately $100 million savings from consolidations of facilities and $100 million reduced information technology ("IT") spending. Of the 1,300 infrastructure-related jobs, approximately 600 employees have been notified as of October 31, 2005 and we expect another 700 employees will be notified in the fiscal year 2006. The FY05 Plan also extends to job reductions within our business segments of approximately 900 people all of whom were notified as of October 31, 2005. These reductions will be concentrated in the semiconductor test solutions and electronic measurement businesses, with semiconductor test solutions reductions focused in the U.S., Germany and Japan, and electronic measurement reductions focused in the U.S. and the U.K. As of October 31, 2005, we have reduced our workforce by approximately 16,900 people (approximately 16,300 people from Prior Plans and approximately 600 people from the FY05 Plan) to approximately 21,000 employees, excluding our former semiconductor products business employees. We recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of $123 million, $161 million and $372 million for the fiscal years ended 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our accrual for future restructuring expenses totaled $93 million as of October 31, 2005, and it encompasses the FY05 Plan and our remaining liability for consolidation of excess facilities from Prior Plans. Our plans to consolidate excess facilities resulted in charges of $10 million in 2005 for lease termination fees and losses anticipated from sub-lease agreements related to Prior Plans. Similar charges in 2004 and 2003 were $35 million and $37 million, respectively. We will continue to make lease payments on some of this excess facility space over the next five years. 43 The restructuring accrual is recorded in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. For further details on our restructuring plans, see Note 14, "Restructuring and Asset Impairment", to our consolidated financial statements. Foreign Currency Our revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. We hedge net cash flow and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis. We do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet as our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. However, movements in exchange rates net of our hedging activities had no material effect on our net income (loss) in the periods presented. Indemnifications Indemnifications to Hewlett-Packard We have given multiple indemnities to Hewlett-Packard ("HP") in connection with our activities prior to our spin-off from HP for the businesses that constituted Agilent prior to the spin-off. These indemnifications cover a variety of aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, employee, tax, intellectual property and environmental matters. The agreements containing these indemnifications have been previously disclosed as exhibits to our registration statement on Form S-1 filed on August 16, 1999. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnifications is not material. Indemnifications to Officers and Directors Our corporate by-laws require that we indemnify our officers and directors, as well as those who act as directors and officers of other entities at our request, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceedings arising out of their services to Agilent. In addition, we have entered into separate indemnification agreements with each director and each board-appointed officer of Agilent which provide for indemnification of these directors and officers under similar circumstances and under additional circumstances. The indemnification obligations are more fully described in the by-laws and the indemnification agreements. We purchase insurance to cover claims or a portion of the claims made against our directors and officers. Since a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in our by-laws or in our indemnification agreements and will depend on the facts and circumstances that arise out of any future claims, the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made payments related to these obligations, and the fair value for these obligations is zero on the consolidated balance sheet as of October 31, 2005. Indemnifications to Avago In connection with the sale of our semiconductor products business in December 2005, we agreed to indemnify Avago, its affiliates and other related parties for certain liabilities that were excluded from the sale such as pre-closing taxes and other specified items. Other Indemnifications As is customary in our industry and as provided for in local law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, many of our standard contracts provide remedies to our customers and others with whom we enter into contracts, such as defense, settlement, or payment of judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use of our products. From time to time, we indemnify customers, as well as our suppliers, contractors, lessors, lessees, companies that purchase our businesses or assets and others with whom 44 we enter into contracts, against combinations of loss, expense, or liability arising from various triggering events related to the sale and the use of our products and services, the use of their goods and services, the use of facilities and state of our owned facilities, the state of the assets and businesses that we sell and other matters covered by such contracts, usually up to a specified maximum amount. In addition, from time to time we also provide protection to these parties against claims related to undiscovered liabilities, additional product liability or environmental obligations. In our experience, claims made under such indemnifications are rare and the associated estimated fair value of the liability is not material. Results from Continuing Operations For the fiscal year ended 2005, income from continuing operations was $141 million, an increase of $14 million from $127 million in 2004 and almost a $2 billon improvement from the $1,777 million loss incurred in 2003. The increase of $14 million in 2005 was primarily due to tighter cost controls. The increase in income from 2003 to 2004 of approximately $1,904 million was primarily due to approximately a $1 billion tax charge in 2003 relating to the establishment of a valuation allowance in the U.S. and the U.K. Also contributing to 2004's improved performance over 2003 was growth in revenue of $692 million, improvement in gross margin of 6 percentage points, and a decline in operating expenses of $263 million year-over-year. Agilent saw a 1 percentage point improvement in its operating margin in 2005 compared to 2004, despite a revenue decrease of $21 million. This was due to controls over our operating expenses, the continued move of manufacturing capacity to lower cost regions, and restructuring savings.

We experienced good growth in wireline communications test and solid demand in our bio-analytical business. Orders in 2004 were up by 13 percent compared to 2003, with all businesses growing except semiconductor test solutions, which saw a 19 percent decrease over the prior year, primarily caused by our customers' excess capacity and excess inventory that had built up over the second half. 45 Net revenue in 2005 was flat compared to 2004. Growth in the bio-analytical and electronic measurement businesses was offset by a cyclical softness that affected our semiconductor test solutions business in the first half of 2005. Net revenue in 2004 increased by 15 percent over 2003. All of our businesses experienced an increase in revenue in 2004. Services and other includes revenue generated from servicing our installed base of products, warranty extensions and consulting. In 2005 and 2004, services and other revenue increased over the prior year as our installed base of products increased and a change in standard warranty from three years to one year drove a higher volume of extended warranty business. Costs and Expenses Years Ended October 31, 2005 over 2004 Change 2004 over 2003 Change 2005 2004 2003 Gross margin on products 52 % 50 % 43 % 2 ppts 7 ppts Gross margin on services and other 37 % 35 % 33 % 2 ppts 2 ppts Total gross margin 49 % 47 % 41 % 2 ppts 6 ppts Operating margin 4 % 3 % (16 )% 1 ppt 19 ppts Research and development $ 738 $ 689 $ 771 7% (11)% Selling, general and administrative $ 1,603 $ 1,603 $ 1,784 (10)% The following tables present the gross inventory charges and sales of previously reserved inventory, respectively: Gross Inventory Charges Years Ended October 31, 2005 2004 2003 Bio-analytical measurement $ 4 $ 3 $ 3 Electronic measurement 40 13 12 Semiconductor test solutions 25 3 2 Unallocated charges and other (1) 15 Total $ 84 $ 19 $ 17 Sales of Previously Reserved Inventory Years Ended October 31, 2005 2004 2003 Bio-analytical measurement $ 1 $ 3 $ Electronic measurement 7 9 5 Semiconductor test solutions 7 1 7 Total $ 15 $ 13 $ 12 (1) Unallocated charges primarily relate to inventory write-downs for exited product lines, which management has not reflected in segment results. 46 Total gross margin increased 2 percentage points from 2004 to 2005. This improvement was the result of restructuring activities, material cost reductions and overall operational improvements, including mix improvements. Total gross margin increased 6 percentage points from 2003 to 2004. Gross margin on both product and service increased 2 percentage points in 2005 compared to 2004. This is a reflection of our continued work on lowering our cost structure. We expect to continue to experience the benefits of a more variable cost structure through use of contract manufacturers. In addition, we will continue to reduce our own manufacturing costs by shifting production to lower-cost regions. In 2004, gross margin on services and other increased 2 percentage points, and gross margin on products increased 7 percentage points over 2003, as a reflection of lower cost structure, principally through our restructuring programs. Operating margin increased 1 percentage point in 2005 compared to 2004, slightly lagging the improvement achieved in gross margin, due to increased research and development expense. In 2004 operating margin increased 19 percentage points compared to 2003. This was primarily due to savings from our restructuring efforts and a $128 million decrease in restructuring costs for research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses in 2004 compared to 2003. Our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies in communications, electronics and bio-analytical measurement, none of which is individually significant to our operations. This research and development is aimed at improving the more than 20,000 products already in production and on new product releases. Because of the large number of new and existing products and research and development projects across all of our businesses and at Agilent Laboratories, it is difficult to quantify the impact of any specific products or projects. We are committed to bringing new products to the market and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities in order to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share. Income from operations in 2005 was $181 million, an increase of approximately $36 million compared to 2004. The increase was primarily driven by a $60 million decrease in costs and expenses due to the incremental benefits of our restructuring programs and discretionary spending controls. Income from operations in 2004 was $145 million, an increase of approximately $865 million from 2003. The increase was primarily due to a revenue increase of $692 million, combined with a $159 million reduction in restructuring charges in 2004 compared to 2003. At October 31, 2005, our headcount, on a continuing operations basis, was approximately 20,750 compared to 21,200 in 2004 and 22,000 in 2003. Other Income (Expense), Net Years Ended October 31, 2005 over 2004 % Change 2004 over 2003 % Change 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Interest income $ 72 $ 27 $ 26 167 % 4 % Interest expense (27 ) (36 ) (36 ) 25 % Other income (expense), net 28 33 34 15 % (3 )% Total other income (expense), net $ 73 $ 24 $ 24 204 % As discussed in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies", to our consolidated financial statements, in 2005, we reclassified our equity earnings (and gain in 2005) from our Lumileds 47 joint venture from other income/(expense), net to a new caption below the provision for income taxes. See Note 22, "Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliate (including Gain) Lumileds", to our consolidated financial statements. Prior periods' amounts have also been reclassified. Other income (expense), net generally includes interest income, interest expense, rental income, currency gain (loss) on balance sheet remeasurement and other miscellaneous items. Other income (expense), net increased by $49 million in 2005 compared to 2004 due primarily to an increase in interest income of $45 million derived principally from the investment of our increased surplus cash balances in bank time deposits and other money market instruments and higher interest rates. Other income (expense), net remained flat from 2003 to 2004. Provision for Income Taxes from Continuing Operations Years Ended October 31, 2005 2004 2003 (Restated) (in millions) Provision for income taxes $ 155 $ 71 $ 1,090 We have restated our historical consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2004, quarterly financial data for the fourth quarter ended October 31, 2004, and selected financial data for fiscal 2004 (the "Restatement"). The determination to restate these consolidated financial statements and selected financial data was made by our management in consultation with the Audit & Finance Committee on January 13, 2006, as a result of our identification of an error related to the accounting for income taxes. During the October 31, 2004 year-end close process, the Company miscalculated and understated its estimate of U.S. jurisdictional loss. By correcting the error and revising the estimate of U.S. loss, this resulted in the recognition of additional tax benefit associated with the loss and a corresponding additional income tax expense associated with Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income pursuant to SFAS No. 109. This error was identified through the operation of our internal control over financial reporting in 2005. The Restatement decreases our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2004 by $20 million and increases net income by $20 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ("AJCA") was signed into law. The AJCA creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we distributed cash from our foreign subsidiaries and will report an extraordinary dividend (as defined in the AJCA) of $970 million and a related tax liability of approximately $48 million in our fiscal 2005 federal income tax return. For fiscal 2005, $23 million of the $48 million is provided for in the discontinued operations' provision for income taxes, while the remaining is provided for in the continuing operations' provision for income taxes. 48 For the year ended October 31, 2005, we recorded an income tax provision of $155 million on continuing operations as compared with an income tax provision of $71 million and $1,090 million on continuing operations for the years ended October 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The current year-to-date provision was recorded for taxes on income generated in jurisdictions other than the U.S. and other jurisdictions for which we have a valuation allowance. During the third quarter of 2003, we recorded a non-cash charge to establish a valuation allowance of $1.4 billion which included approximately $0.4 billion of tax benefits recorded during the first six months of 2003, resulting in an approximate $1.0 billion net deferred tax provision recorded within provision for taxes for 2003. The valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109 which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable; such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. Cumulative losses incurred in the U.S and entities in other jurisdictions in recent years represented sufficient negative evidence under SFAS No. 109 to require a full valuation allowance in these jurisdictions. We intend to maintain a full valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowance. For 2005, the annual effective tax rate was 52.3 percent on continuing operations. The 52.3 percent continuing operations tax rate reflects taxes in jurisdictions other than the U.S. and entities in other jurisdictions in which income tax or benefit continues to be offset by adjustments to the valuation allowance. The tax rate for continuing operations does not include the impact of income from low-tax jurisdictions generated by our semiconductor products business which is now reported within discontinued operations. Additionally, the AJCA repatriation tax caused an 8.1 percent increase in the 2005 effective tax rate as during 2005 we decided to repatriate earnings on which we had not previously provided for U.S taxes. From time to time the company undertakes certain employment, capital and other investment actions that subject the company's income to reduced tax rates. The annual effective tax rate may change over time as the amount or mix of income and taxes changes. Our effective tax rate is calculated using our projected annual pre-tax income or loss and is affected by research and development tax credits, the expected level of other tax benefits, the effects of business acquisitions and dispositions, the impact of changes to the valuation allowance, changes in other comprehensive income, as well as changes in the mix of income and losses outside the U.S. and entities in other jurisdictions having varying statutory rates. For 2004, the annual effective tax rate was 35.9 percent on continuing operations, and was benefited by a valuation allowance release of $37 million. For 2003, the annual effective tax rate was 158.6 percent on continuing operations due primarily to the charge for the valuation allowance. Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliate (Including Gain) Lumileds Lumileds is a global joint venture between Agilent and Philips. Lumileds manufactures high-power light emitting diodes and solid-state lighting solutions. Agilent's ownership interest in Lumileds was approximately 47 percent as of October 31, 2005. Our equity in the net income of our unconsolidated affiliate for the three years ended October 31, 2005 was $34 million, $29 million and $9 million. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2005, we sold 1 percent of our interest in Lumileds to Philips for a gain of $8 million. Agilent sold its interest in Lumileds on November 28, 2005, see Note 24, "Subsequent Events", to our consolidated financial statements. General Infrastructure and Shared Services For Agilent overall, we have decreased our infrastructure costs primarily through restructuring programs and cost controls. We have reduced the number of employees in our workforce that provide support services such as finance, IT and workplace services and moved some of our global shared services operations sites to lower cost regions. Compared to 2004, incremental savings for infrastructure costs for 2005 associated with restructuring plans, IT data center and networking costs, 49 IT project investments and cost controls were approximately $20 million. We passed through these savings to all our businesses according to usage of related services. The general infrastructure and shared services functions ended 2005 with approximately 3,910 employees, a decrease of approximately 140 employees from one year ago and a decrease of approximately 370 employees from two years ago. Over the past two years, general infrastructure and shared services headcount has dropped approximately 570 in the U.S. and Europe but has grown approximately 210 in Asia, primarily in India. We expect to continue to reduce infrastructure costs, currently reported in continuing operations, as we divest our semiconductor products business and spin-off our semiconductor test solutions business. Approximately 200 general infrastructure and shared services employees will be moving to our divested semiconductor products business in 2006. Segment Overview Agilent is the world's premier measurement company providing core bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis industries. We have three primary businesses: electronic measurement, bio-analytical measurement, and semiconductor test solutions. In addition to the discussion below, also see Note 23, "Segment Information", to our consolidated financial statements. Electronic Measurement Our electronic measurement business provides standard and customized solutions that are used in the design, development, manufacture, installation, deployment and operation of electronic equipment and systems and communications networks and services. Orders and Net Revenue Years Ended October 31, 2005 over 2004 Change 2004 over 2003 Change 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Orders $ 3,282 $ 3,180 $ 2,631 3 % 21 % Net revenue from products $ 2,758 $ 2,752 $ 2,291 20 % Net revenue from services and other 507 473 455 7 % 4 % Total net revenue $ 3,265 $ 3,225 $ 2,746 1 % 17 % Compared to 2004, electronic measurement experienced a 3 percent increase in orders. While our wireless communications test orders grew only slightly from last year, we experienced significant growth in our wireline communications test. General purpose test orders remained flat year-over-year. The 21 percent increase in orders in 2004 compared to 2003 was related to strong aerospace defense business, growth in the communications test market for consumer electronics (DVD players, LCD TVs, cell phones) and expansion of the Asian handset manufacturing capacity. Electronic measurement revenues were up 1 percent year-over-year in 2005. Communications test makes up approximately 60 percent of the electronic measurement revenues, and wireless test makes up approximately 85 percent of communications test. The communication test revenues were up 2 percent year-over-year, with a 1 percent year-over-year increase in wireline test and a 2 percent year-over-year increase in wireless test. This was mainly due to the strength of our signal analyzers and signal generator-related products, telecom service provider network integration and next-generation IP services. General purpose test revenues were flat year-over-year. In 2004 segment revenues increased 17 percent compared to 2003, largely due to the expansion of cell phone handset production in Asia. 50 Looking forward to 2006, we anticipate moderate revenue growth to be driven by opportunities tied to the universal adoption of 3G, broadband access proliferation and our recent oscilloscope market share gains. Gross Margin and Operating Margin The following table shows the electronic measurement business's margins, expenses and income from operations for 2005 versus 2004 and 2004 versus 2003. Years Ended October 31, 2005 over 2004 Change 2004 over 2003 Change 2005 2004 2003 Total gross margin 53 % 51 % 43 % 2 ppts 8 ppts Operating margin 11 % 9 % (12 )% 2 ppts 21 ppts Research and development $ 450 $ 426 $ 493 6% (14)% Selling, general and administrative $ 926 $ 940 $ 1,032 (1)% (9)% Income (loss) from operations $ 360 $ 279 $ (336 ) 29% 183% Over the past three years, we have implemented cost reduction and restructuring plans to help lower our cost structure. Our electronic measurement business ended 2005 with approximately 11,460 employees, a decrease of approximately 430 employees from one year ago and 1,200 employees from two years ago. Gross margin for products and services increased 2 percentage points year-over-year in 2005. This improvement was driven by restructuring activities, material cost reductions and overall operational improvements, and was achieved despite a $27 million increase in inventory charges in 2005. Gross margin for products and services increased 8 percentage points in 2004 compared to 2003. Operating margin increased 2 percentage points in 2005 compared to 2004, with research and development expenses increasing slightly and selling, general and administrative expenses decreasing slightly due to savings from restructuring activities and discretionary spending controls. In 2004, operating margin increased 21 percentage points compared to 2003, with operational expenses decreasing by $159 million as a result of restructuring savings and expense reduction. Income from Operations Income from operations increased in 2005 by $81 million compared to 2004 on a revenue increase of $40 million. Restructuring through workforce reductions, reduction in our cost structure and discretionary spending controls helped comparative operating results. The $615 million improvement in income from operations in 2004 compared to 2003 was achieved through strong revenue growth in combination with an 8 percentage point improvement in gross margins and a $159 million reduction in research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses. Bio-analytical Measurement Our bio-analytical measurement business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments, software, consumables and services that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products. Our seven key product categories include: microarrays, microfluidics, gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, software and informatics, and related consumables, reagents and services. The business achieved solid growth in 2005, with orders and revenue growing by 12 percent and 7 percent, respectively, compared to 2004, and operating income up 6 percent. All seven key product categories contributed to the overall growth of the bio-analytical measurement segment. 51 Orders and Net Revenue Years Ended October 31, 2005 over 2004 Change 2004 over 2003 Change 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Orders $ 1,491 $ 1,332 $ 1,174 12 % 13 % Net revenue from products $ 1,096 $ 1,034 $ 915 6 % 13 % Net revenue from services and other 325 299 271 9 % 10 % Total net revenue $ 1,421 $ 1,333 $ 1,186 7 % 12 % Bio-analytical measurement business orders and revenue continued to grow, achieving record levels in 2005. Growth was achieved in all geographies, with the highest rates achieved in Asia and Europe. In both 2004 and 2005, growth over the prior year was driven by demand for replacement instrument systems and consumables in our large installed base in the U.S. and Europe, increased U.S. government spending for homeland security, spending related to environmental testing in Asia, and increased demand from generic drug manufacturers. Looking forward to 2006, we anticipate order and revenue to grow from 2005 levels, with strength across both our life science and chemical analysis businesses. We anticipate growth to be driven by new products such as rapid resolution liquid chromatography, single quadrupole MS for LC detection, LCMS triple quadrupole ("QQQ"), and LCMS quadrupole time-of-flight ("QTOF"). Gross Margin and Operating Margin The following table shows the bio-analytical measurement business's margins, expenses and income from operations for 2005 versus 2004, and 2004 versus 2003. Years Ended October 31, 2005 over 2004 Change 2004 over 2003 Change 2005 2004 2003 Total gross margin 50 % 48 % 48 % 2 ppts Operating margin 14 % 14 % 12 % 2 ppts Research and development $ 136 $ 117 $ 112 16% 4% Selling, general and administrative $ 377 $ 342 $ 318 10% 8% Income from operations $ 197 $ 186 $ 141 6% 32% Gross margin from products and services increased 2 percentage points compared to same period last year as a result of revenue growth, improved microarray production processes and increased efficiencies in support delivery. Looking forward, we expect to continue this trend in 2006. Operating margin remained flat compared to the same period last year as we invested heavily in research and development and had small headcount increases within selling, general and administrative to accommodate growth. Income from Operations Income from operations increased 6 percent in 2005 compared to 2004 due to increased revenue. Operating margin remained flat in 2005 compared to 2004, at 14 percent. Excluding the impact of acquisitions in 2005, operating margin increased 1 percentage point compared to 2004. 52 Semiconductor Test Solutions Our semiconductor test solutions business provides test solutions that are used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices. These solutions are complemented by consulting, service and support offerings such as start-up assistance, application services and system calibration and repair. Our semiconductor test solutions enable designers and manufacturers to shorten the design-to-production cycle, lower manufacturing cost of test, confirm the functional quality of their devices and of their manufacturing processes, and accelerate the high-volume delivery of their products. As previously announced, we plan to spin off our semiconductor test solutions business during 2006. Orders and Net Revenue Years Ended October 31, 2005 over 2004 Change 2004 over 2003 Change 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Orders $ 522 $ 507 $ 627 3 % (19 )% Net revenue from products $ 353 $ 495 $ 448 (29 )% 10 % Net revenue from services and other 100 107 90 (7 )% 19 % Total net revenue $ 453 $ 602 $ 538 (25 )% 12 % We believe that the semiconductor test market has passed the bottom of a downturn that began in the third quarter of 2004 and continued into the first half of 2005. Throughout the second half of 2005, the semiconductor test market exhibited a recovery driven by increased demand for flash memory used in cellular phones, cameras, portable music players and other electronic devices, in addition to strong demand for non-memory chips in end-markets such as wireless handsets, other consumer electronics and personal computers. This helped orders increase by 3 percent in 2005 compared to 2004. In 2004, orders decreased 19 percent compared to 2003 primarily due to a weak second half caused by excess customer inventory and delayed customer purchases in anticipation of our next generation flash memory and SOC test systems. In second half of 2005, we have seen increased sales of our new Pin Scale systems, introduced in late 2004 as our next generation SOC test system. This system allows customers to reduce their infrastructure costs and offers new test capabilities at higher testing speeds. The acceptance attests to the benefits of our single platform strategy and to the ease of migration for customers. This includes an expanding presence in very cost sensitive digital consumer applications, including many systems for MP3, Digital TV and DVD parts. Because of the flexibility and scalability of the Pin Scale platform, we are now addressing entirely new markets, from cost-sensitive digital consumer applications to High Speed Memory test. Pin Scale products comprised approximately 40 percent of the business in 2005, and are expected to rise in 2006 if demand in end markets continues to be strong in the upcoming year. Memory test systems, which represents approximately 27 percent of our semiconductor test business, were driven throughout 2005 by strength in consumer products such as cell phones, cameras and MP3 players. Large Independent Device Manufacturers ("IDMs") drove the majority of the business for memory testing equipment as a result of the overall increase in Not And (NAND) flash memory demand, with the remainder coming from smaller independent test houses. Total net revenue in 2005 decreased 25 percent compared to 2004 primarily due to severe weakness across our product portfolio in the first half of 2005. Total net revenue in 2004 increased 12 percent compared to 2003 due to SOC test market strength, but this was partially offset by weakness 53 in flash memory test. Services and other revenue decreased 7 percent in 2005 compared to 2004 and increased 19 percent in 2004 compared to 2003. It includes the sale of support for hardware and software, servicing our installed base and the sale of services such as training, application development and test consulting for new installations. Services and other revenue tends to show lower volatility than hardware revenue since services are provided over one year or more. Looking forward to fiscal year 2006, we are optimistic about revenue growth. Gross Margin and Operating Margin The following table shows the semiconductor test business's margins, expenses and income from operations for 2005 versus 2004 and 2004 versus 2003. Years Ended October 31, 2005 over 2004 Change 2004 over 2003 Change 2005 2004 2003 Total gross margin 31 % 42 % 44 % (11) ppts (2) ppt Operating (deficit) margin (20 )% 2 % (1 )% (22) ppts 3 ppts Research and development $ 101 $ 104 $ 98 (3)% 6% Selling, general and administrative $ 131 $ 136 $ 145 (4)% (6)% (Loss) income from operations $ (91 ) $ 12 $ (6 ) (858)% 300% Gross margin for products and services decreased 11 percentage points in 2005 from 2004 due to competitive pricing pressure and a $22 million inventory charge on the V4400 system and other legacy product lines, partially offset by sales of previously reserved inventory. Gross margin for products and services decreased 2 percentage points in 2004 compared to 2003 because of a competitive pricing environment. On an absolute dollar basis, the cost of products and services decreased 11 percent in 2005 compared to 2004 due to reduced volume and increased 17 percent in 2004 compared to 2003 due to a higher volume of sales. Our semiconductor test business continues to implement cost control programs as well as outsource production to contract manufacturers, transferring manufacturing to low-cost regions and closely monitoring indirect and direct material costs. The operating margin decreased 22 percentage points in 2005 compared to 2004. This was mainly due to the decrease in gross margins referenced above and an increase in research and development as a percentage of revenue in preparation for the complete roll-over of the STE product line in addition to higher field selling costs to help customers migrate to new products. In 2004, the operating margin increased 3 percentage points compared to 2003, with a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses partially offset by higher research and development spending. On an absolute dollar basis, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 4 percentage points in 2005 compared to 2004 and decreased 6 percentage points in 2004 compared to 2003. The decreases reflect the implementation of initiatives to control discretionary spending. (Loss) Income from Operations Throughout 2004 we saw improvements in revenue and income from operations followed by a market downturn into the first half of 2005, with a recovery in the second half of 2005. Our semiconductor test business exits the current year with strong orders and a competitive line of products. In addition, utilization rates for our 93K systems finished the year at above average industry rates. Discontinued Operations In August 2005, the Board of Directors of Agilent approved the divestiture of our semiconductor products business. We subsequently signed an Asset Purchase Agreement with Avago providing for the 54 sale of our semiconductor products business for approximately $2.66 billion. We have reflected the semiconductor products business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. On December 1, 2005, we completed the sale of our semiconductor products business to Avago. For further information, see Note 24, "Subsequent Events", to our consolidated financial statements. In 2005, our costs directly associated with this transaction were approximately $32 million and are included in the discontinued operation results below. Discontinued operations results for the past three years are summarized in the table below and include the results of the camera module business, which was sold in February 2005. As discussed in the Restatement Explanatory Note, we have restated our 2004 results of operations to correct for an error in the provision for income taxes. This restatement also affected our net results of discontinued operations and is discussed in Note 1A, "Restatement of 2004 Consolidated Financial Statements", to our consolidated financial statements. Years Ended October 31, 2005 2004 2003 (Restated) (in millions) Net revenue $ 1,796 $ 2,021 $ 1,588 Costs and expenses 1,570 1,779 1,594 Income (loss) from discontinued operations 226 242 (6 ) Other income, net 6 3 Income (loss) from discontinued operations before taxes 232 242 (3 ) Provision for taxes 46 10 Income (loss) from discontinued operations $ 186 $ 242 $ (13 ) Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources Our financial position remained strong at October 31, 2005, with cash and cash equivalents of $2,226 million as compared to $2,315 million at October 31, 2004. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities We generated cash from continuing operations of $643 million in 2005 compared to $432 million in 2004. We spent $110 million on restructuring activities in 2005, primarily in the form of severance payments, compared to $138 million in 2004. In 2005, accounts receivable generated cash of $29 million versus cash generated of $117 million in 2004. Days sales outstanding as of October 31, 2005 was 53 days as compared to 56 days as of October 31, 2004. While revenue remained flat, the decline in days sales outstanding reflects the continuing improvement in receivables management. In 2005, accounts payable generated cash of $21 million versus cash generated of $47 million in 2004. Inventory generated cash of $2 million in 2005 compared to $10 million used in 2004. Inventory days on hand also improved as of the end of 2005 at 101 days compared to 109 days as of the end of 2004. In 2005, we contributed $41 million to fund our U.S. defined benefit plan, compared to $63 million in 2004. In 2005, we contributed $36 million to fund our international defined benefits plans, compared to $83 million in 2004. In 2005, total pension plan contributions were $77 million, or 55 47 percent less than in 2004. In 2006, we expect funding requirements for our various benefit plans to decrease slightly to a total of approximately $75 million. Our annual contributions are highly dependent on the relative performance of our assets versus our projected liabilities, among other factors. As the value of our assets increases relative to our future projected obligations we will make smaller contributions to maintain our funded status. In 2005, we recorded an additional minimum pension liability for $170 million as several of our non-U.S. defined benefit retirement plans had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of the fair value of plan assets. The establishment of the additional minimum liability also resulted in a net long term deferred tax asset for $55 million of which $34 million was offset by a valuation allowance. In 2005, as in 2004, we recorded no goodwill amortization in accordance with SFAS No. 142. Depreciation and amortization decreased from $218 million in 2004 to $186 million in 2005 reflecting the reduced acquisitions of property plant and equipment over the past few years and the full amortization of other intangibles relating to business combinations completed in earlier years such as the Objective Systems Integration acquisition in 2001. We paid income taxes amounting to $75 million in 2005, as compared to $149 million in 2004. Net cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations, which is not included above, was $256 million in 2005 as compared to $238 million in 2004. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations for 2005 was $173 million compared to $82 million in 2004. Investments in property, plant and equipment increased by $55 million to $139 million in 2005 compared to 2004. We also used $64 million for acquisitions of related businesses as compared to $18 million in 2004. Cash provided by divestitures was $8 million in 2005. Net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations was $27 million in 2005 as compared to cash used of $32 million in 2004. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities of continuing operations in 2005 was $780 million compared to cash generation of $138 million in 2004. We completed the optional redemption of all the 3 percent senior convertible debentures due 2021 in the fourth quarter of 2005. The aggregate outstanding principal amount was approximately $1.15 billion. In lieu of cash redemption, holders of approximately $466 million aggregate principal amount of the debentures elected to convert their holdings into approximately 14.5 million shares of Agilent common stock. The remaining $684 million of outstanding debentures were retired for cash, and as a result Agilent no longer has any of the debentures outstanding. Loss on redemption of convertible debt amounted to $7 million. During the fourth quarter of 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $4.466 billion of our common stock. Under the program, during the fourth quarter of 2005, we repurchased 8.9 million shares for $290 million. Repurchased shares and related costs have been accounted for as treasury shares using the cost method. Also, subsequent to our fiscal year end, we initiated a self-tender offer for an additional 73 million of our shares under the repurchase program with the right to repurchase up to an additional 2 percent of our outstanding shares as of October 31, 2005. Subsequent to year end, in December 2005, the tender offer expired and we agreed to accept for payment 83 million shares at a purchase price of $36 per share for an aggregate amount of approximately $3 billion. To date we have repurchased approximately 92 million shares for $3.3 billion which leaves approximately $1.2 billion remaining authorized under our stock repurchase program. The remaining repurchases may be affected in a number of ways, including open market purchases, 56 block trades, additional self-tender offers, accelerated share repurchase transactions and other means. The program is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2007. We funded the $3.3 billion in total repurchases under our authorized stock repurchase program with cash on hand and from the proceeds of the sale of our semiconductor products business and our Lumileds joint venture. We also drew down $700 million on a $1 billion senior secured term borrowing facility. We entered into the facility in December 2005 and it matures no later than April 2006. The term facility allows us to borrow at an interest rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 30 basis points per annum, or for shorter LIBOR periods if we and the lenders so agree. Prior to its final maturity, we expect to replace the term facility with permanent financing. As a condition of the term facility, we will segregate investments equal to 105.25 percent of the principal borrowed as restricted assets on our balance sheet. We plan to use the remainder of the term facility proceeds, as well as any additional proceeds from the permanent financing expected in the second quarter of 2006, to fund the remaining $1.2 billion of repurchases under our authorized stock repurchase program. We believe that the cash that we expect to be generated by our operating activities, together with our existing cash and short-term investments, will be sufficient to support our operations, including our working capital, capital expenditure and investment needs, for the coming year. Additionally, we believe this cash together with our current and future borrowing capabilities are sufficient to fund the anticipated repurchase of the remaining shares under the stock repurchase program. In December 2005, we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products business to Avago for approximately $2.6 billion in proceeds. The divestiture includes approximately 6,500 regular employees and operations in Asia, the U.S. and Europe. In November 2005, we also completed the sale of our stake in Lumileds Lighting International B.V. ("Lumileds") to Royal Philips Electronics for approximately $949 million, plus repayment of approximately $51 million of outstanding principal debt and accrued interest from Lumileds. Other We have contractual commitments for non-cancelable operating leases. See Note 19, "Commitments", to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our non-cancelable operating leases. Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. Our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. Local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances. We do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization. On April 13, 2005, Standard & Poor's Rating Services ("S&P") raised its corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings of Agilent to "BB+" from "BB", revising their rating outlook to "stable" from "positive". On August 15, 2005, S&P raised its rating outlook on Agilent to "positive", but left the company's corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings unchanged. On November 23, 2005, Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") affirmed their credit ratings of Agilent, leaving unchanged the senior implied debt rating of "Ba2" and the speculative grade liquidity rating of "SGL-1". Moody's "stable" rating outlook for the company was also left unchanged. Contractual Commitments Our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, and the timing of tax 57 and other payments. As a result, the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors. The following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at October 31, 2005, including those related to discontinued operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet (in millions): Less than one year One to three years Three to five years More than five years Operating leases $ 90 $ 124 $ 55 $ 30 Commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers 585 Other purchase commitments 82 105 18 2 Retirement plans 75 Total $ 832 $ 229 $ 73 $ 32 Operating leases. Commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property. Commitments under leases relating to discontinued operations totaled $23 million, split as follows: $6 million due within one year; $11 million due in one to three years; $5 million due in three to five years and $1 million due in five years or more. Commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers. We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates. However, our agreements with these suppliers usually allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. Typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within 30 days are non-cancelable. Therefore, only approximately 20 percent of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional commitments. We expect to fulfill all purchase commitments for inventory within one year. Commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers relating to our discontinued operations were $166 million, and of these approximately 34 percent were firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional commitments. In addition to the above, we record a liability for firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory. As of October 31, 2005, the liability for our firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments was $27 million, compared with $16 million as of October 31, 2004. These amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Other purchase commitments. These relate primarily to contracts with professional services suppliers. Purchase commitments are typically cancelable within a 90-day period without significant penalties. Retirement plans. Retirement plan funding includes the expected tax-deductible contribution planned for 2006. Funding projections beyond the current year are not practical to estimate due to the rules affecting tax deductible contributions and the impact from asset performance and interest rates. 58 We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of October 31, 2005 or October 31, 2004.
