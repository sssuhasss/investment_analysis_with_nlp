Actual results may materially differ from anticipated results described or implied in these forward-looking statements. OVERVIEW We are one of the largest specialty retailers of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States, selling our products to both do-it-yourself (DIY) customers and professional installers. Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items and accessories and a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional installer service equipment. On July 11, 2008, we completed the acquisition of CSK, one of the largest specialty retailers of auto parts and accessories in the Western United States and one of the largest such retailers in the United States, based on store count. At the date of the acquisition, CSK had 1,342 stores in 22 states, operating under four brand names: Checker Auto Parts, Schuck Auto Supply, Kragen Auto Parts and Murray Discount Auto Parts. We view the following factors to be the key drivers of current and future demand for the products we sell: Number of miles driven and number of registered vehicles the total number of miles driven in the U.S. heavily influences the demand for the repair and maintenance products we sell. The long-term trend in the number of vehicles on the road and the total miles driven in the U.S. has exhibited steady growth over the past decade. Since 1998, the total number of miles driven in the United States has increased at an annual rate of approximately 1.6%. The total number of vehicles on the road has increased from 197 million registered light vehicles in 1998 to 241 million in 2007. Total number of miles driven remained relatively unchanged in 2007 and declined by 3.6% in 2008, as many consumers responded to rising fuel prices and other economic constraints in part by curtailing automobile usage. We believe that the decrease in miles driven in 2008 and expected decrease in 2009 is a short-term trend and that long-term miles driven will increase in the future because of the increasing number of vehicles on the road. Average vehicle age changes in the average age of vehicles on the road impacts demand for automotive aftermarket products. As the average age of a vehicle increases, the vehicle goes through more routine maintenance cycles requiring replacement parts such as brakes, belts, hoses, batteries, and filters. The sales of these products are a key component of our business. The average age of the vehicle population has increased over the past decade from 8.9 years for passenger cars and 8.3 years for light trucks in 1998 to 10.4 and 9.0 years, respectively, in 2007. Based on the dramatic decrease in the sale of new cars and light trucks in 2008, and the expected decrease in 2009, we expect that consumers will continue to choose to keep their vehicles longer and drive them at higher mileages and that this increasing trend in average vehicle age will continue. Unperformed maintenance according to estimates compiled by the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association, the annual amount of unperformed or underperformed maintenance in the United States totaled $60 billion for 2007. This metric represents the degree to which routine vehicle maintenance recommended by the manufacturer is not being performed. Consumer decisions to avoid or defer maintenance affect demand for our products and the total amount of unperformed maintenance represents potential future demand. We believe that challenging macroeconomic conditions in 2007 and 2008 contributed to the amount of unperformed maintenance. Product quality differentiation we provide our customers with an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer. For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects good , better , and best alternatives. Our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the best quality category of products. Consumers willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry. We believe 25 that the average consumer tendency has been to trade-down to lower quality products during the recent challenging economic conditions. We have ongoing initiatives targeted to marketing higher quality products to our customers and expect our customers to be more willing to return to purchasing up on the value spectrum in the future. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS On July 11, 2008, we completed the acquisition of CSK, one of the largest specialty retailers of auto parts and accessories in the Western United States and one of the largest such retailers in the United States, based on store count. Pursuant to the merger agreement, each share of CSK common stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger was canceled and converted into the right to receive 0.4285 of a share of O Reilly common stock and $1.00 in cash. To fund the transaction, we entered into a Credit Agreement for a $1.2 billion asset-based revolving credit facility arranged by Bank of America, N.A., which we used to refinance debt, fund the cash portion of the acquisition, pay for other transaction-related expenses and provide liquidity for our combined Company going forward. The results of CSK operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date. At the date of the acquisition, CSK had 1,342 stores in 22 states, operating under four brand names: Checker Auto Parts, Schuck Auto Supply, Kragen Auto Parts and Murray Discount Auto Parts. This added stores in twelve new states: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Washington, and a number of new markets in states where O Reilly had a presence prior to the acquisition. As of December 31, 2008, we had converted 51 CSK stores to O Reilly brands, merged 35 CSK stores with existing O Reilly locations, closed six CSK stores and opened four new CSK stores. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth, certain income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years indicated: Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Sales 100 % 100 % 100 % Cost of goods sold, including warehouse and distribution expenses 54.5 55.6 55.9 Gross profit 45.5 44.4 44.1 Selling, general and administrative expenses 36.1 32.3 31.7 Operating income 9.4 12.1 12.4 Debt prepayment costs (0.2 ) Interim facility commitment fee (0.1 ) Interest expense (0.7 ) (0.1 ) (0.2 ) Interest income 0.1 0.1 0.1 Other income, net 0.1 0.1 Income before income taxes 8.5 12.2 12.4 Provision for income taxes 3.3 4.5 4.6 Net income 5.2 % 7.7 % 7.8 % 26 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 Sales increased $1.05 billion, or 42%, from $2.52 billion in 2007 to $3.58 billion in 2008, due to the acquisition of 1,342 CSK stores and the addition of 150 net new O Reilly stores opened during 2008. The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2008: Increase/ (Decrease) in Sales For the Year Ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in 2007 (in millions) O Reilly stores: Comparable store sales $ 65.0 Stores opened throughout 2007, excluding sales for stores open at least one year that are included in that are included in comparable store sales 92.3 Sales of stores opened in 2008 61.8 Non-store sales including machinery, sales to independent parts stores and team members (1.1 ) CSK stores: 836.2 Total increase in sales $ 1,054.2 We believe that the increased sales achieved by our existing stores is the result of superior inventory availability, a broader selection of products in most stores, targeted promotional and advertising efforts through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and layout of stores, compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional installers. Consolidated comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2008. This increase in 2008 was less than the prior year increase of 3.7% and historical trends primarily due to challenging external macroeconomic factors in 2008 as well as a decline in comparable store sales in the stores added in the CSK acquisition. The external macroeconomic factors which we believe negatively impacted our sales were constraints on our customers discretionary income resulting from inflation, declining home and investment asset values, higher gas prices in early 2008, increased unemployment and the impact of a contraction in the US economy. Comparable store sales for O Reilly stores, including CSK stores after conversion to the O Reilly brand, but excluding the acquired, yet-to-be-converted CSK stores, increased 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2008. Comparable store sales for acquired CSK stores open at least one year decreased 1.7% for the portion of those stores sales since the July 11, 2008 acquisition by O Reilly as compared to the same period in 2007 when CSK sales were not included in our consolidated financial statements. We anticipate that continued store unit and sales growth consistent with our historical rates will continue in the future. We expect future sales growth as the CSK stores are converted to the O Reilly dual market strategy. Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to team members. The following table presents quarterly results for non-store sales that are excluded from the calculation of comparable stores sales (in millions): 2008 2007 2006 For the quarter ended: March 31 $ 16 $ 17 $ 16 June 30 19 19 19 September 30 21 18 18 December 31 20 16 16 For the year ended December 31: $ 76 $ 70 $ 69 Gross profit increased $507.5 million, or 45%, from $1.12 billion (44.4% of sales) in 2007 to $1.63 billion (45.5% of sales) in 2008. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the increase in sales resulting from the acquisition of CSK, the increase from new stores and increased sales levels at existing stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales is the result of improved product mix, lower product acquisition cost and distribution system improvements. We improved our product mix by 27 continuing to implement strategies to differentiate our merchandise selections at each store based on customer demand and vehicle demographics in the store market and through ongoing Team Member training initiatives focused on selling products with greater gross margin contribution. Additionally, gross margin percentage improved as a result of the inclusion of sales from stores acquired in the acquisition of CSK. Gross margin percentages on the sales at these stores are higher than existing O Reilly stores primarily because a greater proportion of these sales are made to DIY customers (which typically have higher gross margin percentages) and because of market conditions, primarily overall price levels, that are specific to the markets in which the acquired stores are located. Product acquisition costs improved due to increased production by our suppliers in lower-cost foreign countries and improved negotiating leverage with our vendors as a result of our significant growth. Improvements in our distribution system were the result of capital projects designed to create operating expense efficiencies. We anticipate these trends to continue at a moderate rate in 2009, with more significant improvements resulting from continued product acquisition cost reductions relating to the CSK acquisition. SG&A increased $477 million, or 59%, from $815.3 million (32.3% of sales) in 2007 to $1.29 billion (36.1% of sales) in 2008. The dollar increase in SG&A expenses resulted primarily from the acquisition of CSK and from additional team members and resources to support our increased store count. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the addition of the CSK store base which has a higher expense structure than the core O Reilly store base, a one-time charge of $9.6 million to align CSK vacation policy with the Company policy, $5.3 million of non-cash amortization of CSK trade names and trade marks and partial de-leverage of fixed SG&A expenses on low comparable store sales increases. Interest expense increased $22 million, from $4 million (or 0.1% of sales) in 2007 to $26 million (or 0.7% of sales) in 2008. The increase in interest expense is the result of borrowings under our new asset-based revolving credit facility that were used to fund the CSK acquisition as well as amortization of a portion of the debt issuance costs. Other one-time charges were incurred in 2008 of $4.2 million for interim financing facility commitment fees related to the CSK acquisition and $7.2 million of debt prepayment costs resulting from the payoff of our existing senior notes and synthetic lease facility. Our provision for income taxes increased from $114 million in 2007 (36.9% effective tax rate) to $116 million in 2008 (38.4% effective tax rate). The increase in effective tax rate is the result of our acquisition of CSK and the generally higher effective tax rates in most states where the acquired CSK stores are located. The increase is also attributable to a one-time charge to adjust tax liabilities in the amount $3.1 million relating to the acquisition. As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income decreased $7.8 million from $194.0 million in 2007 (7.7% of sales) to $186.2 million in 2008 (5.2% of sales). Diluted earnings per share decreased $0.19 per share in 2008 to $1.48 per share on 125.4 million diluted shares outstanding from $1.67 per share in 2007 on 116.1 million diluted shares outstanding. The increase in dilutive shares outstanding is principally the result of shares exchanged in the acquisition of CSK. 28 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 Sales increased $239 million, or 10.5%, from $2.28 billion in 2006 to $2.52 billion in 2007, due to 190 net additional stores opened during 2007 which contributed $72.5 million to the sales increase, a full year of sales for stores opened throughout 2006 adding $83.5 million and a 3.7% increase in same-store sales for stores open at least one year providing $82.6 million of the sales increase. We believe that the increased sales achieved by our existing stores are the result of superior inventory availability, offering a broader selection of products in most stores, an increased promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of most stores, compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional installers. The same store sales increase in 2007 of 3.7% was greater than the prior year increase of 3.3%, but below our historical results. The decrease from historical trends is the result of challenging external macroeconomic factors in 2006 and 2007. The external macroeconomic factors, which we believe negatively impacted our sales, were constraints on our customers discretionary income as a result of increased interest rates and higher energy costs. Consumers also encountered higher gas prices, which resulted in annual miles driven, a key driver of demand for our products, remaining flat in comparison to the long-term trend of annual increases. We anticipate that continued store unit and sales growth consistent with our historical rates will continue in the future. Increase in Sales For the Year Ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 (in millions) O Reilly stores: Comparable store sales $ 82.6 Stores opened throughout 2006, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales 83.5 Sales of stores opened in 2007 72.5 Non-store sales including machinery, sales to independent parts stores and team members 0.5 Total increase in sales $ 239.1 Gross profit increased $113.7 million, or 11.3%, from $1.01 billion (44.1% of sales) in 2006 to $1.12 billion (44.4% of sales) in 2007, primarily due to the increase in sales resulting from a larger number of stores and increased sales levels at existing stores. The increase in gross profit as a percent of sales is the result of improvements in product mix, lower product acquisition cost and distribution system efficiencies. Improvements in product mix were the result of strategies which differentiated our merchandise selections at each store based on customer demand and vehicle demographics in the store market and through ongoing Team Member training initiatives focused on selling products with greater gross margin contribution. Product acquisition cost improved due to increased imports from lower cost providers in foreign countries as well as improved negotiating leverage with our vendors resulting from our increased purchasing power. Improvements in our distribution system were the result of capital projects designed to create operating expense efficiencies. We anticipate these trends to continue at a moderate rate throughout 2008. SG&A increased $90.9 million, or 12.6%, from $724.4 million (31.7% of sales) in 2006 to $815.3 million (32.3% of sales) in 2007. The increase in these expenses was primarily attributable to increased salaries and benefits, rent and other costs associated with the addition of employees and facilities to support the increased level of our operations. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales was the result of increased store salaries primarily driven by the timing of new store openings, higher advertising costs, increased depreciation expense primarily driven by investment in new store technology and increased stock compensation expense. Other income, net, increased by $2.4 million from ($0.1) million in 2006 to $2.3 million in 2007. The increase was primarily due to decreased interest expense on long-term debt resulting from a reduction in the interest rate on long-term debt as well as increased interest income derived from a higher than average cash balance. Provision for income taxes increased from $104.2 million in 2006 (36.9% effective tax rate) to $113.5 million in 2007 (36.9% effective tax rate). The increase in the dollar amount was due to the increase of income before income taxes. As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income increased $15.9 million from $178.1 million in 2006 (7.8% of sales) to $194.0 million in 2007 (7.7% of sales). Diluted earnings per share increased $0.12 per share in 2007 to $1.67 per share on 116.1 million diluted shares outstanding from $1.55 per share in 2006 in 115.1 million diluted shares outstanding. 29 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Net cash provided by operating activities was $298.5 million in 2008, $299.4 million in 2007 and $185.9 million in 2006. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2008 was consistent with the cash provided by operating activities in 2007 principally because an increase in net inventory investment in 2008 was offset by an increase in operating income adjusted for non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses, and a one-time non-cash charge of $9.6 million to align, where possible, CSK vacation policy with the Company policy. Net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory net of the amount of accounts payable to vendors. The increase in net inventory investment in 2008 was the result of investments made to improve the inventory availability in the stores acquired in the acquisition of CSK. The average per-store inventory for core O Reilly stores increased to $489,000 as of December 31, 2008, from $482,000 as of December 31, 2007. CSK store average per-store inventory increased from $417,000 at the date of acquisition, to $461,000 as of December 31, 2008. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2007 was due to increased net income and a reduction in net inventory investment. The reduction in net inventory investment is the result of reductions in our per-store inventory levels and our ongoing effort to extend terms with our vendors. Reductions in our per-store inventory levels are driven by our continued optimization of inventory selection at our stores and our ability to efficiently deploy inventory throughout our distribution network. Net cash used in investing activities was $367.6 million in 2008, $300.3 million in 2007 and $225.2 million in 2006. The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2008 was principally due to an increase in capital expenditures and payments made in association with the acquisition of CSK. Capital expenditures were $341.7 million in 2008, $282.7 million in 2007 and $228.9 million in 2006. The increase in capital expenditures in 2008 was the result of the July 11, 2008 purchase of properties previously leased under our synthetic lease facility in conjunction with the financing of the acquisition of CSK, the addition of a distribution center facility in Lubbock, Texas, cash paid in the construction of a distribution center in Greensboro, North Carolina planned to open in 2009 and capital investments made in the initial stage of our integration of the operations of CSK. The 2008 increase in capital expenditures from these items was partially offset by decreased capital expenditures for new store construction. We opened 150, 190 and 170 net stores in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2007 compared to 2006 was due to increases in capital expenditures resulting from our increased number of new stores, store relocations, enhancements in existing store technology and the purchase of $21.7 million of CSK shares. These expenditures were primarily related to the opening of new stores and distribution centers, as well as the relocation or remodeling of existing stores. Our plan for the integration of the CSK acquisition and our continuing store expansion program will require significant capital expenditures and working capital investments in 2009. Total capital expenditures in 2009 are expected to range from $420 million to $470 million. The CSK integration plan will require capital expenditures for the planned addition of facilities to enhance distribution infrastructure and the conversion of acquired stores to the O Reilly brand. Costs associated with the conversion of CSK stores include investments in store computer systems, signage, fixtures, interior and exterior renovation, and delivery vehicles. The estimated conversion cost per store is expected to be approximately $135,000. Additionally, our 2009 growth plans call for approximately 150 new stores and the addition of a distribution center in Greensboro, North Carolina. The costs associated with the opening of a new store (including the cost of land acquisition, improvements, fixtures, net inventory investment and computer equipment) are estimated to average approximately $1.3 million to $1.5 million; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site. We plan to finance our expansion program through cash expected to be provided from operating activities and available borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility. Net cash provided by financing activities was $52.8 million in 2008, $18.6 million in 2007 and $37.8 million in 2006. The increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2008 is primarily the result of the proceeds from borrowings under our asset-based credit facility partially offset by the payment of outstanding principal balances on existing debt and debt assumed in the CSK acquisition, debt issuance costs and prepayment costs in association with the financing of the acquisition of CSK. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities in 2007 versus 2006 is due to net repayments of long-term debt. On July 11, 2008, in connection with the acquisition of CSK, we entered into a Credit Agreement for a five-year $1.2 billion asset-based revolving credit facility ( ABL Credit Facility ) arranged by Bank of America, N.A., which we used to refinance debt, fund the cash portion of the acquisition, pay for other transaction-related expenses and provide liquidity for the combined Company going forward. This facility replaced a previous unsecured, five-year syndicated revolving credit facility in the amount of $100 million. The ABL Credit Facility is comprised of a $1.075 billion tranche A revolving credit facility and a $125.0 million first-in-last-out revolving credit facility (FILO tranche). As part of the ABL Credit Agreement, the Company has pledged virtually all of its assets as collateral and is subject to an ongoing consolidated leverage ratio covenant. On the date of the transaction, the amount of the borrowing base available, as described in the ABL Credit Agreement, under the ABL Credit Facility was $1.05 billion of which we borrowed $588 million. We used borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility to repay certain existing debt of CSK, repay our $75 million 2006-A Senior Notes and purchase all of the properties that had been leased under our synthetic lease facility. We believe 30 that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and our ABL Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. At December 31, 2008, our borrowing base was $1.124 billion, of which we had borrowed $614.2 million. Borrowings under the tranche A revolver bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either a base rate plus 1.50% per annum or LIBOR plus 2.5% per annum, with each rate being subject to adjustment based upon certain excess availability thresholds. Borrowings under the FILO tranche bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either a base rate plus 2.75% per annum or LIBOR plus 3.75% per annum, with each rate being subject to adjustment based upon certain excess availability thresholds. The base rate is equal to the higher of the prime lending rate established by Bank of America from time to time and the federal funds effective rate as in effect from time to time plus 0.50%. Fees related to unused capacity under the ABL Credit Facility are assessed at a rate of 0.5% of the remaining available borrowings under the facility, subject to adjustment based upon remaining unused capacity. In addition, we paid customary commitment fees, letter of credit fees, underwriting fees and other administrative fees in respect of the credit facility. On July 24, 2008, October 14, 2008, and November 24, 2008, we entered into interest rate swap transactions with Branch Banking and Trust Company ( BBT ), Bank of America, N.A. ( BA ) and SunTrust Bank ( SunTrust ). We entered into these interest rate swap transactions to mitigate the risk associated with our floating interest rate based on LIBOR on an aggregate of $450 million of our debt that is outstanding under our ABL Credit Agreement, dated as of July 11, 2008. We are required to make certain monthly fixed rate payments calculated on the notional amounts, while the applicable counter party is obligated to make certain monthly floating rate payments to us referencing the same notional amount. The interest rate swap transactions effectively fix the annual interest rate payable on these notional amounts of our debt, which may exist under the ABL Credit Facility plus an applicable margin under the terms of the ABL Credit Facility. The counterparties, transaction dates, effective dates, applicable notional amounts, effective index rates and maturity dates of each of the interest rate swap transactions are included in the table below: Counterparty Transaction Date Effective Date Notional amount (in thousands) Effective index rate Spread at December 31, 2008 Effective Interest Rate at December 31, 2008 Maturity date BBT 7/24/2008 8/1/2008 $ 100,000 3.425 % 3.75 % 7.175 % 8/1/2010 SunTrust 7/24/2008 8/1/2008 25,000 3.830 3.75 7.58 8/1/2011 BA 7/24/2008 8/1/2008 75,000 3.830 2.50 6.330 8/1/2011 SunTrust 7/24/2008 8/1/2008 50,000 3.830 2.50 6.330 8/1/2011 BBT 10/14/2008 10/17/2008 25,000 2.990 2.50 5.490 10/17/2010 BBT 10/14/2008 10/17/2008 25,000 3.010 2.50 5.510 10/17/2010 BA 10/14/2008 10/17/2008 25,000 3.050 2.50 5.550 10/17/2010 SunTrust 10/14/2008 10/17/2008 25,000 2.990 2.50 5.490 10/17/2010 BA 10/14/2008 10/17/2008 50,000 3.560 2.50 6.060 10/17/2011 SunTrust 11/24/2008 11/28/2008 50,000 1.950 2.50 4.450 11/28/2009 $ 450,000 On July 11, 2008, O Reilly agreed to become a guarantor, on a subordinated basis, of the $100 million principal amount of 6 3/4% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2025 (the Notes ) originally issued by CSK. The Notes are exchangeable, under certain circumstances, into cash and shares of our common stock. The Notes bear interest at 6.75% per year until December 15, 2010, and 6.5% until maturity on December 15, 2025. Prior to their stated maturity, the Notes are exchangeable by the holders only under certain circumstances. Prior to their stated maturity, these Notes are exchangeable by the holder only under the following circumstances (as more fully described in the indenture under which the Notes were issued): During any fiscal quarter (and only during that fiscal quarter) commencing after July 11, 2008, if the last reported sale price of our common stock is greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable exchange price of $36.17 for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter; If the Notes have been called for redemption by the Company; or Upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions, such as a change in control. Upon exchange of the Notes, we will deliver cash equal to the lesser of the aggregate principal amount of notes to be exchanged and our total exchange obligation and, in the event our total exchange obligation exceeds the aggregate principal amount of notes to be exchanged, shares of our common stock in respect of that excess. The total exchange obligation reflects the exchange rate whereby each $1,000 in principal amount of the notes is exchangeable into an equivalent value of 25.9697 shares of our common stock and $60.6061 in cash. 31 The noteholders may require us to repurchase some or all of the notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest on December 15, 2010; December 15, 2015; or December 15, 2020, or on any date following a fundamental change as described in the indenture. We may redeem some or all of the notes for cash at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest on or after December 15, 2010, upon at least 35-calendar days notice. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have utilized various financial instruments from time to time as sources of cash when such instruments provided a cost effective alternative to our existing sources of cash. We do not believe, however, that we are dependent on the availability of these instruments to fund our working capital requirements or our growth plans. On December 29, 2000, we entered into a sale-leaseback transaction with an unrelated party. Under the terms of the transaction, we sold 90 properties, including land, buildings and improvements, which generated $52.3 million of cash. The lease, which is being accounted for as an operating lease, provides for an initial lease term of 21 years and may be extended for one initial ten-year period and two additional successive periods of five years each. The resulting gain of $4.5 million has been deferred and is being amortized over the initial lease term. Net rent expense during the initial term will be approximately $5.5 million annually. In August 2001, we entered into a sale-leaseback with O Reilly-Wooten 2000 LLC (an entity owned by certain affiliates of the Company). The transaction involved the sale and leaseback of nine O Reilly Auto Parts stores and generated approximately $5.6 million of cash. The transaction did not result in a material gain or loss. The lease, which has been accounted for as an operating lease, calls for an initial term of 15 years with three five-year renewal options. On September 28, 2007, we completed a second amended and restated master agreement to our $49 million Synthetic Operating Lease Facility with a group of financial institutions. The terms of such lease facility provided for an initial lease period of seven years, a residual value guarantee of approximately $39.7 million at December 31, 2007 and purchase options on the properties. On July 11, 2008, we, in connection with the acquisition of CSK, purchased all the properties included in our Synthetic Operating Lease Facility for $49.3 million, thus terminating the facility. The purchase was funded through borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility. We issue stand-by letters of credit provided by a $200 million sub limit under the ABL Credit Facility that reduce our available borrowings. These letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies. Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one-year term from the date of issuance. Letters of credit totaling $55.6 million and $28.6 million were outstanding at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management. Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required to establish these estimates. Management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material. Vendor concessions We receive concessions from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, including co-operative advertising, allowances for warranties, merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates. Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes, are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred. All other material vendor concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of inventory. Amounts receivable from vendors also include amounts due to us relating to vendor purchases and product returns. Management regularly reviews amounts receivable from vendors and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our vendors financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations. Based on our historical results and current assessment, we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations. The eventual ability of our vendors to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. 32 Self-Insurance Reserves We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and employee health care benefits. With the exception of employee health care benefit liabilities, which are limited by the design of these plans, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim. When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, and growth patterns and exposure forecasts. The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations. Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities. Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains. As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information. The long-term portions of these liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value. These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities. If self-insurance reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2008, the financial impact would have been approximately $8.6 million or 2.8% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2008. Accounts Receivable Management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical loss ratios and other relevant factors. Actual results have consistently been within management expectations, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future that will require a significant change in the assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our allowance for doubtful accounts. However, if actual results differ from our estimates, we may be exposed to losses or gains. If the allowance for doubtful accounts were changed 30% from our estimated allowance at December 31, 2008, the financial impact would have been approximately $1.4 million or 0.4% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2008. Taxes We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit. The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings. Changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and/or changes in tax regulations. In management opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented. The estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates. Alternatively, we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but that would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position. Our judgment regarding the most likely outcome of uncertain tax positions has historically resulted in an estimate of our tax liability that is greater than actual results. While our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion, our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority. The accounting for our tax reserves changed with the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 ( FIN 48 ) on January 1, 2007. Inventory Obsolescence and Shrink Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools is stated at the lower of cost or market. The extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal. The products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population. We have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and, accordingly, have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand. We do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost. This reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate, at a given point in time, the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods. Ultimately, our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances. We have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future. 33 We also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink. We estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic, full physical inventories at our stores and distribution centers. To the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage, we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances. We have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates. If unrecorded shrink were changed 10% from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at December 31, 2008, the financial impact would have been approximately $0.9 million or 0.3% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2008. Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ( SFAS No. 144 ), we evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred. As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment. A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. The estimate of cash flows includes management assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment. Under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ( SFAS 142 ), we review goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. The Company has not historically recorded an impairment to its goodwill or intangible assets. The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our Company. Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We have other liabilities reflected in our balance sheet, including deferred income taxes and self-insurance accruals. Interest payments on our variable rate long-term debt are not included in the financial commitments table. The payment obligations associated with these liabilities are not reflected in the financial commitments table due to the absence of scheduled payments. Therefore, the timing of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2009 that are included in current liabilities. In addition, we have commitments with various vendors for the purchase of inventory as of December 31, 2008. The financial commitments table excludes these commitments because they are cancelable by their terms. Our contractual obligations, as in effect at December 31, 2008, including commitments for future payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, short and long-term debt arrangements, interest payments related to long-term debt, fixed payments related to interest rate swaps and purchase obligations for construction contract commitments, are summarized below and are fully disclosed in Notes 4 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements. Payments Due By Period Total Before 1 Year 1-2 Years 3-4 Years Years 5 and Over (In thousands) Contractual Obligations: Long-term debt $ 717,768 $ $ $ 614,200 $ 103,568 Payments under interest rate swap agreements 135,663 21,596 29,870 13,000 71,197 Future minimum lease payments under capital leases 16,174 8,808 6,096 1,168 102 Future minimum lease payments under operating leases 1,505,771 213,482 370,074 283,505 638,710 Other obligations 4,800 600 1,200 1,200 1,800 Purchase obligations 130,106 130,106 Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,510,282 $ 374,592 $ 407,240 $ 913,073 $ 815,377 34 INFLATION AND SEASONALITY For the last three fiscal years, we have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying. To the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industry-wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products. As a result, we do not believe our operations have been materially, adversely affected by inflation. To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns. While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters of the year. QUARTERLY RESULTS The following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal 2008 and 2007. The unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown. The unaudited operating data presented below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report, and the other financial information included therein. Fiscal 2008 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter (In thousands, except per share data) Sales $ 646,220 $ 704,430 $ 1,111,272 $ 1,114,631 Gross profit 288,494 317,097 507,206 515,129 Operating income 74,156 88,388 92,471 80,602 Net income 46,331 55,788 41,399 42,714 Basic net income per common share 0.40 0.48 0.31 0.32 Net income per common share assuming dilution 0.40 0.48 0.31 0.32 Fiscal 2007 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter (In thousands, except per share data) Sales $ 613,145 $ 643,108 $ 661,778 $ 604,288 Gross profit 269,281 287,185 293,701 270,293 Operating income 77,192 81,558 82,716 63,685 Net income 48,407 51,899 53,087 40,595 Basic net income per common share 0.42 0.45 0.46 0.35 Net income per common share assuming dilution 0.42 0.45 0.46 0.35 NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ( SFAS No. 157 ), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 for financial assets and liabilities, as well as any other assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in financial statements, are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 (fiscal year 2008 for us). FASB Staff Position FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for most nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 (fiscal year 2009 for us). The implementation of SFAS No. 157 for financial assets and financial liabilities, effective January 1, 2008, did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We do not anticipate SFAS No. 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 , The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( SFAS No. 159 ). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to measure selected financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The provisions of SFAS No. 159 are effective as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year. As we elected not to measure any eligible items using the fair value option in accordance with SFAS No. 159, the adoption of SFAS No. 159 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 35 In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations (revised 2007 ) ( SFAS No. 141(R) ). SFAS No. 141(R) applies to any transaction or other event that meets the definition of a business combination. Where applicable, SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer recognizes and measures identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and goodwill or gain from a bargain purchase. In addition, SFAS No. 141(R) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. This statement is to be applied prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We do not expect the initial adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) to have a material impact; however, the impact of SFAS No. 141(R) on a future business combination could be material and would be evaluated at that time. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 ( SFAS 160 ), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. SFAS 160 states that accounting and reporting for minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. The calculation of earnings per share will continue to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent. SFAS 160 applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements, but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary. The provisions of SFAS 160 will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2009, and will be applied prospectively. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 ( SFAS No. 161 ), which requires entities that utilize derivative instruments to provide qualitative disclosures about their objectives and strategies for using such instruments, as well as any details of credit-risk-related contingent features contained within derivatives. SFAS No. 161 also requires entities to disclose additional information about the amounts and location of derivatives located within the financial statements, how the provisions of FASB Statement No. 133 have been applied, and the impact that hedges have on an entity financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 161 beginning with our March 2009 interim consolidated financial statements. In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) ( FSP APB 14-1 ). FSP APB 14-1 clarifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (including partial cash settlement) upon conversion and specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components of certain convertible debt instruments in a manner that reflects the issuer nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. FSP APB 14-1 requires bifurcation of a component of the debt, classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in the Company consolidated statement of operations. FSP APB 14-1 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008, with early application prohibited. We will adopt the provisions of FSP APB 14-1 beginning with our March 2009 interim consolidated financial statements; however, we do not anticipate that the adoption of FSP APB 14-1 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Heirarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( SFAS 162 ). This standard is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent framework or hierarchy, for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. SFAS 162 is effective 60 days following the SEC approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411. The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
