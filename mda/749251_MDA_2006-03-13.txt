OVERVIEW With the convergence of IT and business, technology has become increasingly more important not just to technology professionals, but also to business executives. We are an independent and objective research and advisory firm that helps IT and business executives use technology to build, guide and grow their enterprises. We employ a diversified business model that leverages the breadth and depth of our research intellectual capital while enabling us to maintain and grow our market-leading position and brand franchise. Our strategy is to align our resources and our infrastructure to leverage that intellectual capital into additional revenue streams through effective packaging, campaigning and cross-selling of our products and services. Our diversified business model provides multiple entry points and synergies that facilitate increased client spending on our research, consulting and events. A key strategy is to increase business volume with our most valuable clients, identifying relationships with the greatest sales potential and expanding those relationships by offering strategically relevant research and analysis. We intend to maintain a balance between (1) pursuing opportunities and applying resources with a strict focus on growing our three core businesses and (2) generating profitability through a streamlined cost structure. We have three business segments: Research, Consulting and Events. Research provides research content and advice for IT professionals, technology companies and the investment community in the form of reports and briefings, as well as peer networking services and membership programs designed specifically for CIOs and other senior executives. Consulting consists primarily of consulting, measurement engagements and strategic advisory services (paid one-day analyst engagements) ( SAS ), which provide assessments of cost, performance, efficiency and quality focused on the IT industry. Events consists of various symposia, conferences and exhibitions focused on the IT industry. We believe the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments: BUSINESS SEGMENT BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS Research Contract value represents the value attributable to all of our subscription-related research products that recognize revenue on a ratable basis. Contract value is calculated as the annualized value of all subscription research contracts in effect at a specific point in time, without regard to the duration of the contract. Client retention rate represents a measure of client satisfaction and renewed business relationships at a specific point in time. Client retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing our current clients, who were also clients a year ago, by all clients from a year ago. Wallet retention rate represents a measure of the amount of contract value we have retained with clients over a twelve-month period. Wallet retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing the contract value 12 Table of Contents BUSINESS SEGMENT BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS of clients, who were clients one year earlier, by the total contract value from a year earlier. When wallet retention exceeds client retention, it is an indication of retention of higher-spending clients, or increased spending by retained clients, or both. Number of executive program members represents the number of paid participants in executive programs. Consulting Consulting backlog represents future revenue to be derived from in-process consulting, measurement and strategic advisory services engagements. Utilization rates represent a measure of productivity of our consultants. Utilization rates are calculated for billable headcount on a percentage basis by dividing total hours billed by total hours available to bill. Billing Rate represents earned billable revenue divided by total billable hours. Average annualized revenue per billable headcount represents a measure of the revenue generating ability of an average billable consultant and is calculated periodically by multiplying the average billing rate per hour times the average utilization percentage times the billable hours available for one year. Events Number of events represents the total number of hosted events completed during the period. Number of attendees represents the number of people who attend events. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION During Calendar 2005, we acquired META Group, Inc. ( META ) in an all-cash transaction for $10.00 per share, or approximately $168.3 million, excluding transaction costs of $8.1 million. META was a publicly owned, premier information technology and research firm that was based in Stamford, Connecticut with about 715 employees. In 2004, META generated $141.5 million in revenue from 52 worldwide locations and had $90.8 million of assets at December 31, 2004. The results of operations of META are included in our consolidated financial results beginning April 1, 2005, the date of the acquisition. As of December 31, 2005 we have fully and successfully integrated META into our operations. We initiated and completed several actions during Calendar 2005 to enhance shareholder value. We simplified our capital structure by eliminating our dual class stock, and since July 7 th our common stock has been trading under one ticker symbol IT. We believe this change increased the trading liquidity of our common stock for our shareholders. In September we completed a buy back of certain vested and outstanding stock options for cash, which resulted in the tender and cancellation of approximately 6.4 million options. We undertook the buy back to reduce the option overhang resulting from the high number of options outstanding. In October our Board of Directors authorized a $100.0 million common share repurchase program, and we repurchased approximately 838,000 of our common shares by the end of the year. We enhanced our liquidity and financial flexibility during Calendar 2005 by amending our Credit Agreement. In addition to increasing our available credit and securing a more favorable amortization schedule, we also obtained more favorable covenant terms. We also reduced our exposure to rising interest rates on the term portion of the loan facility by entering into an interest rate swap agreement in the fourth quarter of Calendar 2005, which effectively converted the base floating rate on the base term loan to a fixed rate. We ended Calendar 2005 with $70.3 million in cash, which we believe is sufficient to meet our current needs, and our stockholders equity at December 31, 2005 was $146.6 million. We believe that we have stabilized our core Research business and will continue to focus on growing its revenues. Research revenue was up 9% over the prior year, to $523.0 million; revenue was up about 3% excluding the impact of META and the effect of foreign currency. At December 31, 2005, contract value was $592.6 million, up 16%, or $83.4 million, from $509.2 million at December 31, 2004. This represents our highest contract value since September 30, 2000 and our second highest level ever. In addition, the growth in contract value shows increases across all regions as well as across the entire product portfolio. Our Research client retention rate at December 31, 2005 increased to 81% from 80% at the prior year-end, while wallet retention was down to 93% from 95% over the same period. Consulting revenue for Calendar 2005 was up 16% over the prior year (revenue was up 11% excluding META and foreign currency impact), and we ended Calendar 2005 with a backlog of $119.9 million, a 7% increase from December 31, 2004. During Calendar 2005, our average consultant utilization rate was 62%, compared to 63% in the prior year, while billable headcount increased to 525 at December 31, 2005, compared to 475 at December 31, 2004. Our average annualized revenue per billable headcount was above $375,000. Our Events business continues to deliver consistent and profitable growth. Our emphasis on managing the Events portfolio to retain our long-time successful events and introduce promising new events has resulted in continued positive revenue performance, with Calendar 2005 revenue up 9% over the prior year. Same event revenue also increased, up 5% over the prior year. Contributing to the increased 13 Table of Contents revenue was a substantial increase in the number of events, with 70 held during Calendar 2005 as compared to 56 held in Calendar 2004. FLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS Our quarterly and annual revenue, operating income, and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors, including: the timing of Symposia, our flagship event that normally occurs during the fourth calendar quarter, and other events; the amount of new business generated; the mix of domestic and international business; changes in market demand for our products and services; changes in foreign currency rates; the timing of the development, introduction and marketing of new products and services; and competition in the industry. The potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause period-to-period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective judgments and estimates. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below. Revenue recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements ( SAB 101 ), and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition ( SAB 104 ). Revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows: Research revenues are derived from subscription contracts for research products. Revenues from research products are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term; Consulting revenues are generated from fixed fee and time and material engagements. Revenue from fixed fee contracts is recognized on a percentage of completion basis. Revenues from time and materials engagements is recognized as work is delivered and/or services are provided; Events revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the related symposium, conference or exhibition; Other revenues consists primarily of fees from research reprints and software licensing. Reprint fees are recognized when the reprint is shipped. Fees from software licensing is recognized when a signed non-cancelable software license exists, delivery has occurred, collection is probable, and the fees are fixed or determinable; and The majority of research contracts are billable upon signing, absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time. All research contracts are non-cancelable and non-refundable, except for government contracts that have a 30-day cancellation clause, but have not produced material cancellations to date. It is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue, since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim. For those government contracts that permit termination, we bill the client the full amount billable under the contract but only record a receivable equal to the earned portion of the contract. In addition, we only record deferred revenue on these government contracts when cash is received. Deferred revenues attributable to government contracts were $41.7 million and $40.9 million at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, we had not recognized uncollected receivables or deferred revenues, relating to government contracts that permit termination, of $7.1 million and $4.2 million, respectively. The preliminary purchase price allocation of the META acquisition includes an estimate of the fair value of the cost to fulfill the deferred revenue obligation assumed from META. The estimated fair value of the deferred revenue obligation was determined by estimating the costs to provide the services plus a normal profit margin, and did not include any costs associated with selling efforts. As a result, in allocating the purchase price we recorded adjustments to reduce the carrying value of META March 31, 2005 deferred revenue by approximately $12.6 million. Consequently, revenues related to META contracts existing at the date of acquisition in the amount of approximately $9.0 million that would have been recorded by META had it remained an independent entity were not recognized in Calendar 2005, and the remaining $3.6 million will impact Calendar 2006. As former META customers renew their contracts, we will recognize the full value of revenue from those new contracts over the respective contract periods. Uncollectible fees receivable The allowance for losses is composed of a bad debt and a sales and allowance reserve. Provisions are charged against earnings. The measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for uncollectible fees receivable is based on historical loss experience, aging of outstanding receivables, an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients. This evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires material estimates. These valuation reserves are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectibility of fees receivable becomes available. Circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients liquidity and credit quality, other factors negatively impacting our clients ability to pay their obligations as they come due, and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. The following table provides our total fees receivable, along with the related allowance for losses (in thousands): December 31, 2005 2004 Total fees receivable $ 321,095 $ 266,139 Allowance for losses (7,900 ) (8,450 ) Fees receivable, net $ 313,195 $ 257,689 14 Table of Contents Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets The evaluation of goodwill is performed in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ( SFAS 142 ). Among other requirements, this standard eliminated goodwill amortization upon adoption and requires ongoing annual assessments of goodwill impairment. The evaluation of other intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis. These assessments require management to estimate the fair values of our reporting units based on estimates of future business operations and market and economic conditions in developing long-term forecasts. If we determine that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we must recognize an impairment charge, for the associated goodwill of that reporting unit, to earnings in our financial statements. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger a review for impairment include the following: Significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results; Significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; Significant negative industry or economic trends; Significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and Our market capitalization relative to net book value. Due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of the reporting units and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations, both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty, and as additional information becomes known, we may change our estimates. During Calendar 2004, we recorded an impairment charge of $0.7 million in the first quarter relating to goodwill associated with certain operations in South America that were closed, and in the fourth quarter we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $2.0 million related to the exit from certain non-core product lines. Accounting for income taxes As we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in question. We consider the availability of loss carryforwards, existing deferred tax liabilities, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. In the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged against income in the period such determination was made. We operate in numerous foreign taxing jurisdictions and our level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of income taxes that we provide in any given year. In addition, our tax filings for various tax years are subject to audit by the tax authorities in jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes. We have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these audits. However, resolution of these matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the ultimate resolution will not exceed the amounts provided. In October 2005 we received an IRS Examination Report showing proposed changes that primarily relate to the valuation of intangible assets licensed to a foreign subsidiary and the calculation of payments under a cost sharing arrangement. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for additional information. Contingencies and other loss reserves and accruals We record accruals for severance costs, lease costs associated with excess facilities, contract terminations and asset impairments as a result of actions we undertake to streamline our organization, reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs. Estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions, such as future lease payments, sublease income, the fair value of assets, and severance and related benefits, are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated. To the extent actual costs differ from those estimates, reserve levels may need to be adjusted. In addition, these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved. During Calendar 2005 we revised our previous estimate for costs and losses associated with excess facilities and we recorded a charge of approximately $8.2 million, primarily due to a reduction of office space in San Jose, California, where we consolidated employees from two buildings into one. The charge is included in Other charges along with severance, the option buyback, impairment, and other costs. Additionally, we record accruals for estimated incentive compensation costs during each year. Amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known until after year end. CHANGE IN FISCAL YEAR On October 30, 2002, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a change of our fiscal year-end from September 30 to December 31, effective January 1, 2003. This change resulted in a three-month transitional period ending December 31, 2002. References to Transition 2002, unless otherwise indicated, refer to the three-month transitional period ended December 31, 2002. References to Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001, unless otherwise indicated, are to the respective fiscal year period from October 1 through September 30. References to Calendar 2006, Calendar 2005, Calendar 2004, Calendar 2003, and Calendar 2002, unless otherwise indicated, are to the 15 Table of Contents respective twelve-month period from January 1 through December 31. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CALENDAR 2005 VERSUS CALENDAR 2004 Total revenues increased 11%, or $95.2 million, to $989.0 million during Calendar 2005 from $893.8 million during Calendar 2004. Research revenues increased 9% in Calendar 2005 to $523.0 million, compared to $480.5 million in Calendar 2004, and comprised approximately 53% and 54% of total revenues in Calendar 2005 and Calendar 2004, respectively. Consulting revenues in Calendar 2005 of $301.1 million were up 16% compared to the $259.4 in Calendar 2004, and comprised approximately 30% and 29% of total revenues in Calendar 2005 and Calendar 2004, respectively. Events revenues were $151.3 million in Calendar 2005, an increase of 9% from the $138.4 million in Calendar 2004, and comprised approximately 15% of total revenues in both periods. Other revenues, consisting principally of reprint and software licensing fees, decreased 13% to $13.6 million in Calendar 2005 from $15.5 million in Calendar 2004. The effects of foreign currency translation had approximately a $1.1 million negative effect on total revenues for Calendar 2005 compared to Calendar 2004, while the META purchase added approximately $50.0 million of revenue. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and the META acquisition, revenues would have increased approximately 5% year-over-year. See the Segment Results section below for a further discussion of segment revenues. Revenues increased in all regions. Revenues from sales to United States and Canadian clients increased 9% to $611.0 million in Calendar 2005 from $559.4 million in Calendar 2004. Revenues from sales to clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa ( EMEA ) increased 13% to $296.8 million in Calendar 2005 from $263.0 million in Calendar 2004. Revenues from sales to clients in other international regions increased 14% to $81.2 million in Calendar 2005 from $71.4 million in Calendar 2004. Cost of services and product development increased $52.1 million, or 12%, to $486.6 million in Calendar 2005 from $434.5 million in Calendar 2004, with foreign currency translation having a negligible impact. The increase in cost of services and product development on a year-to-date basis resulted primarily from an increase in salary and benefits expense of approximately $33.5 million, primarily driven by the addition of 140 people related to the META purchase, and higher bonus expense and sales commissions of $14.2 million and $5.0 million, respectively. The increase in bonus expense reflects the Company decision to restore bonus payouts to a competitive level. In addition, we had $5.3 million of higher conference expenses related to an increase in the number of events and attendees. Cost of services and product development in Calendar 2005 benefited by the reversal of $2.1 million of prior years incentive compensation program accruals. Additionally, cost of services and product development during Calendar 2004 benefited by the reversal of $3.5 million of prior years incentive compensation program accruals. For Calendar 2005 and 2004, cost of services and product development as a percentage of sales was 49% for both periods. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $47.4 million, or 14%, to $397.3 million in Calendar 2005 from $349.8 million in Calendar 2004, with foreign currency translation having a negligible impact. The increase in SG&A expenses on a year-to-date basis was primarily driven by our continued investment in our sales organization, in which we now have over 700 sales associates, a 17% increase over Calendar 2004, reflecting the addition of 110 sales associates in 2005. We added 111 people related to the META purchase, including 80 sales associates, accounting for approximately $10.7 million of the increase. In addition to the $10.7 million increase attributable to META, other salary and benefit increases totaled $12.1 million, while bonus expense and sales commissions increased by $6.9 million and $7.0 million, respectively. Also, we had approximately $16.4 million of additional external consulting, facilities, outsourcing, and other charges. These charges were offset by the favorable impact of approximately $4.4 million of lower costs, primarily marketing, and production. SG&A expenses in Calendar 2005 benefited by the reversal of $0.9 million of prior years incentive compensation program accruals. During Calendar 2004, SG&A expenses benefited by the reversal of $3.3 million of prior year incentive compensation program accruals. During Calendar 2004 the Company reduced its allowance for doubtful accounts by $3.7 million as a result of increased collections and a decline in write-offs. Depreciation expense for Calendar 2005 decreased 8% to $25.5 million, compared to $27.6 million for Calendar 2004. The reduction is due to a decline in capital spending, reflecting our disciplined capital spending on projects that support our strategic initiatives. Amortization of intangibles increased to $10.2 million in Calendar 2005 from $0.7 million in the prior year due to the amortization of the $25.6 million of intangibles asset acquired in the META acquisition. The majority of the intangibles related to the META acquisition will be fully amortized by the end of Calendar 2006. 16 Table of Contents Goodwill impairments were $2.7 million in Calendar 2004, reflecting the write-off of goodwill related to the closing of certain operations in Latin America and other non-core product lines. Other charges during Calendar 2005 were $29.2 million, which includes $10.7 million related to workforce reductions, $6.0 million for an option buyback, $8.2 million related to a reduction in office space, and $4.3 million of other charges. The Company severed a total of 150 employees in Calendar 2005 and estimates the annualized savings from the termination of these employees to be approximately $15.2 million. The Company plans to reinvest a significant portion of these savings into improving its products, processes, and infrastructure to help drive future growth. During the fourth quarter of Calendar 2005, the Company recorded other charges of $1.5 million for costs associated with employee termination severance payments and related benefits for 27 employees. In addition, during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2005 the Company reversed approximately $0.7 million of previously accrued severance benefits because the amounts actually paid were less than estimated. During the third quarter of Calendar 2005, the Company recorded other charges of $6.0 million related to its completion of a one time offer to buy back certain vested and outstanding stock options for cash (See Note 8 Equity and Stock Programs in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). During the second quarter of Calendar 2005, the Company recorded other charges of $8.2 million. Included in the second quarter charge was $8.2 million of costs primarily related to the reduction of office space in San Jose, California, by consolidating employees from two buildings into one. The Company also recorded a charge of $0.6 million associated with certain stock combination expenses, which was offset by a reversal of approximately $0.9 million of accrued severance and other charges that the Company determined would not be paid. During the first quarter of Calendar 2005, the Company recorded other charges of $14.3 million. Included in the charge was $10.6 million for costs associated with employee termination severance payments and related benefits. The workforce reduction was a continuation of the plan announced in the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004 which resulted in the termination of 123 employees during the three months ended March 31, 2005. In addition, during the first quarter of Calendar 2005 the Company also recorded other charges of approximately $3.7 million, primarily related to a restructuring of the Company international operations. Other charges during Calendar 2004 were $35.8 million. Included in this amount was $29.7 million related to severance and benefits for 203 employees, including costs of $7.7 million related to the departure of our President and COO and our Chairman and CEO. Of the 203 employees, 132 were severed as part of the action plan announced in the fourth quarter of Calendar 2003. During Calendar 2004 the Company also revised its estimate of previously recorded costs and losses associated with excess facilities and recorded $2.3 million of additional provisions. The revised estimate was due to a decline in market lease rates for expected subleases, as well as a reduction in estimated periods of subleases. The Company also recorded charges in Calendar 2004 of $1.9 million related to the restructuring of certain internal systems, and $1.8 million for charges related to the exit from certain international and other non-core operations. (Loss) gain on investments, net for Calendar 2005 includes non-cash charges of $5.1 million and $0.2 million during the first and second quarters, respectively, primarily related to writedowns of its investment in SI Venture Fund II, L.P. ( SI II ) which the Company had decided to sell in the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004. The Company recorded the writedown in the first quarter of Calendar 2005 to reduce the investment to its estimated net realizable value after receiving preliminary indications of interest to acquire the investment for less than its recorded value. The Company took the additional writedown in the second quarter of Calendar 2005 based on a preliminary sale agreement for which the proceeds were less than the recorded value. On August 2, Calendar 2005, the Company sold its investment in SI II for approximately $1.3 million, with no resulting gain or loss recorded on the sale since the investment was already at net realizable value. During the fourth quarter of Calendar 2005, the Company sold an investment in common stock it had acquired in the META acquisition for $0.7 million, and recorded a loss of $0.5 million, which is recorded in (Loss) gain from investments, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. (Loss) gain on investments, net for Calendar 2004 was a loss of $3.0 million. In the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004, the Company made the decision to liquidate its equity investments in SI Venture Associates, L.L.C. ( SI I ) and to sell the Company interest in SI II. SI I and SI II were venture capital funds engaged in making investments in early to mid-stage IT-based or Internet-enabled companies, of which the Company owned 100% of SI I and 22% of SI II at December 31, 2004. In the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004, the Company recorded a charge of $1.5 million related to the liquidation of SI I, to include $0.8 million for the writedown of the investment and $0.7 million in related shutdown charges. No charges were recorded on SI II in the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004 related to the planned sale since management believed that the carrying value of the investment approximated its net realizable value. In the third quarter of Calendar 2004, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $2.2 million related to the transfer of an investment to SI II, as well as a decrease in the Company ownership percentage in SI II of seven hundred basis points. The carrying value of the Company investments held by SI I and SI II were zero and $6.7 million, respectively, at December 31, 2004. Other (expense), net for Calendar 2005 of $2.9 million consists primarily of net foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Other (expense), net of $3.9 million in Calendar 2004 includes the non-cash write-off of $3.1 million of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments associated with certain of our operations in South America that we have closed. As a result of this decision we were required to reclassify these currency adjustments that have been accumulated within equity to earnings, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52 Foreign Currency Translation. 17 Table of Contents Provision for income taxes was 144.8% and 51.0% of income before income taxes for Calendar 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for Calendar 2005, as compared to that of Calendar 2004, is principally due to the fact that the Company generated less income in low tax jurisdictions as compared to the prior year and recorded valuation allowances against capital losses and foreign tax credit carryforwards. The impact of these items is offset, in part, by benefits taken to reduce the overall tax expense on repatriated earnings as well as reductions for interest costs related to tax contingencies. The impact of the various positive and negative adjustments is amplified by lower pretax book income in 2005 as compared to 2004. In Calendar 2004, we took a $5.0 million tax charge in anticipation of repatriating approximately $52.0 million in earnings from our non-US subsidiaries in Calendar 2005. The repatriation was expected to qualify for a one-time reduced tax rate pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act. (AJCA). The charge was partially offset by a benefit of $2.5 million to release valuation allowance on foreign tax credits that were expected to be utilized before they expired. In March 2005, we repatriated approximately $52.0 million in cash from our non-US subsidiaries. Also in 2005, we took into account technical corrections issued by the Treasury Department related to repatriating earnings under the AJCA. As a result of favorable provisions in the technical corrections, we realized a tax benefit of $3.6 million in 2005 that reduced the cumulative charge on the repatriated earnings to $1.4 million. In addition, as a consequence of the application of the technical corrections, we re-evaluated our ability to use foreign tax credits in the future and took a charge of $2.5 million to re-establish valuation allowance for foreign tax credits that will more likely than not expire unused. Excluding the effect of certain one-time charges, the provision for income taxes for calendar years ended 2005 and 2004 would have been 36.6% and 36.0% respectively. In 2005, the most significant of these one-time charges included expenses related to the acquisition and integration of META, various capital losses and impairments, charges associated with the buy-back of under water stock options, and severance and facilities reduction charges. In 2004, the most significant of these one-time charges included nondeductible goodwill impairment, the write-off of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments associated with certain South American operations, various capital losses and impairments, and severance and facilities reduction charges. 2005 SEGMENT RESULTS We evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin. Gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation, amortization of intangibles, goodwill impairments, income taxes, META integration charges, and other charges. Gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues. Research Research revenues increased 9%, or $42.5 million, when comparing Calendar 2005 and Calendar 2004, with META contributing approximately $29.0 million, and growth in our Executive Programs accounting for the majority of the rest of the increase. The impact of foreign currency was immaterial. Excluding the impact of META and foreign currency, revenue was up 3%. Research gross contribution of $310.0 million for Calendar 2005 increased from the $292.7 million for Calendar 2004, while the gross contribution margin for Calendar 2005 decreased to 59% from 61% in the prior year. The decrease in the gross contribution margin in Calendar 2005 was primarily due to increased revenues from our Executive Programs, which have lower margins than our core subscription products, an increase in compensation costs, mostly due to headcount related to the META acquisition, and the impact of converting META contract value to Gartner contract value. We have now transacted on approximately 95% of the META contract value. Research contract value, an indicator of future research revenue, was $592.6 million at December 31, 2005, an increase of 16%, or $83.4 million, from $509.2 million at December 31, 2004. Approximately half of the increase in contract value is attributable to the META acquisition. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, contract value increased by approximately 13%. The research contract value of $592.6 million at December 31, 2005 represents our highest reported contract value since September 30, 2000. 18 Table of Contents At December 31, 2005, our research client retention rate increased 1 percentage point to 81% from 80% at December 31, 2004, while our wallet retention rate was 93% compared to 95% at December 31, 2004. Our Executive Program membership was 3,522 at December 31, 2005, up 18% from 2,975 at December 31, 2004, which is attributed to new business growth in North America and EMEA, as well as improved renewal rates and clients obtained as a result of the META acquisition. Our Executive Program membership remains the largest in our industry and has almost doubled in the last three years. Consulting Consulting revenues of $301.1 million for Calendar 2005 were up 16%, or $41.7 million, when compared to the $259.4 million in Calendar 2004, with META contributing approximately $18.0 million of the revenue growth. The revenue increase reflects strong organic growth in our core consulting services as well as in the performance-fee portion of our consulting business. The increase in the performance-fee business for Calendar 2005 includes revenues that the Company did not expect to close until the first quarter of 2006, and as a result our margin for that quarter will be impacted. The growth in our core consulting services reflects our continuing execution of our strategy of focusing on fewer accounts, attracting larger deals through integrated solutions, and enhancing engagement profitability through improved resource management. Revenue in Calendar 2005 increased despite our exit from certain less profitable consulting practices and geographies in Calendar 2004. The effect of foreign currency exchange rates reduced revenues by approximately 1%. Excluding the impact of META and foreign currency, revenue was up 11%. Consulting gross contribution of $125.7 million for Calendar 2005 increased significantly from the prior year, up 36% from the $92.7 million for Calendar 2004, primarily due to higher profitability per engagement, as well as the impact of the timing of performance-fees discussed above. Gross contribution margin for Calendar 2005 increased to 42% from 36% in the prior year. Consulting utilization rates were 62% during Calendar 2005 as compared to 63% during Calendar 2004, while our billable rate was over $350 per hour in Calendar 2005, compared to a $318 per hour billable rate in Calendar 2004. Our billable headcount increased to 525 at December 31, 2005 as compared to 475 at December 31, 2004, an 11% increase, primarily related to consultants from the META acquisition. Our average annualized revenue per billable headcount was approximately $390,000 in Calendar 2005 compared to $342,000 in Calendar 2004. Consulting backlog, which represents future revenues to be recognized from in-process consulting, measurement and SAS, increased 7%, or $8.1 million, to $119.9 million at December 31, 2005, compared to $111.8 million at December 31, 2004. Events. Events revenues increased 9%, or $12.9 million, to $151.3 million for Calendar 2005, compared to $138.4 million for Calendar 2004, with approximately $2.4 million of the increase related to META. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negligible effect on revenues when comparing Calendar 2005 to Calendar 2004. Excluding META and foreign currency, revenue was up 8%. The revenue increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of events, to 70 for Calendar 2005 compared to 56 in the prior year period, as we added 15 new events in new topic areas and geographies. Revenue increased to a lesser extent due to continued performance from our recurring events, for which revenue was up about 5% year over year. The number of attendees at our Events increased by about 14% in Calendar 2005 compared to Calendar 2004, rising to 35,502 from 31,223, respectively. Gross contribution of $76.1 million for Calendar 2005 was 9.6% higher than the $69.5 million recorded in Calendar 2004. As a percentage of revenues, gross contribution was 50% during Calendar 2005 and Calendar 2004. Since new events typically run at lower margins in their first year of existence, the 15 new events we launched in Calendar 2005 had slightly lower margins than existing events. However, in addition to launching these new events, we continued to rationalize our existing portfolio by exiting from events that no longer met our profit targets. As a result of this active portfolio management, we were able to deliver a flat contribution margin year-over-year. CALENDAR 2004 VERSUS CALENDAR 2003 Total revenues increased 4% to $893.8 million during Calendar 2004 from $858.4 million during Calendar 2003. Research revenues increased 3% in Calendar 2004 to $480.5 million, compared to $466.9 million in Calendar 2003, and comprised approximately 54% of total revenues in both Calendar 2004 and Calendar 2003. Consulting revenues in Calendar 2004 of $259.4 were up slightly compared to the $258.6 in Calendar 2003, and comprised approximately 29% and 30% of total revenues in Calendar 2004 and Calendar 2003, respectively. Events revenues were $138.4 million in Calendar 2004, an increase of 16% from the $119.4 million in Calendar 2003, and comprised approximately 15% of total revenues in Calendar 2004 versus 14% in Calendar 2003. Other revenues, consisting principally of reprint and software licensing fees, increased 15% to $15.5 million in Calendar 2004 from $13.6 million in Calendar 2003. The effects of foreign currency translation had approximately a 3% positive effect on total revenues for Calendar 2004 compared to Calendar 2003. Excluding the positive effects of foreign currency translation, revenues would have increased approximately 1% year- 19 Table of Contents over-year. See the Segment Results section below for a further discussion of segment revenues. Revenues increased in all regions year-over-year. Revenues from sales to United States and Canadian clients increased 4% to $559.4 million in Calendar 2004 from $535.7 million in Calendar 2003. Revenues from sales to clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa ( EMEA ) increased 4% to $263.0 million in Calendar 2004 from $252.3 million in Calendar 2003. Revenues from sales to clients in other international regions increased 1% to $71.4 million in Calendar 2004 from $70.5 million in Calendar 2003. Cost of services and product development increased 6% during Calendar 2004 to $434.5 million from $410.7 million during Calendar 2003. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, cost of services and product development would have increased by 2%, primarily due to increased investment in our core Research business. Growth in our Executive Programs and Events businesses also contributed to higher costs in Calendar 2004. As a percentage of sales, cost of services and product development increased to 48.6% from 47.8% in the prior year period. Cost of services and product development in Calendar 2004 benefited from the reversal of $3.5 million of prior years incentive compensation. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5%, to $349.8 million during Calendar 2004 from $333.4 million during Calendar 2003. SG&A would have increased by approximately 2% excluding the negative effects of foreign currency translation. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expense increased slightly in Calendar 2004, to 39.1% of sales from 38.8% in Calendar 2003. SG&A expenses benefited during Calendar 2004 from the reversal of $3.3 million of prior years incentive compensation, as well as a reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts of $3.7 million due to increased collections and a decline in bad debt write-offs as a percentage of sales. Depreciation expense for Calendar 2004 decreased 23% to $27.7 million, compared to $36.0 million for Calendar 2003. The decrease was due to a reduction in capital spending during Calendar 2004, Calendar 2003 and Calendar 2002 relative to the capital spending during Fiscal 2001 and 2000, which led to a decrease in depreciation expense. Amortization of intangibles decreased 46% when comparing Calendar 2004 to Calendar 2003 due to certain intangible assets having been fully amortized since the third quarter of Calendar 2003. Goodwill impairments were $2.7 million in Calendar 2004 compared to $0 in Calendar 2003, reflecting the write-off of goodwill related to the closing of certain operations in Latin America and other non-core product lines. Other charges during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004 were $11.9 million, of which $5.9 million was for severance and benefits related to a workforce reduction of 40 employees. Other charges of $4.3 million during the third quarter of Calendar 2004 primarily included severance costs associated with the departure of our President and our former CEO of $3.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Other charges of $9.1 million during the second quarter of Calendar 2004 included $3.8 million of severance costs associated with the departure of our former CEO, as well as $5.3 million of costs associated with the termination of 30 employees. During the first quarter of Calendar 2004, other charges of $10.5 million were primarily associated with a realignment of our workforce. This workforce realignment was a continuation of the action plan initiated during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2003 and resulted in the termination of 132 employees, or approximately 4% of our workforce, bringing the total terminations associated with the action plan to 262 employees. For all of Calendar 2004, we recorded total charges of $29.7 million related to the realignment of our workforce, including costs of $7.7 million related to the departure of our President and our former CEO. The realignment resulted in the termination of 203 employees for the full year. The annualized savings from the termination of these employees would be approximately $23.3 million. However, we plan to reinvest a significant portion of these savings into improving our products, processes, infrastructure, and to fund increases in sales capacity to drive future growth. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004, we revised our estimates of previously recorded costs and losses associated with excess facilities and recorded $2.3 million of additional provisions. The revised estimate was due to a decline in market lease rates for expected subleases, as well as a reduction in estimated periods of subleases. We also recorded a charge of $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004 related to the abandonment of certain internal systems, and $1.8 million for charges related to the exit from certain international and other non-core operations. Other charges of $29.7 million during Calendar 2003 were for costs for employee severance and benefits associated with workforce reductions initiated under two separate actions, $5.4 million during the first quarter of Calendar 2003 and $14.6 million during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2003. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2003, we revised our estimates of previously recorded costs and losses associated with excess facilities and recorded $9.7 million of additional provisions. The revised estimate was due to a decline in market lease rates for expected subleases, as well as a reduction in estimated periods of subleases. The workforce reduction that occurred during the first quarter of Calendar 2003 was a continuation of the action taken in Transition 2002, which resulted in the termination of 92 employees, or approximately 2% of our workforce. The purpose of this reduction was to reduce costs in underperforming segments. The workforce reduction that occurred during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2003 resulted in the termination of 130 employees, or approximately 3% of our workforce. The purpose of this workforce reduction was part of an effort to streamline operations, strengthen key consulting practices, and align our organizational structure to focus on client needs. These remaining payments 20 Table of Contents associated with the workforce reduction were completed in the second quarter of Calendar 2004 and were funded out of existing cash. (Loss) gain on investments, net during Calendar 2004 was a loss of $3.0 million. In the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004, we recorded a charge of $0.8 million related to the liquidation of SI I. In addition, we recorded an additional charge of $0.7 million in related liquidation costs, which is recorded in Other charges. In the third quarter of Calendar 2004, we recorded a charge of $2.2 million for the transfer of our investment in TruSecure to SI II, as well as a decrease in our ownership percentage in SI II of seven hundred basis points. As a result of this transfer and the decrease in ownership, we were relieved of all future capital calls, which had totaled $4.0 million. See Note 3 Investments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (Loss) gain on investments, net during Calendar 2003 was a gain of $4.7 which included a $5.5 million insurance recovery received during Calendar 2003 associated with previously incurred losses arising from the sale of a business. Also included was an impairment loss of $0.9 million associated with a minority-owned investment not publicly traded. We evaluated the investment for impairment because of the investee recapitalization due to its lack of capital resources to redeem its mandatorily redeemable equity, which led us to write the investment down to our estimate of fair value. The conversion of our outstanding convertible debt to equity during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2003 decreased our interest expense. However, due to the new credit agreement signed in the third quarter of Calendar 2004, interest expense will increase in the future. Other (expense), net for Calendar 2004 of $3.9 million includes the non-cash write-off of $3.1 million of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments associated with certain of our operations in South America that we have closed. As a result of this decision we were required to reclassify these currency adjustments that have been accumulated within equity to earnings, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52 Foreign Currency Translation. Other income, net for Calendar 2003 of $0.5 million consists primarily of net foreign exchange gains. Provision for income taxes was 51.0% and 33.4% of income before income taxes for Calendar 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for Calendar 2004, as compared to that of Calendar 2003, reflects the impact of a planned repatriation of foreign earnings in Calendar 2005 at a one-time favorable tax rate pursuant to the Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Excluding the effect of certain one-time charges, the provision for income taxes for calendar years ended 2004 and 2003 would have been 36.0% and 33.0% respectively. In Calendar 2004, the most significant of these one-time charges included nondeductible goodwill impairment, the write-off of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments associated with certain South American operations, various capital losses and impairments, and severance and facilities reduction charges. In Calendar 2003, the most significant of these one-time charges included various capital losses and impairments, and severance and facilities reduction charges. SEGMENT RESULTS We evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin. Gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation, amortization of intangibles, goodwill impairments, and other charges. Gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues. Research Research revenues increased 3% when comparing Calendar 2004 and Calendar 2003, but excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates, revenue was flat. Research gross contribution of $292.7 million for Calendar 2004 decreased slightly from the $292.9 million for Calendar 2003, while gross contribution margin for Calendar 2004 decreased to 61% from 63% in the prior year. The decrease in the gross contribution margin in Calendar 2004 was primarily due to increased revenues from our executive programs, which have lower margins than our core subscription products, as well as continued investment in our people, products, and processes required to provide Research growth. Research contract value, an indicator of future research revenue, was $509.2 million at December 31, 2004, an increase of 6% from $482.2 million at December 31, 2003, with roughly half of the increase due to the effects of foreign currency. The research contract value of $509.2 million at December 31, 2004 represented our highest reported contract value since the first quarter of Calendar 2002. During this period, we focused on stabilizing and then growing revenue in our core Research business. This continued focus began to yield the desired outcome during the latter half of Calendar 2003. We ended the latter half of 2003 with two consecutive quarters of sequential increases in contract value after seven consecutive quarters of sequentially decreasing contract value. Contract value increased sequentially again in the first quarter of Calendar 2004, decreased slightly during the second quarter of Calendar 2004, and increased sequentially again in both the third and fourth quarters of Calendar 2004. At December 31, 2004, our client retention rates increased 2 percentage points to 80% as compared to the same measure at December 31, 2003. Wallet retention increased 6 percentage points during Calendar 2004 to 95%. While wallet retention rates held steady or climbed 21 Table of Contents over the four quarters of Calendar 2004, client retention dipped slightly in the first quarter and then climbed for the remainder of the year. Our Executive Program membership was 2,708 at December 31, 2004, up 16% from 2,332 at December 31, 2003, which is attributed to new business growth in North America and EMEA, as well as improved renewal rates. Consulting Consulting revenues of $259.4 for Calendar 2004 were up slightly when compared to the $258.6 million in Calendar 2003. Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rates, revenues would have decreased approximately 4% in Calendar 2004 compared to Calendar 2003. Adjusted for currency effects, Consulting revenue decreased compared to the prior year as a result of our realignment of our business to exit certain less profitable consulting practices and geographies. Consulting gross contribution of $92.7 million for Calendar 2004 increased 7% from the $86.8 million for Calendar 2003, while gross contribution margin for Calendar 2004 increased to 36% from 34% in the prior year. The increase in the gross contribution margin was primarily attributable to higher consultant utilization rates, which were approximately 63% during Calendar 2004 as compared to approximately 54% during Calendar 2003, as the effects of the realignment were realized, and the reduction in our billable headcount to 475 at December 31, 2004 as compared to 526 at December 31, 2003, a 10% decrease. Our billable rate was $327.00 per hour in Calendar 2004, a 7% increase from the $306.00 rate in Calendar 2003, which is due to more efficient use of staff globally and a higher billable rate in EMEA due to the effects of foreign exchange. Consulting backlog increased 12% to $111.8 million at December 31, 2004, compared to $99.7 million at December 31, 2003. Our Consulting business ended Calendar 2004 with the continuation of the positive trend that began in Calendar 2003, when we ended that year with two consecutive quarters of sequential increases in backlog after five consecutive quarters of sequential decreases. Due to the realignment in which we exited certain practices and geographies, consulting backlog decreased to $91.7 million at March 31, 2004, but increased to $97.7 million at June 30, 2004 and $103.4 million at September 30, 2004, as business ramped up in our areas of focus. Events Events revenues increased 16% to $138.4 million for Calendar 2004, compared to $119.4 million for Calendar 2003. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had approximately a 2% favorable impact on revenues when comparing Calendar 2004 to Calendar 2003. Revenues increased despite having one less event during Calendar 2004 as compared to Calendar 2003, with 56 and 57 events, respectively. Revenue for Calendar 2004 increased due to higher attendance and higher average exhibitor revenue, resulting in higher average revenue per event in our recurring events. Attendance at Events increased to 31,223 in Calendar 2004 from 27,547 in Calendar 2003, a 13% increase, which is attributed to the popularity of the topics offered. Gross contribution of $69.5 million for Calendar 2004 was 24% higher than the $56.0 million recorded in Calendar 2003. As a percentage of revenues, gross contribution increased to 50% during Calendar 2004 from 47% during Calendar 2003. The increase in gross contribution margin was due to the mix of events as well as lower personnel and marketing costs. Also, during Calendar 2003, we invested more in marketing and promoting our events to maintain our attendance levels during a weak economy, especially in the technology sector. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Calendar 2005 Cash provided by operating activities totaled $27.1 million for Calendar 2005, compared to $48.2 million for the prior year, a $21.1 million decline. The net decrease in cash flow from operating activities was due primarily to the payment of $35.0 million of META integration payments, higher employee salary costs, primarily related to higher headcount due to the acquisition of META, and to a lesser extent, a shift in the mix of our products in the Research segment from higher margin core research to lower margin Executive Programs. Offsetting these decreases was a $12.0 million reduction in bonus payments and a decline of approximately $10.0 million in severance and related payments. Cash used in investing activities increased to $181.0 million during Calendar 2005 as compared to $29.0 million in the prior year, primarily due to the acquisition of META, which was completed on April 1, 2005. The Company net cash investment in META was approximately $176.4 million of cash paid, including transaction costs, less the $15.1 million acquired from META. Offsetting the cash paid for META was a decline in capital expenditures, which decreased $2.7 million for Calendar 2005 as compared to Calendar 2004, and $2.1 million in cash received from the sale of the Company investment in SI II and other investments. Cash provided by financing activities totaled $70.0 million for Calendar 2005, compared to $97.2 million of cash used for Calendar 2004. The increase was primarily driven by the borrowing of additional debt in Calendar 2005 and cash used in Calendar 2004 for stock repurchases. We had an additional $56.7 million of debt at December 31, 2005 compared to the prior year end. During Calendar 2005 we borrowed $327.0 million and we repaid $271.3 million. We borrowed $250.0 million on June 29, 2005 related to the refinancing of our debt by 22 Table of Contents entering into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as discussed in Note 6 Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), $67.0 million in April under the revolver related to the META acquisition, and $10.0 million under the revolver which was used to make the second quarter of Calendar 2005 quarterly payment on the term loan. Of the $271.3 million repaid during Calendar 2005, we paid $247.0 million on June 29, 2005 related to the refinancing, we made $23.4 million in quarterly debt payments, and we paid $0.9 million for a note payable we acquired in the META acquisition. We also paid $1.1 million in debt issue costs during the second quarter of Calendar 2005 related to the refinancing of our debt. We received proceeds from stock issued for stock plans of $31.0 million during Calendar 2005 as compared to $67.9 million in the prior year as a result of our higher stock price during 2004 as compared to 2005, which resulted in more stock option exercises by employees in 2004. The Company used $6.0 million of cash, including expenses, to buy back employee stock options in the third and fourth quarters of Calendar 2005. In the fourth quarter of Calendar 2005 we used $9.6 million of cash to repurchase our stock, while in 2004 we used $346.1 million of cash for a stock tender offer and $6.1 million of cash for treasury stock purchases. At December 31, 2005, cash and cash equivalents totaled $70.2 million. The effect of exchange rates decreased cash and cash equivalents by $6.0 million during Calendar 2005, and was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies, primarily the Euro and Sterling. Calendar 2004 Cash provided by operating activities during Calendar 2004 totaled $48.3 million compared to $136.3 million in Calendar 2003. The net decrease in cash flow from operating activities of $88.0 million was due to several factors. We paid $27.0 million in bonuses during 2004 compared to zero in Calendar 2003. No bonuses were paid during Calendar 2003 as they had previously been paid during the quarter ended December 31, 2002 but are now being paid during the first half of the year as a result of our change in fiscal year that became effective January 1, 2003. As a result, the 2003 bonuses were paid in Calendar 2004. Further, we paid a portion of our 2004 bonuses in the third quarter of Calendar 2004 in accordance with the current year corporate bonus plan. Additionally, cash from operating activities declined because we paid approximately $14.0 million more in severance during Calendar 2004 than in Calendar 2003. The net decrease in cash flow from operating activities was also due to the accelerated collection of receivables in Calendar 2003 which improved operating cash flow in that year by approximately $26.0 million, which was not repeated in Calendar 2004. Lastly, approximately $15.0 million of certain accrued liabilities booked in the fourth quarter of Calendar 2003 were paid in the first quarter of Calendar 2004. Cash used in investing activities increased to $29.0 million during Calendar 2004 as compared to $25.4 million for Calendar 2003. The increase was primarily due to $3.9 million we prepaid related to the acquisition of META. Capital expenditures in Calendar 2004 of $25.1 million were 15% lower than the $28.9 million in Calendar 2003. During Calendar 2003, we received an insurance recovery of $5.5 million, and we funded $2.0 million of our capital commitment to SI II. Cash used by financing activities totaled $97.3 million for Calendar 2004, compared to $3.0 million used in Calendar 2003. We purchased $352.3 million of our common stock for treasury during Calendar 2004, of which $346.2 million represents the tender offer and Silver Lake repurchases, inclusive of related costs, as compared to $43.4 million during the prior year. We received proceeds from stock issued for stock plans of $67.8 million during Calendar 2004, as compared to $41.7 million during the prior year. This increase is a result of higher stock option exercises by our employees as increases in our stock price caused a significantly larger percentage of our vested stock options to be in the money during Calendar 2004 as compared to Calendar 2003. We borrowed $200 million related to the tender in the third quarter of Calendar 2004, receiving proceeds, net of debt issuance costs, of $197.2 million. We repaid $10.0 million of this debt in the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004. At December 31, 2004, cash and cash equivalents totaled $160.1 million. The effect of exchange rates increased cash and cash equivalents by $8.1 million during Calendar 2004, and was due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies, primarily the Euro and Sterling. Obligations and Commitments The Company has a $325.0 million, unsecured five-year Credit Agreement with a bank group led by JPMorgan Chase Bank consisting of a $200.0 million term loan and a $125.0 million revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility may be increased up to $175.0 million. As of December 31, 2005, there was $196.7 million outstanding on the term loan and $50.0 million outstanding on the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had approximately $45.6 million borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility. The term loan will be repaid in 19 quarterly installments, with the final payment due on June 29, 2010. The revolving credit facility may be used for loans, and up to $15.0 million may be used for letters of credit. The revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until June 29, 2010, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. The loans bear interest, at the Company option, at a rate equal to the greatest of the Administrative Agent prime rate, the Administrative Agent rate for three-month certificates of deposit (adjusted for statutory reserves) and the average rate on overnight federal funds plus 1 / 2 of 1% plus a spread equal to between 0.00% and 0.75% 23 Table of Contents depending on the Company leverage ratio as of the fiscal quarter most recently ended, or at the Eurodollar rate (adjusted for statutory reserves) plus a spread equal to between 1.00% and 1.75%, depending on the Company leverage ratio as of the fiscal quarter most recently ended. The Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive loan covenants, including, among others, financial covenants requiring a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and a minimum annualized contract value ratio and covenants limiting Gartner ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make acquisitions, be acquired, dispose of assets, pay dividends, repurchase stock, make capital expenditures and make investments. Gartner obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by Gartner U.S. subsidiaries. It also contains events of default that include, among others, non-payment of principal, interest or fees, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, violation of covenants, cross defaults to certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, material judgments, and events constituting a change of control. The occurrence of an event of default will increase the applicable rate of interest by 2.0% and could result in the acceleration of Gartner obligations under the Credit Agreement and an obligation of any or all of the guarantors to pay the full amount of Gartner obligations under the Credit Agreement. In December 2005 the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the base interest rate risk on the term loan. The effect of the swap is to convert the floating base rate on the term loan to a fixed rate. Under the swap terms, the Company will pay a 4.885% fixed rate and in return will receive a three-month LIBOR rate. The three-month LIBOR rate received on the swap will match the base rate paid on the term loan since both use three-month LIBOR. The swap had an initial notional value of $200.0 million which will decline as payments are made on the term loan so that the amount outstanding under the term loan and the notional amount of the swap will always be equal. The swap had a notional amount of $196.7 million at December 31, 2005, which was the same as the outstanding amount of the term loan. In October 2005, the Company Board of Directors authorized a $100.0 million common share repurchase program. Repurchases under the program will be made from time-to-time through open market purchases and/or block trades. Repurchases are subject to the availability of our common stock, prevailing market conditions, the trading price of the Company common stock, and our financial performance. The Company intends to fund the repurchases from cash flow from operations but may also borrow under the Company existing Credit Agreement. During the fourth quarter of Calendar 2005, the Company repurchased 837,800 shares of its common stock under this program for a total purchase price of $11.1 million, of which $1.5 million was paid in early January 2006 when the related share repurchase transactions settled. We believe that our existing cash balances, together with cash from our operating activities and the additional borrowing capacity under our amended five-year revolving credit facility, will be sufficient for our expected short-term and foreseeable long-term needs. The following table represents our contractual cash commitments at December 31, 2005 (in millions), including contractual commitments related to the META acquisition. The table excludes interest payments under our credit facility: Less Than 1 - 3 4 - 5 More Than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Operating leases (1) $ 204.9 $ 32.7 $ 54.3 $ 41.2 $ 76.7 Borrowings (2) 246.7 61.7 70.0 115.0 Severance associated with workforce reductions (1) 4.0 3.7 .3 Contract terminations and other (1) 1.7 1.1 .6 Deferred compensation arrangement (3) 16.6 2.3 2.9 2.3 9.1 Common stock repurchase program (4) 1.5 1.5 Miscellaneous service agreements 0.3 0.3 Totals $ 475.7 $ 103.3 $ 128.1 $ 158.5 $ 85.8 (1) Includes liabilities related to META recorded under EITF 95-3 (see Note 2 Acquisition of META in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). (2) The $61.7 million due in less than one year includes $50.0 million drawn on our revolving credit facility. Although the terms of the Credit Agreement do not require payment until 2010, it is currently our intent to repay this amount within one year. (3) Represents a liability under the Company supplemental deferred compensation arrangement (see Note 12 Employee Benefits in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Amounts payable to active employees whose termination date is unknown have been included in the more than 5 years category since the Company cannot estimate when the amounts will be paid.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2005 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections ( SFAS No. 154 ), which will require entities that voluntarily make a change in accounting principle to apply that change retrospectively to prior periods financial statements, unless this would be impracticable. SFAS No. 154 supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes, which previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in the current period net income the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 also makes a distinction between retrospective application of an accounting principle and the restatement of financial statements to reflect the correction of an error. The statement is effective for accounting changes and error corrections made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. In December 2004 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123R, Share-Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). This statement replaces SFAS No. 123 and APB 25 and will require the recognition of expense for share-based payments, to include the value of stock options and other equity awards granted to employees. The revised statement was originally effective for periods beginning after June 15, 2005, with early adoption permitted. On April 21, 2005 the SEC issued a standard that amends the date of compliance with SFAS No. 123R ( the SEC amendment ). Under the SEC amendment, SFAS No. 123R must be adopted beginning with the first interim or annual reporting period of the registrant first fiscal year beginning on or after June 15, 2005. Gartner adopted SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006, under the modified prospective method of adoption. Projecting the amount of future stock compensation expense is inherently difficult as it is dependent on the type and amount of future awards granted, and the volatility and price of our common stock on the date of grant. The Company is currently reviewing its stock compensation strategy and anticipates that it will make changes to the types of equity awards that it will grant in the future. Based on our current estimates, we project that the adoption of SFAS 123R will result in $12.0 million to $14.0 million of pre-tax expense in Calendar 2006, which will have a materially negative impact on our earnings. 25 Table of Contents
