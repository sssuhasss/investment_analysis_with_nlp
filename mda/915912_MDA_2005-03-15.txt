ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We focus on the investment in and ownership and operation of apartment communities in high barrier-to-entry markets of the United States. As of February 28, 2005, we had 138 current operating communities, which are the primary contributors to our overall operating performance. The net operating income of these communities, which is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance, is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets, our rental rates and occupancy levels, and our ability to control operating costs. Our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of our newly developed and acquired apartment communities. We seek to create long-term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms; deploying that capital to develop, redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barrier-to-entry markets; operating apartment communities; and selling communities when they no longer meet our long-term investment strategy and when pricing is attractive. This report, including the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations, contains forward-looking statements that predict or indicate future events or trends and that do not report historical matters. Actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such statements as a result of the risk factors set forth on page 54 of this report. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes included elsewhere in this report. Business Description and Community Information Overview We believe that apartment communities present an attractive long-term investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle. We intend to continue to pursue real estate investments in markets where constraints to new supply exist, and where new rental household formations are expected to out-pace multifamily permit activity over the course of the real estate cycle. Barriers-to-entry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply. We regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets, which are located in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Pacific Northwest, and Northern and Southern California regions of the United States. Our strategy is to deeply penetrate these markets with a broad range of products and services and an intense focus on our customer. A substantial majority of our communities are upscale, which generally command among the highest rents in their markets. However, we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points, consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services. We believe that, over an entire business cycle, lower housing affordability and the limited new supply of apartment homes in our markets will result in a higher propensity to rent and larger increases in cash flow relative to other markets. However, throughout the business cycle, apartment market fundamentals, and therefore operating cash flows, are affected by overall economic conditions. A number of our markets experienced economic contraction due to job losses in 2002 and 2003, particularly in the technology, telecom and financial services sectors. This resulted in a prolonged period of weak apartment market fundamentals as reflected in declining rental rates and demand. However, 2004 was a year of transition, where the economy showed signs of an early phase recovery, as evidenced by modest job growth and declining unemployment claims. The improvement in the economic environment has resulted in more stabilized apartment market fundamentals, as reflected in the following operating results achieved within our Established Community portfolio specifically during the last three months of 2004: we achieved both sequential and year-over-year revenue growth, our second year-over-year increase since 2001; 38 economic occupancy stabilized and remained at approximately 95% in each of our markets, despite a seasonal decline in leasing; concessions per move-in declined both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis; and we achieved the first sequential increase in average rental rates since 2001. Based on these results we believe that 2005 will be a year of continued growth. We expect that with continued job growth in our markets, apartment market fundamentals (the demand/supply balance) will continue to improve such that apartment rental demand will outpace new supply by a ratio of almost two to one. The improvement may not be experienced evenly throughout our markets, but is nevertheless expected to result in overall revenue growth for our Established Community portfolio in 2005. In anticipation of continued improvement in apartment fundamentals and stronger apartment demand, we have increased our development and acquisition volume. During 2004, we increased our level of acquisition activity in preparation of the closing of a discretionary investment fund. In addition, we continued to secure new Development Rights, as discussed below, bringing our pipeline for potential development opportunities to a new high. However, we continued to dispose of communities in 2004 in response to opportunities to realize value. In 2005, we expect to continue acquisitions for the discretionary investment fund, particularly potential redevelopment opportunities, and to continue to be an opportunistic seller, while increasing our development activity over 2004 levels. Our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities, communities in various stages of development ( Development Communities ), and Development Rights (i.e., land or land options held for development), as further described in Item 2 of this report. Our current operating communities are further distinguished as Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities, Lease-Up Communities and Redevelopment Communities. Established Communities are generally operating communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, which allows the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared and monitored between years. Other Stabilized Communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the current year, but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year. Lease-Up Communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved. Redevelopment Communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year. A more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in Note 9, Segment Reporting, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Although each of these categories is important to our business, we generally evaluate overall operating, industry and market trends based on the operating results of Established Communities, for which a detailed discussion can be found in Results of Operations as part of our discussion of overall operating results. We evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition, disposition, development, redevelopment and financing activities within Other Stabilized, Redevelopment and Development Communities, for which detailed discussions can be found in Liquidity and Capital Resources. As of December 31, 2004, we owned or held an ownership interest in 148 apartment communities containing 42,810 apartment homes in ten states and the District of Columbia, of which ten communities were under construction and four communities were under reconstruction. In addition, we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in Development Rights to develop an additional 49 communities that, if developed in the manner expected, will contain an estimated 13,491 apartment homes. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, or different estimates or assumptions had been made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we 39 consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results and that may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. As a REIT that owns, operates and develops apartment communities, our critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, cost capitalization, asset impairment evaluation and REIT status. A discussion of all of our accounting policies, including further discussion of the critical accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 1, Organization and Significant Accounting Policies of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Rental income related to leases is recognized on an accrual basis when due from residents in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases. In accordance with our standard lease terms, rental payments are generally due on a monthly basis. Any cash concessions given at the inception of the lease are amortized over the approximate life of the lease, which is generally one year. A discussion regarding the impact of cash concessions on rental revenue for Established Communities can be found in Results of Operations. Cost Capitalization We capitalize costs during the development of assets (including interest and related loan fees, property taxes and other direct and indirect costs) beginning when active development commences until the asset, or a portion of the asset, is delivered and is ready for its intended use, which is generally indicated by the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. We capitalize costs during redevelopment of apartment homes (including interest and related loan fees, property taxes and other direct and indirect costs) beginning when an apartment home is taken out-of-service for redevelopment until the apartment home redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident. Rental income and operating costs incurred during the initial lease-up or post-redevelopment lease-up period are fully recognized as they accrue. We capitalize pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of Development Rights for which we currently believe future development is probable. These costs include legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs. Future development of these Development Rights is dependent upon various factors, including zoning and regulatory approval, rental market conditions, construction costs and availability of capital. Pre-development costs incurred in the pursuit of Development Rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, deeming future development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are written-off with a charge to expense. We generally capitalize only non-recurring expenditures. We capitalize improvements and upgrades only if the item: (i) exceeds $15,000; (ii) extends the useful life of the asset; and (iii) is not related to making an apartment home ready for the next resident. Under this policy, virtually all capitalized costs are non-recurring, as recurring make-ready costs are expensed as incurred. Recurring make-ready costs include: (i) carpet and appliance replacements; (ii) floor coverings; (iii) interior painting; and (iv) other redecorating costs. Because we expense recurring make-ready costs such as carpet replacements, our expense levels and volatility are greatest in the third quarter of each year as this is when we experience our greatest amount of turnover. We capitalize purchases of personal property, such as computers and furniture, only if the item is a new addition and the item exceeds $2,500. We generally expense replacements of personal property. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, the amounts capitalized (excluding land costs) related to acquisitions, development and redevelopment were $347,091,000, $296,764,000 and $457,851,000, respectively. For Established and Other Stabilized Communities, we recorded non-revenue generating capital expenditures of $12,347,000 or $354 per apartment home in 2004, $11,064,000 or $333 per apartment home in 2003 and $10,214,000 or $302 per apartment home in 2002. In addition, revenue generating capital expenditures, such as water submetering equipment and cable installations, were $637,000, $529,000 and $697,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The average maintenance costs charged to expense per apartment home, including carpet and appliance replacements, related to these communities was $1,348 in 2004, $1,262 in 2003 and $1,224 in 2002. Historically, we have experienced a gradual increase in capitalized costs and expensed 40 maintenance costs per apartment home as the average age of our communities has increased, and expensed maintenance costs have fluctuated with turnover. We expect these trends to continue, with capitalized costs increasing in 2005 over prior year levels as we embark on a number of community upgrades and improvements. Asset Impairment Evaluation If there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates an impairment in the value of a community, our policy is to assess the impairment by making a comparison of the current and projected operating cash flow of the community over its remaining useful life, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying amount of the community. If the carrying amount is in excess of the estimated projected operating cash flow of the community, we would recognize an impairment loss equivalent to an amount required to adjust the carrying amount to its estimated fair market value. Real estate assets held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less the cost to sell. We account for our investments in unconsolidated entities that are not variable interest entities in accordance with Statement of Position 78-9, Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures and Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. If there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates a loss in the value of an investment, we record the loss and reduce the value of the investment to its fair value. A loss in value would be indicated if we could not recover the carrying value of the investment or if the investee could not sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment. REIT Status We are a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated, for federal income tax purposes, as a real estate investment trust, or REIT. We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for the year ended December 31, 1994 and have not revoked such election. A corporate REIT is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income we distribute currently to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. 41 Results of Operations Our year-over-year operating performance is primarily affected by changes in net operating income of our current operating apartment communities due to market conditions, net operating income derived from acquisitions and development completions, the loss of net operating income related to disposed communities and capital market, disposition and financing activity.

This decrease is primarily attributable to lower gains on sales as a result of reduced disposition activity from the historically high levels experienced in 2003, partially offset by increased net operating income from newly developed and acquired communities. Net income available to common stockholders increased $105,059,000 or 67.5% to $260,781,000 in 2003. This increase is primarily attributable to gains on sales of communities due to increased disposition activity, including gains reflected in equity in income of unconsolidated entities, and the absence of impairment losses in 2003, partially offset by increases in interest and depreciation expense. Net operating income ( NOI ) is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental measure to net income of the operating performance of our communities because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate-level or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community, and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. 42 NOI is defined by us as total revenue less direct property operating expenses, including property taxes, and excludes: corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses; investments and investment management; interest income and expense; general and administrative expense; impairment losses; equity in income of unconsolidated entities; minority interest in consolidated partnerships; venture partner interest in profit-sharing; depreciation expense; gain on sale of real estate assets; cumulative effect of change in accounting principle; and income from discontinued operations. NOI does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance. NOI should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity, nor is NOI necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. A calculation of NOI for 2004, 2003 and 2002, along with a reconciliation to net income for each year, is provided in the preceding table. The NOI increase of $35,313,000 in 2004 and decrease of $583,000 in 2003, as compared to the prior years, consist of changes in the following categories (dollars in thousands): 2004 2003 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease)(1) Established Communities $ (3,963 ) $ (27,335 ) Other Stabilized Communities 16,818 9,145 Development and Redevelopment Communities 23,138 18,727 Non-allocated (680 ) (1,120 ) Total $ 35,313 $ (583 ) (1) For purposes of this table, amounts have been restated from amounts previously reported for changes in discountinued operations as described in Note 7, Discountinued Operations - Real Estate Assets Sold or Held for Sale, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The NOI decreases in Established Communities were largely due to the effects of the weakened economy in our markets during 2003 and the first half of 2004. The impact of historical job losses in many of our markets, in addition to strong single-family home sales, aggravated a weak demand environment, which caused market rental rates to decline. However, 2004 was a year of transition, where modest job growth and declining unemployment claims reflected the early stages of an economic recovery. Strengthening apartment fundamentals, along with strong on-site execution, resulted in year-over-year increases in NOI during the latter half of 2004, as evidenced in the diminishing decline in NOI in 2004 as compared to 2003. Based on economic forecasts that project an acceleration in job growth in our markets in 2005 as compared to the modest job growth experienced in 2004, we expect an improved demand/supply ratio in 2005. Our occupancy has reached stabilized levels, and we began to increase rental rates and reduce concessions in the latter half of 2004. In 2005, we expect the positive momentum from 2004 to continue, resulting in growth in revenue from our Established Communities of 2.0% to 4.0% in 2005 as compared to 2004. We aggressively manage operating expenses, which we expect to increase by 1.5% to 3.5% in 2005, resulting in NOI growth for our Established Community portfolio of 2.5% to 4.5% in 2005 as compared to 2004. Rental and other income increased in both 2004 and 2003 due to rental income generated from newly developed and acquired communities, as well as increased occupancy for our Established Communities, partially offset by declines in effective rental rates for our Established Communities. We expect continued improvement in apartment fundamentals due largely to the job growth projected for 2005. 43 Overall Portfolio The weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased to 36,431 apartment homes for 2004 as compared to 32,629 apartment homes for 2003 and 30,437 in 2002. This change is primarily the result of increased homes available from newly developed and acquired communities and an increase in the overall occupancy rate, partially offset by communities sold in 2003 and 2004. The weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home decreased to $1,479 in 2004 as compared to $1,508 in 2003 and $1,539 in 2002, primarily due to the poor demand/supply fundamentals in our markets that resulted in a high concessionary environment in certain of our markets. Established Communities Rental revenue decreased $1,496,000, or 0.3%, in 2004 and $20,424,000, or 4.3%, in 2003. These decreases are due to declining rental rates, partially offset by increased economic occupancy as compared to the prior years. For 2004, the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home decreased 1.8% to $1,418 compared to $1,444 in 2003, partially due to the impact of increased concessions granted throughout 2003 and into 2004. The average economic occupancy increased from 93.8% in 2003 to 95.3% in 2004. Economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community gross revenue. Economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss, as a percentage of gross potential revenue. Gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents. We expect rental revenue from Established Communities to increase 2.0% to 4.0% in 2005 as compared to 2004. Although rental revenue from the Established Community portfolio as a whole was relatively flat in 2004 as compared to 2003, we had increases in Established Communities rental revenue in four of our six regions. The largest increase was in the Mid-Atlantic with an increase in rental revenue of 2.4% between years, reflecting an increase in both economic occupancy and average rental rates. In addition, in Southern California, we were able to increase average rental rates by 1.5%, while also increasing economic occupancy by 0.4%, resulting in an increase in rental revenue of 1.9% between years. The Midwest and Pacific Northwest experienced increases in rental revenue of 2.2% and 1.4%, respectively, during 2004 as compared to 2003, reflecting increased economic occupancy partially offset by declining average rental rates. However, our total rental revenue from Established Communities was impacted by the continued declines in average rental rates in certain Northern California and Northeast markets. Northern California, which accounted for approximately 31.1% of Established Community rental revenue during 2004, experienced a decline in rental revenue of 3.1% in 2004 as compared to 2003, partially related to the continued impact of job losses experienced in the technology sector in prior years. Although economic occupancy in Northern California increased to an average of 95.6% in 2004, average rental rates dropped 3.4% to $1,365 from $1,413 during 2003. However, we began to see signs of improvement in Northern California during the last three months of 2004, as average rental rates and economic occupancy both increased sequentially. Therefore, we expect year-over-year revenue growth in Northern California in 2005. The Northeast region accounted for approximately 34.2% of Established Community rental revenue during 2004. Rental revenue remained relatively flat as compared to 2003, as the region entered the early stages of economic recovery from the job losses experienced in the financial services sector in prior years. Economic occupancy increased by 2.5% during 2004, while average rental rates dropped 2.5% to $1,800 from $1,847 in 2003. The Northeast region appears to be stabilizing, as reflected in year-over-year rental revenue growth during the latter half of 2004. Although we expect pressure on rental rates to continue in the Northeast region, we expect year-over-year revenue growth in the Northeast in 2005, but at a lesser pace than other regions. In accordance with GAAP, cash concessions are amortized as an offset to rental revenue over the approximate lease term, which is generally one year. As a supplemental measure, we also present rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis to help investors evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on GAAP based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as 44 reported by other companies. Rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis also allows investors to understand historical trends in cash concessions, as well as current rental market conditions. The following table reconciles total rental revenue in conformity with GAAP to total rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis for our Established Communities for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 (dollars in thousands). Information for the year ended December 31, 2002 is not presented, as Established Community classification is not applicable prior to January 1, 2003. See Note 9, Segment Reporting, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended 12-31-04 12-31-03 Rental revenue (GAAP basis) $ 439,914 $ 441,410 Concessions amortized 16,260 12,506 Concessions granted (16,418 ) (14,567 ) Rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis $ 439,756 $ 439,349 Year-over-year % change GAAP revenue (0.3 %) n/a Year-over-year % change cash concession based revenue 0.1 % n/a Concessions granted per move-in for Established Communities averaged $974 during 2004, an increase of 15.5% from $843 in 2003. Concessions granted per move-in peaked at $1,109 during the three months ended June 30, 2004, before subsiding to $861 during the three months ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in recent months is expected to continue into 2005 as demand/supply fundamentals improve with job growth and we regain pricing power. However, because we amortize concessions over the lease term, the historically high concessions from 2004 will continue to lower reported operating results in 2005. Management, development and other fees decreased in both 2004 and 2003 as compared to prior years due to a decrease in the number of communities that we manage. In addition, in 2002 we recognized $711,000 in construction management fees in connection with the redevelopment of a community owned by a limited liability company in which we have a membership interest. In 2005, we expect management, development and other fees to increase as we begin to earn asset and property management fees from the discretionary investment fund discussed elsewhere in this report. Direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes increased in both 2004 and 2003 due to the addition of recently developed and acquired apartment homes, coupled with increased expenses due to salary increases and leasing bonuses, as well as increased make-ready costs associated with increasing occupancy. For Established Communities, direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes, increased $2,131,000, or 2.2%, to $141,823,000 in 2004 due primarily to increased salaries and leasing bonuses, as well as increased make-ready costs associated with increasing occupancy as discussed above. During 2003, operating expenses increased $5,724,000, or 6.1%, due primarily to inclement weather, increased insurance costs and bad debt expenses. We expect expense growth in 2005 to be consistent with growth levels in 2004 with pressure on salaries and utilities, partially offset by moderation in bad debt expenses, marketing costs and insurance. Property taxes increased in both 2004 and 2003 as compared to prior years due to overall higher assessments and the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes, partially offset by property tax refunds. For Established Communities, property taxes increased in 2004 and 2003 by $333,000 and $1,470,000, respectively, as compared to the prior year, due to overall higher assessments throughout all regions, partially offset by successful tax appeals. We expect property taxes to 45 increase in 2005 as local jurisdictions are expected to continue to seek additional revenue sources to offset budget deficits. We manage property tax increases internally, as well as engage third-party consultants, and appeal increases when appropriate. Corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses increased in 2004 due to increased compensation costs. During 2003, corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses increased due to associate separation costs, as well as increased corporate-level marketing and customer service costs to respond to pressure on economic occupancy. Investments and investment management reflects the costs incurred related to investment acquisitions, investment management and abandoned pursuit costs, which include the abandonment or impairment of development pursuits, acquisition pursuits and technology investments. Investments and investment management increased in 2004 as compared to 2003 due to costs incurred in forming a potential discretionary investment fund, increased compensation costs and increased abandoned pursuit costs. Investments and investment management decreased in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to decreases in abandoned pursuit costs. Abandoned pursuit costs were $1,726,000, $1,180,000 and $2,800,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Abandoned pursuit costs can be volatile, and the activity experienced in any given year may not be experienced in future years. We expect investments and investment management costs to continue to increase in 2005 due to the costs associated with operating and managing the investment fund. Interest expense decreased in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to the repayment of unsecured debt and reissuance at lower interest rates, overall lower interest rates and lower average outstanding balances on our unsecured credit facility. Interest expense increased in 2003 as compared to 2002, primarily due to the issuance in late 2002 of unsecured notes and higher average outstanding balances on our unsecured credit facility, partially offset by the repayment of certain unsecured notes and overall lower interest rates on both short-term and long-term borrowings. We expect interest expense to increase in 2005 as interest rates rise and we increase our leverage from current levels. Depreciation expens e increased in both 2004 and 2003 primarily due to the completion of development and redevelopment activities, as well as the acquisition of new communities in 2002 and 2004. General and administrative expense ( G&A ) increased in 2004 as a result of higher compensation expense, increased litigation and settlement costs associated with certain community and corporate matters and additional corporate governance costs, including costs relating to compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley. G&A increased in 2003 as a result of construction litigation relating to a community that has completed development and increased directors and officers ( D&O ) insurance, which was renewed in March 2003. We expect G&A to continue to increase in 2005 due to increased corporate governance (primarily Sarbanes-Oxley compliance) and compensation costs, but at a reduced pace as compared to 2004. Impairment loss of $6,800,000 was recorded during 2002 related to two land parcels that were determined not likely to proceed to development and therefore were planned for disposition. No impairment losses were recorded in either 2004 or 2003. Equity in income of unconsolidated entities decreased in 2004 and increased in 2003 primarily due to our share of the gain received on a community sold in 2003 which was accounted for under the equity method in which we held a 50% interest. Interest income decreased in 2004 and 2003 as compared to prior years due to lower average cash balances invested and lower interest rates. In addition, effective January 1, 2004, we consolidated an entity from which we held a participating mortgage note due to the implementation of FASB Interpretation No. 46 ( FIN 46 ), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, and Interpretation of ARB No. 51, as revised in December 2003. Therefore, interest income that we recognized in 2003 and 2002 is not reflected in 2004 as such amounts were eliminated in consolidation. (See Note 1, Organization and Significant Accounting Policies, of the Consolidated Financial Statements). On October 15, 2004, we received payment in full of the outstanding mortgage note due from this entity. The mortgage note was repaid prior to its scheduled 46 maturity, and therefore the total proceeds of $33,994,000 included an early prepayment premium of approximately $1,240,000 (net of related legal costs) along with the unpaid principal balance and accrued interest. Upon repayment of the mortgage note, our economic interest in this entity ended, and therefore this entity was no longer considered a variable interest entity under FIN 46 and we discontinued consolidation. Venture partner interest in profit-sharing represents the income allocated to our venture partner in a profit-sharing arrangement as discussed in Note 6, Investments in Unconsolidated Entities, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Fluctuations as compared to prior years are due to changes in the net income of the underlying real estate. Effective December 31, 2004, we no longer account for our interest in this venture as a profit-sharing arrangement. Minority interest in consolidated partnerships decreased in 2004 due to the consolidation of an entity under FIN 46, as discussed above. We do not hold an equity interest in this entity, and therefore 100% of the entity net income or loss is recognized as minority interest in consolidated partnerships. Income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by communities sold during the period from January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2004. The decreases in 2004 and 2003 are due to the timing of the sale of five communities in 2004 and eleven communities in 2003. Gain on sale of communities decreased in 2004 and increased in 2003 due to the volume of disposition activity in each year. The amount of gains realized depends on many factors, including the number of communities sold, the size and carrying value of those communities and the market conditions in the local area. We expect to continue to sell communities based on overall portfolio allocation needs as well as to respond to opportunities in the market to maximize risk adjusted returns. Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2004 is a result of the implementation of FIN 46, discussed above, and represents the difference between the net assets consolidated under FIN 46 and the previously recorded net assets. Dividends attributable to preferred stock decreased during 2004 and 2003 primarily as a result of several preferred stock redemptions during 2003 and 2002. Funds from Operations ( FFO ) is considered an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated property and excluding real estate depreciation, which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a company real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. We believe that in order to understand our operating results, FFO should be examined with net income as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. For a more detailed discussion and presentation of FFO, see Selected Financial Data, included in Item 6 of this report. Liquidity and Capital Resources Factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations, financing activities and investing activities. Operating cash flow has historically been determined by: (i) the number of apartment homes currently owned, (ii) rental rates, (iii) occupancy levels and (iv) operating expenses with respect to apartment homes. The timing, source and amount of cash flow provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets environment, particularly to changes in interest rates. The timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage, as well as our plans for development, redevelopment, acquisition and disposition activity, are affected by changes in the capital markets environment, such as changes in interest rates or the availability of cost-effective capital. 47 We regularly review our liquidity needs, the adequacy of cash flow from operations, and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs. We believe our principal short-term liquidity needs are to fund: normal recurring operating expenses; debt service and maturity payments; preferred stock dividends and DownREIT partnership unit distributions; the minimum dividend payments required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged; and opportunities for the acquisition of improved property. We anticipate that we can fully satisfy these needs from a combination of cash flow provided by operating activities, proceeds from asset dispositions and borrowing capacity under our variable rate unsecured credit facility. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,582,000 at December 31, 2004, a decrease of $5,476,000 from $7,058,000 on December 31, 2003. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included elsewhere in this report. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $275,678,000 in 2004 from $239,677,000 in 2003, primarily due to additional NOI from recently acquired and developed communities, partially offset by the loss of NOI from the 16 communities sold in 2004 and 2003, as discussed earlier in this report. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of $251,683,000 in 2004 related to investments in assets through development, redevelopment and acquisition of apartment communities, partially offset by proceeds from asset dispositions and the receipt of payment on a participating mortgage note. During 2004, we invested $498,020,000 in the purchase and development of real estate and capital expenditures: We began the development of six new communities. These communities, if developed as expected, will contain a total of 1,310 apartment homes, and the total capitalized cost, including land acquisition costs, is projected to be approximately $241,100,000. We completed the development of seven communities containing a total of 2,135 apartment homes for a total capitalized cost, including land acquisition cost, of $363,700,000. We began the redevelopment of three communities, two of which were acquired prior to 1999, and one of which was acquired in 2004 (as discussed below) with the intent of being owned by a discretionary investment fund. These communities contain 649 apartment homes and, if redeveloped as expected, will be completed for a total capitalized cost of $69,300,000, of which $55,100,000 was incurred prior to redevelopment. We completed the redevelopment of one community containing 308 apartment homes for a total capitalized cost of $44,000,000, of which $35,700,000 was incurred prior to redevelopment. We acquired five communities containing a total of 1,165 apartment homes for an aggregate purchase price of $134,216,000, which included the assumption of $8,155,000 of fixed rate mortgage debt. Four of these communities were acquired with the intent of being owned by a discretionary investment fund. We acquired ten parcels of land, including three parcels of improved land, in connection with Development Rights, for an aggregate purchase price of $122,775,000. We had capital expenditures relating to current communities real estate assets of $12,984,000 and non-real estate capital expenditures of $860,000. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $29,471,000 in 2004, consisting primarily of dividends paid and certain debt repayments, partially offset by a decrease in borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, issuance of mortgage notes payable, issuance of common stock for option 48 exercises and issuance of unsecured notes. See Note 3, Notes Payable, Unsecured Notes and Credit Facility, and Note 4, Stockholders Equity, of our Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Variable Rate Unsecured Credit Facility We have a $500,000,000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank and Wachovia Bank, N.A. serving as banks and syndication agents for a syndicate of commercial banks. Under the terms of the credit facility, if we elect to increase the facility by up to an additional $150,000,000, and one or more banks (from the syndicate or otherwise) voluntarily agree to provide the additional commitment, then we will be able to increase the facility up to $650,000,000, and no member of the syndicate of banks can prohibit such increase; such an increase in the facility will only be effective to the extent banks (from the syndicate or otherwise) choose to commit to lend additional funds. We pay participating banks, in the aggregate, an annual facility fee of approximately $750,000 in quarterly installments. The unsecured credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ), rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us. The current stated pricing is LIBOR plus 0.55% per annum (3.02% on February 28, 2005). The spread over LIBOR can vary from LIBOR plus 0.50% to LIBOR plus 1.15% based upon the rating of our long-term unsecured debt. In addition, a competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to $250,000,000. This option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pricing provided by the unsecured credit facility. The competitive bid option may result in lower pricing if market conditions allow. We had $100,000,000 outstanding under this competitive bid option at February 28, 2005 priced at LIBOR plus 0.29%, or 2.78%. We are subject to (i) certain customary covenants under the unsecured credit facility, including, but not limited to, maintaining certain maximum leverage ratios, a minimum fixed charges coverage ratio and minimum unencumbered assets and equity levels, and (ii) prohibitions on paying dividends in amounts that exceed 95% of our FFO, except as may be required to maintain our REIT status. The credit facility matures in May 2008, assuming our exercise of a one-year renewal option. At February 28, 2005, $291,500,000 was outstanding, $27,251,000 was used to provide letters of credit and $181,249,000 was available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility. Future Financing and Capital Needs Debt Maturities One of our principal long-term liquidity needs is the repayment of medium and long-term debt at the time that such debt matures. For unsecured notes, we anticipate that no significant portion of the principal of these notes will be repaid prior to maturity. If we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due, it will be necessary for us to refinance the debt. This refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings, additional debt financing that is collateralized by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities, draws on our unsecured credit facility or by additional equity offerings. Although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our long-term liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or, if available, that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory. The following debt activity occurred during 2004: We repaid $125,000,000 in previously issued unsecured notes, along with any unpaid interest, pursuant to their scheduled maturity, and no prepayment penalties were incurred. In addition, we issued $150,000,000 in unsecured notes under our existing shelf registration statement at an annual interest rate of 5.375%. Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15, and they mature in April 2014; We repaid $24,251,000 in fixed rate mortgage debt, secured by two current communities, repaid $10,400,000 in variable rate, tax-exempt debt related to the sale of a community and transferred $28,335,000 in variable rate, tax-exempt debt related to the sale of two communities to the respective purchasers; 49 We issued $82,800,000 in variable rate, conventional debt on three communities, and purchased interest rate protection agreements that serve to effectively limit the level to which interest rates can rise on this debt to a weighted average of 8.5%; We obtained a $50,000,000 secured construction loan for the construction of a development community that will be owned and operated in a joint venture entity upon completion. Outstanding draws ($6,278,000 as December 31, 2004) will bear interest at a variable rate and will come due in March 2008, assuming the exercise of two one-year extension options; We issued $16,765,000 in variable rate, conventional debt on one community; We assumed $8,155,000 in fixed rate, conventional mortgage debt in conjunction with the acquisition of a community; We assumed $20,141,000 in fixed rate debt in connection with the acquisition of three parcels of improved land related to three Development Rights; We replaced the credit enhancements, including interest rate swaps, on approximately $87,000,000 of our variable rate, tax-exempt debt when such credit enhancements expired, of which $9,580,000 was transferred upon the sale of a community to the respective purchaser. We put in place interest rate protection agreements that serve to effectively limit the level to which interest rates can rise on the remaining debt to a range of 6.7% to 9.0%; and We renegotiated the terms of a fixed rate, tax-exempt bond on one community in the amount of $9,780,000 to decrease the annual interest rate from 7.0% to 4.9%. In January 2005, we repaid $150,000,000 in previously issued unsecured notes, along with any unpaid interest, pursuant to their scheduled maturity. No prepayment penalty was incurred. In addition, in March 2005, we issued $100,000,000 in unsecured notes under our existing shelf registration statement at an annual effective interest rate of 4.999%. Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15, and they mature in March 2013. We currently have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The shelf registration statement originally provided $750,000,000 of debt and equity capacity, however, only $370,984,000 remains outstanding (after consideration of the March 2005 issuance discussed above). We cannot assure you that market conditions will permit us to issue debt or equity securities on cost-effective terms or that the registration statement will remain available and effective at all times. The table on the following page details debt maturities for the next five years, excluding our unsecured credit facility, for debt outstanding at December 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands). 50 All-In Principal interest maturity Balance outstanding Scheduled maturities Community rate (1) date 12-31-03 12-31-04 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Tax-exempt bonds Fixed rate CountryBrook 6.30% Mar-2012 $ 17,628 $ 17,145 $ 559 $ 596 $ 634 $ 676 $ 719 $ 13,961 Avalon at Symphony Glen 4.90% Jul-2024 9,780 9,780 9,780 Avalon View 7.55% Aug-2024 17,345 16,920 455 485 518 555 595 14,312 Avalon at Lexington 6.55% Feb-2025 13,477 13,151 347 368 391 415 441 11,189 Avalon at Nob Hill 5.80% Jun-2025 19,149 18,847 (2) 352 378 405 435 466 16,811 Avalon Campbell 6.48% Jun-2025 35,065 34,395 (2) 781 838 898 963 1,033 29,882 Avalon Pacifica 6.48% Jun-2025 15,906 15,602 (2) 354 380 408 437 469 13,554 Avalon Knoll 6.95% Jun-2026 12,748 12,502 263 282 302 324 347 10,984 Avalon Landing 6.85% Jun-2026 6,301 6,177 132 142 152 162 173 5,416 Avalon Fields 7.55% May-2027 11,106 10,912 206 222 239 256 275 9,714 Avalon West 7.73% Dec-2036 8,396 8,327 76 80 85 91 98 7,897 Avalon Oaks 7.45% Jul-2041 17,530 17,426 112 120 128 138 147 16,781 Avalon Oaks West 7.48% Apr-2043 17,336 17,239 102 110 117 125 134 16,651 201,767 198,423 3,739 4,001 4,277 4,577 4,897 176,932 Variable rate (4) Avalon at Laguna Niguel (5) Mar-2009 10,400 The Promenade 3.93% Oct-2010 33,185 32,663 562 605 652 701 755 29,388 Waterford 2.47% Jul-2014 33,100 33,100 (3) 33,100 Avalon at Mountain View 2.47% Feb-2017 18,300 18,300 (3) 18,300 Avalon at Foxchase I 2.47% Nov-2017 16,800 16,800 (3) 16,800 Avalon at Foxchase II 2.47% Nov-2017 9,600 9,600 (3) 9,600 Fairway Glen (5) Nov-2017 9,580 (3) Avalon at Mission Viejo 3.07% Jun-2025 7,039 6,928 (6) 127 138 148 159 170 6,186 Avalon Greenbriar (5) May-2026 18,755 Avalon at Fairway Hills I 2.98% Jun-2026 11,500 11,500 11,500 168,259 128,891 689 743 800 860 925 124,874 Conventional loans (7) Fixed rate $125 million unsecured notes 6.73% Feb-2004 125,000 $100 million unsecured notes 6.75% Jan-2005 100,000 100,000 100,000 $50 million unsecured notes 6.50% Jan-2005 50,000 50,000 50,000 $150 million unsecured notes 6.93% Jul-2006 150,000 150,000 150,000 $150 million unsecured notes 5.18% Aug-2007 150,000 150,000 150,000 $110 million unsecured notes 7.13% Dec-2007 110,000 110,000 110,000 $50 million unsecured notes 6.63% Jan-2008 50,000 50,000 50,000 $150 million unsecured notes 8.37% Jul-2008 150,000 150,000 150,000 $150 million unsecured notes 7.63% Aug-2009 150,000 150,000 150,000 $200 million unsecured notes 7.67% Dec-2010 200,000 200,000 200,000 $300 million unsecured notes 6.79% Sep-2011 300,000 300,000 300,000 $50 million unsecured notes 6.31% Sep-2011 50,000 50,000 50,000 $250 million unsecured notes 6.26% Nov-2012 250,000 250,000 250,000 $150 million unsecured notes 5.51% Apr-2014 150,000 150,000 Avalon at Pruneyard 7.25% May-2004 12,870 Avalon Walk II 8.93% Aug-2004 11,437 Wheaton Development Right 6.99% Oct-2008 4,660 70 76 82 4,432 Twinbrook Development Right 7.25% Oct-2011 8,545 156 168 182 194 211 7,634 Avalon Redondo Beach 4.84% Oct-2011 16,765 16,765 Briarcliffe Lakeside (8) 6.90% Feb-2028 8,104 133 142 153 162 175 7,339 Avalon at Tysons West 5.55% Jul-2028 6,819 138 146 155 162 173 6,045 Avalon Orchards 7.65% Jul-2033 20,574 20,353 238 254 272 292 313 18,984 1,879,881 1,925,246 150,735 150,786 260,844 205,242 150,872 1,006,767 Variable rate (4) Avalon on the Sound (9) 3.90% Apr-2005 36,526 Del Rey 3.90% Sep-2007 6,278 6,278 Avalon Ledges 3.83% May-2009 19,674 (6) 583 616 651 688 17,136 Avalon at Flanders Hill 3.83% May-2009 22,429 (6) 665 703 742 784 19,535 Newton Highlands 3.77% May-2009 39,902 (6) 1,204 1,265 1,329 1,397 34,707 36,526 88,283 2,452 2,584 9,000 2,869 71,378 Total indebtedness excluding unsecured credit facility $ 2,286,433 $ 2,340,843 $ 157,615 $ 158,114 $ 274,921 $ 213,548 $ 228,072 $ 1,308,573 (1) Includes credit enhancement fees, facility fees, trustees fees and other fees.

(3) Financed by variable rate, tax-exempt debt, that was effectively fixed through a swap agreement at December 31, 2003 and was reported as fixed rate debt at that time. The debt was restructured in February 2004 such that the interest rate was capped through an interest rate protection agreement and is currently included as variable rate debt for financial reporting purposes. (4) Variable rates are given as of December 31, 2004. (5) Included in liabilities related to real estate assets held for sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2003 included elsewhere in this report. (6) Financed by variable rate debt, but interest rate is capped through an interest rate protection agreement. (7) Balances outstanding do not include $552 of debt discount and $284 of debt premium as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively, reflected in unsecured notes on our Consolidated Balance Sheets included elsewhere in this report. (8) We have the option to prepay this note without penalty in February 2008; if not prepaid, the interest rate will increase by 2% for the remaining term. (9) Variable rate construction loan was refinanced in March 2004, extending the maturity date to April 2005. This community was deconsolidated as of December 31, 2004. See Note 6, Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities, of our Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding the deconsolidation and the note balance as of December 31, 2004. 51 Future Financing and Capital Needs Portfolio and Other Activity As of December 31, 2004, we had ten new communities under construction, for which a total estimated cost of $145,012,000 remained to be invested. In addition, we had four communities under reconstruction, for which a total estimated cost of $15,710,000 remained to be invested. Substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction, as well as development costs related to pursuing Development Rights, will be funded from: the remaining capacity under our current $500,000,000 unsecured credit facility; the net proceeds from sales of existing communities; retained operating cash; the issuance of debt or equity securities; and/or private equity funding. Before planned reconstruction activity, including reconstruction activity related to a discretionary investment fund discussed below, or the construction of a Development Right begins, we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing. In the event that financing cannot be obtained, we may have to abandon Development Rights, write-off associated pre-development costs that were capitalized and/or forego reconstruction activity. In such instances, we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such Development Rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred. We have engaged in discussions with a limited number of institutional investors regarding the formation of a discretionary fund that would acquire and operate apartment communities. This fund would serve, for a period of three years from its initial closing date or until 80% of its committed capital is invested, as the exclusive vehicle through which we would acquire apartment communities, subject to certain exceptions. These exceptions include significant individual asset and portfolio acquisitions, properties acquired in tax-deferred transactions and acquisitions that are inadvisable or inappropriate for the fund, if any. The fund would not restrict our development activities, and would terminate after a term of eight years, subject to two one-year extensions. As of February 28, 2005, we have acquired four communities with the intent of being owned by the fund, but which are currently consolidated and included in our operating results. We are currently targeting acquisitions for the fund where value creation opportunities are present through one or more of the following: redevelopment activities, market cycle opportunities or improved property operations. We expect the fund to have equity commitments of up to $330,000,000 and the ability to employ leverage through debt financings up to 65% on a portfolio basis, which would enable the fund to invest up to $940,000,000. We would contribute 20% of the total equity up to $50,000,000. We expect closing on the equity funding during the first quarter of 2005. There can be no assurance as to when or if such a fund will be formed or, if formed, what its size, terms or investment performance will be. We have also recently increased our use of joint ventures to hold individual real estate assets, pursuant to which certain developments will be held upon completion through partnership vehicles. We generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity. Each joint venture or partnership agreement has been and will continue to be individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement. However, we cannot assure you that we will continue to enter into joint ventures in the future, or that, if we do, we will achieve our objectives. 52 The following joint venture activity occurred during 2004: We entered into a joint venture agreement with an unrelated third-party for the development of Avalon Chrystie Place I. We hold a 20% equity interest in this joint venture entity (with a right to 50% of distributions after achievement of a threshold return), with the remaining 80% equity interest held by the third-party; We entered into an agreement with an unrelated third-party which provides that, after we complete construction of Avalon Del Rey, the community will be owned and operated by a joint venture between us and the third-party. Upon construction completion, the third-party venture partner will invest $49,000,000 and will be granted a 70% ownership interest in the venture, while we retain a 30% equity interest; We entered into an agreement to develop Avalon at Juanita Village through a wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary and, upon construction completion, contribute the community to a joint venture. Upon contribution of the community to the joint venture, we expect to be reimbursed for all costs incurred to develop the community. The third-party joint venture partner will receive a 100% equity interest in the joint venture and will manage the joint venture. We will receive a residual profits interest and will be engaged to manage the community for a property management fee; and We entered into a joint venture agreement with an unrelated third-party for the development of Avalon at Mission Bay North II, which is expected to begin construction in early 2005. We hold a 25% equity interest in this joint venture entity, with the remaining 75% equity interest held by the third-party. In evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets, we often sell assets that do not meet our long-term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities. In response to real estate and capital markets conditions, including strong institutional demand for product in our markets, we sold five communities in 2004, and anticipate selling additional communities when opportunities arise for harvesting value in 2005. However, we cannot assure you that assets can continue to be sold on terms that we consider satisfactory or that market conditions will continue to make the sale of assets an appealing strategy. Because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets, the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income, but reduce future total revenues, total expenses, NOI and FFO. As of February 28, 2005, we have two communities classified as held for sale under GAAP. We are actively pursuing the disposition of these communities and expect to close on these dispositions in 2005. However, we cannot assure you that these communities will be sold as planned. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We own interests in unconsolidated real estate entities, with ownership interests up to 50%. Three of these unconsolidated real estate entities, Avalon Terrace, LLC, CVP I, LLC and AvalonBay Redevelopment, LLC have debt outstanding as of December 31, 2004. Avalon Terrace, LLC has $22,500,000 of variable rate debt which matures in November 2005 and is payable by the unconsolidated real estate entity with operating cash flow from the underlying real estate. CVP I, LLC has a $117,000,000 construction loan which matures in February 2009, assuming exercise of two one-year renewal options, and is payable by the unconsolidated real estate entity. AvalonBay Redevelopment, LLC has $36,124,000 of variable rate debt which matures in April 2005 and is payable by the unconsolidated real estate entity with operating cash flow from the underlying real estate. We have not guaranteed the debt on Avalon Terrace, LLC and AvalonBay Redevelopment, LLC, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the unconsolidated real estate entities be unable to do so. However, in connection with the general contractor services that we provide to CVP I, LLC, the entity that owns and is developing Avalon Chrystie Place I, we have provided a construction completion guarantee to the lender in order to fulfill their standard financing requirements related to the construction financing. Our obligations under this guarantee will terminate following construction completion once all of the lender standard completion requirements have been satisfied. We currently expect this to occur in 2006. There are no lines of credit, side agreements, financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between us and our unconsolidated real estate entities. In evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage, management takes into consideration our proportionate share of this unconsolidated debt. For more information 53 regarding the operations of our unconsolidated entities see Note 6, Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations We currently have contractual obligations consisting primarily of long-term debt obligations and lease obligations for certain land parcels and regional and administrative office space. Scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of December 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands): Payments due by period Less than 1 More than 5 Total Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Years Long-Term Debt Obligations (1) $ 2,442,843 $ 259,615 $ 433,035 $ 441,620 $ 1,308,573 Operating Lease Obligations 393,075 4,061 8,162 7,641 373,211 Total $ 2,835,918 $ 263,676 $ 441,197 $ 449,261 $ 1,681,784 (1) Includes $102,000 outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility as of December 31, 2004. The table of contractual obligations assumes repayment of this amount in 2005 See Liquidity and Capital Resources. Inflation and Deflation Substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less. In an inflationary environment, this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Short-term leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation, although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents. In a deflationary rent environment, we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter-term leases. Forward-Looking Statements This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify forward-looking statements by our use of the words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, assume, project, plan, may, shall, will and other similar expressions in this Form 10-K, that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters. These statements include, among other things, statements regarding our intent, belief or expectations with respect to: our potential development, redevelopment, acquisition or disposition of communities; the timing and cost of completion of apartment communities under construction, reconstruction, development or redevelopment; the timing of lease-up, occupancy and stabilization of apartment communities; the pursuit of land on which we are considering future development; the anticipated operating performance of our communities; cost, yield and earnings estimates; our declaration or payment of distributions; our joint venture and discretionary fund activities; our policies regarding investments, indebtedness, acquisitions, dispositions, financings and other matters; our qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code; the real estate markets in Northern and Southern California and markets in selected states in the Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, Midwest and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States and in general; 54 the availability of debt and equity financing; interest rates; general economic conditions; and trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations. We cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements; rather, these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed. You should not rely on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. These risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: we may fail to secure development opportunities due to an inability to reach agreements with third parties or to obtain desired zoning and other local approvals; we may abandon or defer development opportunities for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions which make development less desirable, increases in costs of development and increases in the cost of capital, resulting in losses; construction costs of a community may exceed our original estimates; we may not complete construction and lease-up of communities under development or redevelopment on schedule, resulting in increased interest costs and construction costs and a decrease in our expected rental revenues; occupancy rates and market rents may be adversely affected by competition and local economic and market conditions which are beyond our control; financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all, and our cash flow from operations and access to cost effective capital may be insufficient for the development of our pipeline which could limit our pursuit of opportunities; our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, and we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness; we may be unsuccessful in closing, managing or investing in the discretionary investment fund; and we may be unsuccessful in managing changes in our portfolio composition. In addition, these forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake to update these forward-looking statements, and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report.
