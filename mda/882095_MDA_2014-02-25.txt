ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and other disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (including the disclosures under Item 1A, Risk Factors). Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in U.S. dollars. Management Overview Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead, we or us), incorporated in Delaware on June 22, 1987, is a research-based biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes innovative medicines in areas of unmet medical need. With each new discovery and experimental drug candidate, we strive to transform and simplify care for people with life-threatening illnesses around the world. Gilead's primary areas of focus include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), liver diseases such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, oncology/inflammation and serious cardiovascular and respiratory conditions. Headquartered in Foster City, California, we have operations in North and South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. We continue to add to our existing portfolio of products through our internal discovery and clinical development programs and through a product acquisition and in-licensing strategy. Our product portfolio is comprised of Stribild , Complera /Eviplera , Atripla , Truvada , Viread , Emtriva , Tybost , Sovaldi , Hepsera , Vitekta , Letairis , Ranexa , Cayston , AmBisome and Vistide . Business Highlights During 2013, we continued to advance our product pipeline across all therapeutic areas. We made significant progress, particularly in our Phase 3 studies in oncology, liver diseases and HIV. The combination of our existing internal research programs, acquisitions and partnerships will allow us to continue bringing innovative therapies to individuals who are living with unmet medical needs. Below is a summary of our key accomplishments: expanded our single tablet regimen (STR) products with the European launch of Stribild in 14 countries; received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval of Complera/Eviplera for use among certain adult patients switching from another stable antiretroviral regimen; received EMA approval for once-daily Tybost, a pharmacokinetic enhancer that boosts blood levels of certain HIV medicines; received EMA approval for Vitekta, an integrase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults without known mutations associated with resistance to elvitegravir; advanced the clinical development of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) as a once-daily single tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection to Phase 3 clinical trials; received approval from the FDA and Health Canada in December 2013 for Sovaldi (sofosbuvir), a once daily oral regimen for the treatment of HCV as a component of a combination of antiviral treatment regimens; received approval from the EMA for Sovaldi in January 2014; announced positive interim results from three Phase 3 clinical studies (ION-1, ION-2 and ION-3) evaluating the once-daily fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF), with and without ribavirin (RBV), for the treatment of genotype 1 HCV infection; filed a new drug application (NDA) for the fixed-dose combination of LDV/SOF in February 2014; submitted an NDA to the FDA for approval of idelalisib for the treatment of patients with indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (iNHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We also filed for approval of idelalisib for treatment of iNHL and CLL with the EMA on October 28, 2013. In January 2014, the FDA accepted our NDA for iNHL and set a target review date of September 11, 2014 under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). In February 2014, the FDA, which previously granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for idelalisib in CLL, accepted our NDA and set a target review date of August 6, 2014 under the PDUFA; and completed the acquisition of YM Biosciences Inc. (YM), through which we acquired momelotinib, an orally administered, once-daily candidate for hematologic cancers and advanced the clinical development of momelotinib to Phase 3 clinical trials. 56 Outlook 2014 In 2014 , we will continue to focus on our key operating objectives which include continued progression of our product pipeline and continued uptake of our commercial products. From a research and development (R&D) perspective, we will continue to invest in our various ongoing clinical studies, which support both our existing products and pipeline of new drug candidates. We expect to move forward on a number of late-stage clinical studies for new product candidates and plan to file marketing applications for various therapeutic areas. From a commercial perspective, during 2013, we began to build-out our commercial organization to support the launch of Sovaldi in the United States and Canada in December 2013. In January 2014, we received approval from the EMA for Sovaldi in all 28 countries of the European Union. Sovaldi represents a significant shift in the treatment paradigm for certain HCV patients around the world. During 2014, we plan to further the build-out and expansion of our international commercial infrastructure particularly in Europe and Asia to support the Sovaldi launches and increase marketing and sales efforts related to the anticipated launch of our first oncology product, idelalisib. We continue to monitor conditions in the macroeconomic environment that could affect our ability to achieve our goals, such as changes in the reimbursement and payor landscape as well as legislation that may delay or impact funding for AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAPs) in the United States, a worsening of economic conditions in certain key markets, particularly in Europe, patent expirations of competitive products and the launch of generic competitors, government pricing pressures internationally and the potential volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We will adjust our business processes, as appropriate, to attempt to mitigate these risks to our business. We expect that our product pipeline investments and expanding commercial infrastructure will enable us to execute on our 2014 operating objectives. 2013 Financial Highlights During 2013 , we delivered strong financial performance and continued to invest in our product pipeline. Total revenues grew 15% to $11.20 billion and total product sales grew 15% to $10.80 billion , compared to 2012 driven primarily by an increase in antiviral product sales. R&D expenses increased 20% to $2.12 billion for 2013 compared to 2012 due to progression of our clinical studies, particularly Phase 3 studies in oncology, liver diseases and HIV. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 16% to $1.70 billion for 2013 compared to 2012 due to the ongoing growth and expansion of our business, including commercial expansion related to the launch of Sovaldi. Net income attributable to Gilead for 2013 was $3.07 billion or $1.81 per diluted share, compared to $2.59 billion or $1.64 per diluted share in 2012 , due to the increase in total revenues, partially offset by an increase in R&D and SG&A expenses. During 2013 , we generated $3.10 billion in operating cash flows, paid $1.04 billion for the warrants related to our May 2013 Notes that settled in August 2013, repaid $1.67 billion in debt net of proceeds from convertible note hedges and utilized $378.6 million for the acquisition of YM, net of cash acquired. Results of Operations Total Revenues Total revenues include product sales, royalty revenues, and contract and other revenues. Total revenues increased 15% to $11.20 billion in 2013 , compared to 2012 and increased 16% to $9.70 billion in 2012 compared to $8.39 billion in 2011 . Product sales represented 96% of total revenues in 2013 and 97% of total revenues in 2012 and 2011 . Royalty revenues represented 3% of total revenues during 2013 , 2012 and 2011 . Product Sales Total product sales were $10.80 billion in 2013 , an increase of 15% over total product sales of $9.40 billion in 2012 , driven primarily by the continued uptake of our STR products, primarily Stribild and Complera/Eviplera. Cardiovascular product sales consisting of Letairis and Ranexa, increased 24% to $968.6 million in 2013 compared to $783.0 million in 2012 . Total product sales were $9.40 billion in 2012 , an increase of 16% over total product sales of $8.10 billion in 2011 , driven primarily by continued growth in sales of our antiviral products, including Atripla, Truvada and Complera/Eviplera. Product sales in the United States increased 20% for 2013 to $6.65 billion compared to $5.54 billion in 2012 , driven by sales growth of our STR products, specifically Stribild and Complera as well as the launch of our newest product, Sovaldi. 57 During the fourth quarters of 2013 and 2012 , we noted strong wholesaler and sub-wholesaler purchases in anticipation of price increases effective January 1. We estimate that during the fourth quarter of 2013 , sales exceeded demand by approximately $130 - $150 million and $80 - $100 million during the same period in 2012 . Based on our observations during the first quarter of 2013 , this may result in inventory draw-downs during the first quarter of 2014. Approximately 40% of our product sales are generated outside the United States and as a result, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in the Euro. We used foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our foreign currency exposure. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $64.8 million on our 2013 revenues compared to 2012 and an unfavorable impact of $57.1 million on our 2012 revenues compared to 2011 . Product sales in Europe increased 6% in 2013 to $3.33 billion compared to $3.14 billion in 2012 , driven primarily by higher underlying demand for our antiviral products, specifically Eviplera, partially offset by decreases in the average net selling price. Product sales in Europe increased 6% in 2012 to $3.14 billion compared to $2.96 billion in 2011, driven primarily by higher underlying demand in our antiviral franchise. Antiviral product sales in Europe totaled $2.87 billion in 2012, an increase of 6% compared to $2.71 billion in 2011, driven primarily by the sales of Atripla and Truvada. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $55.3 million on our European product sales in 2013 compared to 2012 and an unfavorable impact of $68.9 million on our European product sales in 2012 compared to 2011 . In light of the fiscal and debt crises experienced by several countries in the European Union, several governments have announced or implemented measures to manage healthcare expenditures. Although to date, we have paid rebates in countries outside the United States, payments made to foreign governments do not represent a significant portion of our government rebates and chargebacks or percentage of total product sales in foreign locations. However, we continue to experience pricing pressure, such as increases in the amount of discounts required on our products and delayed reimbursement which could negatively impact our future product sales and results of operations. We expect our total product sales to grow in 2014, as we realize the full year impact of sales of Sovaldi and continued uptake of our commercial products, primarily our single tablet regimens. We believe this growth could be tempered by pricing pressures in certain European territories, the impact of generic efavirenz, now available in Canada and Europe, potential volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the macroeconomic environment. Government Rebates and Chargebacks U.S. government rebates and chargebacks deducted from gross product sales increased 19% to $3.08 billion in 2013 from $2.59 billion in 2012 and increased 39% from $1.86 billion in 2011 , representing 21% of total gross product sales in both 2013 and 2012 and 17% of total gross product sales in 2011 . In March 2010, healthcare reform legislation was adopted in the United States that required further rebates or discounts on products reimbursed or paid for by various public payers, such as Medicaid and other entities eligible to purchase discounted products. As a result of this legislation and the impact of the economic downturn, our total rebates and chargebacks have increased as we have experienced changes in our payer mix. Specifically, we believe that certain patients previously covered by private insurance have moved to public reimbursement programs. As a result, we expect government rebates and chargebacks as a percentage of total gross product sales will continue to increase. 58 The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales: (In thousands, except percentages) 2013 Change 2012 Change 2011 Antiviral products: Atripla $ 3,648,496 2 % $ 3,574,483 11 % $ 3,224,518 Truvada 3,135,771 (1 )% 3,181,110 11 % 2,875,141 Viread 958,969 13 % 848,697 15 % 737,867 Complera/Eviplera 809,452 137 % 342,200 783 % 38,747 Stribild 539,256 837 % 57,536 % Sovaldi 139,435 % % Hepsera 81,095 (25 )% 108,315 (25 )% 144,679 Emtriva 27,405 (7 )% 29,449 2 % 28,764 Total antiviral products 9,339,879 15 % 8,141,790 15 % 7,049,716 Letairis 519,966 27 % 410,054 40 % 293,426 Ranexa 448,624 20 % 372,949 17 % 320,004 AmBisome 351,827 1 % 346,646 5 % 330,156 Other products 143,399 13 % 126,932 16 % 109,057 Total product sales $ 10,803,695 15 % $ 9,398,371 16 % $ 8,102,359 Antiviral Products Antiviral product sales increased by 15% in 2013 compared to 2012 and 2012 compared to 2011 . Atripla In 2013 , increases in Atripla sales were driven primarily by an increase in the average net selling price. In 2012 , Atripla sales were driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States. Atripla sales accounted for 39% , 44% and 46% of our total antiviral product sales for 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. The efavirenz component of Atripla, which has a gross margin of zero, comprised $1.40 billion , $1.34 billion and $1.21 billion of our Atripla sales in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. A generic version of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company's Sustiva (efavirenz), a component of our Atripla, was made available in Canada and Europe in 2013 and will be made available in the United States in 2015. As a result, we expect increased competitive pricing pressure on our future Atripla sales. Truvada In 2013 , decreases in Truvada sales were due to a decrease in sales volume, partially offset by an increase in average net selling price. In 2012 , Truvada sales were driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States. Truvada sales accounted for 34% , 39% and 41% of our total antiviral product sales for 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Future sales of Truvada could be impacted by patients switching to a different STR regimen. Complera/Eviplera In 2013 , increases in Complera/Eviplera sales were driven primarily by sales volume growth in Europe and the United States. In 2012 , Complera/Eviplera sales increased due primarily to sales volume growth in the United States. Complera was approved in the United States in August 2011, and Eviplera was approved in the European Union in November 2011. During 2013, we estimate that Complera became the number two most-prescribed regimen in treatment na ve HIV patients in the United States and the number one most-prescribed regimen in treatment na ve HIV patients in Europe's Big 5 markets, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. Stribild In 2013 and 2012 , increases in sales of Stribild were driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States. Stribild was approved in the United States in August 2012 and in Europe in May 2013. During 2013, we estimate that Stribild became the number one most-prescribed regimen in treatment na ve HIV patients in the United States. Sovaldi In December 2013, the FDA approved Sovaldi for the treatment of HCV. Sovaldi sales totaled $139.4 million in 2013 , of which we estimate that approximately half related to initial inventory stocking by wholesalers and sub-wholesalers. 59 Cardiovascular Products Our cardiovascular products, which include Letairis and Ranexa increased due primarily to sales volume growth. Royalty Revenues The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty revenues: (In thousands, except percentages) 2013 Change 2012 Change 2011 Royalty revenues $ 383,849 32 % $ 290,523 8 % $ 268,827 Royalty revenues increased 32% for 2013 compared to 2012 , due to higher royalty revenues from F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (Roche) as a result of an increase in the number of patients treated for influenza with Tamiflu. Royalty revenues increased 8% for 2012 compared to 2011 , driven primarily by higher royalty revenues from GlaxoSmithKline, Inc., Japan Tobacco Inc. and Astellas US LLC partially offset by lower Tamiflu royalties from Roche. Tamiflu royalties from Roche contributed $134.7 million, $43.7 million and $75.5 million to total royalty revenues in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 respectively. We recognize royalties on Tamiflu sales by Roche in the quarter following the quarter in which the corresponding sales occur. Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross Margin The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales, cost of goods sold and product gross margin: (In thousands, except percentages) 2013 Change 2012 Change 2011 Total product sales $ 10,803,695 15 % $ 9,398,371 16 % $ 8,102,359 Cost of goods sold $ 2,858,502 16 % $ 2,471,363 16 % $ 2,124,410 Product gross margin 74 % 74 % 74 % Our product gross margin for 2013 was consistent with our product gross margin for 2012 and 2011 . Our product gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2013 was 71.8% and included $58.3 million in amortization expense related to the transition of the in-process research and development (IPR&D) asset, from an indefinite-lived to finite-lived intangible asset upon the FDA approval and commercial launch of Sovaldi. In 2014 , we expect to recognize the full year impact of amortization of approximately $700.0 million related to Sovaldi. Research and Development Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in R&D expenses: (In thousands, except percentages) 2013 Change 2012 Change 2011 Research and development $ 2,119,756 20 % $ 1,759,945 43 % $ 1,229,151 We do not track total R&D expenses by product candidate, therapeutic area or development phase. However, we manage our R&D expenses by identifying the R&D activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources and other considerations. We continually review our R&D pipeline and the status of development and, as necessary, reallocate resources among the R&D product portfolio that we believe will best support the future growth of our business. R&D expenses summarized above consist primarily of clinical studies performed by contract research organizations (CROs), materials and supplies, licenses and fees, milestone payments under collaboration arrangements, personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities-related costs. The following table provides a breakout of R&D expenses by major cost type: (In thousands, except percentages) 2013 2012 2011 Clinical studies and outside services $ 1,147,169 $ 828,278 $ 570,302 Personnel and infrastructure expenses 714,027 686,091 412,463 Facilities, IT and other costs 258,560 245,576 219,756 In-process research and development impairment charges 26,630 Total $ 2,119,756 $ 1,759,945 $ 1,229,151 60 In 2013 , R&D expenses increased $359.8 million or 20% compared to 2012 , due primarily to a $318.9 million increase in clinical studies and a $27.9 million increase in personnel and infrastructure expenses to support the continued progression of our clinical studies, particularly Phase 3 studies in oncology, liver diseases and HIV. These increases were partially offset by a $100.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense due to the acceleration of vested stock options related to our acquisition of Pharmasset, Inc. (Pharmasset) in January 2012. In 2012 , clinical studies and outside services increased $258.0 million compared to 2011 due to progression and expansion of our Phase 3 studies, particularly in liver diseases and oncology. Additionally, personnel expenses increased $273.6 million due to higher headcount to support our product pipeline and study progression. During 2011, we recorded $26.6 million of impairment charges related to certain IPR&D assets acquired from CGI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.. These impairment charges were a result of changes in the anticipated market share related to the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) compound. In 2014 , we expect R&D expenses to increase over 2013 due primarily to continued investment in advancing our product pipeline, driven primarily by the progression of our clinical studies in oncology, liver diseases and HIV. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in SG&A expenses: (In thousands, except percentages) 2013 Change 2012 Change 2011 Selling, general and administrative $ 1,699,431 16 % $ 1,461,034 18 % $ 1,241,983 SG&A expenses relate to sales and marketing, finance, human resources, legal and other administrative activities. Expenses are primarily comprised of facilities and overhead costs, outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses and other general and administrative costs. In 2013 , SG&A expenses increased $238.4 million or 16% compared to 2012 . The increase was due primarily to a $308.0 million increase in headcount-related and other expenses to support the ongoing growth of our business, legal expenses and pharmaceutical excise tax resulting from U.S. healthcare reform. This increase was partially offset by a $98.0 million decrease in stock-based compensation due to the acceleration of vested stock options related to our acquisition of Pharmasset in January 2012. Sequentially, SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2013 increased $106.4 million or 26% compared to the third quarter of 2013 due primarily to increased marketing activities related to the launch of Sovaldi. In 2012 , SG&A expenses increased $219.1 million or 18% compared to 2011 . The increase was due primarily to a $100.5 million increase in costs associated with the growth of our business which include personnel and headcount-related expenses, a $98.0 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses primarily resulting from the acquisition of Pharmasset and an increase of $38.2 million in the pharmaceutical excise tax resulting from U.S. healthcare reform. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in bad debt provisions of $34.3 million, which included a gain of $29.9 million related to the sale of our accounts receivables balances in Spain in the second quarter of 2012. In 2014 , we expect SG&A expenses to increase over 2013 to support our continued build-out and expansion of our commercial infrastructure in Europe and Asia to support our Sovaldi launches, increased sales and marketing efforts related to the anticipated launch of our first oncology product, idelalisib and an increase in the pharmaceutical excise tax. We estimate our portion of the pharmaceutical excise tax to be approximately $150 - $170 million in 2014, compared to approximately $110 million in 2013 and approximately $85 million in 2012. Interest Expense In 2013 , interest expense decreased to $306.9 million compared to $360.9 million in 2012 . The decrease was due primarily to the repayment of our May 2013 Notes, conversions of our convertible senior notes due in May 2014 and May 2016 (May 2014 Notes and May 2016 Notes), and the repayment of revolving credit facilities. In 2012 , interest expense increased to $360.9 million compared to $205.4 million in 2011 . The increase was due primarily to the additional debt we issued in connection with our acquisition of Pharmasset, which included $3.70 billion in senior unsecured notes issued in December 2011 and $2.15 billion in bank debt issued in January 2012. Other Income (Expense), Net For 2013 , other income (expense), net was a net expense of $(8.9) million compared to a net expense of $(37.3) million in 2012 and net income of $66.6 million in 2011 . The changes in other income (expense), net were due primarily to a $40.1 million loss on Greek bonds related to Greece's restructuring of its sovereign debt in the first quarter of 2012. 61 Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes was $1.15 billion , $1.04 billion and $861.9 million in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. The 2013 effective tax rate of 27.3% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to the retroactive extension of the 2012 federal research tax credit in January 2013, the 2013 federal research tax credit and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested, partially offset by state taxes, our portion of the non-tax deductible pharmaceutical excise tax and amortization expense related to the Pharmasset acquisition and contingent consideration expense related to certain acquisitions for which we receive no tax benefit. We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries. The 2012 effective tax rate of 28.7% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested, partially offset by state taxes, the stock-based compensation expense related to the Pharmasset acquisition and contingent consideration expense related to certain acquisitions for which we receive no tax benefit. The 2011 effective tax rate of 23.6% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested, partially offset by state taxes and the non-tax deductible pharmaceutical excise tax. Our future effective tax rate may be impacted by various factors, including the amortization of certain acquisition-related intangibles for which we receive no tax benefit. Acquisitions YM Biosciences Inc. We completed the acquisition of YM BioSciences Inc. (YM), based in Canada, for total consideration transferred of $487.6 million on February 8, 2013, at which time YM became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead. YM was a drug development company primarily focused on advancing momelotinib (formerly known as CYT387), an orally administered, once-daily candidate for hematologic cancers. The fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities include primarily IPR&D of $362.7 million , goodwill of $127.2 million , deferred tax assets of $53.0 million with a full unrecognized tax benefit, deferred tax liabilities of $108.8 million and cash acquired of $108.9 million . Pro forma results of operations for the acquisition of YM have not been presented because this acquisition is not material to our consolidated results of operations. See Note 8, Intangible Assets and Goodwill for a description of the IPR&D acquired. Pharmasset, Inc. In January 2012, we completed the acquisition of Pharmasset, a publicly-held clinical-stage pharmaceutical company committed to discovering, developing and commercializing novel drugs to treat viral infections. Pharmasset's primary focus was the development of oral therapeutics for the treatment of HCV infection. Pharmasset's lead compound sofosbuvir (formerly known as GS-7977), is a nucleotide analog which, in December 2013, was approved by the FDA and Health Canada under the name Sovaldi, as a once-daily oral regimen for the treatment of HCV in patients with genotypes 1, 2, 3 or 4 infection, including those with hepatocellular carcinoma meeting Milan criteria (awaiting liver transplantation) and those with HCV/HIV-1 co-infection. In January 2014, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Sovaldi in all 28 countries in the European Union. The acquisition of Pharmasset has allowed us to advance our effort to develop all-oral regimens for the treatment of HCV. We acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Pharmasset for $137 per share in cash through a tender offer and subsequent merger under the terms of an agreement and plan of merger entered into in November 2011. The aggregate cash payment to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock was $11.05 billion . We financed the transaction with approximately $5.20 billion in cash on hand, $3.70 billion in senior unsecured notes issued in December 2011 and $2.15 billion in bank debt issued in January 2012. The Pharmasset acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. The results of operations of Pharmasset have been included in our Consolidated Statement of Income since January 13, 2012, the date on which we acquired approximately 88% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Pharmasset, cash consideration was transferred, and as a result, we obtained effective control of Pharmasset. The acquisition was completed on January 17, 2012, at which time Pharmasset became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead and was integrated into our operations. As we do not track earnings results by product candidate or therapeutic area, we do not maintain separate earnings results for the acquired Pharmasset business. 62 The following table summarizes the components of the cash paid to acquire Pharmasset (in thousands): Total consideration transferred $ 10,858,372 Stock-based compensation expense 193,937 Total cash paid $ 11,052,309 The $11.05 billion cash payment consisted of a $10.38 billion cash payment to the outstanding common stockholders as well as a $668.3 million cash payment to option holders under the Pharmasset stock option plans. The $10.38 billion cash payment to the outstanding common stockholders and $474.3 million of the cash payment to vested option holders under the Pharmasset stock option plans were accounted for as consideration transferred. The remaining $193.9 million of cash payment was accounted for as stock-based compensation expense resulting from the accelerated vesting of Pharmasset employee options immediately prior to the acquisition. The following table summarizes the acquisition date fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the consideration transferred (in thousands): Identifiable intangible assets $ 10,738,000 Cash and cash equivalents 106,737 Other assets acquired (liabilities assumed), net (43,182 ) Total identifiable net assets 10,801,555 Goodwill 56,817 Total consideration transferred $ 10,858,372 Identifiable Intangible Assets We acquired intangible assets, primarily comprised of the sofosbuvir IPR&D compound, which had an estimated fair value of $10.72 billion as of the date of acquisition. The fair value was determined using a probability-weighted income approach that discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The estimated net cash flows were discounted using a discount rate of 12% , which is based on the estimated weighted-average cost of capital for companies with profiles similar to that of Pharmasset. This rate is comparable to the estimated internal rate of return for the acquisition and represents the rate that market participants would use to value the intangible asset. The projected cash flows were based on key assumptions such as: estimates of revenues and operating profits related to each project considering its stage of development on the acquisition date; the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of the product candidate; the life of the potential commercialized product and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies; and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. Intangible assets related to IPR&D projects are considered to be indefinite-lived assets and are not amortized until the completion or abandonment of the associated R&D efforts. In December 2013, following the approval by the FDA and commercialization of sofosbuvir as Sovaldi, we reclassified the $10.72 billion purchased IPR&D project for sofosbuvir from an indefinite-lived to finite-lived intangible asset. We are amortizing this asset over its estimated useful life, utilizing the straight-line method. Goodwill The $56.8 million of goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and is attributable to the synergies expected from combining our R&D operations with Pharmasset's. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Stock-Based Compensation Expense The stock-based compensation expense recognized for the accelerated vesting of employee options immediately prior to the acquisition was reported in our Consolidated Statement of Income as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2012 Research and development expense $ 100,149 Selling, general and administrative expense 93,788 Total stock-based compensation expense $ 193,937 63 Other Costs Other costs incurred in connection with the acquisition include (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 Transaction costs (e.g. investment advisory, legal and accounting fees) $ 10,635 $ 28,461 Bridge financing costs 7,333 23,817 Restructuring costs 15,125 Total other costs $ 33,093 $ 52,278 The following table summarizes these costs by the line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income in which these costs were recognized (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 Research and development expense $ 7,906 $ Selling, general and administrative expense 17,854 28,461 Interest expense 7,333 23,817 Total other costs $ 33,093 $ 52,278 Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by our cash flows generated from operating activities, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and working capital decreased significantly in 2012 compared to 2011 as we completed our acquisition of Pharmasset in January 2012. The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, working capital and cash flow activities as of the end of, and for each of, the periods presented: (In thousands) 2013 2012 2011 As of December 31: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 2,570,590 $ 2,582,086 $ 9,963,972 Working capital (1) $ 948,332 $ 1,918,450 $ 11,431,584 Year Ended December 31: Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,104,988 $ 3,194,716 $ 3,639,010 Investing activities $ (254,355 ) $ (11,846,054 ) $ 3,589,845 Financing activities $ (2,543,941 ) $ 563,346 $ 1,763,569 (1) Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities remained relatively flat at $2.57 billion at December 31, 2013 , when compared to $2.58 billion at December 31, 2012 . During 2013 , we generated $3.10 billion in operating cash flows, paid $1.04 billion for the warrants related to our May 2013 Notes that settled in August 2013, repaid $1.67 billion in debt net of proceeds from convertible note hedges and utilized $378.6 million for the acquisition of YM, net of cash acquired. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.58 billion at December 31, 2012 , a decrease of $7.38 billion or 74% from December 31, 2011 primarily due to our acquisition of Pharmasset for $11.05 billion in January 2012. Of the total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2013 , approximately $1.55 billion was generated from operations in foreign jurisdictions and is intended for use in our foreign operations. We do not rely on unrepatriated earnings as a source of funds for our domestic business as we expect to have sufficient cash flow and borrowing capacity in the United States to fund our domestic operational and strategic needs. 64 Working Capital Working capital was $948.3 million at December 31, 2013 . The decrease of $970.1 million from working capital as of December 31, 2012 was due to an increase in the current portion of long-term debt and other accrued liabilities, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable, inventories and cash and cash equivalents. Working capital was $1.92 billion at December 31, 2012 . The decrease of $9.51 billion from working capital as of December 31, 2011 was primarily attributable to $11.05 billion in cash used for the Pharmasset acquisition and an increase in short-term debt of $1.17 billion related to the current portion of the bank debt issued to finance the Pharmasset acquisition and the current portion of our May 2013 Notes. Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities of $3.10 billion in 2013 primarily related to net income of $3.06 billion , adjusted for non-cash items such as $344.7 million of depreciation and amortization expenses and $252.0 million of stock-based compensation expenses. This was partially offset by $562.7 million of net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. In February 2014, we collected approximately $250.0 million in past due accounts receivable from customers based in Spain. Cash provided by operating activities of $3.19 billion in 2012 primarily related to net income of $2.57 billion , adjusted for non-cash items such as $278.2 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, $208.7 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $107.6 million of net cash inflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities and $112.6 million of tax benefits from employee stock plans. Cash provided by operating activities of $3.64 billion in 2011 primarily related to net income of $2.79 billion , adjusted for non-cash items such as $302.2 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, $211.9 million of net cash inflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities and $192.4 million of stock-based compensation expenses. Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities in 2013 was $254.4 million , consisting primarily of $378.6 million used in our acquisition of YM, net of cash acquired and $190.8 million of capital expenditures primarily related to construction in progress associated with new facilities at our headquarters to support the ongoing growth of our business. This was partially offset by $315.1 million of net proceeds from sales of marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities in 2012 was $11.85 billion , consisting primarily of $10.75 billion used for our acquisition of Pharmasset, net of the stock-based compensation expense and cash acquired, $672.4 million of net purchases of marketable securities and $397.0 million of capital expenditures, related primarily to the purchase of an office building for $180.0 million and a $155.7 million increase in construction in progress associated with new facilities at our headquarters to support the ongoing growth of our business. Cash provided by investing activities in 2011 was $3.59 billion , consisting of $4.31 billion of net proceeds related to the sales of marketable securities in connection with our acquisition of Pharmasset, partially offset by $588.6 million used in our acquisitions of Arresto Biosciences, Inc. and Calistoga Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and $131.9 million of capital expenditures. Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities in 2013 was $2.54 billion , consisting primarily of $4.44 billion used to repay debt financing which includes the maturity of our May 2013 Notes and conversions of our May 2014 Notes and May 2016 Notes, $1.04 billion for the warrants related to our May 2013 Notes that settled in August 2013 and $582.4 million used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase program. This cash outflow was partially offset by proceeds of $2.77 billion related to our convertible note hedges. Cash provided by financing activities in 2012 was $563.3 million , driven primarily by net proceeds of $2.14 billion from the issuance of bank debt in conjunction with the Pharmasset acquisition, proceeds of $466.3 million from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans and $213.9 million from proceeds received related to our convertible note hedges. The cash proceeds were partially offset by the $1.84 billion used to repay debt financing during the year and $667.0 million used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase programs. Cash provided by financing activities in 2011 was $1.76 billion , driven primarily by the issuance of $4.66 billion in senior unsecured notes, of which $3.67 billion was raised in December 2011 to partially fund the Pharmasset acquisition, net of issuance costs, and $211.7 million in proceeds from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans. The cash 65 proceeds were partially offset by $2.38 billion used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and $650.0 million used to repay our convertible senior notes due in May 2011. Debt and Credit Facility Bank Debt In January 2012, in conjunction with our acquisition of Pharmasset, we entered into a five-year $1.25 billion revolving credit facility credit agreement (the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement), a $750.0 million short-term revolving credit facility credit agreement (the Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement) and a $1.00 billion term loan facility (the Term Loan Credit Agreement). We borrowed $750.0 million under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, $400.0 million under the Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement and $1.00 billion under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, upon the close of the acquisition. In 2012, we fully repaid the $1.40 billion in outstanding debt under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement, at which time both agreements terminated. In 2013 , we repaid $150.0 million under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement. The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative, negative and financial maintenance covenants and events of default. The loan bears interest at either (i) the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin or (ii) the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, each as defined in the credit agreement. We may reduce the commitments and may prepay the loan in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. We are required to comply with certain covenants under the credit agreement and note indentures and as of December 31, 2013 , we were in compliance with all such covenants. The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement was inclusive of a $30.0 million swing line loan sub-facility and a $25.0 million letter of credit sub-facility. As of December 31, 2013 , we had $4.7 million in letters of credit outstanding under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement. The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owed under the agreement shall be due and payable in January 2017. Maturity of May 2013 Convertible Senior Notes In 2013, a portion of the May 2013 Notes was converted and on May 1, 2013, the remainder of the notes matured. We repaid an aggregate principal balance of $426.3 million . We also paid $714.0 million in cash related to the conversion spread of the notes, which represents the conversion value in excess of the principal amount, and received $714.0 million in cash from the convertible note hedges related to these notes. The warrants related to the May 2013 Notes expired in August 2013. We paid $1.04 billion to settle the warrants as the average market price of our common stock exceeded the warrants' exercise price. Convertible Senior Notes and Senior Unsecured Notes In 2013 , a portion of our May 2014 Notes and May 2016 Notes was converted and we repaid $1.09 billion of the principal balance, primarily comprised of May 2014 Notes. We also paid $2.06 billion in cash related to the conversion spread on these notes, which represents the conversion value in excess of the principal amount, and received $2.06 billion in cash from our convertible note hedges related to these notes. In 2014, our May 2014 Notes will mature and we will settle the related warrants. As our stock price currently exceeds the conversion and warrants exercise prices, we expect based on the stock price as of the filing of this form, to pay approximately $3.10 to $3.40 billion to settle the aggregate principal of our May 2014 Notes and the related warrants. 66 The following is a summary of our borrowings under various financing arrangements (in thousands, except percentages): Interest December 31, Type of Borrowing Description Issue Date Due Date Rate 2013 2012 Convertible Senior May 2013 Notes April 2006 May 2013 0.625% $ $ 419,433 Convertible Senior May 2014 Notes July 2010 May 2014 1.00% 234,217 1,210,213 Convertible Senior May 2016 Notes July 2010 May 2016 1.625% 1,113,043 1,157,692 Senior Unsecured April 2021 Notes March 2011 April 2021 4.50% 993,781 992,923 Senior Unsecured December 2014 Notes December 2011 December 2014 2.40% 749,710 749,394 Senior Unsecured December 2016 Notes December 2011 December 2016 3.05% 699,326 699,095 Senior Unsecured December 2021 Notes December 2011 December 2021 4.40% 1,247,716 1,247,428 Senior Unsecured December 2041 Notes December 2011 December 2041 5.65% 997,885 997,810 Credit Facility Five-Year Revolver January 2012 January 2017 Variable 600,000 750,000 Total debt, net 6,635,678 8,223,988 Less current portion 2,696,970 1,169,433 Total long-term debt, net $ 3,938,708 $ 7,054,555 We believe our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash flows generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. During 2014, we will consider financing opportunities to better position us for further growth. The amount and terms of any potential financing opportunities, as well as other factors, could affect our liquidity and financial condition. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following: the commercial performance of our current and future products; the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials; the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews; the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities; administrative expenses; the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities; the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products; costs associated with the settlement and conversion of our convertible senior notes and related warrants; the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of litigation and government investigations. We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. If such funding is required, we cannot guarantee that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. 67 Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilities resulting from business combinations and our tax provision. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Product Sales We recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery to the customer has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We record estimated reductions to revenues for government rebates such as Medicaid reimbursements, customer incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and expected returns of expired products. These estimates are deducted from gross product sales at the time such revenues are recognized. Of these reductions from gross product sales, government rebates significantly impact our reported net product sales and are based upon certain estimates that require complex and significant judgment by management. Estimates are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information such as actual experience. Accrued Government Rebates and Allowance for Government Chargebacks We estimate reductions to our revenues for government-managed Medicaid programs as well as to certain other qualifying federal, state and foreign government programs for the reimbursement of portions of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by these programs. These reductions are settled either by us if invoiced directly, or through charge-backs from our wholesalers. For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers at a lower contractual government price, the wholesalers charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual government price. Although we may pay rebates in countries outside of the United States, to date, payments made to foreign governments have not represented a significant portion of our total government rebates. Our estimate of government rebates that will be invoiced directly to us are recorded in accrued government rebates on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our estimate of government rebates that will be charged back through our wholesalers are recorded as allowances against accounts receivable. Our consolidated accrued government rebates totaled $983.5 million as of December 31, 2013 and $745.1 million as of December 31, 2012. Our consolidated allowance for government chargebacks totaled $148.5 million as of December 31, 2013 and $111.1 million as of December 31, 2012 and were recorded against accounts receivable. For government programs in the United States, our rebate allowances are estimated based on product sold, contractual terms, historical utilization rates and estimated population and channel inventory data obtained from our major U.S. wholesalers in accordance with our inventory management agreements. We also take into consideration new information regarding changes in these programs' regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates and/or our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs. Our U.S. accrued government rebates totaled $959.9 million as of December 31, 2013 and $716.6 million as of December 31, 2012. Our U.S. allowance for government chargebacks totaled $148.5 million as of December 31, 2013 and $111.1 million as of December 31, 2012 and were recorded against accounts receivable. U.S. government rebates and chargebacks totaled $3.08 billion during 2013 , and $2.59 billion during 2012 , both representing 21% , of total gross product sales which were deducted from gross product sales. During 2011 , U.S. government rebates and chargebacks totaling $1.86 billion , representing 17% of total gross product sales, were deducted from gross product sales. We believe that the methodology that we use to estimate our sales allowances for government price reductions is reasonable and appropriate given the current facts and circumstances. However, actual results in future periods may differ significantly. One of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which became effective in 2010, was the extension of the Medicaid drug rebate program to patients in Medicaid managed care insurance plans for whom rebates were previously not required. Estimating such rebates during the implementation of the ACA has been complex, in part, due to delays in actual claims data provided by the Medicaid program. 68 Amounts recorded as a reduction (increase) to product sales in 2013, 2012 and 2011 that related to prior periods were $(114.0) million , $10.5 million and $22.9 million, respectively. The increase to product sales of $114.0 million , of which approximately $72.2 million related to our estimate of 2012 claims and the rest related to our estimates of 2011 and other prior years claims, resulted in part, due to changes in our estimates of Medicaid managed care rebates. Based on the current information available to us, actual government rebates and chargebacks claimed for prior periods have varied by less than 3% from our estimates. The following table summarizes the aggregate activity in our U.S. government rebates allowance and accrued government rebate accounts (in thousands): Accrued government rebates and allowance for government chargebacks: Balance at Beginning of Year Reduction/(Increase) to Product Sales Deducted from Accruals Balance at End of Year Year ended December 31, 2013: Activity related to 2013 sales $ $ 3,197,052 $ 2,182,454 $ 1,014,598 Activity related to sales prior to 2013 827,691 (114,048 ) 619,782 93,861 Total $ 827,691 $ 3,083,004 $ 2,802,236 $ 1,108,459 Year ended December 31, 2012: Activity related to 2012 sales $ $ 2,580,317 $ 1,836,199 $ 744,118 Activity related to sales prior to 2012 597,693 10,511 524,631 83,573 Total $ 597,693 $ 2,590,828 $ 2,360,830 $ 827,691 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including, but not limited to, contractual payment terms, historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days sales outstanding by geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate; however, significant deterioration in any of the above factors could materially change these expectations and may result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , our allowance for doubtful accounts was $58.9 million and $50.9 million, respectively. Valuation of Intangible Assets In conjunction with our business combinations, we have recorded intangible assets primarily related to IPR&D projects. We had total intangible assets of $11.90 billion as of December 31, 2013 and $11.74 billion as of December 31, 2012. As part of our Pharmasset acquisition, we acquired intangible assets, primarily comprised of the sofosbuvir IPR&D compound, which had an estimated fair value of $10.72 billion as of the date of acquisition. In December 2013, following the approval by the FDA and commercialization of sofosbuvir as Sovaldi, we reclassified the $10.72 billion purchased IPR&D project from an indefinite-lived to finite-lived intangible asset. We are amortizing this asset over its estimated useful life, utilizing the straight-line method. The identifiable intangible assets are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The models used in valuing these intangible assets require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates; the probability of success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development; the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates; the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates. Intangible assets related to IPR&D projects are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated R&D efforts. If and when development is complete, which generally occurs if and when regulatory approval to market a product is obtained, the associated assets would be deemed finite-lived and would then be amortized based on their 69 respective estimated useful lives at that point in time. During the period the assets are considered indefinite-lived, they will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment on an annual basis as well as between annual tests if we become aware of any events or changes that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the IPR&D projects below their respective carrying amounts. The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets is dependent on assumptions such as the expected timing or probability of achieving the specified milestones, changes in projected revenues or changes in discount rates. Significant judgment is employed in determining these assumptions and changes to our assumptions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in any given period. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives primarily on a straight-line basis. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Valuation of Contingent Consideration Liabilities Resulting from Business Combinations In conjunction with our business combinations, we have recorded contingent consideration liabilities payable upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory approval or sales-based milestone events. The contingent consideration liabilities are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The models used in valuing these contingent consideration liabilities require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates; the probability of success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development; the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates; the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. W e revalue contingent consideration obligations each quarter following the acquisition and record increases or decreases in their fair value in R&D expense within our Consolidated Statement of Income. Increases or decreases in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities can result from updates to assumptions such as the expected timing or probability of achieving the specified milestones, changes in projected revenues or changes in discount rates. Significant judgment is employed in determining these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Updates to assumptions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in any given period. Actual results may differ from estimates. We had total contingent consideration liabilities of $263.8 million as of December 31, 2013 and $205.1 million as of December 31, 2012. Tax Provision We estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. Various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our income tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, interpretations of existing tax laws, changes in tax laws and rates, our portion of the non-tax deductible pharmaceutical excise tax, the accounting for stock options and other share-based payments, mergers and acquisitions, the ability to manufacture product in our Cork, Ireland facility, the amortization of certain acquisition related intangibles for which we receive no tax benefit, expiration of the federal research tax credit, future levels of R&D spending, changes in accounting standards, changes in the mix of earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings and resolution of federal, state and foreign income tax audits. The impact on our income tax provision resulting from the above mentioned factors may be significant and could have a negative impact on our net income. 70 We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We do not believe any such uncertain tax positions currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. At December 31, 2013 and 2012 , we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $236.5 million and $157.0 million , respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $195.1 million and $126.5 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. As of December 31, 2013 , we believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $9.0 million in the next 12 months as we expect to have clarification from the IRS and other tax authorities regarding our uncertain tax positions. With respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authorities. We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. For federal income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2008 and onwards. For certain acquired entities, the statute of limitations is open for all years from inception due to our utilization of their net operating losses and credits carried over from prior years. For California income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2008 and onwards. Our income tax returns are audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations consist of debt obligations, operating leases, capital commitments, purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory-related items and clinical trials contracts. The following table summarizes our significant enforceable and legally binding obligations, future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that certain of these obligations may be cancelable as of December 31, 2013 (in thousands): Payments due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than one year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Debt (1) $ 9,201,555 $ 3,005,855 $ 1,055,700 $ 313,000 $ 4,827,000 Operating lease obligations 226,313 48,976 87,729 57,686 31,922 Capital commitments (2) 42,538 42,538 Purchase obligations (3)(4) 1,990,598 1,588,544 324,974 77,080 Clinical trials (5) 429,365 218,915 150,496 49,705 10,249 Total $ 11,890,369 $ 4,904,828 $ 1,618,899 $ 497,471 $ 4,869,171 (1) Our debt obligations include convertible senior notes, senior unsecured notes and Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement. We incur future interest payments based on fixed rates of 1.00% and 1.625% for May 2014 Notes and May 2016 Notes, respectively and 2.40%, 3.05%, 4.50%, 4.40% and 5.65% for our senior unsecured notes due in December 2014, December 2016, April 2021, December 2021 and December 2041, respectively. The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement incurs interest based on variable interest rates. During 2013 , the portion of interest expense related to variable interest totaled $7.8 million . (2) At December 31, 2013 , we had firm capital project commitments of approximately $42.5 million primarily relating to facilities improvement projects. (3) At December 31, 2013 , we had firm purchase commitments related to active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain inventory-related items. These amounts include minimum purchase requirements and actual purchases are expected to significantly exceed these amounts. 71 (4) In addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration and development arrangements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and have not been included in the table above. (5) At December 31, 2013 , we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. Although all of our material contracts with CROs are cancelable, we historically have not canceled such contracts. These amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or terminations of, existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts. We had total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of $261.5 million as of December 31, 2013 . We believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $9.0 million in the next 12 months as we expect to have clarification from the IRS and other tax authorities regarding our uncertain tax positions. With respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authorities. The unrecognized tax benefits were included in current and long-term income taxes payable and long-term deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and have not been included in the table above. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an update to the existing standard for liabilities. The update provides guidance for the recognition, measurement and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements. For obligations for which the total amount is fixed at the reporting date, an entity will be required to measure those obligations as the sum of the amount the reporting entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among its co-obligors and any additional amount the reporting entity expects to pay on behalf of its co-obligors. Such entities will also be required to disclose the nature, amount and other significant information about the obligations. This guidance will become effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2014. We believe that the adoption of this update will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In July 2013, the FASB issued an update related to presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists. An unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward, except as follows. To the extent a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets. This guidance will become effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2014. We believe that the adoption of this update will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
