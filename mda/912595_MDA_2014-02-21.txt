ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of both MAA and the Operating Partnership, of which the MAA is the sole general partner and in which MAA owned a 94.7% limited partner interest as of December 31, 2013 . MAA conducts all of its business through the Operating Partnership and the Operating Partnership various subsidiaries. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and that involves some degree of uncertainty. The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. We believe that the estimates and assumptions listed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require the greatest subjective determinations and form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical. These critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, capitalization of expenditures and depreciation and amortization of assets, acquisition of real estate assets, impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill, fair value of derivative financial instruments and loss contingencies. Revenue Recognition and Real Estate Sales We primarily lease multifamily residential apartments under operating leases generally with terms of one year or less. Rental revenues are recognized using a method that represents a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and other revenues are recorded when earned. We record gains and losses on real estate sales in accordance with accounting standards governing the sale of real estate. For sale transactions meeting the requirements for the full accrual method, we remove the assets and liabilities from our Consolidated Balance Sheets and record the gain or loss in the period the transaction closes. For properties contributed to joint ventures, MAA records gains on the partial sale in proportion to the outside partners interest in the venture. Capitalization of expenditures and depreciation and amortization of assets We carry real estate assets at depreciated cost. Depreciation and amortization is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings, 5 years for furniture, fixtures, and equipment, 3 to 5 years for computers and software, and 6 months for acquired leases, all of which are subjective determinations. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements, renovations and replacements are capitalized. The cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by us in order to elevate the condition of the property to our standards are capitalized as incurred. Acquisition of real estate assets We account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with ASC 805-10, Business Combinations , which requires the fair value of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and furniture, fixtures and equipment, and identified intangible assets, consisting of the value of in-place leases. We allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property, which includes the land, building, and furniture, fixtures, and equipment, determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, based on management determination of the relative fair values of these assets. Management determines the as-if-vacant fair value of a property using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers. These methods include using stabilized Net Operating Income, or NOI, and market specific capitalization and discount rates. The purchase price is also allocated to any debt and other liabilities that are assumed as part of the transaction. 45 In allocating the fair value of identified intangible assets of an acquired property, the in-place leases are valued based on current rent rates and time and cost to lease a unit. Management concluded that the residential leases acquired on each of its property acquisitions are approximately at market rates since the lease terms generally do not extend beyond one year. For larger, portfolio style acquisitions, like the Merger, management engages a third party valuation specialist to assist with the fair value assessment, which includes an allocation of the purchase price. Similar to management's methods, the third party uses cash flow analysis as well as an income approach and a market approach to determine the fair value of assets. The third party uses stabilized NOI and market specific capitalization and discount rates. Management reviews the inputs used by the third party specialist as well as the allocation of the purchase price provided by the third party to ensure reasonableness and that the procedures are performed in accordance with management's policy. The initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management preliminary assessment, which may differ when final information becomes available. Subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price allocation, if any, are made within the allocation period, which typically does not exceed one year. Impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill We account for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and evaluate our goodwill for impairment under accounting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets. We evaluate goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified. We periodically evaluate long-lived assets, including investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance, market conditions and legal factors. Long-lived assets, such as real estate assets, equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented on the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of properties classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss for goodwill is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill. This determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps. First, we determine the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it to its carrying amount. In the apartment industry, the primary method used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate. We determine the appropriate capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in a property market or submarket. Second, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with accounting standards for business combinations. The residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. Fair value of derivative financial instruments We utilize certain derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, during the normal course of business to manage, or hedge, the interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage well-defined interest rate risk associated with the transaction. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedging instrument, changes in the hedging instrument must be highly effective at offsetting changes in the hedged item. The historical correlation of the hedging instruments and the underlying hedged items are assessed before entering into the hedging relationship and on a quarterly basis thereafter, and have been found to be highly effective. We measure ineffectiveness using the change in the variable cash flows method or the hypothetical derivative method for interest rate swaps and the hypothetical derivative method for interest rate caps for each reporting period through the term of the hedging instruments. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded in earnings if in an overhedged position. 46 The change in fair value of the interest rate swaps and the intrinsic value or fair value of interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of shareholders equity. The valuation of our derivative financial instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The fair values of interest rate caps are determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the interest rate caps. The variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the interest rate cap are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities. Additionally, we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. Changes in the fair values of our derivatives are primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes 7 and 8 for further discussion. Loss Contingencies The outcomes of claims, disputes and legal proceedings including those described in Item 3 Legal Proceedings of this Form 10-K are subject to significant uncertainty. We record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We review these accruals quarterly and makes revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances. When a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable, we do not accrue the loss. However, if the loss (or an additional loss in excess of the accrual) is at least a reasonable possibility and material, then we disclose a reasonable estimate of the possible loss, or range of loss, if such reasonable estimate can be made. If we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss, or range of loss, then that is disclosed. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or range of loss is reasonably estimable, often involve a series of complex judgments about future events. Among the factors that we consider in this assessment, including with respect to the matters disclosed in Item 3 Legal Proceedings of this Form 10-K, are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims, the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency (if reasonably estimable), the progress of the matter, existing law and precedent, the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, our experience in similar matters, the facts available to us at the time of assessment, and how we intend to respond, or have responded, to the proceeding or claim. Our assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress. For matters where we are not currently able to reasonably estimate a range of reasonably possible loss, the factors that have contributed to this determination include the following: (i) the damages sought are indeterminate; (ii) the proceedings are in the early stages; (iii) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories or a large or uncertain number of actual or potential cases or parties; and/or (iv) discussions with the parties in matters that are expected ultimately to be resolved through negotiation and settlement have not reached the point where we believe a reasonable estimate of loss, or range of loss, can be made. In such instances, we believe that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss or business impact, if any. OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 As noted earlier, on October 1, 2013, we consummated the Merger and acquired all of Colonial's net assets. As a result of the Merger, the results of operations for 2013 include 12 months of results for MAA and three months of results for Colonial. Our December 31, 2013 balance sheets include the combined assets and liabilities of MAA and Colonial. All properties acquired from Colonial have been placed in our Non-Same Store operating segment, as the properties are recent acquisitions and have not been owned and stabilized for at least 12 months. We experienced an increase in income from continuing operations in 2013 as increases in revenues outpaced increases in expenses. The increases in revenues came from a 5.1% increase in our large market same store segment, a 2.8% increase in our secondary market same store segment and a 478.8% increase in our non-same store and other segment, which was primarily a result of the Merger. The increase in expense came from a 2.7% increase in our large market same store segment, a 2.1% increase in our secondary market same store segment and a 479.0% increase in our non-same store and other segment, which was primarily the result of the Merger. Our same store portfolio represents those communities that have been held and have been stabilized for at least 12 months. Communities excluded from the same store portfolio would include recent acquisitions, communities being developed or in lease-up, communities undergoing extensive renovations, and communities identified as discontinued operations. The drivers of these increases are discussed below in the results of operations section. 47 As discussed above, all properties acquired through the Merger have been placed in our Non-Same Store operating segment. Based on Colonial's same store classification of its properties prior to the Merger, properties acquired from Colonial experienced an increase in revenue of 3.3%, an increase in property operating expenses of 2.4%, and an increase in NOI of 3.8% based on the three months ended December 31, 2013 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2012 , which covers a period of time for which MAA's management was not involved. We have grown externally during the past three years by following our acquisition strategy to invest in large and mid-sized growing markets in the Sunbelt region of the United States. Apart from the Merger, we acquired eleven properties for our 100% owned portfolio in 2011 , seven in 2012 and four in 2013 . We also purchased one property through one of our joint ventures in 2011 . We did not purchase any properties through our joint ventures in 2012 or 2013 . Offsetting some of this increased revenue stream were two property dispositions in 2011 , nine dispositions in 2012 , and nine dispositions in 2013 . The following table shows our multifamily real estate assets as of 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 : 2013 2012 2011 Properties 275 166 167 Units 83,641 49,591 49,133 Development Units 1,461 774 950 Average Effective Monthly Rent/Unit, excluding lease-up and development $ 883.40 $ 855.71 $ 793.46 Occupancy, excluding lease-up and development 94.9 % 95.1 % 95.1 % See discussion of same store average rent per unit and occupancy comparisons in the Trends section below. In addition to the multi-family assets detailed above, we also owned or owned an interest in five commercial properties totaling 1.2 million square feet of leasable space. Average effective monthly rent per unit is equal to the average of gross rent amounts after the effect of leasing concessions for occupied units plus prevalent market rates asked for unoccupied units, divided by the total number of units. Leasing concessions represent discounts to the current market rate. We believe average effective monthly rent is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pricing. It does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit. The following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 . This discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS As a result of the Merger, the results of operations for 2013 include twelve months of results for MAA and three months of results for Colonial. Our December 31, 2013 balance sheet includes the combined assets and liabilities of MAA and Colonial. Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2013 , to the Year Ended December 31, 2012 Property Revenues The following table shows our property revenues by segment for the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2013 Year Ended December 31, 2012 Increase Percentage Increase Large Market Same Store $ 256,141 $ 243,721 $ 12,420 5.1 % Secondary Market Same Store 207,572 201,834 5,738 2.8 % Non-Same Store and Other 170,374 29,434 140,940 478.8 % Total $ 634,087 $ 474,989 $ 159,098 33.5 % 48 The increases in property revenues from our large market same store and secondary market same store groups are primarily a result of increased average rent per unit of 3.9%. The increase in property revenues from our non-same store and other group is primarily due to the addition of the Colonial portfolio as a result of the Merger. Property Operating Expenses Property operating expenses include costs for property personnel, property personnel bonuses, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and depreciation and amortization. The following table shows our property operating expenses by segment for the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2013 Year Ended December 31, 2012 Increase Percentage Increase Large Market Same Store $ 103,416 $ 100,661 $ 2,755 2.7 % Secondary Market Same Store 83,785 82,070 1,715 2.1 % Non-Same Store and Other 66,113 11,418 54,695 479.0 % Total $ 253,314 $ 194,149 $ 59,165 30.5 % The increase in property operating expenses from our large market same store group is primarily a result of increases in real estate taxes, general liability insurance, and contract labor, with real estate taxes being the largest component. The increase in property operating expenses from our secondary market same store group is primarily a result of increases in real estate taxes, general liability insurance, and commissions, with real estate taxes being the largest component. The increase in property operating expenses from our non-same store and other group is primarily due to the addition of the Colonial portfolio as a result of the merger. Depreciation and Amortization The following table shows our depreciation and amortization expense by segment for the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2013 Year Ended December 31, 2012 Increase Percentage Increase Large Market Same Store $ 60,329 $ 59,914 $ 415 0.7 % Secondary Market Same Store 50,362 49,871 491 1.0 % Non-Same Store and Other 76,288 11,426 64,862 567.7 % Total $ 186,979 $ 121,211 $ 65,768 54.3 % The increases in depreciation and amortization expense from our large market same store and secondary market same store groups resulted from asset additions made during the normal course of business. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense from our non-same store and other group is primarily due to the addition of the Colonial portfolio as a result of the merger. General and Administrative General and Administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 was approximately $15.6 million , an increase of $1.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2012 . The majority of the increase was related to an increase in tax preparation fees, audit fees, and stock incentives. Merger and Integration Costs Merger related expenses for the acquisition of Colonial were approximately $32.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 . We also incurred integration related expenses of $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 . There were no merger related expenses or integration related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2012 . 49 Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 was approximately $75.9 million , an increase of $18.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2012 . The increase was primarily the result of an increase in our average debt outstanding from the year ended December 31, 2012 to the year ended December 31, 2013 of approximately $451.6 million, due primarily to the assumption of Colonial's debt as a result of the Merger. Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations before gain on sale for the year ended December 31, 2013 was approximately $5.1 million , a decrease of $1.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2012 . The decrease is driven by the fact that the properties sold in 2013 had lower net income than the properties sold in 2012 . We recorded a gain on sale of discontinued operations of $76.8 million and $41.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , respectively. The increase in the gain is caused by the proceeds being greater than the net book value of the properties in 2013 compared to 2012 . Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2013 was approximately $4.0 million , a decrease of $0.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2012 . Net Income Attributable to MAA Primarily as a result of the foregoing, net income attributable to MAA increased by approximately $10.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 from the year ended December 31, 2012 . Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2012 , to the Year Ended December 31, 2011 Property Revenues The following table shows our property revenues by segment for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2012 Year Ended December 31, 2011 Increase Percentage Increase Large Market Same Store $ 243,721 $ 219,068 $ 24,653 11.3 % Secondary Market Same Store 201,834 183,087 18,747 10.2 % Non-Same Store and Other 29,434 6,610 22,824 345.3 % Total $ 474,989 $ 408,765 $ 66,224 16.2 % The increases in property revenues from our large market same store and secondary market same store groups are primarily a result of increased average rent per unit of approximately 5.0%. The increase in property revenues from our non-same store and other group is primarily a result of acquisitions. 50 Property Operating Expenses Property operating expenses include costs for property personnel, property personnel bonuses, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and depreciation and amortization. The following table shows our property operating expenses by segment for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2012 Year Ended December 31, 2011 Increase Percentage Increase Large Market Same Store $ 100,661 $ 93,883 $ 6,778 7.2 % Secondary Market Same Store 82,070 76,489 5,581 7.3 % Non-Same Store and Other 11,418 3,191 8,227 257.8 % Total $ 194,149 $ 173,563 $ 20,586 11.9 % The increases in property operating expenses from our large market same store and secondary market same store groups are primarily a result of increases in employees' salaries and medical insurance. The increase in property operating expenses from our non-same store and other group is primarily a result of acquisitions. Depreciation and Amortization The following table shows our depreciation and amortization expense by segment for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2012 Year Ended December 31, 2011 Increase Percentage Increase Large Market Same Store $ 59,914 $ 56,694 $ 3,220 5.7 % Secondary Market Same Store 49,871 45,891 3,980 8.7 % Non-Same Store and Other 11,426 3,424 8,002 233.7 % Total $ 121,211 $ 106,009 $ 15,202 14.3 % The increases in depreciation and amortization expense from our large market same store and secondary market same store groups resulted from asset additions made during the normal course of business. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense from our non-same store and other group is primarily a result of acquisitions. General and Administrative General and Administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 was approximately $13.8 million , a decrease of $4.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2011 . The majority of the decrease was related to a reduction in stock incentives and worker's compensation insurance. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 was approximately $57.9 million , an increase of $1.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2011 . The increase was primarily the result of an increase in our average debt outstanding of $98.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2011 to the year ended December 31, 2012 . Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations before gain on sale for the year ended December 31, 2012 was approximately $6.9 million , a decrease of $2.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2011 . The decrease is driven by the fact that the properties sold in 2012 had lower net income than the properties sold in 2011 . We recorded a gain on sale of discontinued operations of $41.6 million and $12.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 , respectively. The increase in the gain is caused by the proceeds being greater than 51 the net book value of the properties in 2012 compared to 2011 and by the fact that we sold 9 properties in 2012 compared to two properties in 2011 . Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2012 was approximately $4.6 million , an increase of $2.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2011 . Net Income Attributable to MAA Primarily as a result of the foregoing, net income attributable to MAA increased by approximately $56.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 from the year ended December 31, 2011 . Funds from Operations Funds from operations, or FFO, represents net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding extraordinary items, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, asset impairment, gains or losses on disposition of real estate assets, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate, and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect FFO on the same basis. Disposition of real estate assets includes sales of discontinued operations. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other GAAP measurement of performance, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. We believe that FFO is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance because its calculation excludes depreciation and amortization expense on real estate assets. We believe that GAAP historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. Our calculation of FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. Core FFO represents FFO excluding certain non-cash or non-routine items such as acquisition, merger and integration expenses, mark-to-market debt adjustments and loss or gain on debt extinguishment. While our definition of Core FFO is similar to others in our industry, our precise methodology for calculating Core FFO may differ from that utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. Core FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income. MAA believes that Core FFO is helpful in understanding our operating performance in that it removes certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance. 52 The following table is a reconciliation of Core FFO and FFO to consolidated net income for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Net income available for MAA common shareholders $ 115,281 $ 105,223 $ 48,821 Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets 184,671 118,848 104,463 Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets of discontinued operations 2,716 7,384 10,386 Gain on sales of discontinued operations (76,844 ) (41,635 ) (12,799 ) Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets of real estate joint ventures 1,203 1,887 2,261 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 3,998 4,602 2,410 Funds from operations 231,025 196,309 155,542 Acquisition expense 1,393 1,581 3,319 Merger Related Expenses 32,403 Integration related expenses 5,102 Mark-to-market debt adjustment (7,992 ) (767 ) (360 ) Loss on debt extinguishment 426 654 755 Core funds from operations $ 262,357 $ 197,777 $ 159,256 FFO for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased approximately $34.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily as a result of the increase in total property revenues of approximately $159.1 million discussed above that was only partially offset by the $59.2 million increase in property operating expenses as well as the $32.4 million in merger related expenses and $18.0 million of increased interest expense. FFO for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased approximately $40.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily as a result of the increase in property revenues of approximately $66.2 million discussed above that was only partially offset by the $20.6 million increase in property operating expenses. Core FFO for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased approximately $64.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily as a result of the increase in total property revenues of approximately $159.1 million discussed above that was only partially offset by the $59.2 million increase in property operating expenses as well as the $18.0 million of increased interest expense. Core FFO for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by approximately $38.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily as a result of the increase in total property revenues of approximately $66.2 million discussed above that was only partially offset by the $20.6 million increase in property operating expenses. Trends During the year ended December 31, 2013 , rental demand for apartments was strong, as it was during the year ended December 31, 2012 . This strength was evident on two fronts: same store average physical occupancy during the year ended December 31, 2013 was essentially flat with the year ended December 31, 2012 (95.75% for 2013 as compared to 95.83% for 2012 ); while same store effective rent per unit continued to grow, up 3.9% in 2013 over 2012 . We have maintained this momentum despite job formation, one of the primary drivers of apartment demand, continuing to increase at a below average pace. An important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain a broad diversity of markets across the Sunbelt region of the United States. The diversity of markets tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area. We believe that a well diversified portfolio, including both large and select secondary markets, will perform well in up cycles as well as weather down cycles better. As of December 31, 2013 , including the impact of the Merger, we were invested in approximately 46 defined Metropolitan Statistical Areas, with approximately 66% of our multifamily assets, based on gross assets, in large markets and 34% of our multifamily assets in select secondary markets. 53 New supply of rental units entering the market remained below historical new supply delivery averages, but multifamily permitting did pick up in 2013 as compared to 2012 . We believe this permitting will ultimately lead to an increase in supply but also believe the lack of new apartments in recent years combined with demand from new households will help keep supply and demand in balance. Competition from condominiums reverting back to rental units, or new condominiums being converted to rental, was not a major factor in our portfolio because most of our submarkets have not been primary areas for condominium development. We have found the same to be true for rental competition from single family homes. We have avoided committing a significant amount of capital to markets or submarkets where most of the excessive inflation in house prices has occurred. We saw significant rental competition from condominiums or single family houses in only a few of our submarkets. Our focus continues to be on increasing pricing where possible through our revenue management system, while maintaining strong physical occupancy. As noted above, phyisical occupancy remained strong while effective rents continued to grow. With strong occupancy in place as we continue through the winter leasing season, we will be able to maximize the market's pricing potential in the first quarter of 2014. Overall same store revenues increased 4.1% for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 . This increase was primarily due to rising rents and helped by increases in ancillary income. Also, we believe that more sustainable credit terms for residential mortgages should work to favor rental demand at existing multi-family properties. Long term, we expect demographic trends (including the growth of prime age groups for rentals and immigration and population movement to the southeast and southwest) will continue to build apartment rental demand for our markets. We continue to develop improved products, operating systems and procedures that we believe enable us to capture more revenues. The continued benefit of ancillary services (such as our cable saver and deposit saver programs), improved collections and utility reimbursements enable us to capture increased revenue. We also actively work on improving processes and products to reduce expenses, such as new web-sites and internet access for our residents that enable them to transact their business with us more simply and effectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources To fund the Merger, we issued approximately 31.9 million shares of MAA common stock and approximately 2.6 million OP Units on October 1, 2013. Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased to $264.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 from $211.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . This change was a result of various items, including higher revenue as discussed above. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $83.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $329.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 due to the factors discussed below. In the year ended December 31, 2013 , we had acquisition cash outflows of $139.2 million compared to $312.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . During 2013 , we had cash outflows of $53.0 million for development activities, compared to $74.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . During 2013 , we also had cash outflows of $11.0 million for improvements to existing real estate assets compared to $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . The decrease in cash outflows from investing activities was offset by an increase in cash inflows from disposition activity. During the year ended December 31, 2013 , we had cash inflows of approximately $129.0 million , which were related to the sale of nine properties. In the year ended December 31, 2012 , we had cash inflows of $110.1 million , which were related to the sale of nine properties from our same store portfolio. As of December 31, 2013 , we owned 74,830,726 OP Units, comprising a 94.7% limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, while the remaining 4,227,384 outstanding OP Units were held by limited partners of the Operating Partnership. Holders of OP Units (other than us and our affiliates) may require us to redeem their OP Units from time to time, in which case we may, at our option, pay the redemption price either in cash (in an amount per OP Unit equal, in general, to the average closing price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange over a specified period prior to the redemption date) or by delivering one share of our common stock (subject to adjustment under specified circumstances) for each OP Unit so redeemed. In addition, we have registered the 4,227,384 shares of our common stock, which as of December 31, 2013 , were issuable upon redemption of OP Units held by the Operating Partnership's limited partners under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, so that those shares can be sold freely in the public markets. To the extent that additional OP Units are issued to limited partners of the Operating Partnership, we will likely register the additional shares of common stock issuable upon redemption of those OP Units under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, so that those shares can also be sold in the public markets. If we issue shares of our common stock upon the redemption of OP Units in our Operating Partnership, sales of 54 substantial amounts of such shares of our common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock or may impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or other equity securities. Net cash used in financing activities was approximately $100.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $70.0 million provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 . In the year ended December 31, 2013 , we had cash inflows of $347.8 million from proceeds of notes payable compared to $325.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . In the year ended December 31, 2013 , we received proceeds of approximately $25.7 million primarily from the issuance of common stock through our at-the-market program, or ATM. During the year ended December 31, 2012 , we received proceeds of approximately $196.3 million primarily through these same programs. In the year ended December 31, 2013 , we had cash outflows of $308.0 million from the net change in credit lines compared to $320.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . On March 2, 2012, we closed on an underwritten public offering of 1,955,000 shares of common stock. UBS Investment Bank and Jefferies & Company, Inc. acted as joint bookrunning managers. This transaction resulted in net proceeds of $120.1 million . No such issuances occurred during 2011 or 2013. During 2013 , we sold 365,011 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately $24.8 million through our ATM. This compares to 1,155,511 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately $75.9 million for 2012 . As of December 31, 2013 , there were 4,134,989 shares outstanding under our ATM. During 2013 , we issued 1,068 shares for net proceeds of $69,000 through the direct stock purchase feature of our DRSPP; however, no discount was offered. During 2012 , we issued 729 shares for net proceeds of $48,000 through our DRSPP, and no discount was offered. During 2011 , we issued 495,645 shares at an average discount of 2% through our DRSPP for net proceeds of $30.0 million . The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2013 for the $3.5 billion of debt outstanding was 3.9% , compared to the weighted average interest rate of 3.8% on $1.7 billion of debt outstanding at December 31, 2012 . We utilize both conventional and tax exempt debt to help finance our activities. Borrowings are made through individual property mortgages, company-wide secured and unsecured credit facilities, and private and public unsecured notes. We utilize fixed rate borrowings, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to manage our current and future interest rate risk. More details on our borrowings can be found in the schedules presented later in this section. At December 31, 2013 , we had secured credit facility relationships with Prudential Mortgage Capital which are credit enhanced by Fannie Mae, Financial Federal which are credit enhanced by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, and a $500 million bank unsecured facility with a syndicate of banks. Together, these credit facilities provided a total line capacity of $1.4 billion with all but $231.5 million collateralized and available to borrow at December 31, 2013 . We had total borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities of $651.8 million at December 31, 2013 . Approximately 13% of our outstanding obligations at December 31, 2013 were borrowed through credit facilities with/or credit enhanced by Fannie Mae, also referred to as the Fannie Mae Facilities. The Fannie Mae Facilities have a combined line limit of $679.5 million , of which $453.5 million was collateralized and available to borrow at December 31, 2013 . We had total borrowings outstanding under the Fannie Mae Facilities of approximately $453.5 million at December 31, 2013 . Various Fannie Mae rate traunches of the Fannie Mae Facilities mature from 2014 through 2018. The Fannie Mae Facilities provide for both fixed and variable rate borrowings. The interest rate on the majority of the variable portion is based on the Fannie Mae Discount Mortgage Backed Security, or DMBS, rate which are credit-enhanced by Fannie Mae and are typically sold every 90 days by Prudential Mortgage Capital at interest rates approximating three-month LIBOR less a spread that has averaged 0.17% over the life of the Fannie Mae Facilities, plus a credit enhancement fee of 0.49% to 0.67% . We have seen more volatility in the spread between the DMBS and three-month LIBOR since late 2007 than was historically prevalent. Approximately 6% of our outstanding obligations at December 31, 2013 were borrowed through a credit facility with or credit enhanced by Freddie Mac, also referred to as the Freddie Mac Facility. The Freddie Mac Facility has a combined line limit of $200.0 million , of which $198.2 million was collateralized and available to borrow at December 31, 2013 . We had total borrowings outstanding under the Freddie Mac Facility of approximately $198.2 million at December 31, 2013 . The Freddie Mac facility matures in 2014. The interest rate on the Freddie Mac Facility renews every 30 or 90 days and is based on the Freddie Mac Reference Bill Rate on the date of renewal, which has historically approximated the equivalent 30 or 90-day LIBOR, plus a credit enhancement fee of 0.65% . The Freddie Mac Reference Bill rate has traded consistently below LIBOR, and the historical average spread was 0.30% below LIBOR at December 31, 2013 . 55 We also maintain a $500.0 million unsecured credit facility with fourteen banks led by KeyBank National Association (Key Bank). The Key Bank credit facility bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 0.90% to 1.70% based on an investment grade pricing grid. This credit facility expires in August 2017 with two separate six-month extension options. At December 31, 2013 , we had $496.3 million available to be borrowed under the Key Bank credit facility agreement with zero borrowings under this facility. Approximately $3.7 million of the facility is used to support letters of credit. Each of our credit facilities is subject to various covenants and conditions on usage, and the secured facilities are subject to periodic re-evaluation of collateral. If we were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing, the available credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In the event of a reduction in real estate values the amount of available credit could be reduced. Moreover, if we were to fail to make a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility, after applicable cure periods, one or more of our lenders could declare a default, accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding and/or foreclose on properties securing such facilities. A default on an obligation to repay outstanding debt could also create a cross default on a separate piece of debt, whereby one or more of our lenders could accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding and/or foreclose on properties securing the related facilities. Any such event could have a material adverse effect. On July 29, 2011, we issued $135 million of Senior Unsecured Notes. The notes were offered in a private placement with three maturity tranches: $50.00 million at 4.7% maturing on July 29, 2018, $72.75 million at 5.4% maturing on July 29, 2021, and $12.25 million at 5.6% maturing on July 29, 2023, all of which is outstanding at December 31, 2013 . On March 1, 2012 , we entered into a $150 million unsecured term loan agreement with a syndicate of banks led by Key Bank and J.P. Morgan at a rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 1.4% to 2.15% based on a leveraged based pricing grid and a maturity date of March 1, 2017 . In July 2012, we received an investment grade rating (Baa2) from Moody's pricing service, which reduced the variable rate to LIBOR plus a spread of 1.10% to 2.05% based on an investment grade ratings grid. On August 31, 2012, we issued $175 million of Senior Unsecured Notes. The notes were offered in a private placement with four tranches: $18 million at 3.15% maturing on November 30, 2017; $20 million at 3.61% maturing on November 30, 2019; $117 million at 4.17% maturing on November 30, 2022; and $20 million at 4.33% maturing on November 30, 2024, all of which is outstanding at December 31, 2013 . On August 7, 2013, our Operating Partnership entered into a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility agreement with KeyBank National Association and thirteen other banks. This agreement amends our Operating Partnership's previous unsecured credit facility with KeyBank. Interest is paid using an investment grade pricing grid using LIBOR plus a spread of 0.90% to 1.70%. As of December 31, 2013 , we had no borrowings under this facility. On October 16, 2013, MAALP issued $350 million in aggregate principal amount of notes, maturing on October 15, 2023 with an interest rate of 4.3% per annum (the "2023 Notes"). The purchase price paid by the initial purchasers was 99.047% of the principal amount. The 2023 Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of MAALP and rank equally in right of payment with all other senior unsecured indebtedness of MAALP. Interest on the 2023 Notes is payable on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on April 15, 2014. The net proceeds from the offering after deducting the original issue discount of approximately $3.3 million and underwriting commissions and expenses of approximately $2.3 million was approximately $344.4 million. The 2023 Notes have been reflected net of discount in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company entered into three forward swaps totaling $150 million , which resulted in a total effective interest rate of 4.15% . On December 13, 2013, MAALP completed a series of exchange offers (the Exchange Offers ) pursuant to which it exchanged $154,235,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.25% Senior Notes due 2014, $169,161,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.50% Senior Notes due 2015 and $68,130,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.05% Senior Notes due 2016 (collectively, the Existing Notes ) issued by Colonial Realty Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership and wholly owned subsidiary of MAALP, for $154,235,000 aggregate principal amount of MAALP new 6.25% Senior Notes due 2014 (the 2014 Notes ), $169,112,000 aggregate principal amount of MAALP new 5.50% Senior Notes due 2015 (the 2015 Notes ) and $68,130,000 aggregate principal amount of MAALP new 6.05% Senior Notes due 2016 (the 2016 Notes and together with the 2014 Notes and the 2015 Notes, the Exchange Notes ), plus approximately $975,000 in cash. The Exchange Notes are senior unsecured obligations of MAALP and will rank equally in right of payment with all of MAALP other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. Interest on the 2014 Notes will accrue from, and including, December 15, 2013 and be payable on June 15, 2014, which will also be the maturity date for the 2014 Notes. Interest on the 2015 Notes will accrue from, and including, October 1, 2013 and be payable semiannually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2014. Interest on the 2016 Notes will accrue from, and including, September 1, 2013 and be payable 56 semiannually on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on March 1, 2014. In certain circumstances described below MAALP may be required to pay additional interest on the Exchange Notes. The Indenture under which the 2023 notes were issued and the Indentures contain certain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of MAALP and its subsidiaries to incur secured and unsecured indebtedness if not in pro forma compliance with the following negative covenants: (1) total leverage not to exceed 60% of adjusted total assets, (2) secured leverage not to exceed 40% of adjusted total assets and (3) a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.50 to 1. In addition, MAALP is required to maintain at all times unencumbered consolidated total assets of not less than 150% of the aggregate principal amount of its outstanding unsecured debt. At December 31, 2013, MAALP was in compliance with each of these financial covenants. All of the Existing Notes tendered into the Exchange Offers were cancelled in connection with the settlement of the Exchange Offers. In connection with the issuance and sale of the Exchange Notes, MAALP also entered into three separate registration rights agreements, each dated as of December 13, 2013, and each with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, the dealer manager in the Exchange Offers (the Registration Rights Agreements ). Under the Registration Rights Agreements, MAALP agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete exchange offers registered under the Securities Act pursuant to which MAALP will offer to issue new exchange notes containing terms substantially similar in all material respects to the Exchange Notes (except that the exchange notes will not contain terms with respect to transfer restrictions or any increase in annual interest rate) in exchange for the Exchange Notes. MAALP also agreed, if it determines that a registered exchange offer is not available or specified other circumstances occur, to use commercially reasonable efforts to file and have become effective a shelf registration statement relating to resales of the Exchange Notes. MAALP will be obligated to pay additional interest of up to 0.50% per annum on the Exchange Notes if it does not complete the exchange offers within 270 days after the issue date of the Exchange Notes and in other specified circumstances. On October 1, 2013, we acquired the Colonial term loan agreements with Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank Association of $250 million and $150 million, respectively. The Wells Fargo term loan bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 1.65% to 2.90% based on the credit ratings of our unsecured debt from time to time and matures on August 1, 2018. The U.S. Bank National Association term loan bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 1.10% to 2.05% based on the credit ratings of our unsecured debt from time to time and matures on May 11, 2017. Including our term loan agreement with Key Bank and J.P. Morgan, we had total borrowings of $550 million outstanding under these term loan agreements at December 31, 2013 . The following schedule details the line limits, collateralized availability and the outstanding balances of our various borrowings as of December 31, 2013 (dollars in thousands): Line Limit Amount Collateralized Amount Borrowed Average Years to Contract Maturity Fannie Mae Credit Facilities $ 679,533 $ 453,533 $ 453,533 5.8 Freddie Mac Credit Facilities 200,000 198,247 198,247 0.5 Other Secured Borrowings 1,139,155 1,139,155 1,139,155 5.8 Unsecured Credit Facility 500,000 496,302 3.6 Other Unsecured Borrowings 1,681,783 1,681,783 1,681,783 3.5 Total Debt $ 4,200,471 $ 3,969,020 $ 3,472,718 4.4 As of December 31, 2013 , we had entered into interest rate swaps totaling a notional amount of $769.0 million . To date, these swaps have proven to be highly effective hedges. We had also entered into interest rate cap agreements totaling a notional amount of approximately $288.5 million as of December 31, 2013 . 57 The following schedule outlines our variable versus fixed rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps and caps, outstanding as of December 31, 2013 (dollars in thousands): Principal Balance Average Years to Rate Maturity Effective Rate SECURED DEBT Conventional - Fixed Rate or Swapped $ 1,380,813 5.0 4.3 % Conventional - Variable Rate - Capped (1) 225,278 2.2 1.1 % Tax-free - Variable Rate - Capped (1) 88,812 2.6 0.9 % Total Fixed or Hedged Rate Maturity $ 1,694,903 4.5 3.7 % Conventional - Variable Rate (2) 96,032 0.2 0.7 % Total Secured Rate Maturity $ 1,790,935 4.3 3.5 % UNSECURED DEBT Fixed Rate or Swapped $ 1,681,783 3.5 4.3 % Total Unsecured Rate Maturity $ 1,681,783 3.5 4.3 % TOTAL DEBT RATE MATURITY $ 3,472,718 3.9 3.9 % TOTAL FIXED OR HEDGED DEBT RATE MATURITY $ 3,376,686 4.0 4.0 % (1) The effective rate represents the average rate on the underlying variable debt unless the cap rates are reached, which average 4.6% of LIBOR for conventional caps and 5.6% of SIFMA for tax-free caps. (2) Includes $27 million of mortgages with an imbedded cap at a 7% all-in interest rate. The following schedule outlines the contractual maturity dates of our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2013 (in thousands): Amount Borrowed Credit Facilities Fannie Mae Secured Freddie Mac Secured Key Bank Unsecured Other Secured Other Unsecured Total 2014 $ 17,936 $ 198,247 $ $ 34,095 $ 196,678 $ 446,956 2015 105,785 73,724 194,656 374,165 2016 80,000 30,123 81,348 191,471 2017 80,000 59,444 318,408 457,852 2018 80,000 53,234 301,958 435,192 Thereafter 89,812 888,535 588,735 1,567,082 Total $ 453,533 $ 198,247 $ $ 1,139,155 $ 1,681,783 $ 3,472,718 58 The following schedule outlines the interest rate maturities of our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2013 (dollars in thousands): Fixed Rate Debt Interest Rate Swaps Total Fixed Rate Balances Contract Rate Interest Rate Caps Total Fixed or Hedged 2014 $ 226,310 $ 144,000 $ 370,310 5.9 % $ 59,455 $ 429,765 2015 246,563 75,000 321,563 5.5 % 52,142 373,705 2016 90,169 90,169 6.0 % 104,480 194,649 2017 127,444 300,000 427,444 2.1 % 65,204 492,648 2018 103,235 250,000 353,235 3.2 % 32,809 386,044 Thereafter 1,499,875 1,499,875 4.0 % 1,499,875 Total $ 2,293,596 $ 769,000 $ 3,062,596 4.1 % $ 314,090 $ 3,376,686 We believe that we have adequate resources to fund our current operations, annual refurbishment of our properties, and incremental investment in new apartment properties. We rely on the efficient operation of the financial markets to refinance debt maturities, and on rate renewals for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, or the Agencies. The Agencies provided credit enhancement for approximately $651.8 million of our outstanding debt through credit facilities as of December 31, 2013 . The interest rate markets for Fannie Mae DMBS and Freddie Mac Reference Bills, which in our experience are highly liquid and highly correlated with three-month LIBOR interest rates, are also an important component of our liquidity and interest rate swap effectiveness. Prudential Mortgage Capital, a Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) lender for Fannie Mae, markets 90-day Fannie Mae Discount Mortgage Backed Securities monthly, and is obligated to advance funds to us at DMBS rates plus a credit spread under the terms of the credit agreements between Prudential and us. Financial Federal, a Freddie Mac Program Plus Lender and Servicer, is obligated to advance funds under the terms of credit agreements between Financial Federal and us. For the year ended December 31, 2013 , our net cash provided by operating activities was in excess of covering funding of normal capital improvements to existing real estate assets, distributions to unitholders, and dividends paid on common and preferred shares by approximately $63.9 million , as compared to $51.0 million and $28.1 million for the same periods in 2012 and 2011 , respectively. While we had sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings, if necessary, any significant deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate, in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate. The following table reflects our total contractual cash obligations which consist of our long-term debt, development fees and operating leases as of December 31, 2013 (dollars in thousands): Contractual Obligations (1) 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Thereafter Total Long-Term Debt Obligations (2) $ 457,282 $ 397,055 $ 186,759 $ 465,903 $ 390,630 $ 1,575,089 $ 3,472,718 Fixed Rate or Swapped Interest (3) 93,508 80,685 66,775 55,479 47,809 136,096 480,352 Purchase Obligations (4) 2,077 2,077 Operating Lease Obligations 253 250 249 244 174 1,170 Total $ 553,120 $ 477,990 $ 253,783 $ 521,626 $ 438,613 $ 1,711,185 $ 3,956,317 (1) Fixed rate and swapped interest are shown in this table. The average interest rates of variable rate debt are shown in preceding tables. (2) Represents principal payments. (3) Swapped interest is subject to the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges as described in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8. (4) Represents development fees. 59 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2013 , and 2012 , we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Mid-America Multifamily Fund I, LLC, was established to acquire $500 million of apartment communities with redevelopment upside offering value creation opportunity through capital improvements, operating enhancements and restructuring in-place financing. As of December 31, 2013 , Mid-America Multifamily Fund I, LLC was legally dissolved and owned zero properties. Mid-America Multifamily Fund II, LLC, was established to acquire $250 million of apartment communities with redevelopment upside offering value creation opportunity through capital improvements, operating enhancements and restructuring in-place financing. As of December 31, 2013 , Mid-America Multifamily Fund II, LLC owned four properties. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. We do not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with us or our related parties other than those disclosed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 17. Our investments in our real estate joint ventures are unconsolidated and are recorded using the equity method for the joint ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest. Insurance We renegotiated our insurance programs effective July 1, 2013 . We believe that the property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that any insurable loss experienced that can be reasonably anticipated would not have a significant impact on our liquidity, financial position or results of operation. Inflation Our resident leases at the apartment communities allow, at the time of renewal, for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder, and thus may enable us to seek rent increases. Almost all leases are for one year or less. The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation. Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards In February 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income . Under ASU 2013-02, an entity is required to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) by component. In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of AOCI by the respective line items of net income, but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety in the same reporting period. For amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts. ASU 2013-02 does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements. ASU 2013-02 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2012 and early adoption is permitted. We early adopted ASU 2013-02 for the annual period ended December 31, 2012. The adoption of ASU 2013-02 has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. In January 2013, the FASB issued ASU, No. 2013-01, Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities . ASU 2013-01 clarifies that the scope of ASU 2011-11, Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities , would apply to derivatives accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , including bifurcated embedded derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset in accordance with ASC 210-20-45 or ASC 815-10-45 or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2013 and interim periods within those annual periods. We adopted ASU 2013-01 during the period ended March 31, 2013. The adoption of ASU 2013-01 has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income. This ASU allows an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two 60 separate but consecutive statements. In both choices, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income. ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity. The amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. ASU 2011-05 is applied retrospectively. The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011, but allows for early adoption. We adopted ASU 2011-05 for the Annual Report for fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, and this changed the presentation of our financial statements but not our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. In November 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05 . This ASU supersedes certain paragraphs in ASU 2011-05 addressing reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The effective dates and expected changes to our presentation are the same as noted in ASU 2011-05 above. In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS. The amendments change the wording, mainly for clarification, used to describe many of the requirements in GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements. For many of the requirements, the Board does not intend for the amendments in this update to result in a change in the application of the requirements in Topic 820. The amendments in this ASU are to be applied prospectively. The amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We adopted ASU 2011-04 in the interim and annual periods of fiscal year 2012. The adoption of ASU 2011-04 has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.
