ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS On December 11, 2015, The Dow Chemical Company ("Historical Dow") and E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company ("Historical DuPont") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger ("Merger Agreement"), as amended on March 31, 2017, to effect an all-stock merger of equals strategic combination resulting in a newly formed corporation named DowDuPont Inc. ("DowDuPont" or the "Company"). On August 31, 2017, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Historical Dow and Historical DuPont each merged with wholly owned subsidiaries of DowDuPont ("Mergers") and, as a result of the Mergers, Historical Dow and Historical DuPont became subsidiaries of DowDuPont (collectively, the "Merger"). Prior to the Merger, DowDuPont did not conduct any business activities other than those required for its formation and matters contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Historical Dow was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the Merger. As a result, the financial statements of Historical Dow for the periods prior to the Merger are considered to be the historical financial statements of DowDuPont. The results of Historical DuPont are included in DowDuPont's consolidated results from the Merger date forward. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. DowDuPont intends to pursue, subject to the receipt of approval by the Board of Directors ("Board") of DowDuPont and customary closing conditions, the separation of the combined Company's agriculture, materials science and specialty products businesses through one or more tax-efficient transactions ("Intended Business Separations"). Except as otherwise indicated by the context, the term "Historical Dow" includes Historical Dow and its consolidated subsidiaries, "Historical DuPont" includes Historical DuPont and its consolidated subsidiaries, "Union Carbide" means Union Carbide Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Historical Dow, and "Dow Silicones" means Dow Silicones Corporation (formerly known as Dow Corning Corporation, which changed its name effective as of February 1, 2018), a wholly owned subsidiary of Historical Dow. Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results Due to the size of each of Historical Dow's and Historical DuPont's businesses prior to the Merger, in this section certain supplemental unaudited pro forma financial information is provided that assumes the Merger had been consummated on January 1, 2016. Adjustments have been made in the unaudited pro forma financial information for (1) the purchase accounting impact, (2) accounting policy alignment, (3) the elimination of the effect of events that were directly attributable to the Merger Agreement (e.g., one-time transaction costs), (4) the elimination of the impact of transactions between Historical Dow and Historical DuPont, and (5) the elimination of the effect of consummated divestitures required as a condition of regulatory approval for the Merger. Events that are not expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results (e.g., inventory step-up costs) were excluded. These adjustments impacted the consolidated results as well as the reportable segments. For additional information, see the Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information in this section. 38 Table of Contents Table of Contents Page About DowDuPont Inc. 39 Overview 39 Results of Operations 41 Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information 49 Segment Results 53 Agriculture 54 Performance Materials & Coatings 55 Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure 56 Packaging & Specialty Plastics 58 Electronics & Imaging 59 Nutrition & Biosciences 61 Transportation & Advanced Polymers 62 Safety & Construction 64 Corporate 65 Liquidity and Capital Resources 67 Outlook 75 Other Matters 76 Critical Accounting Estimates 76 Environmental Matters 80 Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation 84 ABOUT DOWDUPONT INC. DowDuPont is a holding company comprised of Historical Dow and Historical DuPont with the intent to form strong, independent, publicly traded companies in the agriculture, materials science and specialty products sectors that will lead their respective industries through productive, science-based innovation to meet the needs of customers and help solve global challenges. In 2018 , 37 percent of the Company net sales were to customers in U.S. & Canada; 28 percent were in Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"); 24 percent were in Asia Pacific; and 11 percent were in Latin America. In 2018 , the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries did not operate in countries subject to U.S. economic sanctions and export controls as imposed by the U.S. State Department or in countries designated by the U.S. State Department as state sponsors of terrorism, including Iran, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), Sudan and Syria. The Company has policies and procedures in place designed to ensure that it and its consolidated subsidiaries remain in compliance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations. OVERVIEW The following is a summary of the results from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 : The Company reported net sales for 2018 of $86.0 billion, up 38 percent from $62.5 billion in 2017 , with broad-based sales growth across all segments and geographic regions. Portfolio & Other contributed 29 percent of the sales increase, primarily reflecting the Merger as a full year of net sales in 2018 related to Historical DuPont compared with four months in 2017, which impacted all segments except Performance Materials & Coatings and Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure. Volume increased 4 percent compared with the same period last year, with increases in all segments, except Performance Materials & Coatings and Transportation & Advanced Polymers (both down 2 percent) and Nutrition & Biosciences (flat). Volume increased in all geographic regions, except U.S. & Canada (flat), led by a double-digit increase in Asia Pacific (up 13 percent). Local price was up 4 percent compared with last year, primarily in response to higher feedstock and raw material costs. Local price increased in all segments, except Electronics & Imaging (flat). Local price increased in all geographic regions. 39 Table of Contents Currency had a favorable impact of 1 percent on sales, driven by a favorable impact in EMEA, partially offset by an unfavorable impact in Latin America. Research and development ("R&D") expenses totaled $3,060 million in 2018 , up 43 percent from $2,141 million in 2017 . Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were $6,709 million in 2018 , up 65 percent from $4,064 million in 2017 .

See Notes 6 , 13 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In addition, based on updated projections for the Company equity method investments in joint ventures in China related to the Agriculture segment, management determined the fair values of the equity method investments were below the carrying values and had no expectation that the fair values would recover due to the continuing unfavorable regulatory environment, including lack of intellectual property protection, uncertain product registration timing and limited freedom to operate. As a result, 45 Table of Contents management concluded the impairment was other than temporary and in the third quarter of 2018 recorded an impairment charge of $41 million in Restructuring, goodwill impairment and asset related charges - net in the consolidated statements of income. See Notes 6 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In 2018, the Company recognized an additional pretax impairment charge of $34 million primarily related to capital additions made to the biopolymers manufacturing facility in Santa Vitoria, Minas Gerais, Brazil, which was impaired in 2017. The impairment charge was related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics. 2017 Charges In 2017, the Company recognized a $622 million pretax impairment charge related to a biopolymers manufacturing facility in Santa Vitoria, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Historical Dow determined it would not pursue an expansion of the facility ethanol mill into downstream derivative products, primarily as a result of cheaper ethane-based production as well as Historical Dow new assets coming online on the U.S. Gulf Coast which can be used to meet growing market demands in Brazil. As a result of this decision, cash flow analysis indicated the carrying amount of the impacted assets was not recoverable. The impairment charge was related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics. The Company also recognized other pretax impairment charges of $317 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, including charges related to manufacturing assets of $230 million , an equity method investment of $81 million and other assets of $6 million . The impairment charges were related to Performance Materials & Coatings ( $82 million ), Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure ( $6 million ), Packaging & Specialty Plastics ( $57 million ), Electronics & Imaging ( $39 million ), Safety & Construction ( $32 million ) and Corporate ( $101 million ). See Notes 6 , 22 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 2016 Charges In 2016, Historical Dow recognized a $143 million pretax impairment charge related to its equity interest in AgroFresh Solutions, Inc. ("AFSI") due to a decline in the market value of AFSI. The impairment charge impacted Corporate. See Notes 6 , 12 , 22 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Integration and Separation Costs Integration and separation costs, which reflect costs related to the Merger, post-Merger integration and Intended Business Separation activities and costs related to the ownership restructure of Dow Silicones, were $2,463 million in 2018 , $1,101 million in 2017 and $349 million in 2016 , and were related to Corporate. Asbestos-Related Charge In 2016, Historical Dow and Union Carbide Corporation elected to change the method of accounting for asbestos-related defense and processing costs from expensing as incurred to estimating and accruing a liability. As a result of this accounting policy change, Union Carbide recorded a pretax charge of $1,009 million for asbestos-related defense costs through the terminal year of 2049. Union Carbide also recorded a pretax charge of $104 million to increase the asbestos-related liability for pending and future claims through the terminal year of 2049. There was no adjustment to the asbestos-related liability for pending and future claims and defense and processing costs in 2017 or 2018. These charges were related to Corporate. See Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on asbestos-related matters. Equity in Earnings of Nonconsolidated Affiliates DowDuPont share of the earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates in 2018 was $1,001 million , compared with $764 million in 2017 and $442 million in 2016 . In 2018, equity earnings increased as higher earnings from the Kuwait joint ventures, lower equity losses from Sadara and higher earnings from the HSC Group, which included settlements with a customer related to long-term polysilicon sales agreements, were partially offset by lower equity earnings from the Thai joint ventures. In 2017, equity earnings increased as lower equity losses from Sadara and higher equity earnings from the Kuwait joint ventures and the HSC Group, which included settlements with a customer related to long-term polysilicon sales agreements, were partially offset by the impact of the Dow Silicones ownership restructure and lower equity earnings from the Thai joint ventures. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on nonconsolidated affiliates. Sundry Income (Expense) - Net Sundry income (expense) net includes a variety of income and expense items such as the gain or loss on foreign currency exchange, interest income, dividends from investments, gains and losses on sales of investments and assets, non-operating pension and other postretirement benefit plan credits or costs, and certain litigation matters. Sundry income (expense) - net for 2018 was income of $592 million , compared with income of $417 million in 2017 and income of $1,486 million in 2016 . 46 Table of Contents In 2018, sundry income (expense) - net included credits related to non-operating pension and other postretirement benefit plans, interest income and gains on the sales of investments and other assets, including a $20 million gain for post-closing adjustments on Historical Dow sale of its equity interest in MEGlobal (related to Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure) and a $22 million gain related to Agriculture asset sales. These gains were partially offset by a $135 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt (related to Corporate), foreign currency exchange losses, including a $50 million foreign exchange loss related to adjustments to foreign currency exchange contracts for the change in the U.S. tax rate (related to Corporate), a $47 million loss for adjustments related to the Dow Silicones ownership restructure ($27 million related Electronics & Imaging and $20 million related to Performance Materials & Coatings), and a $14 million loss on the divestiture of the European XPS STYROFOAM business (related to Safety & Construction). See Notes 3, 5, 7, and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In 2017, sundry income (expense) - net included a $635 million gain on the divestiture of the DAS Divested Ag Business (related to Agriculture), a $227 million gain on the divestiture of Historical Dow's EAA Business (related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics), a $137 million gain related to Historical Dow's patent infringement matter with Nova Chemical Corporation (related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics), a $7 million gain for post-closing adjustments on the split-off of Historical Dow's chlorine value chain (related to Corporate), gains on sales of other assets and investments and interest income. These gains more than offset non-operating pension and other postretirement benefit costs, primarily related to a settlement charge for a U.S. non-qualified pension plan of $697 million (related to Corporate), a $469 million loss related to Dow AgroSciences' arbitration matter with Bayer CropScience (related to Agriculture) and foreign currency exchange losses. See Notes 1 , 2 , 5 , 7 , 16 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In 2016, sundry income (expense) - net included a $2,445 million gain on the Dow Silicones ownership restructure (related to Performance Materials & Coatings ($1,617 million), Electronics & Imaging ($512 million) and Transportation & Advanced Polymers ($316 million)), a $6 million gain for post-closing adjustments on the split-off of Historical Dow's chlorine value chain (related to Corporate), gains on sales of assets and investments, non-operating pension and other postretirement benefit credits and interest income. These gains more than offset a $1,235 million loss related to Historical Dow's settlement of the urethane matters class action lawsuit and the opt-out cases litigation (related to Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure), $41 million of transaction costs and productivity actions (related to Corporate), losses on divestitures and foreign currency exchange losses. See Notes 3 , 5 , 7 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Interest Expense and Amortization of Debt Discount Interest expense and amortization of debt discount was $1,504 million in 2018 , $1,082 million in 2017 and $858 million in 2016 . The increase in 2018 was primarily related to the Merger as well as higher debt balances as a result of the DowDuPont Notes Offering. The increase in 2017 was primarily related to the Merger and the effect of the long-term debt assumed in the Dow Silicones ownership restructure. See Liquidity and Capital Resources in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 11 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to debt financing activity. Provision (Credit) for Income Taxes on Continuing Operations The Company's effective tax rate fluctuates based on, among other factors, where income is earned, reinvestment assertions regarding foreign income and the level of income relative to tax credits available. The Company's tax rate is also influenced by the level of equity earnings, since most of the earnings from the Company's equity method investments are taxed at the joint venture level. The underlying factors affecting the Company's overall tax rate are summarized in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("The Act") was enacted. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred, creates new provisions related to foreign sourced earnings, eliminates the domestic manufacturing deduction and moves towards a hybrid territorial system. At December 31, 2018, the Company had completed its accounting for the tax effects of The Act; see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The "Provision (Credit) for income taxes on continuing operations" was a charge of $1,489 million in 2018 , a benefit of $476 million in 2017 and a charge of $9 million in 2016 . The tax rate for 2018 was favorably impacted by equity earnings as well as excess tax benefits related to equity compensation. These impacts were more than offset by the impact of geographic mix of earnings, amortization of the fair value step-up of Historical DuPont inventories as a result of the Merger, a $75 million tax charge associated with a valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax asset position of a Historical DuPont legal entity in Brazil and costs associated with the Merger (including a $74 million net tax charge on repatriation activities to facilitate the Intended Business Separations). These factors resulted in a tax rate of 27.1 percent for 2018 . 47 Table of Contents The tax rate for 2017 was favorably impacted by a provisional net benefit of $1,086 million that the Company recognized due to the enactment of The Act, as well as the geographic mix of earnings. In addition, the tax rate was favorably impacted by the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting," which resulted in the recognition of excess tax benefits related to equity compensation in the provision for income taxes. These impacts were partially offset by a goodwill impairment recognized in the fourth quarter for which there was no corresponding tax deduction, amortization of the fair value step-up of Historical DuPont inventories as a result of the Merger and certain net foreign currency exchange losses recognized on the remeasurement of the net monetary asset positions which were not tax deductible in their local jurisdictions. These factors resulted in a negative tax rate of 39.9 percent for 2017 . The tax rate for Historical Dow in 2016 was favorably impacted by the non-taxable gain on the ownership restructure of Dow Silicones and a tax benefit on the reassessment of a deferred tax liability related to the basis difference in Historical Dow investment in Dow Silicones. The tax rate was also favorably impacted by the geographic mix of earnings, the availability of foreign tax credits, the deductibility of the urethane matters class action lawsuit and opt-out cases settlements and the asbestos-related charge. A reduction in equity earnings and non-deductible transaction costs and productivity actions unfavorably impacted the tax rate. These factors resulted in an effective tax rate of 0.2 percent for 2016 . Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax was $5 million in 2018 and $77 million in 2017, and is related to certain Historical DuPont assets divested as a condition of the regulatory approval of the Merger. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $155 million in 2018 , $132 million in 2017 and $86 million in 2016 . Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily due to the Merger and the sale of Historical Dow's ownership interests in the SKC Haas Display Films group of companies in 2017. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to higher earnings from Dow Silicones' consolidated joint ventures and improved results from a cogeneration facility in Brazil. See Notes 18 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Historical Dow Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock Dividends On December 30, 2016, Historical Dow converted all outstanding shares of its Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A ("Historical Dow Preferred Stock") into shares of Historical Dow's common stock. As a result of this conversion, no shares of Historical Dow Preferred Stock are issued or outstanding. On January 6, 2017, Historical Dow filed an amendment to its Restated Certificate of Incorporation by way of a certificate of elimination with the Secretary of State of Delaware eliminating this series of preferred stock. Historical Dow Preferred Stock dividends of $340 million were recognized in 2016. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Net Income Available for DowDuPont Inc. Common Stockholders Net income available for common stockholders was $3,844 million ( $1.65 per share) in 2018 , compared with $1,460 million ( $0.91 per share) in 2017 and $3,978 million ( $3.52 per share) in 2016 . See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the Company's earnings per share calculations. 48 Table of Contents SUPPLEMENTAL UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION The following supplemental unaudited pro forma combined statements of income (the "unaudited pro forma income statements") for DowDuPont are presented to illustrate the estimated effects of the Merger, assuming that the Merger had been consummated on January 1, 2016. For the periods presented below, activity prior to August 31, 2017 (the Merger Date ) was prepared on a pro forma basis (the unaudited pro forma information ) and activity after the Merger Date was prepared on a combined basis under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). The unaudited pro forma information below was prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X which is a different basis than the unaudited pro forma information presented in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which was prepared in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 805, "Business Combinations" ("ASC 805"). Pro forma adjustments have been made for (1) the purchase accounting impact, (2) accounting policy alignment, (3) the elimination of the effect of events that are directly attributable to the Merger Agreement (e.g., one-time transaction costs), (4) the elimination of the impact of transactions between Historical Dow and Historical DuPont, and (5) the elimination of the effect of consummated divestitures required as a condition of approval for the Merger. Events that are not expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results (e.g., inventory step up costs) are excluded from the unaudited pro forma information. The unaudited pro forma information does not reflect restructuring or integration activities or other costs following the Merger that may be incurred to achieve cost or growth synergies of DowDuPont. The unaudited pro forma income statements provide stockholders with summary financial information and historical data that is on a basis consistent with how DowDuPont reports current financial information. The Merger was accounted for under ASC 805, under which Historical Dow was designated as the accounting acquirer in the Merger for accounting purposes. Under ASC 805, Historical Dow accounted for the transaction by using Historical Dow financial information and accounting policies and adding the assets and liabilities of Historical DuPont as of the Merger Date at their respective fair values. The assets and liabilities of Historical DuPont were measured based on various estimates at the Merger Date using assumptions that DowDuPont believes are reasonable based on information that was available. The fair value estimates reflected in the unaudited pro forma information are based on those used in the Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed with the SEC on October 26, 2017, and subsequent measurement period adjustments are not reflected. The unaudited pro forma income statements have been presented for informational purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what DowDuPont results of operations actually would have been had the Merger been completed on January 1, 2016. In addition, the unaudited pro forma income statements do not purport to project the future operating results of the Company. The unaudited pro forma income statements were based on and should be read in conjunction with the separate historical financial statements and accompanying notes contained in each of the Historical Dow and Historical DuPont Quarterly Reports on Form 10-K for the applicable periods. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 49 Table of Contents Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statement of Income Year Ended Dec 31, 2017 Adjustments In millions, except per share amounts DWDP 1, 2 Historical DuPont 2, 3 Reclass 2, 4 Divestitures 5 Pro Forma 6 Pro Forma Net sales $ 62,484 $ 18,349 $ 84 $ (1,219 ) $ (163 ) $ 79,535 Cost of sales 49,791 10,464 387 (523 ) 65 60,184 Other operating charges 521 (521 ) Research and development expenses 2,141 1,117 (27 ) (104 ) 19 3,146 Selling, general and administrative expenses 4,064 3,368 (583 ) (143 ) 29 6,735 Other (loss) income, net (106 ) 106 Amortization of intangibles 1,013 139 591 1,743 Restructuring, goodwill impairment and asset related charges - net 3,280 323 (10 ) 3,593 Integration and separation costs 1,101 605 (24 ) (183 ) 1,499 Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates 764 55 (15 ) 804 Sundry income (expense) - net 417 (278 ) (12 ) 127 Interest expense and amortization of debt discount 1,082 254 (80 ) 1,256 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 1,193 2,196 (33 ) (437 ) (609 ) 2,310 Provision (Credit) for income taxes on continuing operations (476 ) 228 (33 ) (88 ) (233 ) (602 ) Income from continuing operations, net of tax 1,669 1,968 (349 ) (376 ) 2,912 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 132 20 7 159 Net income from continuing operations attributable to DowDuPont Inc. 1,537 1,948 (349 ) (383 ) 2,753 Preferred stock dividends 7 (7 ) Net income from continuing operations available for DowDuPont Inc. common stockholders $ 1,537 $ 1,941 $ $ (349 ) $ (376 ) $ 2,753 Per common share data: Earnings per common share from continuing operations - basic $ 1.18 Earnings per common share from continuing operations - diluted $ 1.17 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic 2,323.9 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 2,346.1 1.

Reclassify historical dividends for Historical DuPont preferred stock from "Preferred stock dividends" to "Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests." 52 Table of Contents SEGMENT RESULTS Effective August 31, 2017, Historical Dow and Historical DuPont completed the previously announced merger of equals transaction pursuant to the Merger Agreement, resulting in a newly formed corporation named DowDuPont. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Merger. As a result of the Merger, new operating segments were created which are used by management to allocate Company resources and assess performance. The new segments are aligned with the market verticals they serve, while maintaining integration and innovation strengths within strategic value chains. DowDuPont is comprised of nine operating segments, which are aggregated into eight reportable segments: Agriculture; Performance Materials & Coatings; Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure; Packaging & Specialty Plastics; Electronics & Imaging; Nutrition & Biosciences; Transportation & Advanced Polymers and Safety & Construction. Corporate contains the reconciliation between the totals for the reportable segments and the Company totals. The Company Nutrition & Biosciences reportable segment consists of two operating segments, Nutrition & Health and Industrial Biosciences, which individually did not meet the quantitative thresholds. Beginning in the third quarter of 2018, DowDuPont realigned the following joint ventures, global businesses and product lines in preparation for the Intended Business Separations: Realignment of the HSC Group joint ventures (DC HSC Holdings LLC and Hemlock Semiconductor L.L.C.) from the Consumer Solutions global business in the Performance Materials & Coatings reportable segment to the Electronics & Imaging reportable segment. Realignment of certain cellulosics product lines from the Nutrition & Health operating segment in the Nutrition & Biosciences reportable segment to the Consumer Solutions global business in the Performance Materials & Coatings reportable segment. Certain roofing products were realigned from the Building Solutions product line in the Safety & Construction reportable segment to Corporate. Realignment of the previously divested Epoxy and Chlorinated Organics global businesses from the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure reportable segment to Corporate. In addition, the following realignments within the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure reportable segment were made, which had no effect on the segment results: The Construction Chemicals global business was combined with the Polyurethanes & CAV global business. Certain product lines associated with the oil and gas industry were realigned from the Industrial Solutions global business to the Polyurethanes & CAV global business. DowDuPont reported geographic information for the following regions: U.S. & Canada, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and EMEA. As a result of the Merger, Historical Dow changed the geographic alignment for the country of India to be reflected in Asia Pacific (previously reported in EMEA) and aligned Puerto Rico to U.S. & Canada (previously reported in Latin America). The segment and geographic region reporting changes have been retrospectively reflected in the following discussion of segment results for all periods presented. The Company measure of profit/loss for segment reporting purposes is Operating EBITDA (for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018) and pro forma Operating EBITDA (for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016) as this is the manner in which the Company chief operating decision maker ( CODM ) assesses performance and allocates resources. The Company defines Operating EBITDA as earnings (i.e., "Income from continuing operations before income taxes ) before interest, depreciation, amortization and foreign exchange gains (losses), excluding the impact of significant items. Pro forma Operating EBITDA is defined as pro forma earnings (i.e. pro forma "Income from continuing operations before income taxes") before interest, depreciation, amortization and foreign exchange gains (losses), excluding the impact of adjusted significant items. Reconciliations of these measures can be found in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company also presents pro forma net sales for 2017 and 2016 as it is included in management measure of segment performance and is regularly reviewed by the CODM. Pro forma adjustments used in the calculation of pro forma net sales and pro forma Operating EBITDA were determined in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X and were based on the historical consolidated financial statements of Historical Dow and Historical DuPont, adjusted to give effect to the Merger as if it had been consummated on January 1, 2016. For additional information on the pro forma adjustments made, see Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information in the preceding section. 53 Table of Contents AGRICULTURE The Agriculture segment leverages the Company technology, customer relationships and industry knowledge to improve the quantity, quality and safety of the global food supply and the global production agriculture industry. Land available for worldwide agricultural production is increasingly limited so production growth will need to be achieved principally through improving crop yields and productivity. The segment two global businesses, Seed and Crop Protection, deliver a broad portfolio of products and services that are specifically targeted to achieve gains in crop yields and productivity, including well-established brands of seed products, crop chemicals, seed treatments, agronomy and digital services.

Agriculture Percentage change from prior year 2018 2017 2016 Change in Net Sales from Prior Period due to: Local price & product mix 3 % (1 )% 1 % Currency (2 ) (1 ) Volume 1 (2 ) (2 ) Portfolio & other 88 25 Total 90 % 22 % (2 )% Change in Pro Forma Net Sales from Prior Period due to: 1 Local price & product mix 3 % Currency Volume (2 ) 1 Portfolio & other (1 ) 1 Total % 2 % 1. As reported net sales in 2018 compared with pro forma net sales in 2017. Pro forma net sales in 2017 compared with pro forma net sales in 2016. 2018 Versus 2017 Agriculture net sales were $14,301 million in 2018, up from $7,516 million in 2017. Net sales in 2018 were down slightly from pro forma net sales of $14,342 million in 2017, as a 3 percent increase in price was offset by a 2 decrease in volume and a 1 percent decline due to portfolio. Currency was flat year over year. The increase in local price was driven by a favorable mix in U.S. & Canada as well as increases in Crop Protection pricing in Latin America to offset currency pressure. Volume gains in Crop Protection due to new product launches, including VESSARYA TM in Latin America, ENLIST TM products in U.S. & Canada and Latin America, and PYRAXALT TM in Asia Pacific, were offset by lower planted area in U.S. & Canada and Latin America and lower demand for nitrogen stabilizers in U.S. & Canada. The portfolio loss reflected the inclusion of three months of the DAS Divested Ag Business in 2017 results. Operating EBITDA was $2,705 million in 2018, up 4 percent from pro forma Operating EBITDA of $2,611 million in 2017. Cost synergies, new product sales in Crop Protection, lower pension/OPEB costs and lower variable compensation were partially offset by higher raw material costs and royalty expense, investments to support new product launches and seed sales declines. 2017 Versus 2016 Agriculture net sales were $7,516 million in 2017, up from $6,173 million in 2016. Pro forma net sales were $14,342 million in 2017, up from $14,060 million in 2016. Pro forma net sales growth of 2 percent was led by volume gains of 1 percent and a 1 percent benefit from portfolio actions. Seed net sales grew 5 percent, driven by volume and price improvement, and Crop Protection net sales decreased 1 percent as increases in volume were more than offset by lower local price. Seed and Crop Protection volume growth was driven by an increase in sunflower and corn seed sales in Europe, increased soybean sales in U.S. & Canada, 54 Table of Contents continued penetration of new crop protection products VESSARYA and ZORVEC TM fungicides and continued demand for ARYLEX TM herbicide, ISOCLAST insecticide, and novel seed treatment solutions. These volume increases were partially offset by higher Crop Protection inventory levels in China and a reduction in global corn planted area. Increases in local prices for Seeds, driven by continued penetration of LEPTRA corn hybrids, were offset by a decrease in local prices for Crop Protection, driven by competitive pressures in Latin America. The benefit from portfolio actions for 2017 as compared with 2016, is due to the DAS Divested Ag Business, which is excluded from pro forma results for periods prior to the Merger, but included in reported results after the Merger and through the close of the sale of this business on November 30, 2017. Pro forma Operating EBITDA was $2,611 million in 2017, up 12 percent from $2,322 million in 2016. Pro forma Operating EBITDA increased on improved volume, cost savings, lower pension/OPEB costs, currency and portfolio benefits. Increases were partially offset by lower local price due to competitive crop protection pricing pressure and higher product costs, including higher soybean royalties. Agriculture Outlook for 2019 Agriculture's full year 2019 net sales are expected to benefit from new product launches and pricing actions, largely offset by the unfavorable impact of currency. The segment is expected to see benefits from cost synergies, partially offset by higher unit costs and an unfavorable impact from currency.

Pro forma net sales increased 4 percent, driven by volume growth of 3 percent and a favorable impact of 1 percent from portfolio actions. Volume growth was led by Industrial Biosciences, driven by strong demand for microbial control solutions in energy markets, continued growth in biomaterials in apparel and carpet markets and growth in bioactives, primarily in the grain processing market. Volume in Nutrition & Health was flat as growth in probiotics and pharmaceuticals was offset by declines in protein solutions and systems and texturants due to weakness in packaged food markets and specific actions taken to exit low-margin market segments. The favorable impact from portfolio actions was driven by the acquisition of the FMC H&N Business. Pro forma Operating EBITDA was $1,296 million in 2017, up 6 percent from $1,227 million in 2016. The increase in pro forma Operating EBITDA was driven by cost savings, volume growth, lower pension/OPEB costs and favorable impacts of portfolio actions. Increases in pro forma Operating EBITDA were partially offset by the absence of a $27 million gain from a prior-year asset sale. Nutrition & Biosciences Outlook for 2019 Nutrition & Biosciences 2019 sales are expected to benefit from higher volume and prices partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts. Demand for probiotics, sweeteners, and specialty proteins is expected to increase in Nutrition & Health along with increased demand for bioactives and biomaterials in Industrial Biosciences. The segment is expected to benefit from the favorable impact of cost synergies and volume growth, partially offset by growth investments.

Net sales in 2018 were up 10 percent from pro forma net sales of $5,131 million in 2017 due to a 6 percent increase in local price, 2 percent volume growth and a 2 percent benefit from currency, driven by EMEA. The increase in local price, primarily in engineering polymers, was driven by tight polymer supply and higher feedstock costs. Volume growth in the segment was primarily due to performance solutions, led by growth in KALREZ and VESPEL high-performance parts in the electronics and aerospace markets, performance resins, due to growth in DELRIN and HYTREL in the automotive market, and in engineering polymers due to growth in ZYTEL . Broad based volume growth was led by U.S & Canada and Asia Pacific. Operating EBITDA was $1,702 million in 2018, up 29 percent from pro forma Operating EBITDA of $1,319 million in 2017 due to price and volume gains, lower pension/OPEB costs, cost synergies and favorable currency, partially offset by higher raw material costs. 2017 Versus 2016 Transportation & Advanced Polymers net sales were $2,521 million in 2017, up from $897 million in 2016. Pro forma net sales were $5,131 million in 2017, up from $4,497 million in 2016. Pro forma net sales growth of 14 percent, with gains across all geographies, was led by increased volume of 7 percent, a favorable impact from portfolio actions of 5 percent and a 2 percent increase in local price. Broad based volume growth was driven by increased demand for polymers in automotive, electronics and industrial markets, leading to growth from KALREZ and VESPEL high-performance parts. Volume growth was led by Asia Pacific followed by EMEA, U.S. & Canada and Latin America. The increase in local price was driven by price gains in polymers in automotive markets. The favorable impact from portfolio actions related to the addition of Dow Silicones in June 2016. Pro forma Operating EBITDA was $1,319 million in 2017, up 26 percent from $1,043 million in 2016. The increase in Operating EBITDA was driven by increased volume growth, the favorable impact of earnings from Dow Silicones, higher local selling prices, cost savings and lower pension/OPEB costs, partially offset by higher raw material costs. Transportation & Advanced Polymers Outlook for 2019 Transportation & Advanced Polymers' 2019 sales are expected to remain essentially flat as local pricing gains are expected to be offset by the unfavorable impact of currency and portfolio actions. The segment is expected to be favorably impacted by cost synergies and increases in local price, offset by an unfavorable impact from currency. 63 Table of Contents SAFETY & CONSTRUCTION The Safety & Construction segment is a leading provider of engineered products and integrated systems for a number of industries including construction, worker safety, energy, oil and gas, transportation, medical devices and water purification and separation.

Net sales in 2018 compared with pro forma net sales in 2017. Pro forma net sales in 2017 compared with pro forma net sales in 2016. 2018 Versus 2017 Safety & Construction net sales were $5,453 million in 2018, up from $3,006 million in 2017. Net sales in 2018 were up 6 percent from pro forma net sales of $5,142 million in 2017 due to 4 percent volume growth, a 1 percent benefit from currency and a 1 percent increase in local price. Volume growth in the segment was driven by broad based demand in industrial applications, with strength across all lines of business, particularly in NOMEX and KEVLAR , as well as gains in TYVEK enterprise and water solutions. The increase in local price was due to price gains across most businesses. Operating EBITDA was $1,427 million in 2018, up 20 percent from pro forma Operating EBITDA of $1,194 million in 2017, due to lower pension/OPEB costs, cost synergies, volume and price gains and the favorable impact of currency, partially offset by the absence of prior year one-time gains and higher raw material and freight costs. 2017 Versus 2016 Safety & Construction net sales were $3,006 million in 2017, up from $1,877 million in the 2016. Pro forma net sales were $5,142 million in 2017, up 3 percent from $4,984 million in 2016. Pro forma net sales growth was led by volume gains of 4 percent, slightly offset by a 1 percent decline in local price. Continued demand from industrial markets contributed to gains in NOMEX thermal-resistant garments, KEVLAR high-strength materials and water filtration. Growth in TYVEK protective materials reflected increased demand in industrial markets, construction and medical packaging. Declines in local price and product mix, primarily in aramids, were partially offset by pricing gains in building solutions. Regionally, volume gains were driven by Asia Pacific and EMEA followed by U.S. & Canada and Latin America. Drivers included TYVEK for graphics and house wrap in EMEA, and gains from KEVLAR in Asia Pacific. 64 Table of Contents Pro forma Operating EBITDA was $1,194 million in 2017, up 5 percent from $1,133 million in 2016. Pro forma Operating EBITDA increased as volume growth, lower pension/OPEB cost and cost savings were partially offset by the impact of lower local price and higher raw material costs. Safety & Construction Outlook for 2019 Safety & Construction's 2019 sales are expected to remain essentially flat as broad-based pricing gains and increased volume are expected to be offset by the impact of portfolio actions and the unfavorable impact of currency. The segment is expected to benefit from the favorable impact of cost synergies and pricing gains, partially offset by an increase in raw material costs and increased spend on growth investments. The portfolio impact reflects the divestiture of the European XPS STYROFOAM business on December 1, 2018. CORPORATE Corporate includes certain enterprise and governance activities (including insurance operations, environmental operations, geographic management, etc.); business incubation platforms; non-business aligned joint ventures; gains and losses on the sales of financial assets; non-business aligned litigation expenses; discontinued or non-aligned businesses and pre-commercial activities.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, DowDuPont used $4.8 billion of the aggregate proceeds from the DowDuPont Notes to fund Historical DuPont tender offers for certain of its outstanding debt securities of which $4.4 billion aggregate principal amount was tendered and retired; the purchase of $1.4 billion of shares under the $3.0 billion share buyback program; and costs and expenses associated with the DowDuPont Notes offering, the Historical DuPont tender offers and related premiums, fees and expenses. The Company had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $13,616 million at December 31, 2018 and $14,394 million at December 31, 2017 . The Company cash and cash equivalents included $5,820 million at December 31, 2018 and $12,177 million at December 31, 2017 , that was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries, including United States territories. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents held by subsidiaries in foreign countries is due to the repatriation activities discussed below. For each of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment, with the balance available to be repatriated to the United States. The Act requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries, a majority of which were previously considered permanently reinvested by the Company (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of The Act). A tax liability was accrued for the estimated U.S. federal tax on all unrepatriated earnings at December 31, 2017, in accordance with The Act. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and future foreign investments. The Company has the ability to repatriate additional funds to the U.S., which could result in an adjustment to the tax liability for foreign withholding taxes, foreign and/or U.S. state income taxes and the impact of foreign currency movements. It is not practicable to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on undistributed foreign earnings due to the complexity of the hypothetical calculation. During 2018, the Company repatriated certain funds from its non-U.S. subsidiaries that are not needed to finance local operations or separation activities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded tax expense of $74 million associated with these repatriation activities. The Company cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table: Cash Flow Summary In millions 2018 2017 1 2016 1 Cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 4,731 $ (765 ) $ (2,957 ) Investing activities (2,462 ) 14,325 5,092 Financing activities (1,918 ) (6,554 ) (4,014 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (344 ) 297 (77 ) Cash reclassified as held for sale 88 Summary Increase (Decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 7 7,391 (1,956 ) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of year 14,015 6,624 8,580 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of year $ 14,022 $ 14,015 $ 6,624 Less: Restricted cash and cash equivalents, included in "Other current assets" 540 577 17 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 13,482 $ 13,438 $ 6,607 1.

See Notes 1 and 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 67 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2018 compared with 2017 , primarily due to the change in Historical Dow's accounts receivable securitization facilities discussed on the following page, a decrease in cash used for working capital requirements and higher cash earnings, which were partially offset by increased pension contributions, higher integration and separation costs, and the absence of certain cash receipts in 2017. Cash used for operating activities decreased in 2017 compared with 2016 , primarily driven by higher cash earnings, advance payments from customers in the Agriculture segment and customers with long-term ethylene supply agreements, a tax refund related to a voluntary pension contribution and a cash receipt related to the Nova patent infringement award. These items were partially offset by increased pension contributions resulting from a change in control provision in a Historical Dow non-qualified U.S. pension plan, higher integration and separation costs and a cash payment related to the Bayer CropScience arbitration matter. Net Working Capital at Dec 31 In millions 2018 2017 Current assets $ 49,603 $ 49,893 Current liabilities 24,715 26,128 Net working capital $ 24,888 $ 23,765 Current ratio 2.01:1 1.91:1 Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash used for investing activities in 2018 was primarily for capital expenditures and purchases of investments, which were partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investments and proceeds from interests in trade accounts receivable conduits. Cash provided by investing activities in 2017 was primarily from proceeds from interests in trade accounts receivable conduits, cash acquired in the Merger, proceeds from sales and maturities of investments and divestitures, including the divestitures of the DAS Divested Ag Business, the EAA Business and certain assets related to Historical DuPont's crop protection business and R&D organization. These items were partially offset by capital expenditures, purchases of investments and loans to nonconsolidated affiliates, primarily with Sadara. Cash provided by investing activities in 2016 was primarily from proceeds from interests in trade accounts receivable conduits and net cash acquired in the Dow Silicones ownership restructure, which were partially offset by capital expenditures and investments in and loans to nonconsolidated affiliates, primarily with Sadara. In 2018, Historical Dow entered into a shareholder loan reduction agreement with Sadara and converted $312 million of the remaining loan and accrued interest balance into equity. Historical Dow's note receivable from Sadara was zero at December 31, 2018. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2018, Historical Dow waived $70 million of accounts receivable with Sadara, which was converted into equity. In 2017, Historical Dow loaned $735 million to Sadara and converted $718 million into equity, and had a note receivable from Sadara of $275 million at December 31, 2017. Historical Dow expects to loan up to $500 million to Sadara in 2019. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The Company's capital expenditures, including capital expenditures of consolidated variable interest entities, were $3,837 million in 2018 , $3,570 million in 2017 and $3,804 million in 2016 . The Company expects capital spending in 2019 to be approximately $4.3 billion, below depreciation and amortization expense and inclusive of capital spending for targeted cost synergy and business separation projects. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash used for financing activities in 2018 included payments of notes payable and long-term debt, repurchases of DowDuPont common stock and dividends paid to stockholders. These items were largely offset by proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt. Cash used for financing activities in 2017 included dividends paid to stockholders, repurchases of DowDuPont common stock and payments of notes payable and long-term debt. Cash used for financing activities in 2016 included dividends paid to stockholders (including the accelerated payment of the fourth quarter preferred dividend), repurchases of Historical Dow common stock and payments of long-term debt. See Notes 15 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the issuance or retirement of debt and the share repurchase program, respectively. Reclassification of Prior Year Amounts Related to Accounts Receivable Securitization In connection with the review and implementation of ASU 2016-15 and additional interpretive guidance from the SEC related to the required method for calculating the cash received from beneficial interests in trade accounts receivable conduits, the Company changed the prior year presentation and amount of proceeds from interests in trade accounts receivable conduits. Changes related to the calculation and presentation of proceeds from interests in trade accounts receivable conduits resulted in a reclassification from cash used for operating activities to cash provided by investing activities of $9,462 million in 2017 and $8,551 million in 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company suspended further sales of trade accounts receivable through these facilities and 68 Table of Contents began reducing outstanding balances through collections of trade accounts receivable previously sold to such conduits. In September and October 2018, the North American and European facilities, respectively, were amended and the terms of the agreements changed from off-balance sheet arrangements to secured borrowing arrangements. The following table reconciles cash flows from operating activities to a non-GAAP measure regarding cash flows from operating activities excluding the impact of ASU 2016-15 and related interpretive guidance for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure is relevant and meaningful as it presents cash flows from operating activities inclusive of all trade accounts receivable collection activity, which the Company utilizes in support of its operating activities. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Excluding the Impact of ASU 2016-15 and Additional Interpretive Guidance (non-GAAP) 2018 2017 2016 In millions Cash flows from operating activities - Updated for impact of ASU 2016-15 and additional interpretive guidance (GAAP) $ 4,731 $ (765 ) $ (2,957 ) Less: Impact of ASU 2016-15 and additional interpretive guidance (657 ) (9,462 ) (8,551 ) Cash flows from operating activities - Excluding impact of ASU 2016-15 and additional interpretive guidance (non-GAAP) $ 5,388 $ 8,697 $ 5,594 Free Cash Flow The Company defines free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Under this definition, free cash flow represents the cash that remains available to the Company, after investing in its asset base, to fund obligations using the Company's primary source of incremental liquidity - cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow is an integral financial measure used in the Company's financial planning process. This financial measure is not recognized in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to U.S. GAAP financial measures of performance. All companies do not calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner and, accordingly, the Company's free cash flow definition may not be consistent with the methodologies used by other companies. For further information relating to the change in cash provided by (used for) operating activities, see the discussion above under the section entitled "Cash Flows from Operating Activities. Reconciliation of "Cash Provided by (Used for) Operating Activities" to Free Cash Flow In millions 2018 2017 1 2016 1 Cash provided by (used for) operating activities $ 4,731 $ (765 ) $ (2,957 ) Capital expenditures (3,837 ) (3,570 ) (3,804 ) Free Cash Flow $ 894 $ (4,335 ) $ (6,761 ) 1. "Cash from operating activities" was updated for ASU 2016-15 (including SEC interpretive guidance) and ASU 2016-18. See Notes 1 and 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Liquidity & Financial Flexibility The Company primary source of incremental liquidity is cash flows from operating activities. Management expects the generation of cash from operations and the ability to access the debt capital markets and other sources of liquidity will continue to provide sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to meet the Company's and its subsidiaries' obligations as they come due. DowDuPont's Liquidity Sources In November 2018, DowDuPont consummated the offering of the senior unsecured DowDuPont Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $12.7 billion. The offering consisted of $0.5 billion in floating rate notes due November 2020, $0.3 billion in floating rate notes due November 2023, and six tranches of fixed-rate notes: $1.5 billion due November 2020, $2.5 billion due November 2023, $1.85 billion due November 2025, $2.25 billion due November 2028, $1.65 billion due November 2038 and $2.15 billion due November 2048. The net proceeds of the offering after the underwriting discount was $12.6 billion. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the interest related to the DowDuPont Notes. The DowDuPont Notes will rank equally with the Company's future senior unsecured debt outstanding from time to time. The DowDuPont Notes are not guaranteed by any of the Company's subsidiaries and are nonrecourse to the assets of Dow and Corteva. Each series of DowDuPont Notes will continue to be a senior unsecured obligation of DuPont after the separations and distributions. If each of the separations and distributions has not been completed on or before May 1, 2020, or, if prior to such date, the Company 69 Table of Contents has abandoned any of the separations or distributions, the Company will be required to redeem each series of DowDuPont Notes at a redemption price equal to 101 percent of the principal amount of such series of DowDuPont Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to but excluding the date of redemption. DowDuPont also entered into a term loan agreement that establishes two term loan facilities in the aggregate principal amount of $3 billion, (the DowDuPont Term Loan Facilities ). The DowDuPont Term Loan Facilities remain unfunded and future funding is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions, including among others, the consummation of the separation and distribution of Dow. DowDuPont intends to use the remaining proceeds from the DowDuPont Notes together with borrowing under the Term Loan Facilities to (i) reduce outstanding liabilities of Historical Dow that would otherwise be attributable to Dow and further reduce outstanding liabilities of Historical DuPont that would otherwise be attributable to Corteva; (ii) fund additional repurchases under the $3 Billion Share Repurchase Program and (iii) pay any related premiums, fees and expenses. The deleveraging of Dow and the further deleveraging of Corteva may be effectuated through the repayment and/or repurchase of senior notes, term loans and/or commercial paper of Historical Dow and Historical DuPont prior to the respective distributions of Dow and Corteva. Coincident with the DowDuPont notes offering in November 2018, the credit rating agencies released credit ratings for DowDuPont, prospectively assuming the consummation of the separations and distributions of Dow and Corteva. The ratings for the Company are: A- with a Stable outlook from Standard & Poor s; Baa1 with a Stable outlook from Moody Investors Service; and BBB+ with a Stable outlook from Fitch Ratings. Historical Dow's Liquidity Sources Credit Ratings At January 31, 2019, Historical Dow's credit ratings were as follows: Credit Ratings Long-Term Rating Short-Term Rating Outlook Standard & Poor BBB A-2 Stable Moody Investors Service Baa2 P-2 Stable Fitch Ratings BBB+ F2 Stable Downgrades in Historical Dow's credit ratings would increase borrowing costs on certain indentures and could impact its ability to access debt capital markets.

See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facilities - Historical DuPont In March 2016, Historical DuPont entered into a credit agreement that provides for a three-year, senior unsecured term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $4.5 billion (as may be amended, from time to time, the "Term Loan Facility") under which Historical DuPont may make up to seven term loan borrowings and amounts repaid or prepaid are not available for subsequent borrowings. The proceeds from the borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will be used for Historical DuPont's general corporate purposes including debt repayment, working capital and funding a portion of the Company's costs and expenses. The Term Loan Facility was amended in 2018 to extend the maturity date to June 2020, at which time all outstanding borrowings, including accrued but unpaid interest, become immediately due and payable, and to extend the date on which the commitment to lend terminates to June 2019. At December 31, 2018, Historical DuPont had made four term loan borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion and had unused commitments of $2.5 billion under the Term Loan Facility.

These letters of credit support commitments made in the ordinary course of business. Debt The following table reflects the debt of DowDuPont, as well as Historical Dow and Historical DuPont (together, the "Subsidiaries"): Total Debt Dec 31, 2018 Dec 31, 2017 In millions DowDuPont 1 Historical Dow Historical DuPont Total Historical Dow Historical DuPont Total Notes payable $ $ 302 $ 1,863 $ 2,165 $ 484 $ 1,464 $ 1,948 Long-term debt due within one year 340 297 637 752 1,315 2,067 Long-term debt 12,596 19,254 5,812 37,662 19,765 10,291 30,056 Total debt $ 12,596 $ 19,896 $ 7,972 $ 40,464 $ 21,001 $ 13,070 $ 34,071 1. Represents the DowDuPont holding company. 71 Table of Contents On November 13, 2018, Historical DuPont launched a tender offer (the Tender Offer ) to purchase $6.2 billion aggregate principal amount of its outstanding debt securities (the Tender Notes ). The Tender Offer expired on December 11, 2018 (the Expiration Date ). At the Expiration Date, $4,409 million aggregate principal amount of the Tender Notes had been validly tendered and was accepted for payment. In exchange for such validly tendered Tender Notes, Historical DuPont paid a total of $4,849 million, which included breakage fees and all applicable accrued and unpaid interest on such Tender Notes. DowDuPont contributed cash (generated from the offering of the DowDuPont Notes) to Historical DuPont to fund the settlement of the Tender Offer and payment of associated fees. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Historical Dow issued $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes in an offering under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, which included $500 million due 2025; $600 million due 2028 and $900 million due 2048. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the interest related to these notes. In addition Historical Dow tendered and redeemed $2.1 billion of notes issued by Historical Dow with maturity in 2019. In addition, Dow Holdings Inc., the intended parent of Historical Dow after the Intended Business Separations, is obligated, should it issue a guarantee in respect of outstanding or committed indebtedness under Historical Dow Five Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility Agreement ( Revolving Credit Agreement ), dated October 30, 2018, (as described below), to enter into a supplemental indenture with Historical Dow and the trustee under the existing base indenture governing certain notes issued by Historical Dow under which it will guarantee all outstanding debt securities and all amounts due under the existing base indenture. The Company's indenture covenants include customary limitations on liens, sale and leaseback transactions, and mergers and consolidations, subject to certain limitations. The DowDuPont Notes also contain customary default provisions. In addition, the Company will be required to redeem all of the DowDuPont Notes at a redemption price equal to 101 percent of the principal amount of such series of DowDuPont Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date if each of the separations and distributions has not been completed on or before May 1, 2020, or, if prior to such date, DowDuPont has abandoned any of the separations or distributions. The Debt Instruments of the Subsidiaries contain, among other provisions, certain customary restrictive covenant and default provisions. Historical Dow Revolving Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant that Historical Dow must maintain its ratio of consolidated indebtedness to its consolidated capitalization at no greater than 0.65 to 1.00 at any time the aggregate outstanding amount of loans under Historical Dow Revolving Credit Agreement equals or exceeds $500 million. The ratio of Historical Dow consolidated indebtedness to its consolidated capitalization was 0.41 to 1.00 at December 31, 2018 . Historical DuPont Term Loan Facility and RCF contain a financial covenant requiring that the ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization for Historical DuPont and its consolidated subsidiaries not exceed 0.6667 to 1.00. At December 31, 2018 , management believes each of the Subsidiaries were in compliance with all of their respective covenants and default provisions. For additional information on the Subsidiaries' debt covenants and default provisions, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On October 30, 2018, Historical Dow terminated and replaced its $5.0 billion Revolving Credit Agreement, under substantially similar terms and conditions. The new Revolving Credit Agreement has a maturity date in October 2023. Historical Dow Revolving Credit Agreement includes an event of default which would be triggered in the event Dow Holdings Inc. incurs or guarantees third party indebtedness for borrowed money in excess of $250 million or engages in any material business activity or directly owns any material assets, in each case, subject to certain conditions and exceptions. Dow Holdings Inc. may, at its option, cure the event of default by delivering an unconditional and irrevocable guaranty to the administrative agent within thirty days of the event or events giving rise to such event of default. Dividends The following table provides dividends paid to common and preferred shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 : Dividends Paid for the Years Ended Dec 31 In millions, except per share amounts 2018 2017 2016 Dividends paid, per common share 1 $ 1.52 $ 2.22 $ 1.84 Dividends paid to common stockholders 2 $ 3,491 $ 3,394 $ 2,037 Dividends paid to preferred shareholders 3 $ $ $ 425 1. The 2017 dividend is comprised of $0.38 per share of DowDuPont dividends declared and paid in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the remaining amount relates to payments of Historical Dow dividends declared prior to the Merger. 2. The 2017 dividend consists of $885 million paid to DowDuPont common stockholders for dividends declared after the Merger, as well as $2,179 million paid to Historical Dow common stockholders for dividends declared prior to the Merger, and $330 million paid to Historical DuPont common stockholders after the Merger for dividends declared prior to the Merger. 72 Table of Contents 3. Dividends paid to Historical Dow preferred shareholders in 2016 includes payment of the fourth quarter 2016 declared dividend. On December 30, 2016, Historical Dow converted all outstanding shares of its Historical Dow Preferred Stock into shares of Historical Dow's common stock. As a result of this conversion, no shares of Historical Dow Preferred Stock are issued or outstanding. Share Repurchase Programs On November 1, 2018, the Company announced a new $3.0 billion share buyback program, which expires on March 31, 2019 - commensurate with the expected timing of the materials science spin-off. At December 31, 2018, the Company had repurchased $1.4 billion of shares under this program. The Company intends to complete the program before March 31, 2019. On November 2, 2017, the Company announced the Board authorized an initial $4.0 billion share repurchase program, which had no expiration date. Under this program, the Company spent $1.0 billion on repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $3.0 billion on repurchases in the first nine months of 2018, thereby completing this share repurchase program. In connection with the Merger, Historical Dow's $9.5 billion share repurchase program was canceled. At the time of cancellation, Historical Dow had spent $8.1 billion on repurchases of Historical Dow common stock under the share buyback program. For additional information related to the share repurchase program, see Part II. Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Rabbi Trust Historical DuPont entered into a trust agreement in 2013 (as amended and restated in 2017) that established and requires Historical DuPont to fund a trust (the "Trust") for cash obligations under certain non-qualified benefit and deferred compensation plans upon a change in control event as defined in the Trust agreement. Under the Trust agreement, the consummation of the Merger was a change in control event. As a result, in November 2017 Historical DuPont contributed $571 million to the Trust. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the balance in the Trust was $500 million and $558 million, respectively. Historical DuPont distributed $68 million during 2018, in accordance with the Trust agreement. Pension Plans Historical Dow and Historical DuPont did not merge their pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans as a result of the Merger. Historical Dow and Historical DuPont have defined benefit pension plans in the United States and a number of other countries. Historical Dow's funding policy is to contribute to plans when pension laws and/or economics either require or encourage funding. Historical DuPont's funding policy is to contribute to defined benefit pension plans based on pension funding laws and local country requirements. Contributions exceeding funding requirements may be and have been made at Historical Dow and Historical DuPont discretion. In 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , Historical Dow contributed $1,656 million, $1,676 million and $629 million to its pension plans, respectively, including contributions to fund benefit payments for its non-qualified pension plans. Historical DuPont contributed $1,308 million in 2018 and $68 million post-Merger in 2017 to its pension plans, including contributions to fund benefit payments for its non-qualified pension plans. In the third quarter of 2018 , Historical Dow and Historical DuPont each made $1,100 million discretionary contributions to their respective principal U.S. pension plans, which are included in the 2018 contribution amounts above. The discretionary contributions were based on Historical Dow and Historical DuPont's funding policies, which permit discretionary contributions to defined benefit pension plans when economics encourage funding, and reflected considerations relating to tax deductibility and capital structure. Historical Dow expects to contribute approximately $240 million to its pension plans in 2019, which is subject to revision in accordance with Historical Dow's funding policy. Historical DuPont expects to contribute approximately $190 million to its pension plans in 2019. The amount and timing of Historical DuPont actual future contributions will depend on applicable funding requirements, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors, including the Internal Reorganization, separations and distributions. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning the Company pension plans. Historical Dow The provisions of a U.S. non-qualified pension plan for Historical Dow require the payment of plan obligations to certain participants upon a change in control of Historical Dow, which occurred at the time of the Merger. Certain participants could elect to receive a lump-sum payment or direct Historical Dow to purchase an annuity on their behalf using the after-tax proceeds of the lump sum. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Historical Dow paid $940 million to plan participants and $230 million to an insurance company for the purchase of annuities, which were included in "Pension contributions" in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Historical Dow also paid $205 million for income and payroll taxes for participants electing the annuity option. Historical Dow recorded a settlement charge of $687 million associated with the payout in the fourth quarter of 2017. 73 Table of Contents Historical DuPont Prior to the Merger, Historical DuPont made total contributions of $2.9 billion to its principal U.S pension plan in 2017, reflecting discretionary contributions. The $2.9 billion contribution was taken as a deduction on Historical DuPont 2016 federal tax return and resulted in a net operating loss for tax purposes. This loss generated an overpayment of taxes of approximately $800 million. A portion of the overpayment was applied against the 2017 tax liability. The remainder of the loss generated a refund of approximately $700 million, which was received during the fourth quarter of 2017. Restructuring, Goodwill Impairment and Asset Related Charges - Net DowDuPont Agriculture Division Restructuring Program The activities related to the Agriculture Division Program are expected to result in additional cash expenditures of approximately $90 million , primarily by mid-2019, consisting of severance and related benefit costs and costs associated with exit and disposal activities. During the fourth quarter of 2018, and in connection with the ongoing integration activities, DowDuPont approved restructuring actions to simplify and optimize certain organizational structures within the Agriculture segment in preparation for the Intended Business Separations. As a result of these actions, the Company expects to incur costs in the future related to its restructuring activities. These costs will be recognized as incurred. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. DowDuPont Cost Synergy Program The activities related to the Synergy Program are expected to result in additional cash expenditures of approximately $705 million to $790 million , primarily by the end of 2019, consisting of severance and related benefit costs and costs associated with exit and disposal activities. The Company expects to incur additional costs in the future related to its restructuring activities. Future costs are expected to include demolition costs related to closed facilities and restructuring plan implementation costs; these costs will be recognized as incurred. The Company also expects to incur additional employee-related costs, including involuntary termination benefits, related to its other optimization activities. These costs cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Integration and Separation Costs Integration and separation costs, which reflect costs related to the Merger, post-Merger integration and Intended Business Separation activities and costs related to the ownership restructure of Dow Silicones, were $2,463 million in 2018, $1,101 million in 2017 and $349 million in 2016. Integration and separation costs related to post-Merger integration and Intended Business Separation activities are expected to continue to be significant in 2019. 74 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the Company's and the Subsidiaries' contractual obligations, commercial commitments and expected cash requirements for interest at December 31, 2018 . Additional information related to these obligations can be found in Notes 15 , 16 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations at Dec 31, 2018 Payments Due In In millions 2019 2020-2021 2022-2023 2024 & Beyond Total Long-term debt obligations 1 $ 635 $ 15,068 $ 5,199 $ 17,759 $ 38,661 Expected cash requirements for interest 2 1,702 2,992 2,233 12,028 18,955 Pension and other postretirement benefits 799 1,569 4,238 9,804 16,410 Operating leases 654 915 660 1,063 3,292 Purchase obligations 3 3,870 5,542 4,205 6,521 20,138 Other noncurrent obligations 4 460 1,435 989 2,010 4,894 Total contractual obligations $ 8,120 $ 27,521 $ 17,524 $ 49,185 $ 102,350 1. Excludes unamortized debt discount and issuance costs of $440 million and unamortized debt step-up premium of $78 million . Includes capital lease obligations of $486 million . Assumes the option to extend the Dow Silicones Term Loan facility will be exercised. 2. Cash requirements for interest on long-term debt was calculated using current interest rates at December 31, 2018 and includes $5,200 million of various floating rate notes. 3. Includes take-or-pay and throughput obligations, outstanding purchase orders and other commitments greater than $1 million obtained through a survey conducted by the Subsidiaries. 4. Includes liabilities related to asbestos litigation, environmental remediation, legal settlements and other noncurrent liabilities. The table also includes future payments under Historical DuPont Pioneer license agreements of $911 million on an undiscounted basis ( $806 million on a discounted basis). The table excludes uncertain tax positions due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions with the respective taxing authorities and deferred tax liabilities as it is impractical to determine whether there will be a cash impact related to these liabilities. The table also excludes deferred revenue as it does not represent future cash requirements arising from contractual payment obligations. The Subsidiaries expect to meet their contractual obligations through their normal sources of liquidity and believe they have the financial resources to satisfy these contractual obligations. Off-balance Sheet Arrangements Off-balance sheet arrangements are obligations the Company has with nonconsolidated entities related to transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements. The Company holds variable interests in joint ventures accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of these joint ventures and therefore is not required to consolidate these entities (see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the transfer of financial assets. Guarantees arise in the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers and nonconsolidated affiliates when the Subsidiaries undertake an obligation to guarantee the performance of others if specific triggering events occur. The Subsidiaries had combined outstanding guarantees at December 31, 2018 of $5,667 million , compared with $5,960 million at December 31, 2017 . Additional information related to the guarantees of the Subsidiaries can be found in the Guarantees section of Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fair Value Measurements See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to fair value measurements of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets; see Note 21 for information related to other-than-temporary impairments; and, see Note 22 for additional information concerning fair value measurements. OUTLOOK The Company expects global economic expansion to continue in 2019 at a moderately slower pace than 2018. The Company continues to closely monitor macroeconomic and geopolitical developments, including ongoing trade negotiations and the pace of economic activity in China. In this environment, DowDuPont remains focused on the actions in the Company's control, including capitalizing on growth investments, capturing cost synergy savings, delivering productivity actions and advancing the spin milestones. 75 Table of Contents Impact From Recently Enacted Tariffs Certain countries where the Company products are manufactured, distributed or sold have recently enacted tariffs on certain products. The Company has analyzed the direct impacts from the enacted tariffs and does not expect such direct impacts to have a materially adverse affect on the results of operations in 2019. The Company is taking actions to mitigate the impact by leveraging its global asset base to adjust its product and raw material flows. OTHER MATTERS Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. DowDuPont accounting policies that are impacted by judgments, assumptions and estimates are described below. Litigation The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to legal proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business including product liability, patent infringement, governmental regulation, contract and commercial litigation, and other actions. The Company routinely assesses the legal and factual circumstances of each matter, the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters, as well as ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of the reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after thoughtful analysis of each known claim. The Company has an active risk management program consisting of numerous insurance policies secured from many carriers covering various timeframes. These policies may provide coverage that could be utilized to minimize the financial impact, if any, of certain contingencies. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. For further discussion see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation Union Carbide is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past four decades. These suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos-containing products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages. The alleged claims primarily relate to products that Union Carbide sold in the past, alleged exposure to asbestos-containing products located on Union Carbide premises, and Union Carbide responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former Union Carbide subsidiary, Amchem Products, Inc. ("Amchem"). Each year, Ankura Consulting Group, LLC ("Ankura") performs a review for Union Carbide based upon historical asbestos claims, resolution and historical defense spending. Union Carbide compares current asbestos claim, resolution and defense spending activity with the results of the most recent Ankura study at each balance sheet date to determine whether the asbestos-related liability continues to be appropriate. In 2016, Historical Dow and Union Carbide elected to change their method of accounting for Union Carbide's asbestos-related defense and processing costs from expensing as incurred to estimating and accruing a liability. In addition to performing their annual review of pending and future asbestos claim resolution activity, Ankura also performed a review of Union Carbide's asbestos-related defense and processing costs to determine a reasonable estimate of future defense and processing costs to be included in the asbestos-related liability, through the terminal year of 2049. For additional information, see Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings; Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; and Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Environmental Matters Accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2018 , the Company had accrued obligations of $1,201 million for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs, including $210 million for the remediation of Superfund sites. As remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs. The Company's estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties ("PRPs") at multi-party sites and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. Therefore, considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation and costs, and under adverse changes in circumstances, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to two and a half times above that amount. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the Company results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. It is the opinion of the Company management, however, that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the Company 76 Table of Contents results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. For further discussion, see Environmental Matters in Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill The Company performs goodwill impairment testing at the reporting unit level which is defined as the operating segment or one level below the operating segment. One level below the operating segment, or component, is a business in which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. The Company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities. The operating segment is the reporting unit for Agriculture, Electronics & Imaging, Nutrition & Health, and Transportation & Advanced Polymers operating segments. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually (during the fourth quarter), or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has declined below its carrying value. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using qualitative and/or quantitative testing procedures. At December 31, 2018 , the Company had defined 9 operating segments and 15 reporting units; goodwill was carried by 14 of these reporting units. The Company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors assessed at the Company level include, but are not limited to, GDP growth rates, long-term hydrocarbon and energy prices, equity and credit market activity, discount rates, foreign exchange rates and overall financial performance. Qualitative factors assessed at the reporting unit level include, but are not limited to, changes in industry and market structure, competitive environments, planned capacity and new product launches, cost factors such as raw material prices, and financial performance of the reporting unit. If the Company chooses not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, additional quantitative testing is required. Quantitative testing requires the fair value of the reporting unit to be compared with its carrying value. If the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference. The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow methodology to calculate the fair value of its reporting units. This valuation technique has been selected by management as the most meaningful valuation method due to the limited number of market comparables for the Company's reporting units. However, where market comparables are available, the Company includes EBIT/EBITDA multiples as part of the reporting unit valuation analysis. The discounted cash flow valuations are completed using the following key assumptions: projected revenue growth rates, or compounded annual growth rates, over a five to ten-year cash flow forecast period, which varied by reporting unit based on underlying business fundamentals and future expectations; discount rates; tax rates; terminal values, differentiated based on the cash flow projection of each reporting unit and the projected net operating profit after tax ("NOPAT") growth rate; currency exchange rates; and forecasted long-term hydrocarbon and energy prices, by geographic region and by year, which included the Company's key feedstocks as well as natural gas and crude oil (due to its correlation to naphtha). These key assumptions are determined through evaluation of the Company as a whole and underlying business fundamentals and industry risk. The Company also monitors and evaluates its market capitalization relative to book value. When the market capitalization of the Company falls below book value, management undertakes a process to evaluate whether a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of its reporting units has declined below carrying value. This evaluation process includes the use of third-party, market-based valuations and internal discounted cash flow analysis. 2018 Interim Goodwill Impairment Testing As a result of the Merger and the related acquisition method of accounting, Historical DuPont assets and liabilities were measured at fair value, and any declines in financial projections could have a material, negative impact on the fair value of the Company reporting units and assets, particularly within the Agriculture and Specialty Products divisions, and therefore could result in an impairment. The Company commenced strategic business reviews during the third quarter of 2018 inclusive of assembling updated financial projections. In connection with these strategic business reviews and the update to financial projections, DowDuPont subsidiary, Historical DuPont, a separate SEC registrant, was required to perform an interim test of goodwill for its agriculture reporting unit. As a result of the analysis performed, Historical DuPont recorded a pretax, noncash goodwill impairment charge of $4.5 billion. However, the impairment charge did not survive at the DowDuPont level. The Agriculture operating segment was determined to be the reporting unit for DowDuPont, which includes the operations of the agriculture reporting units of both Historical DuPont and Historical Dow. As a result of the Merger accounting considerations and the differences in the composition in the carrying value of the agriculture reporting unit of Historical DuPont (assets and liabilities measured at fair value) and the combined Agriculture reporting unit of DowDuPont (excess fair value over carrying value associated with the Historical Dow business is retained), the fair value of the combined Agriculture reporting unit of DowDuPont exceeded its carrying value by more than 10 percent, and therefore no goodwill impairment existed for DowDuPont. 77 Table of Contents 2018 Annual Goodwill Impairment Testing In the f ourth quarter of 2018, quantitative testing was performed on four reporting units and a qualitative assessment was performed on the remaining reporting units that carry goodwill. For the qualitative assessments, management considered the factors at both the Company level and the reporting unit level. Based on the qualitative assessments, management concluded it is not more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting units were less than the carrying values of the reporting units. Upon completion of quantitative testing in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company determined the fair value of these reporting units exceeded the carrying value of the reporting units. Two of these reporting units, Industrial Biosciences and Clean Technologies, are comprised of Historical DuPont assets and liabilities only. Due to the fair value and carrying value of these two reporting units being equal at the date of the Merger resulting in little margin of fair value in excess of carrying value, the Company believes these reporting units are at risk to have impairment charges in future periods. Changes in factors, circumstances and key assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized. The carrying amount of goodwill for the Industrial Biosciences and Clean Technologies reporting units at December 31, 2018 was $3,113 million and $461 million , respectively. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets, discount rates at which the liabilities could have been settled at December 31, 2018 , rate of increase in future compensation levels, mortality rates and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods. The U.S. pension plans represent the majority of Historical Dow and Historical DuPont pension plan assets and pension obligations. Historical Dow uses the spot rate approach to determine the discount rate utilized to measure the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the U.S. and other selected countries. Historical DuPont also uses the spot rate approach for its U.S. plans. Under the spot rate approach, Historical Dow and Historical DuPont calculate service costs and interest costs by applying individual spot rates from a yield curve (based on high-quality corporate bond yields) for each selected country to the separate expected cash flow components of service cost and interest cost. Service cost and interest cost for all other plans are determined on the basis of the single equivalent discount rates derived in determining those plan obligations. The following information relates to Historical Dow and Historical DuPont's U.S. plans only; a similar approach is used for Historical Dow and Historical DuPont's non-U.S. plans. Historical Dow and Historical DuPont determine the expected long-term rate of return on assets by performing a detailed analysis of historical and expected returns based on the strategic asset allocation and the underlying return fundamentals of each asset class. The historical experience of the pension fund asset performance is also considered. The expected return of each asset class is derived from a forecasted future return confirmed by historical experience. The expected long-term rate of return is an assumption and not what is expected to be earned in any one particular year. The weighted-average long-term rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for 2018 was 7.08 percent. The weighted-average assumption to be used for determining 2019 net periodic pension expense is 7.10 percent. Future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the Company pension plans. The discount rates utilized to measure the pension and other postretirement obligations of the U.S. plans are based on the yield on high-quality corporate fixed income investments at the measurement date. Future expected actuarially determined cash flows are individually discounted at spot rates under the Willis Towers Watson U.S. RATE:Link 60-90 corporate yield curve for Historical Dow's plans and under the Aon AA_Above Median yield curve for Historical DuPont's plans to arrive at the plan's obligations as of the measurement date. The weighted average discount rate utilized to measure pension obligations increased to 4.36 percent at December 31, 2018 , from 3.66 percent at December 31, 2017 . The assumption for the long-term rate of increase in compensation levels for the Historical Dow U.S. plans was 4.25 percent. As of November 30, 2018, active employees who participate in Historical DuPont's U.S. pension plans no longer accrue additional benefits for future service and eligible compensation. Historical Dow and Historical DuPont use generational mortality tables to value their U.S. pension and other postretirement obligations. The following discussion relates to Historical Dow's significant pension plans and Historical DuPont's U.S. qualified plan. 78 Table of Contents Historical Dow and Historical DuPont base the determination of pension expense on a market-related valuation of plan assets that reduces year-to-year volatility. For Historical Dow, this market-related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. For Historical DuPont, the market-related value of assets is calculated by averaging market returns over 36 months. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets are not immediately reflected in the Company calculation of net periodic pension cost. Over the life of the plans, both gains and losses have been recognized and amortized. At December 31, 2018 , net losses of $2,365 million remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market-related value of plan assets. These net losses will result in increases in future pension expense as they are recognized in the market-related value of assets. The net decrease in the market-related value of assets due to the recognition of prior losses is presented in the following table: Net Decrease in Market-Related Asset Value Due to Recognition of Prior Losses In millions 2019 $ 1,075 2020 588 2021 263 2022 439 Total $ 2,365 The Company expects pension expense to decrease in 2019 by approximately $100 million . The decrease in pension expense is primarily the result of higher discount rates and the full year impact of discretionary contributions of $1,100 million made to each of Historical Dow's and Historical DuPont's principal U.S. pension plans in the third quarter of 2018. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the long-term return on assets assumption would change the Company total pension expense for 2019 by $106 million . A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption would lower the Company's total pension expense for 2019 by $24 million . A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase the Company's total pension expense for 2019 by $33 million . A 25 basis point change in the long-term return and discount rate assumptions would have an immaterial impact on the other postretirement benefit expense for 2019 . Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of available evidence, both positive and negative, the Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered to be more likely than not. At December 31, 2018 , the Company had a net deferred tax liability balance of $3,711 million , after valuation allowances of $2,407 million . In evaluating the ability to realize the deferred tax assets, the Company relies on, in order of increasing subjectivity, taxable income in prior carryback years, the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and forecasted taxable income using historical and projected future operating results. At December 31, 2018 , the Company had deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards of $3,634 million , $384 million of which is subject to expiration in the years 2019 through 2023 . The Company recognizes the financial statement effects of an uncertain income tax position when it is more likely than not, based on technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. At December 31, 2018 , the Company had uncertain tax positions for both domestic and foreign issues of $1,062 million . Indemnification Assets On July 1, 2015, Historical DuPont completed the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment through the spin-off of all of the issued and outstanding stock of The Chemours Company (the "Chemours Separation"). In connection with the Chemours Separation, Historical DuPont and The Chemours Company ("Chemours") entered into a Separation Agreement (as amended, the "Chemours Separation Agreement"). Pursuant to the Chemours Separation Agreement, discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Historical DuPont is indemnified by Chemours against certain litigation, environmental, workers' compensation and other liabilities that arose prior to the Chemours Separation. The term of this indemnification is indefinite and 79 Table of Contents includes defense costs and expenses, as well as monetary and non-monetary settlements and judgments. In connection with the recognition of liabilities related to these indemnified matters, Historical DuPont records an indemnification asset when recovery is deemed probable. In assessing the probability of recovery, Historical DuPont considers the contractual rights under the Chemours Separation Agreement and any potential credit risk. Future events, such as potential disputes related to recovery as well as the solvency of Chemours, could cause the indemnification assets to have a lower value than anticipated and recorded. The Company evaluates the recovery of the indemnification assets recorded when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be fully recoverable. Purchase Accounting Due to the Merger and the related accounting determination, Historical DuPont assets and liabilities were measured at fair value as of the date of the Merger. Estimates of fair value require a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties. In determining the fair value, DowDuPont utilized various forms of the income, cost and market approaches depending on the asset or liability being fair valued. The estimation of fair value required significant judgments related to future net cash flows (including net sales, cost of products sold, selling and marketing costs, and working capital/contributory asset charges), discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in each cash flow stream, competitive trends, market comparables and other factors. Inputs were generally determined by taking into account historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions and growth rates. The estimates and assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets and liabilities, as well as asset lives, have a material impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements, and are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain. Third party valuation specialists were engaged to assist in the valuation of certain of these assets and liabilities. The valuation process to determine the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities is complete. Prepaid Royalties The Company Agriculture segment currently has certain third-party biotechnology trait license agreements, which require up-front and variable payments subject to the licensor meeting certain conditions. These payments are reflected as Other current assets and Deferred charges and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to Cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income as seeds containing the respective trait technology are utilized over the life of the license. At December 31, 2018, the balance of prepaid royalties reflected in Other current assets and Deferred charges and other assets was $239 million and $1,139 million, respectively. The Company evaluates the carrying value of the prepaid royalties when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The recoverability of the prepaid royalties and the rate of royalty amortization expense recognized are based on the Company strategic plans which include various assumptions and estimates including product portfolio, market dynamics, farmer preferences, growth rates and projected planted acres. Changes in factors and assumptions included in the strategic plans, including potential changes to the product portfolio in favor of internally developed biotechnology, could impact the recoverability and/or rate of recognition of the relevant prepaid royalty. Environmental Matters Environmental Policies - Historical Dow Historical Dow is committed to world-class environmental, health and safety ("EH&S") performance, as demonstrated by industry-leading performance, a long-standing commitment to RESPONSIBLE CARE , a strong commitment to achieve the 2025 Sustainability Goals - goals that set the standard for sustainability in the chemical industry by focusing on improvements in Historical Dow's local corporate citizenship and product stewardship, and by actively pursuing methods to reduce the environmental impact. To meet Historical Dow public commitments, as well as the stringent laws and government regulations related to environmental protection and remediation to which its global operations are subject, Historical Dow has well-defined policies, requirements and management systems. Historical Dow EH&S Management System ( EMS ) defines the who, what, when and how needed for the businesses to achieve Dow policies, requirements, performance objectives, leadership expectations and public commitments. To ensure effective utilization, the EMS is integrated into a company-wide management system for EH&S, Operations, Quality and Human Resources. It is Historical Dow policy to adhere to a waste management hierarchy that minimizes the impact of wastes and emissions on the environment. First, Historical Dow works to eliminate or minimize the generation of waste and emissions at the source through research, process design, plant operations and maintenance. Second, Historical Dow finds ways to reuse and recycle materials. Finally, unusable or non-recyclable hazardous waste is treated before disposal to eliminate or reduce the hazardous nature and volume of the waste. Treatment may include destruction by chemical, physical, biological or thermal means. Disposal of waste materials in landfills is considered only after all other options have been thoroughly evaluated. Historical Dow has specific requirements for waste that is transferred to non-Historical Dow facilities, including the periodic auditing of these facilities. 80 Table of Contents Historical Dow believes third-party verification and transparent public reporting are cornerstones of world-class EH&S performance and building public trust. Numerous Historical Dow sites in Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific and U.S. & Canada have received third party verification of Historical Dow compliance with RESPONSIBLE CARE and with outside specifications such as ISO-14001. Historical Dow continues to be a global champion of RESPONSIBLE CARE and has worked to broaden the application and impact of RESPONSIBLE CARE around the world through engagement with suppliers, customers and joint venture partners. Historical Dow EH&S policies helped achieve improvements in many aspects of EH&S performance in 2018 . Historical Dow process safety performance was excellent in 2018 and improvements were made in injury/illness rates. Safety remains a priority for Historical Dow. Further improvement in these areas, as well as environmental compliance, remains a top management priority, with initiatives underway to further improve performance and compliance in 2019 as Historical Dow continues to implement its 2025 Sustainability Goals. Detailed information on Historical Dow performance regarding environmental matters and goals can be found online on Historical Dow Science & Sustainability webpage at www.dow.com. Historical Dow's website and its content are not deemed incorporated by reference into this report. Environmental Policies - Historical DuPont Historical DuPont operates global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. Such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency, and Historical DuPont monitors these changes closely. Historical DuPont's policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, Historical DuPont implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions, minimize the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of water use and discharges, increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. Management has noted a global upward trend in the amount and complexity of proposed chemicals regulation. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. Climate Change - Historical Dow Climate change matters for Historical Dow are likely to be driven by changes in regulations, public policy and physical climate parameters. Regulatory Matters Regulatory matters include cap and trade schemes; increased greenhouse gas ( GHG ) limits; and taxes on GHG emissions, fuel and energy. The potential implications of each of these matters are all very similar, including increased costs of purchased energy, additional capital costs for installation or modification of GHG emitting equipment, and additional costs associated directly with GHG emissions (such as cap and trade systems or carbon taxes), which are primarily related to energy use. It is difficult to estimate the potential impact of these regulatory matters on energy prices. Reducing Historical Dow's overall energy usage and GHG emissions through new and unfolding projects will decrease the potential impact of these regulatory matters. Historical Dow also has a dedicated commercial group to handle energy contracts and purchases, including managing emissions trading. Historical Dow has not experienced any material impact related to regulated GHG emissions and continues to evaluate and monitor this area for future developments. Physical Climate Parameters Many scientific academies throughout the world have concluded that it is very likely that human activities are contributing to global warming. At this point, it is difficult to predict and assess the probability and opportunity of a global warming trend on Historical Dow specifically. Preparedness plans are developed that detail actions needed in the event of severe weather. These measures have historically been in place and these activities and associated costs are driven by normal operational preparedness. Historical Dow continues to study the long-term implications of changing climate parameters on water availability, plant siting issues, and impacts and opportunities for products. Historical Dow Energy business and Public Affairs and Sustainability functions are tasked with developing and implementing a comprehensive strategy that addresses the potential challenges of energy security and GHG emissions. Historical Dow continues to elevate its internal focus and external positions - to focus on the root causes of GHG emissions - including the unsustainable use of energy. Historical Dow's energy plan provides the roadmap: Conserve - aggressively pursue energy efficiency and conservation Optimize - increase and diversify energy resources Accelerate - develop cost-effective, clean, renewable and alternative energy sources 81 Table of Contents Transition - to a sustainable energy future Through corporate energy efficiency programs and focused GHG management efforts, Historical Dow has and is continuing to reduce its GHG emissions footprint. Historical Dow manufacturing intensity, measured in Btu per pound of product, has improved by more than 40 percent since 1990. As part of its 2025 Sustainability Goals, Historical Dow will maintain GHG emissions below 2006 levels on an absolute basis for all GHGs. Historical Dow intends to implement the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosures ("Task Force") over the next two to four years, which is aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force. Climate Change - Historical DuPont Historical DuPont believes that climate change is an important global issue that presents risks and opportunities. For instance, Historical DuPont continuously evaluates opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings to meet the anticipated demands of a low-carbon economy. Historical DuPont also manages and reports its operational resource efficiency. Expanding upon significant GHG emissions and other environmental footprint reductions made in the period 1990-2010, in 2015, Historical DuPont announced its 2020 Sustainability Goals, including a goal to achieve a 7 percent reduction in GHG emissions intensity (2015 baseline) and a 10 percent improvement in energy intensity (2010 baseline). While Historical DuPont's 2017 GHG intensity held relatively flat with its 2015 goal baseline, Historical DuPont has achieved a 12.7 percent reduction in GHG intensity since 2010. In addition, Historical DuPont has achieved a 14.9 percent improvement in non-renewable energy intensity since 2010. Historical DuPont is actively engaged in efforts to develop constructive public policies to reduce GHG emissions and encourage lower-carbon forms of energy. Such policies may bring higher operating costs as well as greater revenue and margin opportunities. Legislative efforts to control or limit GHG emissions could affect Historical DuPont's energy source and supply choices as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials derived from fossil fuels. Such efforts are also anticipated to provide the business community with greater certainty for the regulatory future, help guide investment decisions and drive growth in demand for low-carbon and energy-efficient products, technologies and services. Similarly, demand is expected to grow for products that facilitate adaptation to a changing climate. However, the current unsettled policy environment in the U.S., where many Historical DuPont facilities are located, adds an element of uncertainty to business decisions, particularly those relating to long-term capital investments. In addition, significant differences in regional or national approaches could present challenges in a global marketplace. An effective global climate policy framework will help drive the market changes that are needed to stimulate and efficiently deploy new innovations in science and technology, while maintaining open and competitive global markets. DowDuPont Environmental Remediation Environmental Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures for environmental projects, either required by law or necessary to meet the Company internal environmental goals, were $105 million in 2018 . Environmental Operating Costs and Remediation As a result of the Historical Dow and Historical DuPont operations, DowDuPont incurs environmental operating costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment, emissions testing and monitoring and obtaining permits. The Company also incurs environmental operating costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials. Pretax environmental expenses charged to income from continuing operations are summarized below: Environmental Expenses Charged to Income In millions 2018 2017 1 2016 Environmental operating costs $ 1,012 $ 725 $ 623 Environmental remediation costs 232 179 504 Total $ 1,244 $ 904 $ 1,127 1. Includes Historical DuPont costs for the period September 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017. Based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that year over year changes in environmental expenses charged to current operations will have a material impact on the Company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. 82 Table of Contents Annual expenditures in the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. Changes in the remediation accrual balance are summarized below: Accrued Obligations for Environmental Matters In millions 2018 2017 Balance at Jan 1 $ 1,311 $ 909 Liabilities assumed 1 483 Accrual adjustment 233 180 Payments against reserve (270 ) (260 ) Foreign currency impact (24 ) 17 Net change, indemnification 2 (49 ) (18 ) Balance at Dec 31 $ 1,201 $ 1,311 1. Remediation obligations assumed upon completion of the Merger. 2. Represents the net change in indemnified remediation obligations based on activity as well as the removal from Historical DuPont's accrued remediation liabilities of obligations have been fully transferred to Chemours. Pursuant to the Chemours Separation Agreement, as discussed below and in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Historical DuPont is indemnified by Chemours for certain environmental matters. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation and costs, and under adverse changes in circumstances, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to two and a half times times above the amount accrued. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the Company results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. It is the opinion of the Company management, however, that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the Company results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. For further discussion, see Environmental Matters in Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Information regarding environmental sites is provided below: Environmental Sites 1 Historical DuPont Historical Dow Sites 2 Superfund Sites 3, 4 Sites 5 Superfund Sites 3 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 Number of sites at Jan 1 99 62 244 189 131 131 Sites added during year 6 1 99 7 62 3 60 2 2 Sites closed during year (9 ) (5 ) (2 ) (2 ) Number of sites at Dec 31 100 99 69 62 238 244 131 131 1. Active sites. 2. Sites currently or formerly owned by Historical DuPont. Remediation obligations are imposed by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act or similar state law in the United States and by similar federal, state, provincial or local law in non-U.S. locations. At December 31, 2018 , Chemours is indemnifying Historical DuPont for activities at 31 of these sites. See discussion below and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 3. Superfund sites are sites, including sites not owned by Historical DuPont or Historical Dow, where remediation obligations may be imposed on either company under federal or state Superfund laws or similar laws in non-U.S. locations. The total includes approximately 40 sites that have been counted twice as Historical DuPont and Historical Dow are separately named. 4. At December 31, 2018 , Chemours is indemnifying Historical DuPont for activities at 28 of these Superfund sites. See discussion below and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 5. Sites currently or formerly owned by Historical Dow. Remediation obligations are imposed by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act or similar state law in the United States and by similar federal, state, provincial or local law in non-U.S. locations. At December 31, 2018 , 32 of these sites ( 35 sites at December 31, 2017 ) were formerly owned by Dowell Schlumberger, Inc., a group of companies in which Historical Dow previously owned a 50 percent interest. Historical Dow sold its interest in Dowell Schlumberger in 1992. 6. Includes Historical DuPont remediation obligations transferred as a result of the Merger in 2017. Additional information is provided below for Historical Dow Midland, Michigan, manufacturing site and Midland off-site locations (collectively, the "Midland sites"), as well as a Superfund site in Wood-Ridge, New Jersey, the locations for Historical Dow that have the largest potential environmental liabilities. In the early days of operations at the Historical Dow Midland manufacturing site, wastes were usually disposed of on-site, resulting in soil and groundwater contamination, which has been contained and managed on-site under a series of Resource Conservation and Recovery Act permits and regulatory agreements. The Hazardous Waste Operating License for the Midland manufacturing 83 Table of Contents site, issued in 2003, and renewed and replaced in September 2015, also included provisions for Historical Dow to conduct an investigation to determine the nature and extent of off-site contamination from historic Midland manufacturing site operations. In January 2010, Historical Dow, the EPA and the State of Michigan ("State") entered into an Administrative Order on Consent that requires Historical Dow to conduct a remedial investigation, a feasibility study and a remedial design for the Tittabawassee River, the Saginaw River and the Saginaw Bay, and pay the oversight costs of the EPA and the State under the authority of the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. At December 31, 2018 , Historical Dow had an accrual of $134 million ( $131 million at December 31, 2017 ) for environmental remediation and investigation associated with the Midland sites. In 2018 , Historical Dow spent $26 million ( $24 million in 2017 ) for environmental remediation at the Midland sites. Rohm and Haas, a wholly owned subsidiary of Historical Dow, is a PRP at the Wood-Ridge, New Jersey Ventron/Velsicol Superfund Site, and the adjacent Berry Creek Study Area ("BCSA") (collectively, the "Wood-Ridge sites"). Rohm and Haas is a successor in interest to a company that owned and operated a mercury processing facility, where wastewater and waste handling resulted in contamination of soils and adjacent creek sediments. The Berry Creek Study Area PRP group completed a multi-stage Remedial Investigation ("RI") pursuant to an Administrative Order on Consent with U.S. EPA Region 2 to identify contamination in surface water, sediment and biota related to numerous contaminated sites in the Berry's Creek watershed, and submitted the report to the EPA in June 2016. That same month, the EPA concluded that an "iterative or adaptive approach" was appropriate for cleaning up the BCSA. Thus, each phase of remediation will be followed by a period of monitoring to assess its effectiveness and determine if there is a need for more work. The Feasibility Study ("FS") for the first phase of work was submitted in the third quarter of 2018. The EPA selected the interim remedy and issued an interim Record of Decision ("ROD"). The PRP group is negotiating agreements among the PRP's to fund design of the selected remedy and with the EPA to design the selected remedy. Although there is currently much uncertainty as to what will ultimately be required to remediate the BCSA and Rohm and Haas's share of these costs has yet to be determined, the range of activities that will be required in the interim ROD is known in general terms. Based on the interim remedy selected by the EPA, the overall remediation accrual for the Wood-Ridge sites was increased by $21 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. At December 31, 2018 , the Company had an accrual of $106 million ( $88 million at December 31, 2017 ) for environmental remediation at the Wood-Ridge sites. In 2018 , Historical Dow spent $6 million ( $7 million in 2017 ) on environmental remediation at the Wood-Ridge sites. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Historical Dow recorded a pretax charge of $295 million for environmental remediation at a number of historical locations, including the Midland manufacturing site/off-site matters and the Wood-Ridge sites, primarily resulting from the culmination of negotiations with regulators and/or final agency approval. This charge was included in "Cost of sales" in the consolidated statements of income. In total, the Company accrued liability for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs was $1,201 million at December 31, 2018 , compared with $1,311 million at December 31, 2017 . This is management best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the Company has accrued liabilities, although it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately two and a half times that amount. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the Company results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. It is the opinion of the Company management, however, that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the Company results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Separation of Historical DuPont's Performance Chemicals Segment Pursuant to the Chemours Separation Agreement discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Historical DuPont is indemnified by Chemours for certain environmental matters, included in the liability of $1,201 million , that had an estimated liability of $193 million at December 31, 2018 , and a potential exposure that ranges up to approximately $310 million above the current accrual. As such, Historical DuPont has recorded an indemnification asset of $193 million corresponding to Historical DuPont's accrual balance related to these matters at December 31, 2018 . Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation Union Carbide is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past four decades. These suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos-containing products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages. The alleged claims primarily relate to products that Union Carbide sold in the past, alleged exposure to asbestos-containing products located on Union Carbide premises, and Union Carbide responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former Union Carbide subsidiary, Amchem. In many cases, plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any compensable loss as a result of such exposure, or that injuries incurred in fact resulted from exposure to Union Carbide products. 84 Table of Contents The table below provides information regarding asbestos-related claims pending against Union Carbide and Amchem based on criteria developed by Union Carbide and its external consultants. Asbestos-Related Claim Activity 2018 2017 2016 Claims unresolved at Jan 1 15,427 16,141 18,778 Claims filed 6,599 7,010 7,813 Claims settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved (9,246 ) (7,724 ) (10,450 ) Claims unresolved at Dec 31 12,780 15,427 16,141 Claimants with claims against both Union Carbide and Amchem (4,675 ) (5,530 ) (5,741 ) Individual claimants at Dec 31 8,105 9,897 10,400 Plaintiffs lawyers often sue numerous defendants in individual lawsuits or on behalf of numerous claimants. As a result, the damages alleged are not expressly identified as to Union Carbide, Amchem or any other particular defendant, even when specific damages are alleged with respect to a specific disease or injury. In fact, there are no personal injury cases in which only Union Carbide and/or Amchem are the sole named defendants. For these reasons and based upon Union Carbide litigation and settlement experience, Union Carbide does not consider the damages alleged against Union Carbide and Amchem to be a meaningful factor in its determination of any potential asbestos-related liability. For additional information, see Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
