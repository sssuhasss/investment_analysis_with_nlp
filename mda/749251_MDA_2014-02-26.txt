BUSINESS OVERVIEW Gartner, Inc. is the world leading information technology research and advisory company that helps executives use technology to build, guide and grow their enterprises. We offer independent and objective research and analysis on the information technology, computer hardware, software, communications and related technology industries. We provide comprehensive coverage of the IT industry to thousands of client organizations across the globe. Our client base consists primarily of CIOs and other senior IT and executives from a wide variety of business enterprises, government agencies and the investment community. We have three business segments: Research, Consulting and Events. Research provides objective insight on critical and timely technology and supply chain initiatives for CIOs, other IT professionals, supply chain leaders, technology companies and the investment community through reports, briefings, proprietary tools, access to our analysts, peer networking services, and membership programs that enable our clients to make better decisions about their IT and supply chain investments. Consulting provides customized solutions to unique client needs through on-site, day-to-day support, as well as proprietary tools for measuring and improving IT performance with a focus on cost, performance, efficiency, and quality. Events provide IT, supply chain, and business professionals the opportunity to attend various symposia, conferences and exhibitions to learn, contribute and network with their peers. From our flagship event Symposium/ITxpo, to Summits focused on specific technologies and industries, to experimental workshop-style Seminars, our events distill the latest Gartner research into applicable insight and advice. 15 BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS We believe the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments: BUSINESS SEGMENT BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS Research Contract value represents the value attributable to all of our subscription-related research products that recognize revenue on a ratable basis. Contract value is calculated as the annualized value of all subscription research contracts in effect at a specific point in time, without regard to the duration of the contract. Client retention rate represents a measure of client satisfaction and renewed business relationships at a specific point in time. Client retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing our current clients, who were also clients a year ago, by all clients from a year ago. Wallet retention rate represents a measure of the amount of contract value we have retained with clients over a twelve-month period. Wallet retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing the contract value of clients, who were clients one year earlier, by the total contract value from a year earlier, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. When wallet retention exceeds client retention, it is an indication of retention of higher-spending clients, or increased spending by retained clients, or both. Consulting Consulting backlog represents future revenue to be derived from in-process consulting, measurement and strategic advisory services engagements. Utilization rate represents a measure of productivity of our consultants. Utilization rates are calculated for billable headcount on a percentage basis by dividing total hours billed by total hours available to bill. Billing rate represents earned billable revenue divided by total billable hours. Average annualized revenue per billable headcount represents a measure of the revenue generating ability of an average billable consultant and is calculated periodically by multiplying the average billing rate per hour times the utilization percentage times the billable hours available for one year. Events Number of events represents the total number of hosted events completed during the period. Number of attendees represents the total number of people who attend events. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION We have executed a consistent growth strategy since 2005 to drive double-digit annual revenue and earnings growth. The fundamentals of our strategy include a focus on creating extraordinary research content, delivering innovative and highly differentiated product offerings, building a strong sales capability, providing world class client service with a focus on client engagement and retention, and continuously improving our operational effectiveness. We had total revenues of $1,784.2 million in 2013, an increase of 10% over 2012 while diluted earnings per share increased by $.20 per share, to $1.93. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, 2013 total revenues increased 11% over 2012. Research revenues rose 12% year-over-year, to $1,271.0 million in 2013, and the contribution margin increased 1 point, to 69%. At December 31, 2013, Research contract value was $1,423.2 million, an increase of 13% over December 31, 2012 and 12% adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange. Client retention was 82% and wallet retention was 98% at December 31, 2013. 16 Consulting revenues in 2013 increased 3% compared to 2012, while the gross contribution margin was 34%. Consultant utilization was 64% for 2013 compared to 67% in 2012, and we had 509 billable consultants at December 31, 2013 compared to 503 at year-end 2012. Backlog increased 3% year-over-year, to $106.1 million at December 31, 2013. Events revenues increased 14% year-over-year, to $198.9 million, while the segment contribution margin was 46%. We held 64 events in 2013 compared to 62 in 2012, with a slight decline in the number of attendees. For a more detailed discussion of our results, see the Segment Results section below. Cash flow from our operating activities increased 13% in 2013 compared to 2012, to $315.7 million. We continued to focus on maximizing shareholder value in 2013, and we repurchased 3.4 million of our outstanding common shares during the year. We ended 2013 with almost $424.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, which is a record year-end cash balance. We refinanced our debt in 2013 to take advantage of favorable market conditions, and as of year-end 2013 we had over $541.0 million of borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility. We believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our currently anticipated needs. FLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTERLY RESULTS Our quarterly and annual revenue, operating income, and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors, including: the timing of our Symposium/ITxpo series, which are normally held during the fourth calendar quarter, as well as other events; the timing and amount of new business generated; the mix between domestic and international business; changes in market demand for our products and services; changes in foreign currency rates; the timing of the development, introduction and marketing of our new products and services; competition in the industry; general economic conditions; and other factors which are beyond our control. The potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause period-to-period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results and cash flows. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below. The preparation of our financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events. We develop our estimates using both current and historical experience, as well as other factors, including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future. We adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate. However, our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision. In addition, these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ from actual results. On-going changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the Company financial statements in future periods. Our critical accounting policies are as follows: Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements ( SAB 101 ), and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition ( SAB 104 ). Revenue is only recognized once all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met. Revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows: Research revenues are derived from subscription contracts for research products and are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term. Fees from research reprints are recognized when the reprint is shipped. Consulting revenues are principally generated from fixed fee and time and material engagements. Revenues from fixed fee contracts are recognized on a proportional performance basis. Revenues from time and materials engagements are recognized as work is delivered and/or services are provided. Revenues related to contract optimization contracts are contingent in nature and are only recognized upon satisfaction of all conditions related to their payment. Events revenues are deferred and then recognized upon the completion of the related symposium, conference or exhibition. The majority of research contracts are billable upon signing, absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time. All research contracts are non-cancelable and non-refundable, except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal 17 funding clauses. It is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue, since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim. Uncollectible fees receivable We maintain an allowance for losses which is composed of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve. Provisions are charged against earnings, either as a reduction in revenues or an increase to expense. The measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for losses is based on historical loss experience, aging of outstanding receivables, an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients. This evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires estimates. These valuation reserves are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectability of fees receivable becomes available. Circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients liquidity and credit quality, other factors negatively impacting our clients ability to pay their obligations as they come due, and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. The following table provides our total fees receivable and the related allowance for losses (in thousands): December 31, 2013 2012 Total fees receivable $ 497,923 $ 470,368 Allowance for losses (7,000 ) (6,400 ) Fees receivable, net $ 490,923 $ 463,968 Goodwill and other intangible assets The Company evaluates recorded goodwill in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 350, which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In addition, an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets may also be performed on a periodic basis should events or circumstances indicate potential impairment. If we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset is less than its related carrying amount, we must recognize an impairment charge against earnings. Among the factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review are the following: Significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results; Significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; Significant negative industry or general economic trends; Significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and Our market capitalization relative to net book value. The annual assessment of the recoverability of recorded goodwill can be based on either a qualitative or qualitative assessment or a combination of the two. Both methods require the use of estimates which in turn contain judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events. As a result, both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty. In 2013, we completed the required annual goodwill impairment test utilizing a qualitative approach. Based on this assessment, the Company believes the fair values of the Company reporting units continue to substantially exceed their respective carrying amounts. See Note 1 Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. Accounting for income taxes We estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in question. We consider the availability of loss carryforwards, existing deferred tax liabilities, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. In the event we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment is made to reduce the valuation allowance and increase income in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance is charged against income in the period such determination is made. 18 Accounting for stock-based compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topics 505 and 718, as interpreted by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins No. 107 ( SAB No. 107 ) and No. 110 ( SAB No. 110 ). The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense, which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant, over the related service period, net of estimated forfeitures (see Note 8 Stock-Based Compensation in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding stock-based compensation). Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain complex and subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the stock compensation award and the Company Common Stock price volatility. In addition, determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the rate of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of achievement of certain performance targets. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent management best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions, or if the quantity and nature of the Company stock-based compensation awards changes, then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period. Restructuring and other accruals We may record accruals for severance costs, costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased, contract terminations, asset impairments, and other costs as a result of on-going actions we undertake to streamline our organization, reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs. Estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions, such as future lease payments, sublease income, the fair value of assets, and severance and related benefits, are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated. These accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates. In addition, these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved. We also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs. Amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known with certainty until after year end. 19 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results 2013 VERSUS 2012 The following table presents the changes in selected line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the two years ended December 31, 2013 (dollars in thousands): Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2013 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2012 Income Increase (Decrease) $ Increase (Decrease) % Total revenues $ 1,784,213 $ 1,615,808 $ 168,405 10 % Costs and expenses: Cost of services & product development 713,484 659,067 (54,417 ) (8 ) Selling, general and administrative 760,458 678,843 (81,615 ) (12 ) Depreciation 28,996 25,369 (3,627 ) (14 ) Amortization of intangibles 5,446 4,402 (1,044 ) (24 ) Acquisition & integration charges 337 2,420 2,083 86 Operating income 275,492 245,707 29,785 12 Interest expense, net (8,837 ) (8,859 ) 22 Other expense, net (216 ) (1,252 ) 1,036 83 Provision for income taxes (83,638 ) (69,693 ) (13,945 ) (20 ) Net income $ 182,801 $ 165,903 $ 16,898 10 % TOTAL REVENUES for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 increased $168.4 million, or 10%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2012. Total revenues increased 11% excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Revenues increased in all three of our business segments and across all of our geographic regions. The following table presents total revenues by geographic region for the twelve months ended: Geographic Region December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 Increase (Decrease) $ Increase (Decrease) % U.S. and Canada $ 1,049,734 $ 947,075 $ 102,659 11 % Europe, Middle East, Africa 508,755 458,675 50,080 11 Other International 225,724 210,058 15,666 7 Totals $ 1,784,213 $ 1,615,808 $ 168,405 10 % The following table presents our revenues by segment for the twelve months ended: Segment December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 Increase (Decrease) $ Increase (Decrease) % Research $ 1,271,011 $ 1,137,147 $ 133,864 12 % Consulting 314,257 304,893 9,364 3 Events 198,945 173,768 25,177 14 Totals $ 1,784,213 $ 1,615,808 $ 168,405 10 % Please refer to the section of this MD&A below entitled Segment Results for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment. 20 COST OF SERVICES AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ( COS ) expense increased 8% in 2013 compared to 2012, or $54.4 million, to $713.5 million compared to $659.1 million in 2012. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount as we continued to invest to support the growth in our business, and to a lesser extent, merit salary increases. We also had higher conference costs due to an increase in the number of events, a double-digit increase in the number of exhibitors at our events, and the upgrading of facilities in several locations to support anticipated growth in the events business. These additional costs were partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency. COS as a percentage of revenues was 40% in the 2013 period compared to 41% in the 2012 period. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ( SG&A ) expense increased by $81.6 million in 2013, or 12%, to $760.5 million compared to $678.8 million in 2012. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs, which was partially offset by favorable foreign currency impact. The higher payroll and benefit cost was primarily driven by our investment in additional headcount, and to a lesser extent, higher sales commissions and merit salary increases. The increased headcount includes additional quota-bearing sales associates, which increased to 1,643 at December 31, 2013, a 16% increase over year-end 2012. DEPRECIATION expense increased 14% in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to additional depreciation on leasehold improvements from two renovated buildings on our Stamford headquarters campus being placed into service during 2013. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES increased 24% year-over-year due to a full year of amortization in 2013 of the intangible assets recorded from the Ideas International acquisition in mid-2012. ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION CHARGES was $0.3 million in 2013 compared to $2.4 million in 2012. These charges related to the acquisition of Ideas International in mid-2012 and include legal, consulting, severance, and other costs. OPERATING INCOME increased $29.8 million year-over-year, or 12%, to $275.5 million in 2013 from $245.7 million in 2012. The increased operating income was primarily attributable to a substantially higher segment contribution from our Research segment. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 15% for both periods. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET was flat year-over-year. OTHER EXPENSE, NET was $0.2 million in 2013 and $1.3 million in 2012. These expenses primarily consisted of net foreign currency exchange gains and losses. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES was $83.6 million in 2013 compared to $69.7 million in 2012 and the effective tax rate was 31.4% for 2013 compared to 29.6% for 2012. The higher effective tax rate in 2013 was primarily attributable to a change in the annual mix of pre-tax income by jurisdiction as well as the impact of certain state tax credits recognized in 2012. During 2013, the Company closed the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) audit of its 2008 and 2009 federal income tax returns. The resolution of the audit did not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, cash flows, or results of operations of the Company. In late 2013 the Company received notice that the IRS intends to conduct an audit of the Company's 2010 and 2011 tax years. The audits for these years have commenced and are in the early stages of examination. Although the final resolution of these audits is uncertain, the Company believes that the ultimate disposition will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the 2012 Tax Act ) was enacted in January of 2013 and contained beneficial tax provisions for the Company which applied retroactively to 2012. However, since the 2012 Tax Act was passed in 2013, approximately $1.5 million of tax benefits relating to its retroactive application were recorded by the Company in early 2013. NET INCOME was $182.8 million in 2013 and $165.9 million in 2012, an increase of $16.9 million, or 10%, primarily due to the higher operating income, which was partially offset by higher income tax charges. Diluted earnings per share increased 12% year-over-year due to the higher net income and to a lesser extent a lower number of weighted-average shares outstanding. 21 2012 VERSUS 2011 The following table presents the changes in selected line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the two years ended December 31, 2012 (dollars in thousands): Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2012 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2011 Income Increase (Decrease) $ Increase (Decrease) % Total revenues $ 1,615,808 $ 1,468,588 $ 147,220 10 % Costs and expenses: Cost of services & product development 659,067 608,755 (50,312 ) (8 ) Selling, general and administrative 678,843 613,707 (65,136 ) (11 ) Depreciation 25,369 25,539 170 1 Amortization of intangibles 4,402 6,525 2,123 33 Acquisition & integration charges 2,420 (2,420 ) (100 ) Operating income 245,707 214,062 31,645 15 Interest expense, net (8,859 ) (9,967 ) 1,108 11 Other expense, net (1,252 ) (1,911 ) 659 34 Provision for income taxes (69,693 ) (65,282 ) (4,411 ) (7 ) Net income $ 165,903 $ 136,902 $ 29,001 21 % TOTAL REVENUES for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 increased $147.2 million, or 10%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2011. Total revenues increased 12% excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Revenues increased by double-digits in both our Research and Events segments but declined slightly in Consulting. Revenues increased across all of our geographic regions, with a double-digit increase in Research revenues in every region. An overview of our total revenues by geographic region follows: Geographic Region Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2012 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2011 Increase (Decrease) $ Increase (Decrease) % U.S. and Canada $ 947,075 $ 861,481 $ 85,594 10 % Europe, Middle East, Africa 458,675 437,194 21,481 5 Other International 210,058 169,913 40,145 24 Totals $ 1,615,808 $ 1,468,588 $ 147,220 10 % An overview of our total revenues by segment follows: Segment Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2012 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2011 Increase (Decrease) $ Increase (Decrease) % Research $ 1,137,147 $ 1,012,062 $ 125,085 12 % Consulting 304,893 308,047 (3,154 ) (1 ) Events 173,768 148,479 25,289 17 Totals $ 1,615,808 1,468,588 $ 147,220 10 % Please refer to the section of this MD&A below entitled Segment Results for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment. COST OF SERVICES AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ( COS ) expense increased 8% in 2012, or $50.3 million, to $659.1 million compared to $608.8 million in 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount as we continued to invest to support the growth in our business, and to a lesser extent, merit salary increases. 22 We also had higher conference costs and related travel expenses due to an increase in the number of events, as well as additional attendees and exhibitors at our events. These additional costs were partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency. COS as a percentage of revenues was 41% for both periods. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ( SG&A ) expense increased by $65.1 million in 2012, or 11%, to $678.8 million compared to $613.7 million in 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs, which was partially offset by favorable foreign currency impact. The higher payroll and benefit cost was primarily driven by our investment in additional headcount, and to a lesser extent, higher sales commissions and merit salary increases. The increased headcount includes additional quota-bearing sales associates, which increased to 1,417 at December 31, 2012, a 12% increase over the prior year-end. DEPRECIATION expense decreased slightly year-over-year due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated which was only partially offset by the additional depreciation related to asset additions. Capital expenditures increased to $44.3 million in 2012 from $42.0 million in 2011, which includes $17.0 million and $9.5 million, respectively, of expenditures for the renovation of our Stamford headquarters facility. Up to $25.0 million of these expenditures are reimbursable by the facility landlord, and as of December 31, 2012, $22.0 million had been reimbursed. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES decreased year-over-year due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized, which was only partially offset by the additional amortization from the intangible assets recorded from the Ideas International acquisition in mid-2012. ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION CHARGES was $2.4 million in 2012 and zero in 2011. These charges related to the acquisition of Ideas International in mid-2012 and included legal, consulting, severance, and other costs. OPERATING INCOME increased $31.6 million year-over-year, or 15%, to $245.7 million in 2012 from $214.1 million in 2011. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 15% for both periods. Although both Research and Events had higher segment contributions in 2012, these increases were partially offset by a lower contribution in Consulting, as well as higher SG&A expenses, as discussed above. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET declined by 11% in 2012 when compared to 2011. The decline was primarily due to a lower average amount of debt outstanding, which declined to $207.0 million in 2012 from $220.0 million in 2011, as well as lower amortization of capitalized debt refinancing costs. OTHER EXPENSE, NET was $1.3 million in 2012 and $1.9 million in 2011. These expenses primarily consisted of net foreign currency exchange gains and losses. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES was $69.7 million in 2012 compared to $65.3 million in 2011 and the effective tax rate was 29.6% for 2012 compared to 32.3% for 2011. The lower effective tax rate in 2012 was primarily attributable to the recognition of tax benefits in 2012 resulting from the settlement of tax audits, as well as benefits recorded in 2012 relating to the recognition of certain state tax credits. During 2012, the Company closed the IRS audit of its 2007 federal income tax return. The resolution of the audit did not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, cash flows, or results of operations of the Company. NET INCOME was $165.9 million in 2012 and $136.9 million in 2011, an increase of $29.0 million, or 21%, primarily due to a higher operating income, which was partially offset by $4.4 million in higher income tax charges. Although the year-over-year effective tax rate declined, pre-tax income increased substantially, resulting in the higher dollar amount of tax charges. Both basic and diluted earnings per share increased 24% year-over-year due to the higher net income and to a lesser extent a lower number of weighted-average shares outstanding. 23 SEGMENT RESULTS We evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin. Gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain Cost of services and product development charges, SG&A, Depreciation, Acquisition and integration charges, and Amortization of intangibles. Gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues. The following sections present the results of our three business segments. Research The following table presents the financial results and business measurements of our Research segment as of and for the twelve months ended December 31: 2013 2012 $ Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) 2012 2011 $ Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) Financial Measurements: Revenues (1) $ 1,271,011 $ 1,137,147 $ 133,864 12 % $ 1,137,147 $ 1,012,062 $ 125,085 12 % Gross contribution (1) $ 879,384 $ 774,342 $ 105,042 14 % $ 774,342 $ 682,136 $ 92,206 14 % Gross contribution margin 69 % 68 % 1 point 68 % 67 % 1 point Business Measurements: Contract value (1) $ 1,423,179 $ 1,262,865 $ 160,314 13 % $ 1,262,865 $ 1,115,801 $ 147,064 13 % Client retention 82 % 83 % (1) point 83 % 82 % 1 point Wallet retention 98 % 99 % (1) point 99 % 99 % (1) Dollars in thousands. 2013 VERSUS 2012 Research segment revenues in 2013 increased compared to 2012. The impact of foreign exchange translation was not significant. The segment gross contribution margin increased by 1 point, to 69%, driven by the operating leverage in this business. Contribution margin improved in spite of an 8% increase in segment headcount as we continue to invest for future growth. Research contract value increased 13% in 2013 to $1,423.2 million, and increased 12% year-over-year adjusted for the impact of foreign currency translation. Our growth in contract value was broad-based, with almost every region, industry segment, and client size growing at double-digit rates compared to 2012. The number of research client organizations we serve increased by 6% in 2013, to 14,099. Both client retention and wallet retention remained strong during 2013, and were 82% and 98% at December 31, 2013, respectively. 2012 VERSUS 2011 Research segment revenues increased 12% in 2012 compared to 2011 but excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation, Research segment revenues increased 14%. The segment gross contribution margin increased by 1 point. Research contract value increased 13% in 2012, to $1,262.9 million, but increased 14% year-over-year excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. We had double-digit contract value growth across all of our Research product lines and client sizes, and almost every industry segment. Both client retention and wallet retention remained strong during 2012 at 83% and 99%, respectively. 24 Consulting The following table presents the financial results and business measurements of our Consulting segment as of and for the twelve months ended December 31: 2013 2012 $ Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) 2012 2011 $ Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) Financial Measurements: Revenues (1) $ 314,257 $ 304,893 $ 9,364 3 % $ 304,893 $ 308,047 $ (3,154 ) (1 )% Gross contribution (1) $ 107,565 $ 109,253 $ (1,688 ) (2 )% $ 109,253 $ 114,838 $ (5,585 ) (5 )% Gross contribution margin 34 % 36 % (2) points 36 % 37 % (1) point Business Measurements: Backlog (1) $ 106,130 $ 102,718 $ 3,412 3 % $ 102,718 $ 100,564 $ 2,154 2 % Billable headcount 509 503 6 1 % 503 481 22 5 % Consultant utilization 64 % 67 % (3) points 67 % 65 % 2 points Average annualized revenue per billable headcount (1) $ 409 $ 430 $ (21 ) (5 )% $ 430 $ 424 $ 6 1 % (1) Dollars in thousands. 2013 VERSUS 2012 Consulting revenues increased 3% year-over-year and 4% when adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange. The increase was due to higher contract optimization revenue, which can fluctuate from period to period and are generally about 10% of total Consulting segment revenues. The increased contract optimization revenues were partially offset by slightly lower core consulting and strategic advisory ( SAS ) revenues. The gross contribution margin declined by 2 points due to higher payroll and benefit costs from additional headcount and merit salary increases, and to a lesser extent, lower utilization in core consulting. Backlog increased $3.4 million, or 3%, year-over-year, to $106.1 million at December 31, 2013. 2012 VERSUS 2011 Consulting revenues decreased 1% year-over-year due to lower revenues in our contract optimization business. The decrease in contract optimization revenue was substantially offset by higher core consulting revenues, which increased 5% year-over-year, driven by additional demand and increased headcount. SAS revenues were flat year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenues increased 1% year-over-year. The gross contribution margin declined by 1 point due to the lower revenues in our contract optimization business, which has a higher contribution margin than core consulting or SAS. Backlog increased 2% year-over-year, to $102.7 million at December 31, 2012. 25 Events The following table presents the financial results and business measurements of our Events segment as of and for the twelve months ended December 31: 2013 2012 $ Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) 2012 2011 $ Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) Financial Measurements: Revenues (1) $ 198,945 $ 173,768 $ 25,177 14 % $ 173,768 $ 148,479 $ 25,289 17 % Gross contribution (1) $ 91,216 $ 80,119 $ 11,097 14 % $ 80,119 $ 66,265 $ 13,854 21 % Gross contribution margin 46 % 46 % 46 % 45 % 1 point Business Measurements: Number of events 64 62 2 3 % 62 60 2 3 % Number of attendees 44,986 46,307 (1,321 ) (3 )% 46,307 42,748 3,559 8 % (1) Dollars in thousands. 2013 VERSUS 2012 Events revenues increased $25.2 million when comparing 2013 to 2012, or 14%, but excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenues increased 15% year-over-year. We held 64 events in 2013, consisting of 58 ongoing events and 6 new events, compared to 62 events in 2012. The year-over-year revenue increase was primarily attributable to higher exhibitor revenue at our ongoing events. The overall number of attendees declined slightly while the number of exhibitors increased 11%. Average revenue per attendee rose 15% and average revenue per exhibitor increased 6%. The gross contribution margin was flat year-over-year at 46%. 2012 VERSUS 2011 Events revenues increased 17% year-over-year, or $25.3 million, but excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenues increased 20% year-over-year. We held 62 events in 2012 compared to 60 in 2011. The 62 events held in 2012 consisted of 57 ongoing events and 5 new event launches, with 3 events held in prior years discontinued, while the overall number of attendees and exhibitors increased 8% and 20%, respectively. Average revenue per attendee rose 3% and average revenue per exhibitor increased 1%. Both the additional revenue and the higher contribution margin in 2012 were primarily due to the significantly higher exhibitor volume at our ongoing events. 26 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We finance our operations primarily through cash generated from our operating activities. For 2013, we had operating cash flow of $315.7 million, which was the highest in the Company history and represented an increase of 13% over 2012. Our operating cash flow has been continuously enhanced by the leverage characteristics of our subscription-based business model as well as our focus on operational efficiencies. Revenues in our Research segment, which increased 12% in 2013 compared to 2012, constituted 71% and 70% of our total revenues in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our Research contracts generally renew annually and typically are paid in advance, and combined with a strong customer retention rate and high incremental margins, has generally resulted in strong growth in operating cash flow each year. Our cash flow generation has also benefited from our continuing efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our businesses as well as a focus on the optimal management of our working capital as we increase our sales volume. In addition to the strong increase in our operating cash flows, we also had almost $424.0 million of cash and cash equivalents at year-end 2013, which was the highest cash balance in the Company history. We refinanced our debt in 2013 to take advantage of favorable market conditions and we had $541.1 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at year-end 2013. We believe that our strong operating cash flow, as well as our existing cash balances and our available borrowing capacity, provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our currently anticipated needs. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world. At December 31, 2013, $247.0 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside the U.S. Approximately half of the cash and cash equivalents held overseas represents unremitted earnings of our non-U.S subsidiaries. Under U.S. accounting rules, no provision for income taxes that may result from the remittance of such earnings is required if the Company intends to reinvest such funds overseas. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these undistributed earnings to fund our U.S. operations or otherwise satisfy the liquidity needs of our U.S operations. We intend to reinvest these earnings in our non-U.S. operations, except in instances in which the repatriation of these earnings would result in minimal additional tax. As a result, the Company has not recognized additional income tax expense that may result from the remittance of these earnings. However, should our liquidity needs change or we decide to repatriate some or all of these unremitted earnings, we may be required to accrue additional taxes which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, cash flows, and result of operations. Changes in cash and cash equivalents The following disclosure summarizes and explains the changes in our cash and cash equivalents for the three years ending December 31, 2013 (in thousands): 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2013 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2012 Increase (Decrease) Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2012 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2011 Increase (Decrease) Cash provided by operating activities $ 315,654 $ 279,813 $ 35,841 $ 279,813 $ 255,566 $ 24,247 Cash used in investing activities (36,498 ) (54,673 ) 18,175 (54,673 ) (41,954 ) (12,719 ) Cash used by financing activities (153,855 ) (72,570 ) (81,285 ) (72,570 ) (186,559 ) 113,989 Net increase 125,301 152,570 (27,269 ) 152,570 27,053 125,517 Effects of exchange rates (1,163 ) 4,543 (5,706 ) 4,543 (4,495 ) 9,038 Beginning cash and cash equivalents 299,852 142,739 157,113 142,739 120,181 22,558 Ending cash and cash equivalents $ 423,990 $ 299,852 $ 124,138 $ 299,852 $ 142,739 $ 157,113 2013 VERSUS 2012 Operating Operating cash flow increased by $35.8 million, or 13%, when comparing 2013 to 2012. The increase was primarily due to higher net income in the 2013 period, as well as additional receivable collections and other positive working capital changes. These increases were partially offset by additional cash payments in the 2013 period for bonus, commissions, and taxes, and we also had lower cash reimbursements in the 2013 period related to the completion of the renovation of our Stamford headquarters facility. 27 Investing Cash used in our investing activities declined by $18.2 million in 2013 compared to 2012. The decrease was primarily due to $10.3 million of cash used in 2012 for the acquisition of Ideas International and to a lesser extent, higher capital expenditures in 2012. Capital expenditures were $36.5 million in 2013 compared to $44.3 million in 2012, which included $7.7 million and $17.0 million, respectively, that were paid for the renovation of our Stamford headquarters facility. The Company's total expenditures on the renovation were approximately $34.2 million. The Company received a total of $25.0 million of reimbursements from the facility landlord for the renovation, of which $3.0 million was received in 2013, $13.0 million in 2012, and $9.0 million in 2011, which were recorded in operating cash flows. Financing We used $153.9 million of cash in our financing activities in 2013 compared to $72.6 million in 2012, an increase in cash used of $81.3 million, primarily due to share repurchases. We used $181.7 million of cash in 2013 for share repurchases compared to $111.3 million in 2012. We also had lower cash proceeds from employee share-based activity in the 2013 period, and we also paid $3.6 million of fees related to our debt refinancing in the 2013 period. 2012 VERSUS 2011 Operating Operating cash flow increased by 9%, or $24.2 million, in 2012 compared to 2011, which was primarily due to higher net income. We also had lower cash payments for interest on our debt and other items, as well as higher cash reimbursements related to the renovation of our Stamford headquarters facility. These increased cash flows were partially offset by higher cash payments for income taxes during 2012. Investing Cash used for investing purposes was $54.7 million in 2012, an increase in cash used of $12.7 million compared to 2011, due to $10.3 million of cash used for the acquisition of Ideas International and to a lesser extent, higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $44.3 million in 2012 compared to $42.0 million in 2011, which included $17.0 million and $9.5 million, respectively, that were paid for the renovation of our Stamford headquarters facility. The Company received reimbursements from the facility landlord of $13.0 million in 2012 and $9.0 million in 2011, which were recorded in operating cash flows. Financing We used $114.0 million less cash in our financing activities in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to a lower number of shares repurchased. Cash used for share repurchases was $111.3 million in 2012 compared to $212.0 million in 2011, with 2.7 million and 5.9 million of shares repurchased, respectively. Cash used also declined due to net debt activity, as we borrowed an additional $5.0 million in 2012 compared to $20.1 million of debt repayments in 2011. OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS 2013 Credit Agreement The Company has a five-year credit arrangement that it entered into in March 2013 that provides for a $150.0 million term loan and a $600.0 million revolving credit facility (the 2013 Credit Agreement ). Under the revolving credit facility, amounts may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed through the maturity date of the agreement in March 2018. The credit arrangement contains an expansion feature by which the term loan and revolving credit facility may be increased, at the Company option and under certain conditions, by up to an additional $250.0 million in the aggregate. The Company had a total of $200.0 million outstanding under the 2013 Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2013, which consisted of $144.4 million outstanding under the term loan and $55.6 million outstanding under the revolver. As of December 31, 2013, we had $541.1 million of borrowing availability under the revolver. The term loan will be repaid in 16 consecutive quarterly installments which commenced on June 30, 2013, plus a final payment due on March 7, 2018, and may be prepaid at any time without penalty or premium at the Company option. The revolving credit facility may be used for loans, and up to $40.0 million may be used for letters of credit. The revolving loans may be borrowed, 28 repaid and re-borrowed until March 7, 2018, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. See Note 5 - Debt herein in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the 2013 Credit Agreement. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Through December 31, 2013, we have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated entities or other persons. Contractual Cash Commitments The Company has certain contractual commitments that require future payment. The following table summarizes the Company contractual cash commitments due after December 31, 2013 (in thousands): Commitment Description: Due In Less Than 1 Year Due In 2-3 Years Due In 4-5 Years Due In More Than 5 Years Total Debt principal and interest (1), (2) $ 20,555 $ 50,485 $ 160,620 $ 5,210 $ 236,870 Operating leases (3) 34,525 48,135 25,985 82,485 191,130 Deferred compensation arrangement (4) 3,280 5,920 3,800 23,410 36,410 Tax liabilities (5) 1,520 1,520 Other (6) 21,500 5,560 27,060 Totals $ 81,380 $ 110,100 $ 190,405 $ 111,105 $ 492,990 (1) Includes the contractual principal due under the Company 2013 Credit Agreement, which matures in March 2018. Amounts borrowed under the term loan arrangement have been classified in the table based on the scheduled repayment dates, while revolver borrowings are classified in the Due In 4-5 Years category since the amounts are not contractually due until 2018. Interest payments on amounts outstanding under the 2013 Credit Facility are based on a floating rate. However, the Company has a $200.0 million notional interest rate swap that converts the variable interest payments on the debt to a 2.26% fixed rate on the first $200.0 million of borrowings. As a result, in order to calculate an estimate for the future interest payments, the Company has used a rate of 3.64%, which includes the swap rate of 2.26% plus a loan margin of 1.38%. See Note 5 Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's 2013 Credit Agreement. (2) The Company's $5.0 million State of Connecticut economic development loan is included in the Due In More Than 5 Years category since it has a 10 year maturity. Interest payments on the loan have been calculated based on the contractual fixed rate of interest of 3%. See Note 5 Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the loan. (3) The Company leases various facilities, furniture, autos, and computer equipment. These leases expire between 2013 and 2027 See Note 1 Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's leases. (4) Represents the Company liability to participants in its supplemental deferred compensation arrangement (see Note 13 Employee Benefits in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). Amounts payable to active employees whose payment date is unknown have been included in the Due In More Than 5 Years category since the Company cannot determine when the amounts will be paid. (5) Includes interest and penalties. In addition to the amount presented in the table, the Company also has recorded liabilities of $13.1 million for unrecognized tax benefits and $3.1 million for related potential interest and penalties. We are uncertain as to when or if such amounts may be settled. (6) Includes contractual commitments for software, building maintenance, and telecom services. Also included are amounts due for share repurchase transactions that occurred in late December 2013 and were settled in early January 2014. See Note 7 Stockholders' Equity in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's share repurchases. 29 QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA The following tables present our quarterly operating results for the two year period ended December 31, 2013: 2013 (In thousands, except per share data) First Second Third Fourth Revenues $ 406,754 $ 446,047 $ 410,705 $ 520,707 Operating income 54,005 73,987 58,743 88,757 Net income 36,675 46,514 38,194 61,418 Net income per share: (1) Basic $ 0.39 $ 0.50 $ 0.41 $ 0.67 Diluted $ 0.38 $ 0.49 $ 0.40 $ 0.65 2012 (In thousands, except per share data) First Second Third Fourth Revenues $ 369,171 $ 397,482 $ 374,406 $ 474,749 Operating income 53,556 62,722 49,768 79,661 Net income 34,221 41,484 31,375 58,823 Net income per share: (1) Basic $ 0.37 $ 0.44 $ 0.34 $ 0.63 Diluted $ 0.36 $ 0.43 $ 0.33 $ 0.61 (1) The aggregate of the four quarters basic and diluted earnings per common share may not equal the reported full calendar year amounts due to the effects of share repurchases, dilutive equity compensation, and rounding. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS The FASB has issued new accounting rules which have not yet become effective. These new rules are described below, together with our assessment of the potential impact they may have on our financial statements and related disclosures in future periods: In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-11, "Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists" ("ASU 2013-11"). ASU 2013-11 addresses the balance sheet presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. ASU 2013-11 requires that an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward. ASU No. 2013-11 is effective for the Company fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2014 and impacts balance sheet presentation only. The Company believes the balance sheet impact will not be material. In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-05, Parent Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity. ASU No. 2013-05 provides updated guidance to resolve diversity in practice concerning the release of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment into net income when a parent sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity. When a company ceases to have a controlling financial interest, the company should recognize any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary had resided. Upon a partial sale, the company should release into earnings a pro rata portion of the cumulative translation adjustment. ASU No. 2013-05 is effective for the Company fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2014. The guidance in ASU 2013-05 will only impact the Company's financial statements upon the occurrence of a transaction within its scope. The FASB also continues to work on a number of significant accounting rules which may impact the Company accounting and disclosures in future periods. Since these rules have not yet been issued, the effective dates and potential impact are unknown. 30
