The rate plans provide for revenues to cover expected increases in certain other operations and maintenance expenses and depreciation, reflecting primarily the impact of higher utility plant balances. The results of operations also include the gain on sale of solar electric production projects, the impact of LILO transactions and the net mark-to-market effects of the competitive energy businesses. CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 41 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued The following table presents the estimated effect on earnings per share and net income for common stock for 2014 as compared with 2013, and 2013 as compared with 2012, resulting from these and other major factors: 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012 Earnings per Share Net Income for Common Stock (Millions of Dollars) Earnings per Share Net Income for Common Stock (Millions of Dollars) CECONY(a) Changes in rate plans $ 0.43 $ 125 $ (0.07 ) $ (21 ) Weather impact on steam revenues 0.03 10 0.10 30 Other operations and maintenance expenses (0.28 ) (83 ) 0.11 32 Depreciation and amortization (0.09 ) (27 ) (0.11 ) (31 ) Other 0.04 13 (0.01 ) (4 ) Total CECONY 0.13 38 0.02 6 O&R(a) Changes in rate plans 0.04 11 0.04 11 Other operations and maintenance expenses (0.03 ) (10 ) (0.02 ) (7 ) Other (0.03 ) (6 ) (0.02 ) (3 ) Total O&R (0.02 ) (5 ) - 1 Competitive energy businesses Revenues less energy costs (0.34 ) (100 ) (0.10 ) (30 ) Net interest expense 0.29 86 (0.27 ) (80 ) Other 0.08 20 0.03 11 Total competitive energy businesses(b) 0.03 6 (0.34 ) (99 ) Other, including parent company expenses(c) (0.03 ) (9 ) 0.06 16 Total variations $ 0.11 $ 30 $ (0.26 ) $ (76 ) (a) Under the revenue decoupling mechanisms in the Utilities New York electric and gas rate plans and the weather-normalization clause applicable to their gas businesses, revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. Under the rate plans, pension and other postretirement costs and certain other costs are reconciled to amounts reflected in rates for such costs. In general, the Utilities recover on a current basis the fuel, gas purchased for resale and purchased power costs they incur in supplying energy to their full-service customers (see Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A and Rate Plans in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8). Accordingly, such costs do not generally affect the Companies results of operations. (b) These variations include the gain on sale of solar electric production projects, the impact of the LILO transactions, the manufacturing tax deduction and the net mark-to-market effects shown in note (a) in the Results of Operations table above. (c) The variation for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the 2012 period, reflects certain income tax benefits and related interest in 2013 for Con Edison (parent company), $16 million or $0.06 a share.

See Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. (d) After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days, electric delivery volumes in CECONY service area decreased 0.1 percent in 2014 compared with 2013. Operating revenues increased $306 million in 2014 compared with 2013 due primarily to higher revenues from the electric rate plan ($215 million), higher purchased power ($62 million) and fuel expenses ($6 million). Purchased power expenses increased $62 million in 2014 compared with 2013 due to an increase in unit costs ($56 million) and purchased volumes ($6 million). Fuel expenses increased $6 million in 2014 compared with 2013 due to higher unit costs ($34 million), offset by lower sendout volumes from the company electric generating facilities ($28 million). Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $90 million due primarily to higher costs for the support and protection of company underground facilities to accommodate New York City municipal projects ($25 million), higher costs for injuries and damages ($24 million), an increase in healthcare costs ($12 million) and an increase in the surcharges for assessments and fees that are collected in revenues from customers ($11 million). Depreciation and amortization increased $32 million due primarily to higher electric utility plant balances.

Operating revenues decreased $55 million in 2014 compared with 2013 due primarily to lower fuel expenses ($41 million) and lower revenues from the steam rate plans ($38 million), offset in part by the weather impact on revenues ($17 million) and higher purchased power costs ($8 million). Purchased power expenses increased $8 million in 2014 compared with 2013 due to an increase in unit costs ($7 million) and purchased volumes ($1 million). Fuel expenses decreased $41 million in 2014 compared with 2013 due to lower unit costs ($44 million), offset by higher sendout volumes ($3 million). Other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $19 million due primarily to the absence in 2014 of certain previously deferred pension costs that were recognized in 2013 under CECONY steam rate plan. Depreciation and amortization increased $11 million due to higher steam utility plant balances. Taxes, other than income taxes decreased $24 million principally due to lower property taxes and sales and use tax refund. 46 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Taxes, Other Than Income Taxes At $1.8 billion, taxes other than income taxes remain one of CECONY largest operating expenses.

(b) After adjusting for weather and other variations, total firm sales and transportation volumes increased 0.2 percent in 2013 compared with 2012. Operating revenues increased $2 million in 2013 compared with 2012 due primarily to the increase in gas purchased for resale in 2013 ($7 million), offset in part by the gas rate plan. Gas purchased for resale increased $7 million in 2013 compared with 2012 due to an increase in purchased volumes ($23 million), offset by a decrease in unit costs ($16 million). Taxes other than income taxes increased $2 million principally due to higher property taxes.

Electric retail revenues decreased $99 million, due to lower sales volume ($138 million), offset by higher unit prices ($39 million). Wholesale revenues decreased $57 million in 2013 as compared with 2012, due to lower sales volumes. Solar revenues increased $38 million in 2013 compared with 2012 reflecting an increase in solar electric production projects in service. Net mark-to-market values increased $6 million in 2013 as compared with 2012, of which $14 million in gains are reflected in revenues and $8 million in losses are reflected in purchased power expenses. Other revenues increased $14 million in 2013 as compared with 2012, due primarily to higher other wholesale revenues. Purchased power expenses decreased $89 million in 2013 compared with 2012 due primarily to lower volumes ($180 million), offset by higher unit prices ($83 million) and changes in mark-to-market values ($8 million). Gas purchased for resale increased $22 million due primarily to higher volumes. Depreciation and amortization increased $15 million due to higher non-utility plant balances. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense increased $134 million in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to the impact of the LILO transactions. See Lease In/Lease Out Transactions in Note J to the financial statements in Item 8. Income Tax Expense Income taxes decreased $93 million in 2013 compared with 2012 due primarily to lower income before income tax expense and a tax benefit resulting from the acceptance by the IRS of the company claim for manufacturing tax deductions. Other For Con Edison, Other also includes inter-company eliminations relating to operating revenues and operating expenses. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companies liquidity reflects cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as shown on their respective consolidated statement of cash flows and as discussed below. The principal factors affecting Con Edison liquidity are its investments in the Utilities, the dividends it pays to its shareholders and the dividends it receives from the Utilities and cash flows from financing activities discussed below. The principal factors affecting CECONY liquidity are its cash flows from operating activities, cash used in investing activities (including construction expenditures), the dividends it pays to Con Edison and cash flows from financing activities discussed below. The Companies generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Companies repay their short-term borrowings using funds from long-term financings and operating activities. The Utilities cost of capital, including working capital, is reflected in the rates they charge to their customers. 58 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Each of the Companies believes that it will be able to meet its reasonably likely short-term and long-term cash requirements. See The Companies Require Access to Capital Markets to Satisfy Funding Requirements and The Companies Also Face Other Risks That Are Beyond Their Control in Item 1A, and Capital Requirements and Resources in Item 1. Changes in the Companies cash and temporary cash investments resulting from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 are summarized as follows: Con Edison (Millions of Dollars) 2014 2013 Variance 2014 vs. 2013 2012 Variance 2013 vs. 2012 Operating activities $ 2,831 $ 2,552 $ 279 $ 2,599 $ (47 ) Investing activities (2,759 ) (2,659 ) (100 ) (2,523 ) (136 ) Financing activities (47 ) 387 (434 ) (330 ) 717 Net change 25 280 (255 ) (254 ) 534 Balance at beginning of period 674 394 280 648 (254 ) Balance at end of period $ 699 $ 674 $ 25 $ 394 $ 280 CECONY (Millions of Dollars) 2014 2013 Variance 2014 vs. 2013 2012 Variance 2013 vs. 2012 Operating activities $ 2,430 $ 2,643 $ (213 ) $ 2,346 $ 297 Investing activities (2,304 ) (2,417 ) 113 (1,958 ) (459 ) Financing activities (114 ) 54 (168 ) (407 ) 461 Net change 12 280 (268 ) (19 ) 299 Balance at beginning of period 633 353 280 372 (19 ) Balance at end of period $ 645 $ 633 $ 12 $ 353 $ 280 Cash Flows from Operating Activities The Utilities cash flows from operating activities reflect principally their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations. The volume of energy sales and deliveries is affected primarily by factors external to the Utilities, such as growth of customer demand, weather, market prices for energy, economic conditions and measures that promote energy efficiency. Under the revenue decoupling mechanisms in the Utilities New York electric and gas rate plans, changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved may affect the timing of cash flows but generally not net income. See Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. The prices at which the Utilities provide energy to their customers are determined in accordance with their rate plans. In general, changes in the Utilities cost of purchased power, fuel and gas may affect the timing of cash flows but not net income because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate plans. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. The Companies cash flows from operating activities also reflect income tax payments. Cash paid by Con Edison for income taxes, net of any refunds received was $633 million, $69 million and $46 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively (including $748 million, $163 million and $62 million for CECONY in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively). The Companies had no current federal income tax liabilities for 2012 due primarily to deduction for costs incurred in connection with Superstorm Sandy and deductions under the bonus depreciation provisions of the federal tax code. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 has extended bonus depreciation provisions to assets placed in service before January 2014 (or, for certain types of assets, January 2015). In December 2014, President Obama signed into law the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 which extended bonus depreciation for another year through December 31, 2014. As a result, Con Edison is requesting a refund of $224 million of 2014 estimated federal tax payments (including $128 million attributable to CECONY). See Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. Net income is the result of cash and non-cash (or accrual) transactions. Only cash transactions affect the Companies cash flows from operating activities. Principal non-cash charges or credits include depreciation, deferred income tax expense and amortizations of certain regulatory assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges or credits may also be accrued under the revenue decoupling and cost reconciliation mechanisms in the Utilities New York electric and gas rate plans. See Rate Plans CECONY Electric and Gas and O&R Electric and Gas in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. Net cash flows from operating activities in 2014 for Con Edison and CECONY were $279 million higher and $213 million lower, respectively, than in 2013. The increase in net cash flows for Con Edison reflects primarily the decreased pension contributions ($303 million) in 2014. The decrease in net cash for CECONY reflects higher income tax payments ($585 million) in 2014, offset in part by decreased pension contributions ($286 million) in 2014. The Companies contributed $584 million and $887 million (of which $544 million and $830 million was contributed by CECONY) to the pension plan during 2014 and 2013, respectively. Net cash flows from operating activities in 2013 for Con Edison and CECONY were $47 million lower and $297 million higher, respectively, than in 2012. The decrease in net cash flows for Con Edison reflects a special deposit the company made with federal and state tax agencies relating primarily to the LILO transactions. See Lease In/Lease Out Transactions in Note J to CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 59 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued the financial statements in Item 8. The increase in net cash for CECONY reflects receipt of a property tax refund from the City of New York. The change in net cash flows also reflects the timing of payments for and recovery of energy costs. This timing is reflected within changes to accounts receivable customers, recoverable energy costs and accounts payable balances. The changes in regulatory assets principally reflect changes in deferred pension costs in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits. See Notes A, B and E to the financial statements in Item 8. Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities Net cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison and CECONY were $100 million higher and $113 million lower, respectively, in 2014 than in 2013. For Con Edison, the change reflects primarily the proceeds from the termination of the LILO transactions in 2013 ($200 million) and increased investments in renewable electric production projects ($108 million), offset by proceeds from sale relating to its solar electric production projects in 2014 ($108 million, see Note Q to the financial statements in Item 8). In addition, the changes for Con Edison and CECONY reflect decreased utility construction expenditures in 2014. Net cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison and CECONY were $136 million and $459 million higher, respectively, in 2013 than in 2012. The changes for Con Edison and CECONY reflect increased utility construction expenditures in 2013. In addition, for Con Edison, the change reflects increased non-utility construction expenditures, offset by receipt of grants related to solar electric production projects, decreased investments in solar electric production projects and the proceeds from the termination of the LILO transactions. See Lease In/Lease Out Transactions in Note J to the financial statements in Item 8. Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities Net cash flows used in financing activities in 2014 for Con Edison and CECONY were $434 million and $168 million higher, respectively, than in 2013. Net cash flows from financing activities in 2013 for Con Edison and CECONY were $717 million and $461 million higher, respectively, than in 2012. Net cash flows from financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 reflect the following CECONY transactions: 2014 Issued $850 million of 4.45 percent 30-year debentures, $250 million of 3.30 percent 10-year debentures and $750 million of 4.625 percent 40-year debentures, the net proceeds from the sale of which were used to repay short-term borrowings and for other general corporate purposes; Redeemed at maturity $200 million of 4.70 percent 10-year debentures; and Redeemed at maturity $275 million of 5.55 percent 5-year debentures. 2013 Issued $700 million of 3.95 percent 30-year debentures, the net proceeds from the sale of which were used to repay short-term borrowings and for other general corporate purposes; Redeemed at maturity $500 million of 4.875 percent 10-year debentures; and Redeemed at maturity $200 million of 3.85 percent 10-year debentures. 2012 Issued $400 million 4.20 percent 30-year debentures, $239 million of the net proceeds from the sale of which were used to redeem all outstanding shares of its $5 Cumulative Preferred Stock and Cumulative Preferred Stock ($100 par value); and Redeemed at maturity $300 million 5.625 percent 10-year debentures. O&R had no issuances of long-term debt in 2014, 2013 and 2012. In 2013, a Con Edison Development subsidiary issued $219 million aggregate principal amount of 4.78 percent senior notes secured by certain of the company California solar electric production projects. The notes have a weighted average life of 15 years and final maturity of 2037. In 2014, the company sold a 50 percent interest in the subsidiary. See Note Q to the financial statements in Item 8. Cash flows from financing activities of the Companies also reflect commercial paper issuance. The commercial paper amounts outstanding at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 and the average daily balances for 2014, 2013 and 2012 for Con Edison and CECONY were as follows: 2014 2013 2012 (Millions of Dollars, except Weighted Average Yield) Out- standing at Dec ember 31 Daily average Out- standing at Dec ember 31 Daily average Out- standing at Dec ember 31 Daily average Con Edison $ 801 $ 899 $ 1,451 $ 901 $ 539 $ 144 CECONY $ 451 $ 765 $ 1,210 $ 598 $ 421 $ 123 Weighted average yield 0.4 % 0.2 % 0.2 % 0.3 % 0.3 % 0.3 % 60 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Common stock issuances and external borrowings are sources of liquidity that could be affected by changes in credit ratings, financial performance and capital market conditions.

Capital Requirements and Resources For information about capital requirements, contractual obligations and capital resources, see Capital Requirements and Resources in Item 1. Other Changes in Assets and Liabilities The following table shows changes in certain assets and liabilities at December 31, 2014, compared with December 31, 2013. (Millions of Dollars) Con Edison 2014 vs. 2013 Variance CECONY 2014 vs. 2013 Variance Assets Regulatory asset Unrecognized pension and other postretirement costs $ 2,116 $ 1,999 Investments 355 24 Income taxes receivable 224 - Non-utility property, less accumulated depreciation (217 ) 1 Special deposits (319 ) $ (84 ) Liabilities Pension and retiree benefits $ 2,187 $ 2,040 Deferred income taxes and investment tax credits 610 425 Accrued taxes (404 ) - Regulatory Asset for Unrecognized Pension and Other Postretirement Costs and Liability for Pension and Retiree Benefits The increase in the regulatory asset for unrecognized pension and other postretirement costs and the liability for pension and retiree benefits reflects the final actuarial valuation of the pension and other retiree benefit plans as measured at December 31, 2014, in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits. The change in the regulatory asset also reflects the year amortization of accounting costs. The change in the liability for pension and retiree benefits reflects in part contributions to the plans made by the Utilities in 2014. See Notes B, E and F to the financial statements in Item 8. Investments and Non-Utility Property, Less Accumulated Depreciation The increase in investments and decrease in non-utility property, less accumulated depreciation for Con Edison primarily reflect the purchase and sale of interests in solar electric production projects. See Note Q to the financial statements in Item 8. Income Taxes Receivable The increase in income taxes receivable for Con Edison reflects the refund request filed with the IRS in January 2015. See Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. Special Deposits and Accrued Taxes The decreases in Con Edison special deposits and accrued taxes reflect applying the deposits made in 2013 against the federal and state tax liabilities in 2014 that primarily related to settling the LILO transactions. See Lease In/Lease Out Transactions in Note J to the financial statements in Item 8. Deferred Income Taxes and Investment Tax Credits The increase in the liability for deferred income taxes and investment tax credits reflects primarily the timing of the deduction of expenditures for utility plant which resulted in amounts being collected from customers to pay income taxes in advance of when the income tax payments will be required. For Con Edison, the increase also reflects the accelerated deductions for expenditures and investment tax credits primarily related to its renewable electric production projects. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Companies have interests in a number of non-consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs) that are accounted for under the equity method. Aside from the guarantees issued by Con Edison Development discussed below, none of the Companies interests in VIEs meet the SEC definition of off-balance sheet arrangements. For information regarding the Companies VIEs, see Note Q to the financial statements in Item 8. Con Edison Development issued two guarantees ($63 million maximum and $31 million maximum) on behalf of two entities in which it acquired a 50 percent interest in July 2013 and March 2014, respectively (see Guarantees in Note H to the financial statements in Item 8). The entities were formed to develop, construct and operate solar electric production facilities with a cumulative capacity of 400 MW (AC). The guarantees were issued in connection with the construction of the solar electric production facilities. Con Edison Development is not the primary beneficiary of these entities since the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economics of the facilities is shared equally between Con Edison Development and a third party. No payments have been made nor are any expected to be made under the guarantees. Regulatory Matters For information about the Utilities rate plans and other regulatory matters affecting the Companies, see Utility Regulation in Item 1 and Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 61 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Risk Factors The Companies businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. See Risk Factors in Item 1A. Application of Critical Accounting Policies The Companies financial statements reflect the application of their accounting policies, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Companies critical accounting policies include industry-specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies, long-lived assets, derivative instruments, goodwill and leases. Accounting for Regulated Public Utilities The Utilities are subject to the accounting rules for regulated operations and the accounting requirements of the FERC and the state public utility regulatory commissions having jurisdiction. The accounting rules for regulated operations specify the economic effects that result from the causal relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or regulatory assets under the accounting rules for regulated operations. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or regulatory liabilities under the accounting rules for regulated operations. The Utilities principal regulatory assets and liabilities are listed in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. The Utilities are each receiving or being credited with a return on all regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. The Utilities are each paying or being charged with a return on all regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission. In the event that regulatory assets of the Utilities were no longer probable of recovery, as required by the accounting rules for regulated operations, these regulatory assets would be charged to earnings. At December 31, 2014, the regulatory assets for Con Edison and CECONY were $9,304 million and $8,613 million, respectively. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits The Utilities provide pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all of their employees and retirees. Con Edison competitive energy businesses also provide such benefits to certain of their employees. The Companies account for these benefits in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits. In addition, the Utilities apply the accounting rules for regulated operations to account for the regulatory treatment of these obligations (which, as described in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8, reconciles the amounts reflected in rates for the costs of the benefit to the costs actually incurred). In applying these accounting policies, the Companies have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, discount rates, health care cost trends and future compensation. See Notes A, E and F to the financial statements in Item 8 for information about the Companies pension and other postretirement benefits, the actuarial assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2014, 2013 and 2012. The discount rate for determining the present value of future period benefit payments is determined using a model to match the durations of highly-rated (Aa or higher by either Moody or S&P) corporate bonds with the projected stream of benefit payments. In determining the health care cost trend rate, the Companies review actual recent cost trends and projected future trends. The cost of pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets, assumptions for future periods, contributions and benefit experience. Con Edison and CECONY current estimates for 2015 are increases, compared with 2014, in their pension and other postretirement benefits costs of $148 million and $141 million, respectively. 62 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued The following table illustrates the effect on 2015 pension and other postretirement costs of changing the critical actuarial assumptions, while holding all other actuarial assumptions constant: Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Pension Other Postretirement Benefits Total (Millions of Dollars) Increase in accounting cost: Discount rate Con Edison (0.25 %) $ 63 $ 3 $ 66 CECONY (0.25 %) $ 59 $ 2 $ 61 Expected return on plan assets Con Edison (0.25 %) $ 27 $ 2 $ 29 CECONY (0.25 %) $ 26 $ 2 $ 28 Health care trend rate Con Edison 1.00 % $ - $ (5 ) $ (5 ) CECONY 1.00 % $ - $ (9 ) $ (9 ) Increase in projected benefit obligation: Discount rate Con Edison (0.25 %) $ 609 $ 41 $ 650 CECONY (0.25 %) $ 573 $ 33 $ 606 Health care trend rate Con Edison 1.00 % $ - $ (21 ) $ (21 ) CECONY 1.00 % $ - $ (43 ) $ (43 ) A 5.0 percentage point variation in the actual annual return in 2015, as compared with the expected annual asset return of 7.80 percent, would change pension and other postretirement benefit costs for Con Edison and CECONY by approximately $22 million and $20 million, respectively, in 2016. Pension benefits are provided through a pension plan maintained by Con Edison to which CECONY, O&R and the competitive energy businesses make contributions for their participating employees. Pension accounting by the Utilities includes an allocation of plan assets. The Companies policy is to fund their pension and other postretirement benefit accounting costs to the extent tax deductible, and for the Utilities, to the extent these costs are recovered under their rate plans. The Companies were not required to make cash contributions to the pension plan in 2014 under funding regulations and tax laws. However, CECONY and O&R made discretionary contributions to the pension plan in 2014 of $535 million and $43 million, respectively. In 2015, CECONY and O&R expect to make contributions to the pension plan of $703 million and $53 million, respectively. See Expected Contributions in Notes E and F to the financial statements in Item 8. Accounting for Contingencies The accounting rules for contingencies apply to an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Known material contingencies, which are described in the notes to the financial statements, include certain regulatory matters (Note B), the Utilities responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, PCBs and coal tar that have been used or generated in the course of operations (Note G); and other contingencies (Note H). In accordance with the accounting rules, the Companies have accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated. The Utilities generally recover costs for asbestos lawsuits, workers compensation and environmental remediation pursuant to their current rate plans. Changes during the terms of the rate plans to the amounts accrued for these contingencies would not impact earnings. Accounting for Long-Lived Assets The accounting rules for property, plant and equipment require that certain long-lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Under the accounting rules, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable from such cash flows, and exceeds its fair value, which approximates market value. Accounting for Goodwill In accordance with the accounting rules for goodwill and intangible assets, Con Edison is required to test goodwill for impairment annually. See Note K to the financial statements in Item 8. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two-step approach. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill. Goodwill was $429 million at December 31, 2014, which consists of $406 million related to the O&R merger and $23 million related to two energy services companies acquired by Con Edison Solutions and a gas storage company acquired by Con Edison Development. The most recent tests, which were CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 63 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued performed during 2014, did not require any second-step assessment and did not result in any impairment. The company most significant assumptions surrounding the goodwill impairment tests relate to the estimates of reporting unit fair values. The company estimated fair values based primarily on discounted cash flows and on market values for a proxy group of companies. Estimates of future cash flows, projected growth rates and discount rates inherent in the cash flow estimates for the energy services companies and gas storage company may vary significantly from actual results, which could result in a future impairment of goodwill. Accounting for Derivative Instruments The Companies apply the accounting rules for derivatives and hedging to their derivative financial instruments. The Companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase and sale of electricity and gas and interest rate risk on certain debt securities. The Utilities are permitted by their respective regulators to reflect in rates all reasonably incurred gains and losses on these instruments. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks below and Note O to the financial statements in Item 8. Where the Companies are required to make mark-to-market estimates pursuant to the accounting rules, the estimates of gains and losses at a particular period end do not reflect the end results of particular transactions, and will most likely not reflect the actual gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction. Substantially all of the estimated gains or losses are based on prices supplied by external sources such as the fair value of exchange-traded futures and options and the fair value of positions for which price quotations are available through or derived from brokers or other market sources. Accounting for Leases The Companies apply the accounting rules for leases and other related pronouncements to their leasing transactions. In accordance with the accounting rules, Con Edison accounted for Con Edison Development two Lease In/Lease Out or LILO transactions as leveraged leases. At December 31, 2012, the company investment in these leases, net of non-recourse debt, was carried as a single amount in Con Edison consolidated balance sheet included in Item 8. In 2013, a court disallowed tax losses claimed by Con Edison relating to Con Edison Development LILO transactions and the company subsequently terminated the transactions, resulting in charges to earnings of $95 million (after taxes of $63 million) and $1 million in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The transactions did not impact earnings in 2012. See Notes J and L to the financial statements in Item 8. Financial and Commodity Market Risks The Companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets. The most significant market risks include interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and investment risk. Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including the construction expenditures of the Utilities and maturing debt securities. Con Edison and its businesses manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. Con Edison and CECONY estimate that at December 31, 2014, a 10 percent variation in interest rates applicable to its variable rate debt would not result in material changes in annual interest expense. Under CECONY current gas, steam and electric rate plans, variations in actual variable rate tax-exempt debt interest expense are reconciled to levels reflected in rates. Under O&R current New York rate plans, variations in actual tax-exempt (and under the gas rate plan, taxable) long-term debt interest expense are reconciled to the level set in rates. Commodity Price Risk Con Edison commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. The Utilities and Con Edison competitive energy businesses apply risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. See Note O to the financial statements in Item 8. Con Edison estimates that, as of December 31, 2014, a 10 percent decline in market prices would result in a decline in fair value of $53 million for the derivative instruments used by the Utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $47 million is for CECONY and $6 million is for O&R. Con Edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. In accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the Utilities generally recover from customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for their customers, including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. Con Edison competitive energy businesses use a value-at-risk (VaR) model to assess the market price risk of their portfolio of electricity and gas commodity fixed-price purchase and sales commitments, physical forward contracts, generating assets and commodity derivative instruments. VaR represents the potential change in fair value of the portfolio due to changes in market prices, for a specified time period and confidence level. These 64 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued businesses estimate VaR across their portfolio using a delta-normal variance/covariance model with a 95 percent confidence level. Since the VaR calculation involves complex methodologies and estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience, it is not necessarily indicative of future results. VaR for the portfolio, assuming a one-day holding period, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, was as follows: 95% Confidence Level, One-Day Holding Period 2014 2013 (Millions of Dollars) Average for the period $ 1 $ 1 High 7 1 Low - - The competitive energy businesses compare the measured VaR results against performance due to actual prices and stress test the portfolio each quarter using an assumed 30 percent price change from forecast. The stress test includes an assessment of the impact of volume changes on the portfolio because the businesses generally commit to sell their customers their actual requirements, an amount which is estimated when the sales commitments are made. The businesses limit the volume of commodity derivative instruments entered into relative to their estimated sale commitments to maintain net market price exposures to their estimated sale commitments within a certain percentage of maximum and minimum exposures. Credit Risk The Companies are exposed to credit risk related to transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities by the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses. See Credit Exposure in Note O to the financial statements in Item 8. Investment Risk The Companies investment risk relates to the investment of plan assets for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, above and Notes E and F to the financial statements in Item 8. The Companies current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of 58 percent equities and 42 percent fixed income and other securities. At December 31, 2014, the pension plan investments consisted of 58 percent equity and 42 percent fixed income and other securities. Environmental Matters For information concerning climate change, environmental sustainability, potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment and other environmental matters, see Environmental Matters in Item 1 and Note G to the financial statements in Item 8. Impact of Inflation The Companies are affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation. Regulation permits the Utilities to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of their plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the assets upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs. The impact is, however, partially offset by the repayment of the Companies long-term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed. Material Contingencies For information concerning potential liabilities arising from the Companies material contingencies, see Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Contingencies, above, and Notes B, G and H to the financial statements in Item 8.
